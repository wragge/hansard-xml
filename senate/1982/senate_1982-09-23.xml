<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When giving notice, on 17 August 1982, of a motion to disallow the High Court Rule contained in Statutory Rules 1982 No. 77, I indicated to the Senate that the Committee was corresponding with the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia concerning the retrospective operation of interest rates on judgment debts. The Committee was concerned that the Rule doubled the rate of interest which had previously applied, with retrospective effect to 21 April 1980. Following the Committee's inquiries, the Chief Justice has now advised that the Court has agreed to amend the Rule to overcome the problem identified by the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee wishes to express its appreciation of the co-operation of the Chief Justice and the Court in this matter. I therefore give notice that it is my intention, on the next day of sitting at the time for giving notices of motion, to withdraw Business of the Senate, Notice of Motion No. 1, standing in my name for the next day of sitting, to disallow the High Court of Australia Rule of Court Amending the High Court Rules, as contained in Statutory Rules 1982 No. 77 and made under the Judiciary Act 1903. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has publicly indicated that he has communicated with Mr Horgan and that there has been communication about how the allegations that have been made in this place, and not least by the honourable senator who asked me this question, might be dealt with. That matter is still under discussion between Mr Horgan and the Government. I am unable to say at this stage what precise course of action is to be followed. With respect to the question of agreement, I assume that is raised because, as I have advised anyone who has cared to ask, Mr Denis Horgan is a friend of mine and has been for some years. He is a man who, on everything I know of him, is an honourable man who maintains extremely high public and private standards. I would not wish in any sense to leave any other impression about him. I would have to say in respect of the matters which have been raised that I regard him, on what I know of him, as a man superior to his detractors. That might explain that part of the question which asks why this has taken so long.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that because Mr Horgan has been associated with the Liberal Party he has been singled out for considerable criticism and comment for party political reasons. That has become a matter of some political significance. Clearly from the point of view of the Government it is a matter which has to be clarified and sorted out to the satisfaction not only of the Government but also of the Australian people, and that is a matter which I trust will occur quickly. The present position is that the matter is under discussion between the Government and Mr Horgan. I simply make it quite clear that on what I know of that man, as I said before, he maintains extremely high standards and I believe him to be a superior man to his detractors.</PARA>

In addition, the CSIRO has transferred the technology for custom designing of silicon chips to potential users working in research institutions and industry. I understand that Australia is the first country in the world outside the United States of America where individual scientists and engineers have access to this technology. There are 46 individual designs represented on the first multi-project chip, including a processor for a bionic ear for deaf people, an insulin diffuser for diabetics, a new tool for on-the- spot assessment of mineral deposits and a device for improving the performance of the CSIRO's radio telescope at Parkes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister's reason for asking Mr Horgan to stand down, as stated yesterday, was that it is very important that statutory office holders do, and be seen to do, the right thing. Will the Prime Minister apply to the High Commissioner to London the same standards as he seeks to apply to Mr Horgan, and ask Sir Victor Garland to stand down until Mr Costigan has investigated the disposal of Stirling West, Greenbank and Frederic Salon Pty Ltd, and any other family companies which former Minister Garland declared to the Prime Minister?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I would have thought the honourable senator would know, the basis for the matter concerning Mr Horgan is that the McCabe-Lafranchi report mentioned Mr Horgan's association with some companies which were sold to people who allegedly took part in a bottom-of-the-harbour situation. There is no such allegation regarding Sir Victor Garland. No allegation has been made publicly in these cases regarding Sir Victor Garland.

I ask a similar question concerning the United States Government's tests in Nevada and the effects of those tests. Is the Government aware of the current court case in Utah where nearly 1,200 residents are claiming millions of dollars in compensation for ill health arising from tests in the 1950s and 1960s? Is the Government aware that, despite the fact that an epidemiologist at the University of Colorado estimates that in this area there is four times the incidence of leukaemia, six times the rate of bone cancer, three times the number of melanomas and twice as much brain cancer, there has been only one official cancer survey there by the United States Government since 1950?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General. Is it correct that the Council of Europe is expected to establish a new international agreement called the 'Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons' and that this Convention will allow foreigners convicted in one country to serve their gaol terms in their homeland? Is the Minister in a position to seek Australian participation in such an agreement? Moreover, will the Australian Government take the initiative to seek to establish this kind of agreement among the countries in our own region?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that it is correct that the Council of Europe is expected to establish an international agreement along the lines suggested. I regret that in the relatively brief period that I have represented the Acting Attorney-General in this place I have not had a chance to catch up with what appears to be a very positive step in trying to ensure that prisoners who are imprisoned outside their own homeland are dealt with in an adequate way. It may be, of course, of real relevance to Australia, given the fact that a number of Australian citizens recently have found themselves, often in highly publicised situations, in foreign gaols and living in conditions which, I think, are foreign to most Australians. I think that is a matter of some public concern. I suppose one's concern ought to be heightened by the fact that on at least one notable occasion of which I can think there was an ultimate acquittal after a fair period of incarceration. The honourable senator raises a significant point in his question. I will ask the Acting Attorney-General to have the matter examined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say in passing that, as a federation, we probably still have some minor problems to iron out. For example, I think prisoners sentenced in the Australian Capital Territory are unable to enjoy the salubrious conditions to which they are normally accustomed as residents of the Australian Capital Territory when they are incarcerated in New South Wales gaols under conditions which are quite foreign to the lucky residents of this part of Australia, which has the highest per capita income of any part of the country.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General aware that, as revealed by the taxation documents tabled yesterday, the Treasurer wrote to the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, on three separate occasions- December 1978, February 1979 and May 1979-seeking his advice on just one aspect of the proposed new criminal legislation, a proposal already at that stage a year old, namely, the aspect concerning the onus of proof? Is the Minister further aware that the Treasurer received on each occasion no more than a formal acknowledgment-of the kind to which we have become all too accustomed-in January 1979, February 1979 and June 1979 respectively and that it was not until 19 July 1979, seven months after the initial request for advice, that the Attorney gave anything approaching a substantive reply? Can the Minister explain how a matter of central importance, supposedly, to the Government's legislative program and taxation strategy could have been allowed to languish that way in the Attorney- General's Department for seven months, while, as Mr O'Reilly was making painfully clear at the same time, thousands of companies were going to the bottom of the harbour with the consequent massive loss to revenue?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1191" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before replying in very specific terms to the question raised by Senator Evans I make the general comment that the question, like so many points made in the debate on matters currently concerning us, seems to assume that the item under examination is the only matter receiving the attention of the Government, the Attorney-General's Department and the Attorney-General at any one time. The point made by the Treasurer in an interview this morning was that at that time there was a whole series of measures being undertaken by the Government. If one looks through the legislative program of the Government from 1976 on, one finds a constant stream of legislation staunching the flow of tax avoidance which was of so much concern to both the community and the Government. I think it is important to understand that, whilst Senator Evans now talks of the millions of dollars being lost here, he raised in the Senate a week or two ago the problem of trust stripping-a matter which also was of great concern to the Government, a matter which has been legislated against and a matter in which firm action has been taken by the Government. That is but one of many examples of areas of tax avoidance which were attended to by the Government over the relevant period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The advice which I have is that the letter written by the Treasurer to the Attorney-General, which letter was referred to in the question, was received in the Attorney-General's office on 2 January 1979 and, after an interim reply dated 8 January 1979, was sent to the Department, going first to the Business Affairs Division and then to the Justice Division on about 18 January 1979. I take it that honourable senators will not mind my giving the detail of this matter. I assure them that the question is not a Dorothy Dixer. To my knowledge, Senator Evans has not given notice of it, but I do have detailed advice on it. When Mr Howard's letter was received in the Justice Division, a decision had to be made on whether the Attorney-General would be asked to confirm the approach agreed upon with the Australian Taxation Office in the previous year-namely, to place the onus on a defendant to establish an innocent intention-or whether the matter should be completely reviewed. The Justice Division had been reluctantly persuaded in the previous year by the Taxation Office that in the circumstances the reverse onus approach was justified but, having regard to the Treasurer's own doubts, there was a need to review the earlier approach.</PARA>
<PARA> I should add that here we were dealing not with legislation which proposed merely the recovery of tax but with legislation which, unusually, imposed criminal penalties as the sanction to prevent a particular form of tax avoidance . One was looking at a situation where one was concerned about the onus of proof , not of liability to pay tax but of liability for criminal punishment. The first step was to examine the difficulties of proof that would arise in establishing, without the benefit of a reverse onus provision, the elements of the offence proposed by the Taxation Office-to be a party to an arrangement that deprived a company or trustee of capacity to pay tax, including unremitted pay- as-you-earn deductions. Discussions on this question had commenced in March 1979 with officers of the Crown Solicitor's Division. I am advised that the Taxation Office would have been informed of this review. In other words, discussion took place in March 1979 on that quite important question, which goes to a matter of civil liberties, not merely to a matter of tax liability. I would have thought that Senator Evans, if no one else on the Opposition benches, would appreciate that a point of principle and of concern is involved there.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry; Senator Tate would also understand. I am grateful for the interjection. We have the great consolation of knowing that, if something happens to Senator Evans, Senator Tate will be there to fill the gap.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was also necessary to involve and consult the First Assistant Secretary in this matter. At that time he was heavily involved in the preparation of, and attendance in Parliament for the debate on, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Bill. I suspect, therefore, that his attention was probably unduly prolonged by the verbal ministrations of Senator Evans who, I am sure, was taking a very active interest in that piece of legislation. This Bill was introduced on 8 March 1979 and debated in the Senate throughout most of the autumn session. That, again, is a reminder of the fact that both the Government and its departments seldom have their attention fixed on one item at a time. Honourable senators will recall the very intense interest in this place in the detail of the ASIO legislation because of the very important questions of civil liberties which were involved and which occupied the attention of the Attorney and of relevant senior officers for very considerable periods during that session. However, consultations with the Taxation Office continued. The Office explained the circumstances that were likely to arise. It was concluded that the 1978 approach needed to be substantially varied. Of course, it is a matter of record that the form of the legislation and the question of the onus were the subject of variation between the earlier discussions and the time when the Bill was ultimately introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> The alternative formula arrived at was that the basic offence was to be a party to an arrangement with the intention of reducing the capacity of a company or trustee to pay tax, or knowing that the arrangement was likely to have that effect. Evidence that the arrangement was not entered into in the ordinary course of business, or explicable by ordinary commercial considerations, and that the arrangement had reduced the capacity of the company or trustee to pay tax would be prime evidence that the defendant had the prohibited intention. However, this formula was arrived at only after there had been many consultations with interested departments and several alternative formulations had been put forward and discarded for practical and policy considerations.</PARA>
<PARA> In other words, yes, there was a delay of the sort which is indicated in the documents and which was mentioned by Senator Evans in his question. That delay was in part occasioned by the fact that other significant jobs were being done by some of the people concerned but also because significant questions of policy needed consideration. The consideration resulted in a different approach being taken by the Government. All of that contributed to the delay about which Senator Evans has expressed concern.</PARA>

It relates to access by commercial broadcasters to Australia 's proposed domestic satellites. Commercial television operators in Western Australia are fearful that the large Melbourne and Sydney based commercial stations will be able to transmit programs all over Australia, thereby making it difficult for the local stations to attract advertising revenue and to maintain a reasonable viewing audience. To some extent the same concern exists as between regional broadcasters and those in Perth. I understand that the Government has received submissions from the Perth based stations; however, some of the smaller regional stations have yet to make their views known to the Government.

I am aware that at present the Minister is examining the issues which the honourable senator set out in his question. He is receiving inputs. Senator Thomas has already made it known that the Perth television channels have made submissions to the Minister. I believe that the Minister would welcome other inputs if people have views to put. Therefore, I suggest to the honourable senator that he make known to the regional telecasters to whom he referred the appropriateness of their also making a submission to the Minister.

Why, then, has no retrospective legislation been introduced at any stage to recoup the revenue lost through this blatant form of tax avoidance? Does the Minister acknowledge, as did the Treasurer in his statement of 11 May 1982, that trust stripping had been going on apace to the grave injury of the revenue-indeed, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars? In particular, why have the matters in respect of which the special prosecutor, Mr Gyles, Q.C., may launch prosecutions or undertake civil proceedings been confined by the Government, by notice in yesterday's Commonwealth of Australia Gazette, in such a way as to exclude his pursuing the question of recovery of revenue lost through trust stripping?

I would have to refresh my memory on the timing of each of those, as to what precisely was under consideration at the time those letters were before the Attorney-General. The question of the retrospective recovery of taxation under the proposed legislation is related to the Government's attitude to the loss of revenue occasioned by conduct which was declared criminal in the 1980 legislation. It is an unusual step to take and the Government has taken it in these limited circumstances only. I will have to look more closely at the general point raised by Senator Tate in his question and let him have a more considered reply. At the moment, the intention of the Government is to restrict the recovery in the way outlined by Senator Tate in his question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. The Northern Land Council in the Northern Territory is challenging the right to extend community government to Aboriginal communities, saying that no council established to manage community affairs has jurisdiction over land controlled by the NLC on behalf of traditional owners. An example of the Council's stand was seen last week when it boycotted a ceremony establishing a community government council at Angurugu on Groote Eylandt. Can the Minister comment on the correctness of this advice from the NLC, where it could possibly be said that it is playing a role of the servant ruling the master? Under the Aboriginal land rights legislation, land councils were set up to 'ascertain and express the wishes and the opinions of Aboriginals living in the area of the land council as to the management of Aboriginal land in that area', et cetera. If such actions are sustained, what ramifications does the Government expect, considering its policies of self-management and self- determination for Aboriginal people in communities?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kilgariff raises an important question. I think honourable senators will realise, having listened to the question, that the matter is complex. What has occurred is that there has been some misunderstanding of what Mr Blitner said on behalf of the Northern Land Council and what the situation is. I understand that an examination has been made of the transcripts of statements which he made on Australian Broadcasting Commission television, I believe, on 17 September, and on ABC radio over the weekend of 18 and 19 September. I am advised that what Mr Blitner said, in fact, was that no council set up to manage community affairs had jurisdiction over land controlled by the Northern Land Council on behalf of traditional owners. I think that is correct. He observed that there had been no consultation by the Northern Territory with the Northern Land Council in this matter. The thrust of his statement was that community councils, once they are set up-Senator Kilgariff talked about the one at Angurugu-cannot intrude into those areas of responsibility which have been given to the Northern Land Council in the administration of Aboriginal land conferred by the Aboriginal Land Rights ( Northern Territory) Act. Of course, Mr Blitner is correct in that statement. If land has been granted to a lands trust by the Land Rights Act, the Northern Land Council has a role in the management of that land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that there is a genuine area of overlap or uncertainty at the margin between community councils and the Land Council in terms of the management of communities and land. I do not believe that there was anything in Mr Blitner's statement that would enable one to say that community councils have no role or are not seen to have a role. I think what Mr Blitner was pointing out is that, where land was granted under the Land Rights Act, the Land Council has a role, and continues to have a role, which must be recognised and which it will carry out.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of this morning's radio broadcast which set out an allegation about a situation which Senator Lajovic mentioned in his question. I have not seen many of the newspaper reports but I have seen a statement from Senator Ryan, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, in which the same kind of allegation is made. I believe that the allegation is incorrect and I will give some figures now. I have not heard recently from Tranby Co-op College for Aborigines or from anyone else in New South Wales on this matter. My Department' s role in funding Tranby College is to pay allowances to students in eligible programs through the program called AbStudy. This money is paid; it will continue to be paid and there has been no attempt that it not be paid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since I read Senator Ryan's Press release and since I heard this morning's radio broadcast I have asked what exactly is the situation. In the year ending April 1982 Tranby students received almost $24,000 from my Department for courses that they attended at Tranby through the AbStudy scheme. For that financial year the allocation was $41,000. Approximately $52,000 has been allocated this year. The amount allocated this year for that College was in accord with the submission that we received from Tranby for the amount needed for AbStudy funding in 1982 and 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as we are aware neither have the New South Wales technical and further education authorities nor has Tranby made any submission for funding for the College above the levels currently operating. If that is the case it is very hard to know how people can say that a decision on our behalf is going to have the effect of forcing the College to close. It may be that they have taken a management decision in light of what is available to them and they want to claim that the Department in some way is responsible for this.</PARA>
<PARA> It might help honourable senators to look at the sources of Commonwealth funds that go into technical and further education courses in New South Wales for Aboriginal people. There are two sources and I have figures for two financial years. Last financial year the Department of Aboriginal Affairs contributed a little more than $650,000 and this year it will contribute a little more than $ 800,000 to TAFE activities in New South Wales for Aboriginals. That is not consistent either with Senator Ryan's Press release or with the claims that have been made. Last financial year my Department spent $137,000 through AbStudy and this year it has allowed $165,000. Neither of those figures makes it possible to sustain any kind of claim that there has been a cut in funding. They do not make it easy to sustain the assertions by the Labor Party that Commonwealth funding cutbacks are responsible in any way for decisions which may have been taken in New South Wales or by Tranby College. We have provided the money for Tranby because we are aware and appreciative of what Tranby does. We have given money in accordance with the kinds of inputs that have come from Tranby. I cannot understand the assertions made in the Press. From what I can discern from the facts before me, they have no basis. I certainly cannot understand any basis upon which Senator Ryan or the Australian Labor Party would make the claims which they have made on this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the latter part of Senator Childs's question, I thought that the Labor Party relied upon the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, which said that the Ministers could not have known. I thought that in this debate quite clearly the Labor Party had upheld the Costigan report as a paragon of virtue. That report said that the Ministers could not have known. In the period mentioned by Senator Childs this Government took many actions to overcome tax evasion, and a list of those actions is now in Hansard. I direct the attention of Senator Childs and the Senate to it. The Government was enormously active in those years, unlike the three years in which the Whitlam Government was in power, when it did nothing and when the notorious Curran scheme was running. It was known to that Government and it did nothing at all. There was no legislation on the books even though that Government knew those things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have made it very clear that in all these matters there was a need, first of all, to get the most expert legal opinions- and there was a very great difference in legal opinions. There was a great worry about principles of the rule of law in terms of reverse onus of proof. There was a need to be sure that when we acted we acted with equity to all, and so we did.

I point out to the Senate that the record of the Government over the years is one of unprecedented action to stop tax evasion . Indeed, the action in 1980 by the Government put an end to the bottom-of-the- harbour schemes.

Senator Reid draws our attention to some matters concerning the Builders Labourers Federation. I suppose it is well known that the BLF has particular ways of operating in this country. These kinds of matters have been drawn to our attention in recent times, especially in relation to royal commission reports and certain other prosecutions which are pending in Victoria. Those, of course, are matters which are now obviously extending their tentacles into the Australian Capital Territory in relation to the firm John Pfeiffer Constructions mentioned by Senator Reid. It is clear that this kind of activity is going to jeopardise jobs in the Australian Capital Territory at a time when I understand private industry, especially the building industry, in the Australian Capital Territory is concerned about its future. It is amazing to think that a union of the status that the BLF claims to have is determined to destroy the building industry in the Australian Capital Territory by this kind of action.

Will the Minister assure the Senate that the Goverment will not allow an already appalling relationship between it and the trade union movement to become even worse because the Government cannot or will not maintain its industrial relations specialists in the Department?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of points suggested by that question, both of which I think are points which would in fact be broadly agreed even by the honourable senator who asked the question. The first is that the administration of Commonwealth departments is and is required to be largely centralised in Canberra. The reason for that is the interaction between departments, the interaction between the Cabinet and departments and so on. There has been, since I think 1927, a process of transfer from the cities of Sydney and Melbourne to Canberra. That process was continued and may even have been accelerated by the Labor Government. In any event as I understand it, it was not a matter of partisan dispute within this Parliament. In fact, it is the view of the Government that the efficiency and effectiveness of the Department would be enhanced by locating its major operation in Canberra although, of course, it is intended to maintain elements of the Department in Melbourne, in common with other major Australian cities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been, of course, a very important element of the Department in Melbourne until now. I understand that, as has always been the case when transfers of this sort are effected, a number of senior officers have indicated that they do not wish to transfer to Canberra. That is a matter that can be contentious at the very highest levels, right up to the High Court, I suppose. There are a number of Australians who prefer living somewhere other than in Canberra. I suppose, with my peculiar Western Australian loyalties, I am one of them. I would have to say that, yes, on my understanding there will be some loss of staff because of the transfer. That loss of staff is not in any sense peculiar. It has occurred because of other transfers, for reasons which would be well understood by honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA> As to allowing this to worsen the relations between the trade union movement and the Government, I would have thought there would be pretty broad agreement in the industrial relations area that the Government has been making quite a number of positive approaches to the trade union movement. For example, the current Minister has, I think, already developed close ties with the trade union movement. He has made it a habit to visit the movement on its own ground. When he visited my own State of Western Australia I think he visited the trade union movement at its headquarters. Of course, the Government has encouraged greater communication with the trade union movement. I was one of a large group of Ministers who took part in discussions with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and employers some months ago, discussions which were aimed at ensuring that as far as possible we had a common understanding of the problems facing Australia, including the economic situation.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a whole series of ways in which the Government and the Minister are promoting better relations with the trade union movement in the hope that that will assist industrial relations in Australia and, indeed, our economic management. The shift to Canberra should not be seen as something which is, in the view of the Government, in any way designed to reduce either the effectiveness of the Department or the communications which must be carried out between the Government and the trade union movement. Without reference to the Minister I can give the Senate the assurance that every care will be taken to ensure that the negative effects, which are the concern of the honourable senator who asked the question, will not occur.</PARA>

<TITLE>Introduction</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA>As Acting Chairman of the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs , in the absence of Senator Missen who is attending an Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting in Rome, I wish to table, on behalf of the Committee, its report on annual reports referred to it for the years 1979-80 and 1980-81. In tabling this report, which discusses aspects of the annual reports of a number of Government agencies, the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee is acting pursuant to the Sessional Order of 26 November 1980. Under that Sessional Order annual reports of all Government departments and authorities stand referred to the relevant standing committees of the Senate for consideration and, if necessary, for report. This report deals with the annual reports of some 18 agencies for the years 1979-80 and 1980-81. As the Committee's time and staff resources have not allowed a detailed appraisal of each report, our approach has been to assess each report in the light of guidelines set down by the Joint Committee on Publications in its 1979 report on the presentation of annual reports and to note major developments or operational problems raised by reporting agencies.</PARA>
</PROCTEXT>
</DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1202">
<TITLE>Presentation</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As regards compliance with the Publications Committee's guidelines, an appendix to our report illustrates in tabular form each agency's performance. Generally speaking, most agencies reported on attained a fairly high level of compliance with these requirements of a presentational nature, covering such matters as a clear statement of the legislation under which the agency operates, an indication of where the agency fits within the scheme of Commonwealth administration, the number of staff employed, a statement of the agency's budget allocation and actual expenditure, a simple organisation chart and so on.</PARA>
<PARA> Particularly noteworthy for the manner of their presentation are the reports of the Trade Practices Commission for 1979-80 and 1980-81. A most useful practice, which could be adopted by other agencies with great benefit, is the consolidation of suggested amendments to legislation in one section of the report rather than, as tends to happen, scatterd throughout.</PARA>
</PROCTEXT>
</DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1202">
<TITLE>Recommendations</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The report makes three recommendations. These are on matters arising from three separate annual reports, where the Committee takes the view that issues of sufficient gravity arise to warrant the making of a specific recommendation to the Government. The first arises out of our dissatisfaction with the skimpy coverage of the activities of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General provided in the reports of the Attorney-General's Department. Although the 1979- 80 report indicates some 40 items on the Standing Committee's agenda at 30 June 1980, only eight are mentioned and none of them is discussed in detail. The activities of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General have significant impact on law reform in this country and it would be of great benefit to have a much fuller account of all items on the Standing Committee's agenda and of the stage of deliberation which has been reached in respect of each of them. Accordingly, our report recommends that the section of the Attorney-General's Department's annual report dealing with the Standing Committee of Attorneys- General should be considerably expanded. Alternatively, consideration should be given to the presentation of a separate report on the Standing Committee's activities.</PARA>
<PARA> Our second recommendation relates to difficulties experienced by the Commonwealth Ombudsman when paying accounts incurred by him as a result of instructing a private firm of solicitors to represent him in situations where the Deputy Crown Solicitor was already appearing for a party to the proceedings. Under Finance Direction 23/5 payment of such an account usually requires the approval of the Crown Solicitor or the Deputy Crown Solicitor and in such instances the Ombudsman has been embarrassed by the need to delay payment until he obtained an exemption from Finance Direction 23/5. Although the Ombudsman had previously sought a standing exemption from that Finance Direction as being incompatible with his statutory function, his request was rejected. In the Committee's view the Ombudsman's case for a standing exemption to Finance Direction 23/5 is very strong and we have recommended that the matter of his exemption be reconsidered.</PARA>
<PARA> Our third recommendation is that the Government give urgent consideration to the staffing situation in the Law Reform Commission with a view to providing the Commission with sufficient staff to properly discharge its important task of law reform. Our report outlines the drastic staffing position faced by the Law Reform Commission which, put shortly, has suffered a 10 per cent cut in its research capacity while at the same time acquiring additional functions. Such a cut must seriously impede the Commission's work program. We also draw attention to the disturbingly slow rate at which implementation of several important Commission reports is being considered by the Government. The situation is well illustrated in a table contained in the report. Having drawn attention to this problem, the Committee concludes in its report that 'in view of the extent and thoroughness of the Law Reform Commission's reports, it is difficult to think of any justification for such delays'.</PARA>
</PROCTEXT>
</DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1202">
<TITLE>Staffing Problems</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Law Reform Commission is not alone in reporting severe difficulties as a result of staffing cutbacks. The great majority of agencies discussed in the report refer to the very real problems with which they are faced as a result of government-imposed staffing constraints. These problems are often exacerbated by the additional burden of funding cutbacks. Several-for example, the Inspector- General in Bankruptcy and the Family Law Council-suggest that the situation has reached such a stage that they can no longer effectively perform the function which Parliament has assigned to them. The imposition of staff ceilings becomes farcical once it has the effect of rendering agencies ineffective, and must call into question the continuing worth of the agencies affected.</PARA>
</PROCTEXT>
</DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1203">
<TITLE>Jurisdiction of Commonwealth Ombudsman</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Ombudsman in both of his annual reports which the Committee considered, referred to instances of disputation between him and some departments and authorities over the extent of his jurisdiction to take up matters arising out of complaints against those departments and authorities. Because of our concern we took evidence about this matter from Professor Richardson, the Ombudsman, at a public hearing on 7 September. The major problem which emerged is the inability of the Ombudsman, when faced with such a jurisdictional dispute, to take action of his own motion in the Federal Court to have the matter settled. It appears that an amendment to the Ombudsman Act to overcome this difficulty is expected soon and the Committee urges its speedy introduction and passage.</PARA>
</PROCTEXT>
</DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1203">
<TITLE>Functions of Trade Practices Commission</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Of necessity, a report on annual reports covers a wide canvas and it is accordingly difficult to single out particular issues for mention in a tabling statement such as this. Nevertheless, the difficulties being experienced by the Trade Practices Commission, as illustrated in its sixth and seventh annual reports, give rise to some concern. Not only has the Commission suffered badly by way of continuing staff reductions, falling from a ceiling of 210 in 1977 to 160 in 1980-81, but the imposition of severe operational constraints, largely following the Review of Commonwealth Functions, has severely reduced the Commission's ability to perform its statutory functions. In summary form, these operational constraints require the Commission to be more selective in its pursuit of both consumer protection and restrictive trade practices complaints. A major effect of this selectivity will be the resolution of cases administratively rather than by litigation.</PARA>
<PARA> While acknowledging that court cases invariably take a long time and cost a lot in money and staff resources, the Commission points to their great advantages in influencing conduct, in settling and illustrating principles, in giving assurances to companies that wish to comply with the law that their competitors must do the same and in reflecting the policy of the Act that companies must actively avoid breaches rather than wait to deal with them after they have occurred. As Commissioner Pengilley expressed it in some 'additional comments' to the seventh annual report: 'Litigation is now of the essence of the credibility of the Trade Practices Act . . .'. It appears to the Committee that the imposition of even more constraints on the nature and level of the Commission's operations could well detract from the Act's credibility. Indeed, it must be asked at what point the sort of selectivity urged upon the Commission devolves to mere tokenism.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was not able in the time available to undertake a more thorough investigation of the matters arising out of the Trade Practices Commission's sixth and seventh annual reports. In our view, however, the seventh report in particular raises quite fundamental questions about the functions-and, indeed, the capacity to function-of the Trade Practices Commission. It is a matter of concern to us that what appears to amount to a fundamental re-ordering of the Trade Practices Act has not been achieved through legislative action but has been the product of executive fiat and purely administrative actions, and we intend to keep the situation under review.</PARA>

<TITLE>Conclusion</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The presentation of informative annual reports to the Parliament serves a vital purpose in keeping government agencies accountable to the Parliament and, through Parliament, to the people. The annual reports which have been referred to the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee, and which are the subject of the report tabled today, contain much valuable information about the processes of administration. They also point up many problems to which the Government should turn its attention. I have raised some of them in my earlier remarks. Others are discussed in the Committee's report. I commend the report to the Senate and, more particularly, to the Government, as it is in that direction that responsibility for the resolution of these matters rests.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have my second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The objective of this Bill is to bring about total divorcement between petroleum companies and petroleum retail sites by 1st July 1983. The Bill is deceptively simple, which belies its far-reaching effects. In section 10 (3) of the Principal Act, I propose that the words and before 1st July 1983 be added after the word Act. The effect of this simple amendment would be that after 1 July 1983 no exceptions to the overriding section 10 (1) would be permitted and, in the words of section 10 (1), a prescribed corporation shall not operate a retail site. </PARA>
<PARA> The prescribed corporations are Amoco, Ampol, BP, Caltex, Esso, Mobil, Shell, H .C. Sleigh, Total and their associates. On 30th October 1978 the government announced its so-called Fife package which included the promise that oil companies would be prohibited from retailing petroleum through direct sales sites. Two years passed without government action to implement the Fife package. In 1980 I made a well-publicised statement that I would introduce a Private Member's Bill incorporating the Fife package. </PARA>
<PARA> Towards the end of 1980 the government introduced its Petroleum Retail Marketing Legislation, but with a crucial departure from the originally announced package. That is, the government decided that total divorcement was not necessary to achieve its objectives, and that a reduction of about 50 per cent over a two-year period in a number of sites would be adequate. Each integrated oil group was allocated a quota of site numbers. The maximum number of company owned sites allowed under the 1980 legislation was 989 for the year beginning 19th September 1981, and 401 sites for the following year. The existing legislation only goes half way. Oil companies are still involved in every level of output from production to retail sale. As the oil company sites grow individually larger, with high volume sales and low service emerging as the company-owned norm, it is highly likely that the companies will be able to command as much of the petrol retail market with 401 sites as they formerly did with 989. </PARA>
<PARA> The trend toward 'rationalisation' of the petrol market is continuing-less viable service stations are being closed down while the remaining stations are increasing their sales and their ability to control the market. It does not require a soothsayer to predict that this attrition will not result in the oil companies' quota of 401 decreasing. Rather, the 401 company sites would continue to frustrate the aims of the orginally announced Government package and reinforce company control of the retail market with a vengeance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's own figures, disclosed in 1980, are evidence of this trend toward 'rationalisation' in favour of oil company sites. Mr Garland, the then Minister, acknowledged that total service station numbers declined from 14,281 to 12,411 between 30 June 1978 and 30 May 1980, whereas total company operated sites increased from 578 to over 800 in the same period. Indeed, between December 1973 and May 1980, the total number of Australian service stations declined by one third-from 18,431 in December 1973 to 12,411 in May 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three types of operation for petroleum retail outlets in the present market:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Where the oil company owns the site and sells petrol direct to the public. The site is operated by a commissioned agent. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Where the oil company owns the site and leases it to a 'franchisee' who buys petrol from the company and then sells it to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) Where an independent owner owns the site, buys the petrol from an oil company and then sells it to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> The second groups of retailers-lessee operators or 'franchisees'-are protected under the existing legislation by certain rules which prevent the oil company- the 'franchisor'-from exploiting the retailer. The aim of these protections is to put the small businessman in a position where he can compete equally with other operators. No protection is given to the third category of retail operators, the independent owner. The theory seems to be that he owns his site and if he does not like the treatment he is given by an oil company he can change suppliers. In practice, an ill-treated independent operator is likely to be labelled a 'trouble maker' by the oligopoly and find it difficult to get sufficient supply and service from any source whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the continuing presence of oil companies in the retail market makes it harder for both sorts of independent operators to exist at all. The franchisees and independent owners buy petrol from the company and resell to the public. There is potential for price mark-ups here which the oil company selling direct to the public is not bothered by. The oil company selling direct can either retail cheaper or make more money from retail sales. Indeed, whereas the ordinary small business operator aims to maximise his profit, either by high volume sales or by a high margin of profit with increased services, the oil companies are not always concerned that an individual outlet be profitable. The company's primary objective is to have its refinery operating at the optimum rate of production. It is in the company's interests to ensure that retail sales correspond with optimum refinery production. Marginal or unprofitable retail outlets can be maintained by oil companies in order to boost market shares as profits are maximised within the total system. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, there is little likelihood that the company allocation of 401 retail sites would be affected by poor market posture; an independent owner, by contrast, would be forced out of business in such circumstances. This Bill would complete the job the Government started with its 1980 legislation. Sadly, it is too late to help the thousands of service station operators who have been forced out of business since the Government first announced its intention to seek complete divorcement. But this Bill will make certain that the lessee operators and independent retailers are given a fair go in the future, that full competition is retained in the retail petroleum markets and that small businessmen are protected from the predatory pricing actions of the big oil companies. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The main purposes of this Bill are to authorise the payment in 1982-83 of general purpose capital grants to the States totalling $457,667,000; and amounts the States and the Northern Territory may choose to nominate from their 1982-83 Loan Council borrowing programs to be provided for welfare housing at concessional loan terms and conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> At the June 1982 Loan Council meeting, an overall program of assistance for the States for works and housing in 1982-83 was agreed, comprising the States' Government Loan Council program of $1,438m and $247.2m for welfare housing under the established welfare housing assistance arrangements. Part of the States' Loan Council Program, some $65m, was earmarked for welfare housing and is being provided for as a grant, along with other welfare housing grants, under Appropriation Bill (No. 2). The arrangement for the States to nominate further funds as they wish for welfare housing from their loan council programs was also agreed at the June Loan Council meeting. That is, Commonwealth funds available to the States for welfare housing in 1982-83 aggregate to $312.2m plus whatever extra amounts the States choose to nominate from their loan council programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The general purpose capital grant amounts to one-third of the States' loan council program net of the $65m grant earmarked for welfare housing. The Bill also provides for the payment of general purpose capital grants in the first six months of 1983-84 up to an amount equal to one-half of the 1982-83 amount, pending passage of legislation to authorise grants in 1983-84. These proposed grants represent a continuation of arrangements initiated by the Liberal-Country Party Government in 1970, which provide that a proportion of the States' Government Loan Council Program should take the form of interest-free non- repayable grants instead of what would otherwise be interest-bearing borrowings by the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the grants is to relieve the States of debt charges-that is, interest payments and sinking fund contributions-which they would otherwise have to pay, and the grants accordingly have a substantial beneficial effect on the States' financial positions. The grants were introduced to help States finance works such as schools, and other capital works from which debt charges are not normally recovered. The States are, however, entirely free to apply these grants as they choose. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that, upon receipt of requests by the States and the Northern Territory, the concessional loans for welfare housing will be made available in the amounts nominated. The funds will be paid at the loan terms and conditions of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement and hence will bear interest at the rate of 4 1/2 per cent per annum and will be repayable over 53 years. </PARA>
<PARA> As a condition to the payment of these funds, the Bill contains a provision that the States and the Northern Territory will continue to provide at least as much from their own resources for welfare housing in 1982-83 as they did in 1981 -82. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall effect of the new welfare housing assistance arrangements is that the Commonwealth is providing more than 25 per cent specifically for this purpose in 1982-83 than in 1981-82, all by way of concessional loans or grants, and that the States and the Northern Territory also have the opportunity to convert part of their Loan council programs to this form of assistance according to their wishes and priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The rest of the States' Government Loan Council Program-that is, the program other than the $65m already earmarked for welfare housing-amounts to $1,373m, which represents a 5 per cent increase on the total program for 1981-82. As mentioned earlier, the one-third general purpose grant element of this amount is appropriated by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The States' Government Loan Council Program is, of course, only one component of overall funds available to the States from the Commonwealth Budget. In 1982- 83 these overall funds are estimated to total $15,268m, an increase of 13.7 per cent on 1981-82, and represent about one-third of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays this year. Payments to or for the States in addition to the general purpose capital funds approved by the Loan Council are expected to increase by 14.7 per cent to $13,895m in 1982-83. All but $5,154m of this involves general purpose funds which may, of course, be spent by the States however they see fit, including on capital works projects. </PARA>
<PARA> At its June 1982 meeting, the Loan Council also approved an increase in the larger State semi-government authorities' borrowing programs of 13.6 per cent to $1,047m for 1982-83. These figures exclude borrowings by major electricity authorities which have, at least for the next three years, been put outside the Loan Council ambit and can be determined by the States themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers these arrangements with the States to be generous. They also provide flexibility to the States in setting their own expenditure priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is an important measure in these overall arrangements. I commend it to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Northern Territory (Self- Government) Act 1978 to confirm that minerals in land acquired under s70 of the Act are vested in the Commonwealth. As far as this provision is concerned I am speaking on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), who administers this section of the Act. Since land was acquired by the Commonwealth under section 70 of the Act there has been doubt expressed as to whether the terms of the Act actually provided for minerals in that land to be vested in the Commonwealth. It is therefore considered essential that any doubts on this issue should be removed to ensure the protection of Commonwealth land where mining and exploration would not be desirable from the Commonwealth's point of view-for example, defence facilities, airports or areas where there are essential navigational aids. It is for this reason that amending clause 11 is proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to turn to the other minor amendments proposed in the Bill and to preface my remarks by drawing attention to the fact that self-government in the Northern Territory is now four years old and can be described as a success. I commend all Territorians on the enthusiam and energy which they have applied to the conduct of their own affairs. The atmosphere of confidence created in the Territory indicates that the majority of Territorians consider the granting of self-government to have been the most significant milestone in the Territory's history. The Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act has served the Territory well but as with all legislation now requires some fine tuning. This opportunity has been taken to make some machinery amendments to the Act that will improve its administration. Each of these minor amendments has the blessing of both Governments and I will refer briefly to some of the proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The assent procedures have been modified to give the Territory Legislative Assembly a degree of flexibility, similar to that enjoyed by the Commonwealth Parliament, in dealing with proposed laws returned by the Governor-General or the Administrator. In respect of the proposal of money votes in the Legislative Assembly it is proposed that the Administrator's message need only recommend the purpose of an appropriation rather than the proposed law itself. It is proposed that a casual vacancy in the Legislative Assembly should be filled only if it occurs more than six months before the last date for the next general election. The same clause confirms that a general election is not required as a result of a casual vacancy. The Bill amends some of the terminology in the Act to confirm with the practice of the Assembly and its Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for the simultaneous existence of more than one dormant commission as Acting Administrator to provide for the situation where both the Administrator and the holder of the first dormant commission are unavailable to act as Administrator. By these amendments the Government intends to improve the operation of the Act and I commend the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak briefly on the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Amendment Bill and out of order. My colleague, Senator Walsh, who is the Opposition spokesman in this area, will speak after me and move our amendment. I will speak briefly, mainly on the determination of the States' tax sharing entitlements, as a result of which this legislation has been introduced. The Bill purports to give effect to the new per capita weights for the purpose of determining States' tax sharing entitlements agreed to at the June 1982 Premiers Conference. These weights in turn derive substantially from the inquiry conducted by the Commonwealth Grants Commission over 1981 and 1982. I have prepared a table which I believe is suitable for incorporation in Hansard. I apologise to the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) for not showing it to her. I did not realise that this matter would come on so quickly. It is a composite table showing the various existing weights, the actual relativities, the assessed needs of each State, the weights proposed and the predictions of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) of the possible outcome of this weighting in 1983-84.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. These new weights are to be phased in over three years commencing in 1982-83, as the Bill states. Because the changes will adversely affect South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, there is a clause guaranteeing a minimum real annual increase for all States of about 2 per cent in 1982-83 and 1 per cent in 1983-84 and 1984-85 on top of the consumer price index rise for the capital city in each State. However, this guarantee, which will cost an anticipated $34m in 1982-83, and more in subsequent years, will not be financed by an increased Commonwealth Government contribution. Rather, it will be financed in effect by a reduction in the payments to other States within an overall entitlement of 20.72 per cent of total Commonwealth taxation revenue for the previous year. The mechanism for this nice bit of fiscal sleight of hand is the supplementary tax-sharing pool out of which the guarantees will be funded. The basic tax-sharing pool is only 20.323 per cent of the previous year's tax collections. It will be divided according to the new per capita weights as they are progressively introduced. The supplementary tax- sharing pool comprises 0.39 per cent of the previous year's tax collections and will be used first to fund the guarantees before any residual is distributed amongst the other States. Any State subject to the guarantee will receive its basic guarantee plus a share of the residual pool if its share of the residual is greater than the guarantee. Otherwise, it will receive only the guaranteed amount.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All this complexity essentially means that the total Commonwealth grants to the States in 1981-82 amounted to 20.7 per cent of the previous year's tax collections. The Commonwealth used this proportion, which itself is basically a matter of historical accident, as the bench-mark for the new tax-sharing arrangements. It was not prepared to spend any more than this to introduce the new arrangements, so it had to rob Peter to pay Paul. In 1979-80, the last year in which the Whitlam guarantee operated, tax-sharing grants amounted to 23.3 per cent of the previous year's tax collections. In 1980-81, grants were frozen in real terms, and declined as a percentage of Commonwealth tax collections. In 1981-82, grants were arbitrarily restricted to 9 per cent nominal growth, with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) subsequently disclosing that the States could have got 10 per cent had they bargained harder. Other additions and adjustments brought this increase to 11.4 per cent, but even some of this increase was accounted for by reductions in specific purpose grants. Under the previous formula, the increase would have been 16.6 per cent. These arbitrarily reduced grants for 1981-82 were then used as the basis for determining total allocations for the next three years of the new agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The principle of fiscal equalisation as a basis of redistribution of these tax- sharing arrangements is fair enough. But it is an essential principle in a federal system such as ours that factors other than fiscal equalisation, of course, are taken into account. But the issues of what may be called horizontal equalisation between the States and vertical equalisation between the Commonwealth and the States collectively cannot be separated. The Commonwealth is to make the States bear the whole burden of readjusting to the new tax- sharing arrangements while making no new contributions to that adjustment process. This in fact means that meaningful progress towards fiscal equalisation , if that is the aim of the Government, will in fact be slow. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless total tax receipts grow considerably faster than inflation the guarantee will come, after two or three years, to absorb most or all of the supplementary pool. The apparent gains for the larger States may not materialise, and could do so only if the other States were to be made worse off, since there is only a fixed sum to be distributed among all the States. Each one per cent of total tax revenue implies an amount of about $400m. It would surely have been not unreasonable for the Commonwealth to divide the whole of the 20.72 per cent of receipts among the States and then fund the guarantees from its own resources. These appear likely to amount to about $200m by 1984-85, or an additional 0.5 per cent on the 20.72 per cent total. This procedure would have enabled a far more significant movement towards fiscal equalisation than that now likely. We could have made adjustments on top of that for those States that need such adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be borne in mind that grants to the States are only one component of the totality of Federal-State financial relationships. These also encompass specific purpose grants to the States and Loan Council borrowing approvals. If the Government sticks to its old trick of whittling away these other allocations, some States will find themselves in fact worse off on the total equation. Recently we have seen savage cuts in specific purpose grants for hospitals and health care. Although this is part of this legislation I certainly do not want to delay its passage by going into this in detail. The States have been forced to impose higher and higher charges. The Government has cut the Loan Council borrowing programs for capital works from $1.43 billion in 1977-78 to $1 .37 billion in 1982-83-a cut of nearly half in real terms. The special infrastructure borrowing program has also declined rapidly.</PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania will be a particularly heavy loser from these new arrangements. It faces a fall in its per capita weight from almost 2 at the moment to 1.646 by 1984-85. In the short term, it will get some protection from the real guarantee. But what happens after 1984-85? What security is there for forward financial planning for any government in Tasmania? The whole agreement will obviously go back into the melting pot. Without the guarantee, Tasmania could be as much as $ 60m worse off by 1984-85. The other States will be not unnaturally aggrieved at having to foot this bill, as well as that for South Australia and Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Walsh would say, we do not oppose the Bill although I believe we have an amendment to move. I think I should point out that in no way does this legislation provide the States with funds adequate to their needs nor does it adequately address the issue of fiscal equalisation if that is what we are seriously talking about. In particular, in no way does it give State Treasurers much confidence in planning for the future and it arouses uncertainties in small States like Tasmania, and to a lesser extent South Australia, about their future under these agreements. I think if we proceed with this uncertainty in the future we will exacerbate economic difficulties which the States and this country in general have faced in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Grimes for speaking when this Bill was called on somewhat earlier than I had expected. As a result I was caught in my office instead of the chamber. I shall not repeat the very good statistical assessment which Senator Grimes has given. However, I would like to make a few general comments about the Bill before moving the Opposition amendment. There are two components to the legislation which is now before the Senate-the absolute amount of money which is granted by the Commonwealth to the States and the relativities between the States of that amount of money. First of all I will deal with the absolute quantity. Senator Sir John Carrick on 27 April 1976 in reply to a question gave an absolute guarantee that payments to the States in the succeeding three years would increase in real terms by more than 57 per cent under the new federalism policy. At that time Senator Sir John Carrick was talking up new federalism with as much enthusiasm as he subsequently displayed when talking up Rundle shares. The result of both cases has been the same. Rundle shares are now selling for about 12 per cent of the price they were selling for at the time of Senator Sir John Carrick's talking up of the shares was in full flight and new federalism is dead. The Rundle project is dead; new federalism is dead. Unfortunately Senator Sir John Carrick survives as a Minister of the Crown. In real terms, grants to the States since this Government has taken office, far from increasing by 57 per cent, as Senator Sir John Carrick had given an absolute guarantee they would, have remained in some years stagnant and in some years have slowly declined. Yet Senator Sir John Carrick has the audacity to be censorious of other Ministers in other governments for alleged failure to live up to their promises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Traditionally, relativities between the States, the division of whatever absolute amount the Commonwealth decides to provide, has been based on the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission with occasional or ad hoc supplementary grants to the States. For the first time, in this Bill a government has rejected the basic relativities recommended by the Grants Commission and it has done so for the basest of political reasons. The political strategy underlying the relativities which this Government has set is a desire to punish New South Wales and Victoria for electing State Labor governments. That vindictive, politically opportunistic action of this Government is the direct cause of the substantial increases in a number of State charges forced upon the Victorian Government yesterday and other increases in charges forced upon the New South Wales Government a couple of years earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The obverse of the Commonwealth's punishment of New South Wales and Victoria for having the audacity to elect Labor governments contrary to the wish of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is that Queensland will be rewarded to a greater extent than the Grants Commission had recommended and the other States will fall in between. The sordid political strategy of the Prime Minister with respect to New South Wales and Victoria supplementing his vindictive desire to punish them for electing State Labor governments, of course, is that because those State governments are unjustly placed in a position where they have no alternative but to increase State charges substantially, he hopes that he can mount a campaign against the Labor Party in general pursuant to that and save Federal seats in those States which his Government would otherwise lose. Never before have Grants Commission recommendations been rejected by a government. I hope that never again will they be rejected for such base and sordid political reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party has many firsts in addition to that. It was, for example, the first to block a Budget in the Senate. This Prime Minister was the first to establish a doctrine of ministerial non-responsibility, at least for National Country Party Ministers. Indeed, the new standard set for the first time by this Government appears to be that if Ministers are not actually in Long Bay gaol or if they have not been convicted of a gaolable offence, they are fit to remain in a Cabinet. This Prime Minister is the first Prime Minister to reject the findings of a royal commission and to attack the integrity of a royal commissioner. Now he is the first to reject the recommendations of the Grants Commission. From the day he became the Leader of the Opposition in 1975- presumably it will be so until the day he loses the next election, whenever that is held-this Prime Minister consistently has debased or destroyed the institutions which have held this society together. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Grimes said, the absolute amount granted the States under this legislation is 20.27 per cent of total revenue. It should be noted that tax forgone by the Commonwealth, tax not collected by the States, is paid for partially-to the extent of 20.27 per cent-by the States. Tax not paid to the Commonwealth is money the States do not receive because the amount granted to the States is tied by formula to total tax collections. I should like to place on record that as a direct result of the activities of people-powerful figures- in the Liberal Party the States are being deprived of revenue. One powerful figure who is well known has sold at least nine companies registered in three States to at least two different promoters over four calendar years. In one case alone the tax evaded by the sale of that company was $1.7m. Even under a government of integrity there are real problems in determining both the level of payments to the States and the relativities between the States-the division of that total payment between the States. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1976 and in late 1975 the Prime Minister propounded a doctrine of new federalism, the stated objectives of which were to align more closely the power to raise revenue and the responsibility for spending it. Many people, including me, believe there is a great deal to be said for that doctrine but, as always, the doctrine was sacrificed. What was stated by the Prime Minister to be a principle was sacrificed as he succumbed, as always, to short term political opportunism. Of all the damage that this Prime Minister has done to Australian society this might yet be recorded as one of the worst instances. Probably no Prime Minister in history has been in as strong a political position as the present Prime Minister was in his first term. He could have actually applied the doctrine which he espoused of tying power to raise revenue more closely to the responsibility of spending it. Any Labor government which attempted to do that almost certainly would be destroyed politically by opposition from State governments and from State based media. Any normal Liberal government would be likely to face the same problem. This Prime Minister, in his first term, had a unique opportunity to put State financial relations on a new and better basis. He had the opportunity to be a statesman. He remained a political opportunist, which he was before and which he still is. The chance was missed and, conceivably, it will never recur. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one point before I conclude my remarks. I do not often adopt a parochial attitude in the Senate-I think that would be acknowledged on both sides of the chamber-but I note that page 19 of Budget Paper No. 7, which is the Budget Paper that details payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and local government, shows an estimate of the population of the States for December 1982. I note that the estimate puts the population of Western Australia 10,000 above that of South Australia. After three years of Tonkin Liberal government in South Australia the order of precedence, based on priority of the States, has changed for the first time this century. The implications of that are, among other things-I do not raise this as a frivolous matter-that next year the order of precedence will be changed in the Budget Papers so that Western Australia will precede South Australia. At Premiers conferences the Premier of Western Australia, who next year will be Mr Burke, will take precedence of John Bannon, who will then be the Premier of South Australia. The radio call signs, when established in the 1920's, again were related to precedence based on population, so that New South Wales was two, Victoria was three, Queensland was four and so on-Western Australia was six. That too should be changed to give the new status of Western Australia the recognition it is due. Likewise, the subscriber trunk dialling prefixes of 08 for South Australia and 09 for Western Australia should be reversed, as should the post codes. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what plans the Government has to deal with this situation which probably has arisen by now. The population estimates could not conceivably be so inaccurate that it will not arise before the end of this calendar year. All of those things will have to be changed if the traditional basis upon which precedence is determined is adhered to. All of that-if not all of it then certainly most of it-can be attributed to the stagnation of South Australia under its present Liberal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I protest again that the relativities determined by the Grants Commission have been rejected by the Government, for the basest of political reasons. They have not been rejected before, for any reason. The direct consequence of that is that severe financial penalties are imposed on the States of New South Wales and Victoria which inevitably require those States to increase charges heavily. The Prime Minister hopes that there will be an electoral backlash to those increases which will save the seats in those States which currently keep this worthless Government in office. The strategy will fail and the Government will be swept from office. The strategy will be as dismal a failure in the long run as the grand design of new federalism was six and seven years ago. On behalf of the Opposition, I move the amendment which has been circulated, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that the Bill deprives the States of funds necessary to meet their needs, as identified by the Grants Commission, and fails to adequately address the issue of fiscal equalisation'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that the Opposition will not be opposing the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982 that is before us. There are one or two comments that were made by Opposition senators to which I wish briefly to respond. One comment related to the Commonwealth's refusal to accept the Commonwealth Grants Commission's findings. The new relativities were settled upon at the June Premiers Conference of this year and were based largely upon acceptance of the commission's findings. The new relativities which are ultimately to apply are the Commission's recommended relativities modified in one respect only. The Commonwealth considered that a case existed for modifying the Commission's 1982 preferred relativities in view of the Commission's assessment that South Australia and Tasmania should have a lower share of tax sharing grants on account of the above average per capita amounts paid to them under their continuing hospital cost sharing agreements with the Commonwealth. It was the Commonwealth's view that South Australia and Tasmania were entitled to those extra amounts until the year 1984-85 in view of clause 7 (1) of their hospital cost sharing agreements with the Commonwealth. That clause states that any such financial gains are not to be offset by the Commonwealth against general revenue payments to those States. Furthermore, preserving the financial gains to these two States could not be considered at the expense of the other States because the Commonwealth, and not the other States, has been the source of any such financial gain. The method of implementing the new relativities has been said to be contrary to the Commission's wishes. Further to what I have said about the hospital cost sharing arrangements, the only other aspect of the new arrangements which could be mistaken as a rejection of the Commission's findings was the decision to phase in the new relativities in conjunction with the Commonwealth guaranteeing a real terms increase in each State's tax sharing grants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The new arrangements give due recognition to the magnitude of change involved for some States if the recommendations of the Commission had been implemented immediately. In fact, the Chairman of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, in his letter of transmittal, recognised that the effects on some States of an immediate shift to the assessed relativities would be quite severe. Further, it is the Commonwealth's view that the straight phasing-in of the new relativities over the three remaining years of the current tax sharing arrangements along the lines canvassed by the Commission without some guaranteed minimum growth in grants would involve arbitrarily determining the capacity of some of the less populous States to absorb the changes necessary, especially in view of the effect upon the standard and level of particular services of real term reductions in Commonwealth payments to those States. These matters were canvassed at the Premiers Conference and it was the agreement reached at that Conference which has resulted in the arrangements that are before us in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It was also said that the Commonwealth has made no effort to assist States to adjust to the new sets of relativities. I would have to say on that matter that serious consideration was given to the contribution by the Commonwealth which would be appropriate in assisting the States in moving to the new relativities. It was considered that the Commonwealth's contribution should not only entail once again an amount of $60m made available in 1981-82 to the three more populous States in recognition of the likelihood that following the further review relativities would be adjusted in favour of those three States-now escalated to about $70m-but also should include the escalated value of the net budgetary gains to South Australia and Tasmania associated with the transfers of their railways to the Commonwealth in 1975-76. That is estimated to cost about $ 79m in the 1982-83 year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission in its report had assessed that South Australia and Tasmania should not continue to have a higher share of tax sharing grants on account of these railway transfers. It was the Commonwealth's view, however, that these benefits should not be automatically redistributed among the States but should instead revert to the Commonwealth. This additional budgetary assistance had been provided by the Commonwealth at its own budgetary expense and not by the other States. Instead of retaining this amount for its own purposes the Commonwealth determined that it could be added to the amount set aside to assist in the process of implementing new tax sharing relativities, in particular by funding the guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA> Some comments have been made about Victoria and New South Wales. I do not want to enter into a long discussion about them. But I do want to say that both New South Wales and Victoria are better off in 1982-83 under the new arrangements than they would have been if a review of the tax sharing relativities had not been undertaken by the Grants Commission. If such a review had not taken place the Commonwealth would not have provided a total of $60m additional assistance to the three more populous States in 1981-82 in recognition of the likelihood that the relativities would be adjusted in favour of these States. In fact, New South Wales is $20m better off and Victoria is $28m better off than they would have been if the review by the Grants Commission had never been undertaken. Furthermore, both New South Wales and Victoria are better off now than they would have been had the Grants Commission relativities, as modified, been immediately implemented and had the Commonwealth's contribution of about $149m been completely excluded from the tax sharing pool and used instead directly to assist the less populous States in their process of adjustment to the new tax sharing relativities. I know that all States find difficulties in adjusting to their own budget requirements the raising of revenue and the expenditure which is their responsibility. I think it is fair to say that at the Premiers Conferences fairly wide debate on these matters is held. </PARA>
<PARA> A further question which I think was raised by Senator Grimes concerns what would occur after the 1984-85 year. As I understand it the States and the Commonwealth have not yet made any decisions with regard to this, but I feel quite confident that these matters will be raised at an appropriate time so that whatever are to be the arrangements after the 1984-85 year will be put in place so that there will be the sort of certainty for planning that undoubtedly is required at the State level and, indeed, at the Commonwealth level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has moved an amendment. The amendment is not acceptable to the Government. It is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of the Grants Commission inquiry and report. The Grants Commission was required to examine the relative distribution of a given level of tax sharing funds among the States. The Commission did not and nor was it asked to, identify a specific level of funds necessary to meet each State's needs. Furthermore, the amendment is incorrect in presupposing that the Grants Commission's assessments were rejected by the June 1982 Premiers Conference. The fact is that the new relativities ultimately to apply are the Commission's preferred relativities modified only so that South Australia's and Tasmania's hospital cost sharing grants do not adversely affect their tax sharing grants. It was the Commonwealth's view that South Australia and Tasmania were entitled to those extra amounts until 1984-85 in view of clause 7 (1) of their hospital cost sharing agreements with the Commonwealth which states that any such financial gains are not to be offset by the Commonwealth against general revenue payments to those States. Since the principle of fiscal equalisation was fundamental to the Grants Commission's recommendations and since the new arrangements essentially embrace those recommendations, it follows that the new relativities contained in this Bill are directed at pursuing this important principle. I wish the Bill a speedy passage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I present a ministerial statement concerning a review of Commonwealth administration which was delivered today by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I seek leave to incorporate the statement in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> In my statement in Parliament on 21 September 1982, concerning the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry, I referred to breakdowns and administrative failures in a number of areas of government administration over the last decade or so. These matters are obviously of the gravest concern to all Australians: Efficient and effective public administration is vital for maintaining the kind of Australia that we want for our children. The people of Australia have a right to expect good, honest, efficient and effective administration, and the Government is determined to take every possible step to ensure that this occurs. In each instance where there has been a breakdown in Public Service administration over recent years the Government has made an appropriate and prompt response to remedy the deficiencies that have come to notice. But the Government believes that it is vital not only to remedy deficiencies in administration as they become known but also to look more broadly at the Public Service and the demands upon it in order to do whatever can be done to prevent such breakdowns from occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> The general health of the Public Service, including its efficiency and management, must be a matter of the highest concern for Government. The Public Service-broadly interpreted to include departments and authorities-must be equipped with the kinds of management structures and tools which will enable it to deliver Government programs effectively to the people of Australia, and which will allow it to keep up with new technology and with changes in community and business requirements and attitudes. The Government believes there is a question as to whether the Public Service, as presently organised, has the management tools, the flexibility and the capacities to meet the challenge that presently exist and that lie ahead. Departments and authorities must be able not only to meet the demands of today, but also to anticipate the demands of tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three evolutionary changes which present challenges to public administration at the present time. The first is changing technology and the so- called information explosion. The Public Service needs to be able to cope with the significant technological changes and the growth of information which have been and will be taking place, including the relevance of computer technology to public administration. Governments and their agencies must be able to be responsive to, and to take advantage of, new methods of gathering, processing and applying information. But it is not just a matter of applying new technology to growing information. It is also a matter of knowing what information is needed-and in what form it is needed-to enable departments, authorities and ministers to carry out their functions efficiently and effectively and also a matter of being able to take practical steps for satisfying these requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The second challenge is posed by the increasing demands on the public sector flowing from a greater involvement by government in areas such as social welfare , health, education and national development, plus many other areas of concern to the community. The increased scope and the wider activities of government obviously enlarge the responsibilities of public administration enormously and create difficulties in relation to adequate communications, accountability and control. </PARA>
<PARA> The third challenge, I regret to say, arises from a deterioration in what I might call the 'business ethics' of a minority. There was a time when the administration, in its relationships with business, could assume that a high degree of trust was appropriate. The Service did not have to be geared to handle cheating on a large scale. Of course, there have always been those in the community who have been prepared to get away with as much as they can without too much regard for what might be regarded as honour, let alone the law: But in the past this has not been an element which has put significant stress on the Service itself. As recent events relating to taxation, meat substitution and health schemes show only too clearly, there are those outside the administration -and I stress that they are very much a minority-who are prepared to act ruthlessly in what they perceive as their own interests, without regard either to the interests of the community or to the observation of the law. It is that third challenge, which has been particularly instrumental in leading the Government to the view that at this time there is a need to look closely at the management tools, the flexibility and the capacity of the Service as presently organised. There have been a number of administrative breakdowns which have flowed from the Service's inability to respond speedily and adequately to the challenges posed by those who seek to behave unethically or even illegally. Those in the community who cheat on their obligations to others or attempt dishonestly to evade the law, whether by evading taxation or meat inspection regulations or any other laws or regulations, not only bring dishonour on themselves but also impose real strains on the Public Service of this country, and on the social and economic fabric which is vital to our way of life. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a particular tragedy that small numbers of failures by individuals who have fallen to temptation to give favours or seek favours have brought the Public Service into a degree of disrepute. The Public Service itself wants to respond to the criticisms that have been made against it. They are not criticisms that are made against the Service as a whole but the Service as a whole is touched by them. Many public servants feel that the reputation of the Service has been badly tarnished by recent happenings and that it needs to re- establish the high reputation that it feels it has earned in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not wish what I am saying to overshadow the very solid work that is being done in the greater part of the Public Service: It is unfortunate, but inevitable, that attention tends to be focused on what is wrong, not on what is right. But I have said before and I say again now that I have enormous respect for the dedication and management skills of the Public Service, and for the people who staff it. By world standards we have a Public Service of high reputation. But the Public Service cannot live on its reputation and in particular it must meet changes with adequate administrative responses. It is clear that the Service needs to be a jump ahead of those who seek to frustrate it in carrying out its proper functions. </PARA>
<PARA> Both to assist in achieving this and to create the opportunity for the public to be reassured about the future of the Service, the Government proposes that there should be a report to the Government on aspects of the performance of the whole Commonwealth administration. Both through an examination of the underlying causes of major administrative deficiencies of the kind that have occurred in recent years, and through a wider examination of management skills and management structures throughout the Commonwealth Government departments and authorities, the Review of Commonwealth Administration is to be asked to examine , report on and make recommendations in relation to the requirements for an efficient and effective Public Service in Australia; and in particular to identify the demands and pressures placed upon the Public Service, and the mechanisms, procedures and management structures which are required to enable the Public Service to carry out its functions, implement government policy and deliver programs effectively and efficiently to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Review in particular should take into account the need for the Public Service to have high standards and good morale; the need for the Public Service to provide the professional managerial component of public administration; the need for the Public Service to possess management skills and to develop management structures capable of meeting and responding to the challenges of an increasingly complex business, economic and social environment; the need for the Public Service to provide constructive and imaginative policy advice, and adequate mechanisms for ensuring the effective implementation of the Government' s policy decisions; and the need for accountability of the Public Service while maintaining the concept of a non-political career Public Service based on merit, capable of providing effective support for Ministers in relation to their administrative and policy-making responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Review involves a major examination of Commonwealth administration , it is not intended that it should be a protracted one. The Government understands that in the interests of a timely completion of the Review, in some areas of concern it may be possible only to provide indications of further work that will need to be done to achieve the ultimate objective. It is not proposed that this Review should repeat the work done by the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, which was the first comprehensive review of government administration in over 50 years and had the broadest possible terms of reference. Nor is it proposed to duplicate the particular work done by parliamentary committees, by the Auditor-General, by the Public Service Board and by management consultants and others who may have examined, or be examining, particular aspects of the Service. This Review is to focus specifically on the management framework, the constraints which face public sector managers, and the challenges that they will have to confront in the future. The Government is looking for a report, from people of high reputation in their own business fields, which assesses what they see as the deficiencies, the problems and the appropriate remedies. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr J. B. Reid, A.O., has accepted the role of chairman of the review. Mr Reid is Chairman of James Hardie Industries Limited, Vice Chairman of Qantas Airways Ltd and a Director of BHP and Barclays International Australia Limited. He was a member of the Administrative Review Committee in 1975-76 chaired by Sir Henry Bland and a member of the inquiry into the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in 1978. He has been also a member of various other government bodies and currently is Chairman of the Australian Bicentennial Authority. Mr Reid will be assisted by Sir Ronald Elliott, and Professor John Rose. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Ronald Elliott is a director of Brambles Industries Limited and International Commodities Clearing House Limited. He is the former Managing Director of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation. Sir Ronald is also a member of the Council of Administrative Staff and a Fellow of the Australian Institute of Management. Professor Rose is Sidney Myer Professor of Commerce and Business Administration at the University of Melbourne, and since 1976 has been a consultant in my private office. All three members of the Review are obviously well qualified for the task, and the Government is grateful to them for accepting this most important role. </PARA>
<PARA> The Review will have full access in all areas of government administration-to see and consult with whoever they determine, whether from inside or outside the Public Service and statutory authorities. The administration will have an opportunity to explain its task and its methods of carrying it out and, also, the nature of the constraints which distinguish Government administration from the business world. People from outside the administration, with substantial and established reputations in the business world, will have an opportunity to say what they think the Public Service should be doing-and here the Review would be looking no doubt for positive and realistic guidance capable of being put into practical effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry will be assisted by a small secretariat, headed by Mr H. B. MacDonald, Deputy Secretary in the Department of Administrative Services. Mr Reid has indicated that he would expect to be able to report before the autumn sitting of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> As I stated earlier and as no-one in this House would deny, the people of Australia have a right to expect good, honest, efficient and effective administration in the public sector. With the assistance of this Review of Commonwealth Administration the Government is determined to see that they get it . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This statement, brought down under the letterhead of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), is a pathetic statement. It is really rather sad, if one may allow some degree of emotion in politics. I want to make a few brief comments about the statement to illustrate that point. Since this Government was elected to office there has been a lot of talk by the Prime Minister-words, words, words-about the importance of an efficient, honest Public Service of integrity. I do not need to quote to the Senate at any length the sort of statements which have been made over the years by the Prime Minister in relation to that issue. It is probably sufficient to say that in 1978 he spoke of the degree of integrity and efficiency required by his Government in relation to the Public Service. On 12 March 1978 he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of my Government's first promises when we were elected just over two years ago was to restore the integrity and honesty of government. As long as I lead the Government there is no way known that anything less than the highest code and practice of public administration will be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a promise which he said was made as a prime plank of the Fraser Government's election in 1975-on the question of restoring to the process of Government integrity and honesty and the highest standards of public administration. It is somewhat sad and pathetic, as I say, in September 1982 to have the Prime Minister, caught as it were with numerous examples of alleged Public Service inefficiencies and deficiencies, now saying that he will conduct a review of the Public Service to see how it can be improved. The terminology of the proposed review is the most extraordinary aspect of all. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer briefly to some aspects of the statement by the Prime Minister to illustrate that point. Of course, this Review of Commonwealth Administration in Australia arises out of the fact that this Government has been caught in numerous inefficiencies in relation to the collection of revenue. It has been exposed by Mr Justice Woodward's inquiry into the meat industry, by the Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd scandal, indeed by a number of scandals which have plagued it from its inception but more recently have been revealed in a more dramatic way. </PARA>
<PARA> As a response, the Prime Minister says: 'Everything will be all right; we will now conduct a review of public administration in Australia'. The first point to be made about that statement is that it is just not credible. For seven years this Government has said the same thing-that it is committed and dedicated to efficiency and honesty in public administration. Why should this statement be more credible than any of the others which have been made?</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to some of the particular absurdities. The Prime Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There are three evolutionary changes which present challenges to public administration at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA>It is instructive to consider what these three changes are. The first that he identifies is changing technology and the so-called information explosion. Really, the Prime Minister displays monumental acumen in now discovering that there is a need to consider the information explosion and changing technology as a matter relevant to the Public Service of Australia. It is quite extraordinary because it was this Government which set up the Myers Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia, which has hundreds of pages of advice and information about the effects of the information explosion and new technology on the Public Service. When the Myers Committee reported to the Parliament the whole of its report was pigeonholed by this Government. Nothing has been done with regard to any of the recommendations of the Myers Committee in relation to the effects of technology on the Australian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister identifies the second challenge to public administration as being: '. . . The increasing demands on the public sector flowing from a greater involvement by government in areas such as social welfare, health, education and national development, plus many other areas of concern to the community'. I take it that this is Malcolm Fraser's equivalent of Brideshead Revisited; we might call it the razor gang revisited. There is now a discovery of the growing involvement of government and demands placed on the public sector by all of these areas such as social welfare, health, education and national development. </PARA>

<PARA>The whole message of the so-called razor gang-which, as we said, right from the beginning, was a stunt; that is transparent now-was that Public Service administration had to be tightened up. It had to be more efficient and more effective. A ministerial council was to be established to deal with all such questions. In addition, the size of the Public Service was to be cut, certain functions were to be transferred to the States and other functions were to be transferred to private enterprise. That statement was made in April 1981. Eighteen months later the Prime Minister, in this razor gang revisited statement , talks about the increasing demands on the public sector because it is more involved in areas such as social welfare, health, education and so on. He adds that this imposes additional responsibilities on public administration, accountability and control. They are the first two challenges that the Prime Minister talks about as being challenges to the standards of public administration. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the third challenge he says:</PARA>
<PARA> The third challenge, I regret to say, arises from a deterioration in what I might call the 'business ethics' of a minority. </PARA>
<PARA>He adds that there was a time when the Administration could rely on business ethics, but now the time has come when this unhappy Administration can no longer do so. Thus, the three scapegoats for this pathetic inquiry are established-the third being a group now identified in the business community by the Prime Minister whom he was pleased to refer to a couple of weeks ago, in his electorate broadcast, as 'recipients of stolen money'. I have always taken the view that tax evasion is the ultimate development of private enterprise. I have always taken the view that government in this country is best served by a balanced development of the economy and a balanced development of government services so there is a relationship between the public and private sectors. What we have seen is an explosion of activity in the private enterprise sector in the tax avoidance industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from these sorts of specific criticisms one can make of the absurd grounds for the statement being made, there is also, as I said, the element of scapegoat philosophy in this whole statement. Nothing under the Fraser Government is the responsibility of the Government. Bertolt Brecht once wrote a marvellous passage about the Weimar Republic in Germany in the 1930s. He said that the Government had lost confidence in the people; the Government had decided to dismiss the people. That could be said with validity about the Weimar Republic in Germany and it could also with validity be said about Malcolm Fraser 's Government of 1982. The Government has lost confidence in the people; the Government has decided to dismiss the people. The Government has decided to dismiss the Public Service in the sense that it is saying that these people are responsible for all the problems. The Government has decided to dismiss the opinions of Mr Justice Woodward, a distinguished royal commissioner, when they criticise a Minister of this Government. One can go through a whole range of areas in which there is this chronic inability to accept any responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not like to remind the Senate of these boring, sordid things but when this Government was elected after the events of 11 November 1975 it was elected on the promise and on the assumption that it would do better. Seven years on, growing older and older, the story looks a bit sad because in none of these areas has the Government done better. The economy of the country is in the worst state it has been in since the 1930s. The administration of this country has been exposed as being in the worst state it has been in for many years. One could go through a whole range of areas relating to that. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is to be an inquiry into public administration and public administrators are to be blamed for the manifest deficiencies of this Government , it is incumbent upon us to remind the people of Australia and this Parliament of what those deficiencies are. Of course, it all stems back to the fact that a public service can be efficient and creative only if it believes in the Ministers of the Government who are responsible for leading it, who are given the responsibility by the Constitution of administering departments, of putting forward policies. If a public service believes in its leadership then that public service will respond. </PARA>
<PARA> But what has happened here in Australia now that it is said that the Public Service is largely to blame for these things? Look at the reports of various Government instrumentalities about what this Government has done to the Public Service over the years. Look first of all at the Auditor-General's reports for the last two years. The Auditor-General goes through department after department and identifies inefficiencies which are a direct result of Government policy. The Auditor-General identifies in particular inefficiencies in the Australian Taxation Office, in the Bureau of Customs and in a number of other departments. Look at the reports of the Commissioner of Taxation for the last four years. One would think all of this stuff about the Taxation Office not being able to carry out its function was new. It is not new at all. The reports of the Taxation Office indicated in 1977 and 1978 that it could not do what it wanted to do about tax avoidance and evasion in Australia because it did not have the staff. In its 1978 report it said that nothing had happened as a result of its request for additional staff. Look for example, at the reports of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the effects which Government policies have had on it , particularly in relation to staff. Again there are instances of staff ceilings imposed by this Government costing a body such as the Australian Broadcasting Commission more because it has had to put work out to contract, which has been more costly. Look also at the reports of Telecom Australia, which organisation complained that as a result of the arbitrary imposition of staff ceilings in pursuit of an ideological commitment of this Government it has not been able to carry out its functions effectively and well, particularly in the provision of new telephone services in the country and outer suburban areas of the big cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA> One can go through all these reports and find documentation of inefficiencies in the Public Service directly related to this Government's policies. I said yesterday that these things go to the top. They go to the top because if we are to have good, efficient and honest administration that administration needs to look to the leadership of this country to guide it. Of course that is where the failing is. </PARA>
<PARA> I reminded the Senate a minute ago of the sort of double-talk that has gone on over this issue over the years. Let me make the point again that when the razor gang was established last year we were promised as a parliament, and the people of Australia were promised, a continuous review of government administration. That has just not happened and if it has happened it has produced no results at all. As I said in this place yesterday, and as I say again, if one wants proof that the leadership of this country is the problem which creates difficulties right down the line in public administration, there is no better authority than Mr Peacock, the former Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Foreign Affairs, who made some very clear statements about this at the time of his resignation from this Government. In his statement of 28 April 1981, he simply made this point:</PARA>
<PARA> By reposing too much power in the Prime Minister, the system of collective responsibility within the Cabinet is destroyed; the responsibility of Cabinet to Parliament is abandoned; and the very democratic process is placed in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA>It is placed in jeopardy, all right; it is placed in jeopardy by the conduct of this Prime Minister. He refers in the statement put down today to the problem of cheating on a large scale developing in this country. There is plenty of evidence that the Prime Minister is the biggest cheat on a large scale in this country. I am not referring to money matters when I say that. Right from the start of this Government there has been a lack of leadership on moral issues and on issues of public probity steming from the office of the Prime Minister. We had the despoiling of conventions beginning in 1975 and now in 1982, this week, we have the Prime Minister attacking the umpire, the royal commissioner Mr Justice Woodward. Three years ago it was good enough for him to say that the Government had no choice but to accept the recommendations of a royal commissioner. Last night he was indulging himself with great double-talk about the Liberal Party being the party of fairness in Australia. Fair to whom? It has been very fair to tax avoiders and evaders over the last seven years. But in fact rorts have been tolerated and incomes of ordinary people, pay-as-you-earn taxpayers, have declined in real terms although the Government persists in trying to demonstrate otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> The living standards of this country over the last seven years since the present Government came to power have gone down the hit parade every year compared with those of other countries. People are now waking up to where the big cheat is coming from. Ultimately, the Prime Minister cannot escape responsibility for the erosion of trust to which he refers so much. </PARA>
<PARA> A further point is the centralisation of power in the Prime Minister's own Department, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Many of the problems of the Public Service stem from that, as Mr Peacock identified in his resignation speech. What we have in the Prime Minister's Department is a mini- Public Service shadowing all other sections of the Public Service. Plenty of honourable senators will know that that is a cause of great concern in many departments of the Public Service. In a sense, if public servants want to get something done, they have to try to supplant the senior officials of their own department and get into the mini-Public Service of the Prime Minister's Department. The effects of this on morale in other departments are enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to reiterate the points I seek to make. This is a pathetic statement. It is an illustration of this Government's absolute despair after all these deficiencies in its own administration have been revealed. It is a record which would be disastrous for any government, and it is disastrous for the process of government in Australia. We shall never do anything significant in this country until we have a public service which is working at maximum efficiency and until we have a system of government which is believable to the ordinary citizen. The system of government under Malcolm Fraser is not credible and not believable to the ordinary citizen any longer. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we have these attempts at windy rhetoric over the years to try to paint this Government as a government of efficiency. The last such effort was the razor gang in April 1981, when the rhetoric was totally contrary to the rhetoric now put down in this statement today. Thirdly, we have government imposed policies which, in many cases, have destroyed the morale and efficiency of the Public Service. Now, after all this time, we have an inquiry set up as a sort of pre-election stunt, in case the Prime Minister wants an election this year, in which it is said, 'We are doing something about the Public Service'- just as the Government is going to do something about tax avoiders, it is said, and about recovering money by retrospective legislation, it is said; although no one believes it. These things are all being said as pre-election stunts-'We are getting the house in order. Everything will be all right in the future. The last seven years may have been horrible, disastrous and miserable for the average Australian, but we are getting things in order now and we are looking forward to a rosy future.'</PARA>
<PARA> If there is an election this year, it will occur because the Prime Minister knows that this country's economy is an abysmal mess and will be worse next year . If there is an election this year, it will be because the Prime Minister fears further revelations from royal commissioners about his own administration. There will be more reports on that. These are the reasons which lead to this sort of statement being made. It is a totally hypocritical exercise. It is cynical. I am sad to say that it is also abolutely pathetic. The terms of reference of the inquiry are ludicrous in the way in which they lay down reasons for the inquiry taking place at all. I do not want to say an more about it. It is a transparent sort of document. It will not wash anywhere but in the minds of a few loyal senators, from Warrnambool, or some such place, who think that everything that the great man does is still all right. But as I know from my conversations around this Parliament, there is a growing disbelief about that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I concur in large measure with the remarks of Senator Button. The Australian Democrats are glad that a committee like the Review of Commonwealth Functions has been appointed. We agree with the objectives stated. However, we are more than a little uncomfortable with the implication that the responsibility for recent debacles lies essentially or solely with the Public Service, and not with the Government. That is clearly the inference in regard to the appointment of such a committee. Although three distinguished men, Mr John Reid, Sir Ronald Elliott and Professor John Rose, have been invited to serve on the Review Committee, I am bitterly disappointed and I find it incomprehensible-it is an act of stupidity on the part of the Government-that no member of any Public Service trade union has been included or offered a position on this committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government talks about worker participation. It says that Senator John Siddons's Bill on industrial democracy is a step in the right direction. Yet in relation to an inquiry into the Public Service, what does the Government do? It brings in three outsiders to comment and to criticise, within a limited framework as Senator Button has suggested, and it does not appoint a person such as Mr Paul Munro, the Secretary of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, a very learned and very able person, even to protect the interests of the public servants in the in camera sessions of the committee. I should have thought that it would be sheer common sense to say 'Let us create good will and good public relations; let us get the co-operation of the Public Service in this matter', and that that would have demanded a senior trade union official being included in the committee. But such a person will not be there. </PARA>
<PARA> I give one example of how a senior trade union official from the Public Service would help. When the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) came to power in 1975, he said, 'We will put a ceiling on the growth of the Public Service'. I have a political persuasion which would be similar to yours in this matter, Mr Acting Deputy President. That is, the growth of the Public Service ought to be strictly controlled and there ought to be a very strong audit on its growth. But one of the silliest things to do is to say, 'Right, there will be a one per cent increase over the next year, irrespective of what department is concerned'. I have canvassed or been canvassed by public servants in my old department, the Bureau of Customs, at airports and at seaports. They have said to me 'Senator, we have given it up. We have given it away. We are dedicated, honest public servants, trying to stop contraband coming into this country, trying to control the entry of drugs at our seaports and airports. But how can we do it? Our staff has been cut and the workload has been doubled or trebled'. They have given it away. Morale is shattered. Thats one of the reasons why we have had problems in the Customs department. </PARA>
<PARA> A trade unionist, Mr Paul Munro or someone similar, would be able to go to the Committee and say 'One of the problems here has been a silly act by the Government. Let us attack the problem in that way and get the view of a few officers who are a rung or two down the ladder to find out why these problems exist'. We have had relative cuts in social security staff at a time when the number of unemployed has risen astronomically. Surely that would indicate the need for more social security staff, not less. Hence, disenchantment, loss of morale and loss of efficiencyy, will finally rebound on a Minister. These are the sorts of things that I would have hoped such a committee could find out. Because of this omission, I hope that Mr Reid and his two colleagues will intimately consult members of the Public Service trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> I am suspicious about the motives for the appointment of this committee, as is Senator Button. I sense a feeling of disquiet in this building at the moment. One can feel it at Question Time. Inordinately few Government senators were here for Question Time this morning and all this week. </PARA>

I hope that it will not be interpreted that the appointment of this Committee will fix up all the ills that beset the country at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the various reports that have come down. Although they do point a finger at certain public servants they point fingers very heavily at certain Ministers. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and his Department have taken virtually no action. Similarly, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has not acted for 12 months or more after receiving advice from the Australian Taxation Office. I pay a tribute to Mr O'Reilly, the Commissioner of Taxation. From the scanty evidence that we have had a chance to look at so far and the papers that have been tabled he at least comes out of this with great credit. He has been pushing for action on tax 'avoision'-that may be a suitable word to coin. The fault in this area does not lie with the Public Service; it lies squarely with the ministry and Ministers. Does any honourable senator suggest that Mr Nixon has acted promptly or efficiently? Can any honourable senator say that successive Ministers for Health have acted zealously to protect the millions of dollars which are being ripped off by a few unscrupulous doctors? Does any honourable senator suggest that Telecom Australia is an efficient organisation? Its arrogance and inefficiency are being allowed to perpetuate by a series of incompetent, inactive Ministers who do not seem able to grapple with the problems of their department. If the thrust of the appointment of this Committee is to divert attention from the Government it will not wash with the Democrats and I am sure that it will not wash with the people. </PARA>
<PARA> If the general health of the Public Service-I am using words from the Prime Minister's statement-is of the highest concern to the Government, why has it taken almost 12 months to deal with the proposed Public Service Acts Amendment Bill? It has been before us for 12 months. It is urgent. It is a crucial Bill for the morale and efficiency of the Public Service. I have issued a statement containing certain amendments that I propose to move after consultation with the trade unions of the Public Service. I understand that the Australian Labor Party will move amendments for similar reasons-to improve the Bill. But again the Bill has been taken off the business sheet. It has been on and off for 12 months. It came on last week-it appeared briefly on Tuesday and now it has disappeared again. Is the Government going to proceed with it? If not, why not? This is an area in which some consequential or significant improvements in the morale and health of the Public Service could be tackled. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the challenges, as described, facing the Public Service, are great, but they are not less than those facing private enterprise. Clearly there is a need to make management structures more flexible, more responsible and more participatory. There is hardly a need to establish an inquiry to do that. For decades private enterprise has worked towards greater worker involvement in management decisions, but in this activity the Government has chosen to disregard the experience of the private sector. It is true that our society has become more materialistic and some individuals more greedy. To what extent has the Prime Minister contributed to this with his confrontationist style and the economic and social policies of his Government which have tended to make the rich richer and the poor poorer?</PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the statement that the Government has basically a good Public Service-it has an excellent Public Service. I had a fair bit to do with it from time to time when I had the honour of administering 10 portfolios. There are still great men in the Public Service, men such as the late Sir Alan Carmody and many others-I single him out because I was close to him and knew of his loyalty, persistence, dedication and brilliant mind. One could mention many others-Sir John Bunting is another. Men of that quality are still in the Public Service. But I do not know when they see their Ministers these days. It is a catch-22 situation. The country is facing enormous problems on many fronts. I am sure that the efficient senior members of the Public Service have propositions to put to their Ministers to cure, or at least allay, those problems, but when can they see their Ministers? I understand that there is a continuous meeting of Cabinet in this building. I believe that one started last night at about half past eight and continued through the night until about midnight. </PARA>

<PARA> We agree with the terms of reference on page 4 of the submission.

Surely that is the weakest link disclosed by the recent scandal. The report of the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration is mentioned but the well- regarded and highly competent report of Dr Peter Wilenski, based on the New South Wales Public Service with general application, is omitted. As I have said before, we are pleased with members of the review, but again we express our disappointment that no member of the Public Service trade unions has been included. I notice that Mr Reid, who is a man of great action, has indicated to the Government that he plans to put down a report before the autumn session of Parliament.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V4">Senator COLEMAN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(1.01)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity of the first reading of the Dried Fruits Export Charges Amendment Bill 1982 to express my concern that a Minister in this place has made it quite clear on a number of occasions that he just does not understand at least part of his portfolio. I refer, of course, to the Min ister for National Development and Energy, Senator Sir John Carrick. I should like to think that perhaps he is just being poorly advised but I suspect that he just does not want to know about some issues that cause me some heartburn. I be lieve that he is guilty of making some of the most outrageous statements in this place regarding both thorium and monazite and the danger of both substances. Perhaps the only comparison I can make is with the Minister for Health in Western Australia. He seems to know as little about the subject as the Minister for National Development and Energy. Mr Jones, Minister for Mines in Western Australia, a colleague of the Minister for Health in Western Australia, Mr Ray Young, has indicated also that he knows very little about the subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recall that when I first raised in this place the issue of monazite mined at Capel-a newspaper report was published in Western Australia-one of the senior advisers to the Minister for Health in Western Australia made a ridiculous comment. Following my statement that, because high radio activity tailings had been used as a ramp at a dairy, perhaps it was possible that milk had be come contaminated, I was rather shocked to have a very senior official in the Department of Health tell me that cows do not eat monazite. I know that they do not eat monazite. I am rather surprised that the official obviously thought that they had to eat it for their end product to become affected. The Minister did not contradict him at that time and I do not believe that even to this day he understands that we do not have to eat monazite to be irradiated in some way; nor does a cow need to eat monazite in order to have its milk affected. I am reasonably certain that Senator Sir John Carrick knows that much but I am not sure that he knows a great deal more than that. </PARA>
<PARA> A few weeks ago-I am sure honourable senators will recall the occasion-Senator Mason stood in this place and spoke about the safe transportation of radioactive materials. At that time he raised the issue of both monazite and thorium. A little later on that same day Senator Sir John Carrick came back into this chamber. He apologised for not having been present when Senator Mason expressed his concern in relation to these matters but proceeded to answer some of the points raised by Senator Mason. He also said that at some stage in the future we should have a full scale debate on things nuclear. I should like to think that that opportunity will arise at some stage. One of the things that he said was this:</PARA>
<PARA> The short answer is that thorium in itself is not an explosive material. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement is almost true. Thorium does need to be processed before it becomes an explosive material. I quote Professor Phillip Jennings, associate professor in physics at Murdoch University. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Thorium is used in breeder reactors to produce uranium 233 which can be used in nuclear reactors or in nuclear weapons. Both the United States of America and Canada have researched this 'thorium cycle' and have pilot breeder reactors in operation using thorium as the breeding material. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have a situation in which monazite becomes thorium becomes uranium, for breeder purposes particularly. Therefore it can be considered to be a fuel and is recognised as a fuel. I will make this point later in my speech. In actual fact it was recognised in this country, as long ago as 1948, as being a nuclear fuel. It was banned from export because of that very reason. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Energy Advisory Committee, in report No. 2 entitled 'Australia's Energy Resources: An Assessment'-one presumes that this comes within the Minister's own Department-said this:</PARA>
<PARA> Thorium cannot be used directly as a nuclear fuel but is transmuted into uranium 233, a fissile material with characteristics similar to uranium 235. Increased demand could result if thorium is extensively used as an alternative material (instead of U238) in certain types of thermal reactors. </PARA>
<PARA>The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA>Prototype high-temperature reactors (HTGR) with thorium in their fuel elements are operating in the U.S.A. and in F.R.G. Several countries including Japan, have reactors using thorium at the planning or construction stage. The only commerical HTGR using a uranium-thorium fuel cycle commenced operation in late 1976 at Fort Vrain, Colorado, U.S.A. This reactor has a design capacity of 330 megawatts and reloads will require 3 tonnes of thorium annually. The use of thorium in other breeding systems is at an experimental stage, but the nuclear breeding characteristics of thorium and the nuclear fuel properties of uranium 233 are well understood. </PARA>
<PARA>I have already made the point that the Minister did not quite answer the questions raised when Senator Mason discussed those problems that he found with both monazite and thorium. Senator Sir John Carrick went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>There are no exports of thorium from Australia. I make that perfectly clear. Thorium is a component which typically contains around 6 to 7 per cent monazite.</PARA>
<PARA>I am prepared to accept that that was a slip of the tongue but it has appeared in Hansard. What the Minister actually meant to say was that monazite is a component which typically contains around 6 per cent to 7 per cent thorium, not the other way round. But I want to repeat the first part of the Minister's statement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There are no exports of thorium from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Once again I find that that statement is not quite true. Senator Mason was talking about the export of monazite. The Minister chose to talk about the export of thorium. Whether he was deliberately trying to confuse the issue or not is something I will not argue at this stage. The point is that the concern expressed was related to the export of monazite. The Minister said that we do not export thorium. No one has claimed that we do export thorium, but we do export monazite which typically contains 6 per cent to 7 per cent thorium. The Minister also said:</PARA>
<PARA> Monazite exports from Australia have been permitted under the Customs ( Prohibited Exports) Regulations only when the stated use of the monazite is for the extraction of rare earth elements, a non-nuclear use. </PARA>
<PARA>I am quoting directly from the Minister's statement in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Senate to an article in the Daily News on 10 August 1982. The banner line states: 'Western Australia in back-door nuclear deal'. The sub-heading states: 'A Daily News Inquiry finds a loophole in our safeguards treaty'. I do not intend reading the entire article but I will read excerpts from it. I seek leave to have the article incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA> And the Federal and State Governments say they don't know about it. Daily News investigations in Europe and Australia have uncovered the story of the nuclear fuel about which the public has not been told. </PARA>
<PARA> The cargoes are shipped from Fremantle through gaping holes in Australia's nuclear safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA> The fuel is thorium 232, which has been used in European nuclear power for more than 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> In converted form it becomes uranium 233 which could be used to make nuclear warheads. </PARA>
<PARA> The thorium comes from the radioactive mineral sand monazite, mined at Eneabba and Capel and shipped to France. </PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australia companies exporting monazite are Allied Eneabba, Westralian Sands Ltd, Associated Minerals Consolidated Ltd and Cable Sands Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA>As a little footnote and perhaps by way of rubbing salt into open wounds the articles states:</PARA>
<PARA> Allied Eneabba last year won a Federal Government export award for outstanding performances. </PARA>

<PARA> I repeat that the Minister said that there are no exports of thorium from Australia. He went on to say that monazite was exported only when the end use was a non-nuclear one. That newspaper report will show the Senate that the end use is not for the rare earth elements; the end use is to power a breeder reactor. Perhaps just briefly, to answer Senator Thomas' question, the reason, of course, is that something like 13 tonnes of thorium annually is needed to reload a nuclear power station whereas much more is required if uranium is used. That is part of the answer to the question asked by Senator Thomas. </PARA>

<PARA> The Western Australian companies exporting monazite are Allied Eneabba, Westralian Sands Ltd, Associated Minerals Consolidated Ltd and Cable Sands Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> Allied Eneabba last year won a Federal government export award for outstanding performances. </PARA>
<PARA> A political row is still rumbling on inside the ALP over future uranium deals with France, a non-signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> And senior officials of Euratom, Europe's monitoring agency on the nuclear industry, ducked Daily News questions on nuclear safeguard agreements with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Euratom's safeguards director is Mr William Gmelin. </PARA>
<PARA> When he was pressed on specific agreements between Australia and France over monazite deals, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> ''Please, I would rather not answer without making inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> ''Even then I may not be able to tell you.''</PARA>
<PARA> But the nuclear connection is clear. </PARA>
<PARA> It starts in France with the giant chemical company Rhone Poulenc. </PARA>
<PARA> The company extracts the thorium content from monazite. </PARA>
<PARA> The company has been selling the thorium under strict security to West Germany for use in two nuclear power plants. </PARA>
<PARA> Some Western Australian thorium is also used in a reactor in Colorado the French say. </PARA>
<PARA> And uranium extracted from the monazite is sold to the French Atomic Energy Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Monazite is a restricted export. The Federal and Western Australian Governments should know where the end product is going and its final use. </PARA>
<PARA> But they don't, they say. </PARA>
<PARA> Western Australian mine workers, rail workers and waterside workers do not know they are handling nuclear fuel. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Mines, Mr Peter Jones, told State Parliament on May 4 that he understood there was no current use of thorium for nuclear purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> But last week the Daily News saw hundreds of thousands of thorium-uranium fuel elements stockpiled in a West German nuclear fuel manufacturing plant near Frankfurt. </PARA>
<PARA> The thorium came from Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Three thousand tonnes of thorium have been extracted at Rhone Poulenc's La Rochelle plant, on the French Atlantic coast, since 1972. </PARA>
<PARA> Each year between one and two tonnes has been sold to the leading West German nuclear fuel manufacturing company, Nukem, near Frankfurt. </PARA>
<PARA> They make the tennis ball-sized thorium-uranium fuel elements used to power a 15-year old experimental reactor at Julich, near Cologne. </PARA>
<PARA> It supplies fuel for Germany's national electricity grid. </PARA>
<PARA> West Germany has poured $1 billion into a giant reactor which will use the thorium provided by Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In Colorado in the U.S. the St Vrain reactor runs on thorium-uranium fuel elements made by the General Atomic Company. </PARA>
<PARA> General Atomic has ordered thorium from Rhone Poulenc and two American firms.</PARA>
<PARA> In Paris, Rhone Poulenc's marketing development manager, Mr Phillippe Poirier, said the company was under no obligation to tell Australia what thorium was being used for. </PARA>
<PARA> That was a matter for the Australian monazite producers and the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The embarrassing possibility is that the Australian Government hasn't been told . </PARA>
<PARA> Senior trade commissioner at the Australian Embassy in Paris is Mr Rod Hall. </PARA>
<PARA> He took part in negotiations over safeguard agreements 18 months ago but did not remember any mention of monazite. </PARA>
<PARA> ''That's not to say it wasn't there. It may have been somewhere in the small print but I don't recall it,'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> ''It's an interesting one. You'd better check it out with Canberra.''</PARA>
<PARA> In Canberra, a Department of Foreign Affairs official said nuclear safeguards were ''basically primarily and exclusively directed at uranium. </PARA>
<PARA>Safeguards</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> ''No one is using the monazite for nuclear purposes.''</PARA>
<PARA> A Department of Trade and Resources official said: ''No country has yet succeeded in using thorium as a nuclear fuel-to our knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> ''There is no research work being done in this area.''</PARA>
<PARA> The official said that for nuclear safeguard purposes ''the mineral has to be cleared by chemical analysis, country of destination, name of end user, end use and quantity.''</PARA>
<PARA> Close contact between the French and Australian governments over nuclear power issues makes Australia's apparent ignorance over the thorium nuclear power link all the more astonishing. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is no doubt in the mind of Mr Yves Coupin, director of Gas, Electricity and Coal and the Ministry for Research and Industry in Paris. </PARA>
<PARA> He told the Daily News: ''Nuclear safeguard agreements between Australia and France deal purely with uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> ''We will need much more uranium from Australia and negotiations are now going on to bring this about,'' Mr Coupin said. </PARA>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V4">Senator COLEMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for that consideration. I simply make the point that whilst the Minister for National Development and Energy has said that we do not export thorium and we do not export monazite unless we know that it is wanted only for its rare earth elements, we actually find in the National Energy Advisory Committee report No. 2 the following statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The export of minerals containing thorium compounds and alloys is prohibited without the approval of the Minister for National Development. </PARA>
<PARA>So in fact he has been signing documents permitting the export of this material, which is highly volatile once it has been converted, in the belief-and he is still trying to convince the Senate of this-that the export of these mineral sands is only for their rare earth elements. In response to Senator Mason the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> Thorium ore such as monazite and thorium ore residue is not subject to International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards and the export of monazite is fully in accord with Australia's nonproliferation treaty. The IAEA Australian safeguards agreement would apply to thorium only if it were concentrated as a source material. </PARA>
<PARA>The article in the Daily News clearly indicates that when officers of Federal Government departments were questioned they said, and I must admit that State government department officers also said, that it did not come under any international or Australian safeguards. I mentioned earlier that monazite was banned from export as long ago as 1948. This also came out of the NEAC report No . 2, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1948 when thorium in monazite seemed likely to become important as a possible source of nuclear energy--</PARA>
<PARA>I stress the words 'nuclear energy'-</PARA>
<PARA>the Commonwealth Government banned the export of mineral sand concentrates containing more than 0.5 per cent monazite. </PARA>
<PARA>What we are talking about at this stage is mineral sand concentrates with 0.5 per cent monazite when in fact the monazite that is being exported contains typically, in the Minister's own words, 6 per cent to 7 per cent thorium. So we are now seeing a much more concentrated product being exported with the authority of the Minister for National Development and Energy. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, I have some doubts as to whether in fact the Western Australian State Government is prepared to do anything. I know darn well that the Federal Government is not prepared to do anything. Honourable senators will remember that in February this year I raised the problems that were being experienced with the high level radioactivity tailings from monazite mining in the town of Capel. At that time, in a question in this place, I was informed that it was not a Federal Government responsibility-it was a State Government responsibility. When I got back to Western Australia and I found the situation that had occurred there, I immediately, because it was a radioactive substance and because we are constantly being told that things nuclear come under the Federal Minister, sent an urgent telegram to the Minister requesting that the least that he could do was to have members of the Atomic Energy Advisory Committee visit Capel to establish what could be done in the best interests of the people who live there. The Minister responded that it was purely a State matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in the short time that has been available to me I have established that what we are talking about is not just monazite and not just thorium but a potential nuclear fuel for which we as the Federal Government are responsible. If the Minister for National Development and Energy adopts the same attitude as the Minister for Health in Western Australia, who is rapidly becoming known as the Minister for dangerous substances, all I can say is that the people of Western Australia as well as the people in the rest of this country will have to start applying a great deal of pressure to make sure that this Government comes up with the answers to which they are entitled. The answers should not be hidden away as they are-a fact that has been established by Ernest Sternglass in his book 'Secret Fallout-Low-level Radiation from Hiroshima to Three-Mile Island'. I would recommend that every member of the Senate take this book home and read it, except that I have the only copy available from the Parliamentary Library. It is worthwhile reading. I certainly suggest that the Minister for National Development and Energy should be the first to read it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is timely to make a constructive contribution on the subject of taxation. In that spirit I wish to take this opportunity of a first reading debate to speak on the potential of consumption expenditure as an alternative taxation base to income. Recent parliamentary debate on the report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union-the Costigan report-and recent media debate on retrospective taxation have again raised the whole question of the inequity of Australia's taxation system. This inequity was largely the subject of my first speech in this place a little over one year ago. I pointed to the disadvantage of the pay-as-you-earn taxpayer vis-a-vis the self-employed. I pointed out that this resulted from the emphasis in Australia on the taxation of income. Most forms of tax avoidance, therefore, rely on minimising income, as defined by the Income Tax Assessment Act, and accumulating wealth through a different channel, either capital or some other non-taxable or reduced-taxable benefit. From the very simple family partnership through to the most sophisticated scheme, that is the purpose. As a result, taxation of income has very much become a taxation of wages and salaries with an inequitable burden being placed on the PAYE sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Additionally, most forms of tax evasion involve non-disclosure of income. Perhaps the most significant area is in what is referred to as the cash economy. Morally, the recipient of goods or services obviously should not accept a 'lower price for cash' arrangement. However, it is difficult to condemn a PAYE taxpayer for doing so when he is already being inequitably treated by the system. In fact , he is, of course, simply compounding the problem. The evader particularly benefits because of the overemphasis in our system on income tax as compared with the majority of taxation systems in the Western world. A step in the right direction quite simply is a better balanced tax system with less emphasis on income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In February, in relation to last year's sales tax Bills, I argued the need for greater indirect taxes and less direct as a means of combating both tax avoidance and evasion. I said I would prefer a comprehensive indirect tax such as a value added tax but would support an extension of our more narrow indirect wholesale sales tax. The problem last year was that there were not corresponding reductions in income tax and therefore the legislation was not correcting an imbalance. This year with an increase in sales tax there have been reductions in income tax, and this restructuring I applaud. It is, however, only a start. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget also aimed to strike at the cash economy with a commitment from 1 July 1983 for a system of deducting at source an amount of tax in respect of certain payments for labour and services. It may reduce some evasion, not avoidance, and if I am right in saying that the cash economy thrives on small payments by parties who do not make those payments in the course of business, it might not be very successful. The discussion paper referred to in the Budget asserts that evasion is concentrated in certain areas, in particular industries, and that identification which is still going on will be published as soon as the examination is complete. I await that publication with interest. It will in no way, however, redress the bias in the system towards income tax and the damage thereby caused which I have more fully detailed on other occasions. Perhaps it is time for more dramatic change. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Peter Groenewegen believes that whatever the theoretical justification for a progressive income tax, its practical implication and operation has left it beyond repair. Writing in the Australian Financial Review in June of this year Groenewegen had no doubt about the state of the personal income tax system. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> My diagnosis of the problem is that the personal income tax is so sick in this country that it is beyond recovery. The patient's illness was induced, if I may continue the metaphor, because it was overworked. </PARA>
<PARA>If, indeed the personal income tax is so sick as to be beyond recovery, what alternative direct tax could be used? A number of major overseas studies undertaken in recent years have examined the feasibility of a direct consumption expenditure tax as an alternative to, or to operate in tandem with, existing systems of progressive income tax. It would be a comprehensive tax on consumer expenditure. In other words, the people would be taxed on what they consume or take out, not on what they produce or put into the stream of production of goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept is not new. It was supported by Lord Kaldor in his work 'An Expenditure Tax' in 1955 as more equitable and more efficient than income tax and not nearly as difficult to administer as often thought. He saw its history commencing with Hobbes 'Leviathan' 300 years ago, taken up by John Stuart Mill who saw income tax as a discouragement to thrift and enterprise and supported by such economists as Alfred Marshall, who saw it as a Utopian goal, and Irvine Fisher. It received revised interest when the United States Treasury put before Congress in 1942 a proposal for a progressive spendings tax as its principal suggestion for war finance. It was tried in a limited way in Ceylon and India but actual experience under modern conditions has been absent to date. In fact, Professors R. Musgrave and T. Musgrave in 'Public Finance in Theory and Practice ' were able to refer to it as 'still a new and exciting idea'. </PARA>
<PARA> It remained in the wilderness of taxation theory principally because it was considered too difficult a system to implement. Three major reports, however, have questioned that assumption. The United States Treasury report 'Blueprint for Basic Tax Reform' in 1977 and the United Kingdom's Institute for Fiscal Studies report 'The Structure and Reform of Direct Taxation' chaired by Nobel laureate, Professor Meade in 1978 both suggested that such a tax would be a feasible and desirable alternative to income taxation. At the same time, a study prepared for the Swedish Government Commission on Taxation, without reaching a final position, recommended that the Government continue the investigation of the expenditure tax as an alternative to income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, no such examination of the feasibility of implementing expenditure tax has yet taken place. Rather, proposals regarding taxation of consumption have remained locked into the consideration of indirect tax options. The failure of the existing system calls for a serious examination of alternatives, including expenditure tax. Under an expenditure tax system, taxation would be levied when the consumer utilises his income by consuming it. How then is income consumed calculated? Income would include the taxpayer's ordinary income received in the form of wage or salary, proceeds from the sale of assets, dividends, interest and loans. From that sum would be deducted purchases of investment assets such as shares or government bonds, outlays incurred in the earning of the taxpayer's income and net savings undertaken in that year. The net amount remaining would constitute the consumption expenditure or income consumed-that which the taxpayer has withdrawn from the pool of common resources-and would be liable for tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Many advantages are claimed for the expenditure tax. First, unlike most common consumption taxes which are indirect in their incidence and may reduce the relative tax burden of the wealthier sections of the community, expenditure tax is direct and, therefore, can be made more, less or just as progressive as our current system of income tax. Second, as the expenditure tax has a broader base, the income is treated more equally than under a progressive income tax. Income consumed and therefore taxed could, for example, have derived from capital assets. All consumption is taxed equally, irrespective of its origin. As such it is argued that the operation of the expenditure tax would lead to less distortions and complications than in our current income tax system. Third, contrary to income tax, expenditure tax maintains its neutrality in times of inflation as it automatically taxes real values of consumption expenditure--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Peter Baume" NAMEID="ME4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What does it do to inflation? Would you take that up?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take that up later. Fourth, the advantage most commonly cited in favour of expenditure tax is that saving is encouraged by being excluded from taxable consumption. Thus the double taxation of, say, savings bank accounts is eliminated. This, it is said, would enhance the possibility of increased personal and corporate savings enabling a greater flow of funds to financial institutions to be used for housing finance and investment activity. It is argued that it could help the social service system in that it helps those saving to help themselves. A growing income would enhance one's ability to provide for a time of retirement, illness or unemployment. Furthermore, because the tax treatment of investment and saving decisions is the same, a choice between different forms of investment and savings remains uninfluenced by considerations of tax effects, thus increasing taxation efficiency. I ask honourable senators to contrast that with the different taxation effect under our current law of, say, investment in a superannuation fund as opposed to a bank account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Fifth, it is argued that expenditure tax would counter tax avoidance. No form of general tax would fully eliminate avoidance schemes, but as I indicated earlier, a high proportion of avoidance derived under income tax arises from the difficulties of distinguishing income and capital items or from using tax shelters such as companies and trusts. Under an expenditure tax regime such opportunities would disappear. Sixth, personal income tax has an inevitable bias against fluctuating incomes. Progressive expenditure tax would not penalise the receipt of a large lump sum by, say, an author of a bestseller unless he spent his earnings all at once. So long as earnings were kept in the form of savings and only drawn gradually and steadily over a period, marginal rates could be kept quite modest. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it is argued that as a policy instrument an expenditure tax is a more effective means of implementing desired economic policy objectives. It would effectively govern levels of private consumption. Increases in expenditure tax rates would have the desired effect of increasing public revenues and encouraging private savings. It is said that income tax would require much greater rate changes for the same effect and that it has a less certain effect on consumption levels. Obviously, the system must have disadvantages or at least perceived disadvantages not to have been introduced at least in the more adventurous tax planning nations. One major and immediate difficulty would be that of educating the taxpayers as to the way in which an expenditure tax system works. It would require a different kind of thinking, especially as taxpayers have gained considerable familiarity with the workings of income tax. Professor Lodin suggests that the greatest difficulty in implementing an expenditure tax would be:</PARA>
<PARA> Getting the taxpayers to arrive at a proper understanding of the tax effects of , above all, their consumption behaviour and to take account of these effects in their economic planning. </PARA>
<PARA>There would be difficulties and problems in the operation of an expenditure tax. Imputed consumption such as housing and home grown food would have to be examined to determine whether it should form part of the tax base. An appropriate averaging scheme may be necessary in the case of housing so that prohibitive tax burdens are not imposed at the time of purchase. Similar considerations apply to long life consumer goods. How would outlays on education be classified? Would they be classified as consumption spending or investment spending? How would gifts and bequests be treated? Some argue that the definition of 'exempt saving', locating the boundary between consumption and investment, raises as many complexities and difficulties in drafting as exist in the distinction between capital and income. Nevertheless, from the point of view of equity, efficiency and as a policy instrument, a switch to expenditure tax appears to have much to offer as an alternative to our present income tax system . Evidence now appears to be mounting that its administration would not be nearly as difficult as first thought. Professor Groenewegen has urged those interested in tax reform to:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . base their decisions on a careful evaluation of the current tax system and an even more careful examination of the consequences of the alternatives on the basis of the most recent research available. </PARA>
<PARA>In the case of Australia that research, as I indicated, is not available. In this country there has been no significant study on the feasibility or desirability of such a tax. The present tax crisis is evidence that it is time to break away from conventional tax ideology and to broaden our tax vision. For the longer term future of taxation in this country research into expenditure tax would provide a desirable addition to the armament of the tax reformer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An hour or so ago Senator Chipp was speaking in the Senate and he drew attention in a general way to the state of confusion in which the Government finds itself, partly because of the many reefs and shoals that seem to beset it at the moment-largely of its own making, I might say-but also I believe because of a certain lack of will, a lack of ability, by the Government to perceive what the problems of the country are and to try to do something about them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this first reading debate on the Dried Fruits Export Charges Amendment Bill 1982 I want to draw attention to a subject I have mentioned before and which I think is very important; that is, the close association between the energy problems of the country and its unemployment problems. In other words, I wish basically to bring forward the thesis that if unemployment is to be controlled it will not be done by encouraging people to be trained in industries and occupations which are already overcrowded; it will be done by looking at new areas of activity and industry which are to the public benefit and, by doing that, making work for some of the people who are at present unemployed. This is not an original idea; it is being done in so many countries overseas that it worries me intensely that the Government of Australia has not yet got around to considering it as a serious proposition. I suggest that the Government, if it really wants to get back the goodwill of the people of Australia and to re- establish some faith in the processes of Government, should get to work on something like that, it should look at what is going on overseas, read the lessons and do something which would indeed-this has been proven; it is not just hypothetical-get many thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of Australians back to work. Indeed, as is happening in some countries, we might even get to the stage where there is virtually a labour shortage. It seems to the Australian Democrats that the Government is seeing the future through a telescope that is well out of focus-a myopic one-and that, as a result, its view is very vague and indistinct. It does not see any of the long term problems of the country and because of that it naturally does not see any solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment we are lulled into a false sense of security by the apparent world glut of petrol. I think all of us who appreciate the situation at all well understand that this will not last. It will be only a matter of a few years before we run out, in spite of the glut in production. The amount of petrol still underground is not increasing; it is diminishing rapidly. Every day that passes reduces the amount of oil that can be taken from our major field in Bass Strait. It is significant that the major rundown in production is only too likely to coincide with a crunch in the world supply situation towards the end of the present decade. If we want to do something about that we must do something now because of the lead times that are required to get that sort of industry into operation. For example, it takes some five years to get a methanol plant into operation. I think it will be much too late if we allow things to drift on until the end of the decade without doing anything about those matters.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is failing lamentably in this whole energy field. It persists, for its inscrutable reasons-I believe they are inscrutable-in involving itself more and more deeply with the discredited, uneconomic and dangerous nuclear power industry which we, of all countries, could very well do without. I think all Australians should be asking themselves what the reasons are. What reasons of money and influence determine this perverse policy of the Government? Why is it so concerned with only that area of energy? Why is it that so much money is being put into that area? The fact is that nuclear energy, and the manufacture of small, dirty atomic bombs of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki type, are very closely associated. Most of the countries now building so-called peaceful reactors-the ones which have not cancelled their orders-want them, not for power but to derive plutonium to make bombs. It is worth once again stressing the point that it is much easier and quicker to breed plutonium in a modern power reactor than it is to breed it in a fast breeder reactor. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator is speaking next. I will let him take up the matter then. I ask him not to take up my speaking time, if he does not mind. In the United States there is now a much wider and better vision. I was there some months ago and I was greatly reassured to find an almost general renunciation of nuclear power, which now is widely seen in that country as dangerous and completely uneconomic. I also found there a genuine practical effort to turn to other means. While there-I think Senator Jessop also had this experience-I visited the world's largest solar power station, Solar One, in the Mojave Desert, 50 miles east of Los Angeles. Its operations are automated and computerised to the extent that its needs, including maintenance, can be met by a staff of three. I think the point has to be made that solar technology has become very much more feasible in only the last few years because of the tremendous increase in microchip technology. It is now possible to automate these devices to an extent that was not before thought possible, and to do it much more cheaply than was previously the case. While the sun is shining-it does 10 hours a day on average at that location as it is a desert location, of which Australia has many-Solar One produces 12 1/2 megawatts of electricity, and on this daytime running it can provide enough power for some 6,000 households, which is quite good. At night a thermal storage unit comes into operation so that during that critical peak period in the evening the station retains surplus heat in the storage unit and goes on producing something like 7 1/2 megawatts during that peak period for the first four hours after the sun has set. That unit consists of nearly 7,000 tonnes of rock and sand and a quarter of a million gallons of a type of oil specifically developed as an efficient power exchanger.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A second and similar power station is being built nearby by a private enterprise corporation which is so confident that it has already contracted-I stress that it has already contracted-to supply solar power to California's major supply authority, Southern California Edison, at a lower price than power generated by burning fossil fuels. That is a notable breakthrough in the world. It is one which exists; it is there for everybody to see. It is private enterprise and justified purely in those terms. At that place I saw on the drawing boards, for other parts of the United States, plants of that type of up to 120 megawatt. In other words, they are beginning to approach in a single solar plant the sort of thing we so stupidly, as Senator Chipp said, are thinking of building in South West Tasmania. The technology is there; it is there for us to learn from. It is economic. </PARA>
<PARA> In Hawaii I found wind power being studied seriously. It is actually in use in many small-scale applications such as businesses and cattle ranches. I visited the largest of these generators, which is a joint National Aeronautical and Space Administration and Department of Energy project, which generates 220 kilowatts of power. It has functioned very successfully and, interestingly enough, operates most of the time quite automatically, without the need for any staff whatsoever. Plans are now in preparation for a much larger facility to take advantage of the trade winds in Hawaii-a wind farm of 20 machines which will produce a total of 80 megawatts. Here again it is comparable to this disastrous dam which is planned for South West Tasmania. The Government has those lessons there for it. The question has to be posed again: Why does it not do something about it?</PARA>
<PARA> We know, as I said earlier, that we are going to run out of our native oil in the Bass Strait field within a foreseeable time-not too much time. When that happens, especially if there is a world crunch, it will have the most severe effects possible on both the Australian standard of living and the level of unemployment. The troubles that we have now will pale into insignificance compared with the problems we would have if world affairs reached a stage in which a single shot fired one night in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabi, created an Iran-type revolution. If that happened in three or four years time, when our own crude oil supplies will have run down, we will be in very serious trouble indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> We wait in vain for the North West Shelf contract, to sell gas to the Japanese, to be concluded, but as yet, there is no sign that it will be. Should we not go back to the idea, proposed by Sir Mark Oliphant and others, of using our young unemployed in a vast imaginative project-such as that which Roosevelt implemented under the New Deal in the United States of America to pull America out of recession-the building of a pipeline across the continent to bring gas to the eastern States where probably it could provide fuel for many decades, if not centuries?</PARA>
<PARA> Could we not consider again doing what many other countries such as the Soviet Union, New Zealand and others, are doing-provide a plant to convert natural gas to methanol. This is an established technology. It is well known. It is not even expensive. It is a fact that methanol, produced as a petrol extender from such plants, would be cheaper than the present landed cost of Middle East crude. As more and more people understand that fact, it will be very difficult for the Government to apologise for its inadequacies and failure in that regard. The public will come to realise that we could have had a petrol extender which would have spun out our own resources in a major and practical way and would have been cheaper than what we would eventually be forced to buy. </PARA>
<PARA> We are already facing problems related to electricity supplies in many regions. These also must become worse as every year goes by; we know that. We had the problem earlier this winter and we had it last winter also. In the long run the only answer can be a determined effort to move towards conservation and the use of renewable energy resources. In this regard, I was quite alarmed to read a report in the Canberra Times of 26 August which quoted the Secretary to the Department of Science and Technology, Dr W. J. McG. Tegart as saying, in a paper to a chemical and physics congress in Canberra at the time, that the percentage of Australia's primary energy consumption provided by renewable resources was likely to fall slightly between now and the year 2000 from a present figure which he assessed as 4.5 per cent. If this is so, it is certainly regrettable, and completely out of tune with what almost every other nation in the world is doing. It is also a direct result of current Government policy not to encourage the use of renewable energy resources. The Government is condemned by its own words. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last Budget the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's Division of Energy Technology, the Division responsible for renewable energy resources, had its budget cut, in real terms, by 2 per cent. At the same time the CSIRO's Division of Energy Chemistry, the Division responsible for nuclear energy research, had its budget increased in real terms, so that the provision for combined nuclear energy research by that Division of CSIRO and by the Australian Atomic Energy Commission has been increased by 2 per cent, in real terms, for the coming year. I cannot understand why the Government feels it must continue this perverse promotion of nuclear energy while cutting back on research in the most vital area of renewable energy resources. I do not know whether Dr Tegart included in his figure of 4.5 per cent the very considerable energy contribution now being made in Australia by the use of solar hot water heaters. I suspect that he did not, since the resources he mentioned were said to be mainly hydro-electric power, fire-wood and bagasse. </PARA>
<PARA> The real point is that a quite slight change in Government policy would greatly increase the use of established technology in the solar hot water area. It would reduce not only our dependence on non-renewable resources but also would provide thousands of new jobs. This has been demonstrated over the last three years in California, where the Solarcal program established by Governor Brown on 3 May 1978 provides a State and Federal tax credit of 55 per cent of the cost of the installation and upkeep of solar hot water heating systems. Householders obtain a refund of 55 per cent of that amount. This has led to an enormous increase in that industry in California. By the end of this year the Solarcal Council expects that there will be 200,000 solar hot water heaters and 150,000 solar space conditioning installations in California-a tremendous leap. By 1985 this program is expected to save 15 per cent of the oil and gas which California would otherwise have imported. The other point is that California, a society comparable with our own-with 20 million people and much the same geographical conditions-expects to employ about 30,000 people at all levels of skill and experience. That does not take into account the downstream results which would occur, of course, in the metals area-an area in which we need new industries. Why does the Government not go forward in that regard? It could obtain from the California Energy Commission a well thought out and completely researched document which would prove beyond doubt that it is cheaper to subsidise such developments than it is to build new power stations using any other form of generated electricity. Conservation is the answer that the world needs. That can be seen abundantly clearly. It is why I despair so much of the Government. It seems to have an inability to see even the obvious things and do something about them. If such a scheme were introduced in Australia it would not only dramatically increase employment but also would increase it at an even rate throughout society in all Australian cities and towns, not only industrial centres. The building and installation of this established technology-solar hot water heating-is a local labour-intensive industry. It would also start a trend towards renewable energy which we all know must come, if we are not to take the strange lemming-like view which the Government has towards nuclear power and eventual deprivation of society through unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Government has accepted with deep gratitude an alarming and discreditable tendency in the Australian community to tolerate massive unemployment. It is part of the 'I'm all right Jack' mentality. We have the bizarre situation that although we have probably, all up-including those who do not want to say that they are unemployed-well over half a million unemployed, and women; those who are actually employed are well enough off. That is my final point. We can afford to do these things in society. It is only a government that does not have the guts or will to do so that is our problem. </PARA>

This is the first opportunity that I have had to respond in any detail and with the indulgence of the Senate, I seek to do so now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regularly visit Kununurra. It is an important part of my electorate, in its extreme north-east corner. I know a considerable number of people in that area. I also regularly meet with the people employed by the Department of Agriculture in that area. Some very dedicated people have been working there for many years. Also, many farmers went there in good faith when cotton was being produced quite successfully. Since the failure of cotton production, through no fault of their own-it certainly was not predicted by anyone involved-these people have found themselves in dire straits. Virtually anything will grow in the Ord River area, but since the failure of the cotton industry, the region has not been self- supporting. Some of the crops that can be grown in the area include sunflower, rice, wheat, sorghum, melons, ground nuts, soya beans, bananas and other tropical fruits, All of these will grow very well but most, if not all, suffer from high freight costs, lack of a profitable export market, cheaper competition from other Australian markets or pure economies of scale. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand the concern of the Queenslanders in the Senate about the potential of the Ord River sugar industry. I genuinely believe the Ord has the potential to be a much more efficient producer of sugar than have the existing areas of Queensland and north-east New South Wales. I do not blame the existing sugar producers for trying to maintain their cosy monopoly. I would probably try to do the same if I were in that situation, but I find it very hard to believe that the senior Australian Labor Party senator from Western Australia would try to condemn the attempts by the State Government and the people who live in the Ord River area to establish this new industry. Is it any wonder that Western Australia is represented by only four Labor senators? If they continue to adopt this attitude of condemning any potential new industry for their State, they will be forever restricted to that number, at the most. We have here a senator with a farming background-one of the few members of his party in this place who have any knowledge of farming whatsoever. To give him some credit, I guess he is the only Labor politician I know who, if he belonged to another party, would feel very much at home in that very important body, the 'Society of Modest Members'. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh is doing all he can to prevent his own State of Western Australia from creating a new industry, an industry that I believe would not need any taxpayer support if everything went well and would certainly need a lower level of taxpayer support than many of the other industries that are established in this country and which the Opposition repeatedly says need more support. I separated two issues from the early part of Senator Walsh's address. It was typical of the bitter, negative and emotional addresses that he normally makes in this place, so identifying two important issues was rather difficult. The first issue I found was that he said that the Queensland sugar industry is an ailing industry. The second point was that the Western Australian Government was irresponsible. He actually used words like 'sloth' and 'illiterate', as well as 'irresponsible'. </PARA>
<PARA> Can the Queensland industry be ailing if it has increased its production steadily since 1963 by a rate of 5 per cent a year? In 1963 it produced 894,000 tonnes of sugar and I understand that now it produces about 3.4 million tonnes. The sugar industry itself expects to produce five million tonnes by the year 1990. Can that be an ailing industry? Can it also be an ailing industry when it negotiates a shorter working week with its employees with very little argument at all, as happened recently? Even Senator Macklin, who also spoke on 19 August, admitted that just a few months ago international sugar prices were at their second highest level on record. I suggest that that cosy monopoly is about to be broken. I suggest also that some of the benefits will flow to Queensland. Perhaps then its industry will modernise some of its old sugar mills and reduce what I believe to be a high level of capitalisation. I happen to believe that monopolies are bad for any industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the second point, the irresponsibility of the Western Australian Government, I was three years old when a royal commission recommended that the Ord be classified as an area suitable for irrigation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do remember it well. I doubt whether any members of the present governments or either the Premier of Western Australia or the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Malcolm Fraser) had any part in the decision in the early 1950s to build a diversion dam, or even in the 1960s decision to build the main dam. I do not believe that anybody in those two governments had any part in those decisions. History can be the only judge of whether those decisions were correct. It is totally futile to try to make politics out of those two decisions . The fact is that we have a dam and we must try to make the most efficient and best use of it. Since the establishment of the Ord River irrigation system, successive State and Federal governments, both Liberal and Labor-I stress, both Liberal and Labor-have maintained their support for the Ord. Is it not typical of the Australian Labor Party to condemn the east Kimberley area to government dependency now, yet in July of this year, during the North Province by-election, all the Labor spokesmen supported a sugar industry there. Is that not amazing?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Walsh issued a challenge during his address. He issued that challenge to the Prime Minister, to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) and to the honourable members for Leichhardt (Mr Thomson), Herbert (Mr Dean) and Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). It was the typical scattergun approach that he tends to use. I think it is more relevant that a challenge be issued to the present honourable member for Kalgoorlie, Mr Campbell, and also to Mr Brian Burke, the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia, to Mr Ernie Bridge, the member for Kimberley, and to Mr Peter Dowding and Mr Tom Stephens, the members for North Province. I think they should be asked to say where they stand on a sugar industry for the Ord River area and where they stand in relation to what Senator Walsh and Mr John Kerin have been saying on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose the parliamentary Labor Party in Western Australia will continue to ignore Senator Walsh, as it usually does. What an embarrassment he must be to it . However, I think the people in the Kimberley area have a right to know where their member, Mr Campbell, stands on this issue. Is Mr Campbell going to help the area, which is a very important part of his electorate, by speaking out against John Kerin and Senator Walsh? Will he do that? I suspect not. I suspect he will continue with his normal track record and condemn and try to frustrate every attempt by the State Government of Western Australia and by the Federal Government of Australia to improve the situation and the living conditions of the people who live in his electorate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that the honourable senator came in here a little late. I did list the reasons why all the other areas of production tried have failed. When Senator Walsh said in his address that the figure of 20 tonnes of sugar per hectare should be discounted he was being selective again, in his usual way. He chose not to tell us that the average yield in some years has been as high as 26 tonnes to the hectare. He also failed to tell us that in all the calculations made by the State Department of Agriculture the figures have been discounted to accommodate the obviously higher figures that can be attained in a trial of this size. He also failed to mention that the trials conducted in the last four or five years in that area have been full scale commercial size trials , so the discounted figure used by the Department of Agriculture, discounted down from the conservative 20 tonnes per hectare, is a realistic figure. It has been discounted to between 70 per cent and 80 per cent, which I think is an extremely reasonable and realistic depreciation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Walsh also questioned the Department of Agriculture's figures on the infrastructure costs of establishing an industry in the Ord. I suggest that neither he nor I are in a position to challenge those figures. If Senator Walsh has those figures available I would like to see them. He again chose to ignore that sugar technology has advanced a great deal since the mills were built in Queensland and north-east New South Wales and that the Ord sugar industry would have the advantage of this new technology. I close by saying again that the people of the Kimberleys have a right to know where their Federal member stands in relation to the sugar industry in the Ord. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have almost been goaded into talking about sugar. I will certainly tell Senator Thomas where I stand in relation to sugar growing on the Ord. In fact, it had been my intention to say something along those lines when Parliament resumed. I remember that just before the Parliament resumed the honourable senator was in Queensland peddling his story about how we should be growing more sugar in the Ord. I do not know how he got a stamp on his visa to get out of the place. I think I might come back to sugar at some stage and tell the honourable senator a few home truths about the sugar industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Strange as it may seem, the Senate is actually debating the Dried Fruits Export Charges Amendment Bill. Because it is a Bill that the Senate is not able to amend we can speak on matters relevant or irrelevant to it. I mention that because sometimes people who take the time to read Hansard wonder why we talk about things that are not related to the Bill. I suppose sugar is a bit closer to dried fruits than the matter I am going to raise, but even the matter I raise will have something to do with the sugar and dried fruits industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to mention something that was outlined in the Budget and the effect that it is having on a great number of people and industries throughout Australia. When the Budget was brought down, the full impacts of some of the measures in it were not immediately felt or were not immediately evident to some people. However, since then the details of many of the parts of the Budget which on first blush did not look too bad and are now causing alarm to many people. We spoke only yesterday or the day before about increased rates of sales tax. Some people felt the brunt of those almost immediately, or within a few days of the Budget. There was the imposition of new sales taxes on items that did not previously attract sales tax. This is causing a lot of alarm. There is another matter on which I shall not dwell, which is causing alarm to many people, especially elderly people. That is the tax on bank transactions, which we have promised will be introduced from 1 January next year. We do not yet know the full details of this, but people are sufficiently concerned to be worried about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The main point on which I want to concentrate is the new policy in relation to excise on deisel fuel. On August 17 we were told in the Budget Speech:</PARA>
<PARA> Exemption of excise duty on diesel fuel is allowed at present for all use off public roads. </PARA>
<PARA>So up until 17 August the only people who were paying excise on diesel fuel were those who were using it on public roads, which meant that a great number of consumers throughout Australia were not paying the excise at all. But we were also told in the Budget Speech that this exemption had proved difficult to administer so as to prevent abuse. Because of that, the Government decided to throw the baby out with the bath water. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> As from tonight, all diesel fuel will bear the full rate of excise duty, irrespective of its end use. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, there were some exceptions. The Government said that it would-</PARA>
<PARA>introduce a system to allow users to claim rebates of this excise in respect of certain categories of off-road end use-broadly, domestic use, hospitals, nursing and convalescent homes and in the agricultural, mining, fishing and forestry industries. </PARA>
<PARA>So those industries or people who work within those categories using diesel fuel will be able to have a rebate of the excise that they pay. Despite the rebates for some users, many users will still pay the excise whereas they were not paying it previously. Because of that, I and, I am sure, many of my colleagues on both sides of the chamber have received many complaints from those who will now have to pay the excise. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that it is worthwhile to outline what this excise is. It is 5.155c a litre. But to be added to that is an extra 1c a litre, and that 1c a litre will be used to fund the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. I think that program probably has to be funded because of the paucity of funding that has been provided by the Federal Government up until now for roads. But that 1c brings the total amount to 6.155c a litre. One of the glaring examples where this has to be paid where it has not been paid previously is the State Government railways. In my State of Queensland, the railways will be forced to pay about $11m a year extra to the Federal Government because they now have to pay excise for diesel fuel. They must pass on these costs. There will have to be increased fares and increased freight charges. </PARA>
<PARA> I am surprised that this matter got through the Government parties when one of the partners in the coalition is the National Country Party. It will have a big effect on country areas. If freight rates are increased, this will affect country areas the greatest. What is ironic and what really galls the Queensland Railway Department and, I suppose, all other railway departments throughout Australia, is that part of the excise that they will be paying will be going to road funding. It just seems like something out of Alice in Wonderland when the Queensland Railway Department will now be paying about $2m a year to road funding throughout Australia. This additional impost of 1c a litre is to be increased next year to 2c a litre, so from then on the Queensland Railway Department will be paying about $4m a year to road funding.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons why it was decided that railways should not be an exempt category was outlined in the Budget Speech. The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> The concession--</PARA>
<PARA>That was the concession that excise did not have to be paid by those who were not using the diesel fuel on public roads--</PARA>
<PARA>also ensures certain competitive advantages, for example, rail transport as against road transport. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder whether the Government really thinks that there is any competition for some rail transport in Queensland. Can we visualise that all of the copper, the lead and all the other minerals from Mount Isa which are transported to Townsville would come by road rather than rail? There is no way in the world that road transport would be used. Similarly, it would be almost impossible to take all the coal from the coalfields of central Queensland to the eastern ports if one used road transport instead of rail. But one of the reasons why the concession was withdrawn from railway departments was said to be the competition between the two modes of transport. </PARA>
<PARA> The total bill for all of the railways throughout Australia is not known, but I calculate that the State railways will probably pay about $30m to $35m a year to the Commonwealth Government in excise on diesel fuel. I should like to give some figures on the diesel fuel consumption of the railways throughout Australia. They will give a clear indication that my calculations are correct. Queensland railways use 180 million to 200 million litres of diesel fuel a year. I could not get a more precise figure than that. I was told that the amount used depends upon the amount of traffic in a particular year, and 180 million to 200 million litres seems to be about the consumption. New South Wales railways inform me that they use 213 million litres a year, so the railways there will also be paying about $2m now and about $4m later on, just for road funding, in addition to the other excise on the diesel fuel. In Victoria, about 80 million litres are used; in Western Australia it is about 58 million litres; and in South Australia it is 10 million litres. It should be remembered that in South Australia all country services are a Commonwealth responsibility, and in Western Australia there are extensive private railways to which I have not referred. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall leave the matter of the State railways there, but I should mention that there are some other areas about which I have received considerable complaint because people will now be paying excise on diesel fuel whereas they did not do so previously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One such area is coastal shipping. This has a great effect on Queensland. Many areas in Queensland are serviced by coastal shipping, but now they will have to pay excise on the diesel fuel used. Local authorities are worried about what this cost will mean to them. I had a complaint from a brickworks which is using a lot of diesel fuel. The increased cost is considerable. That extra 6.155c per litre will result in extra costs for the brickworks and I presume that these will have to be passed on. This will mean extra home building costs and again the consumer will have to pay. I had a complaint from a person who has a dry cleaning establishment. He said that the additional cost to him will be considerable. I will read his comments because I think that honourable senators should understand the problems that these small businesses are facing. He states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To my knowledge the Dry Cleaning Industry has always been entitled to the Diesel Fuel Rebate for Diesel used solely for steam raising. I believe that the withdrawal of this entitlement as announced in the Budget on the 18th August, 1982 is most unjust. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase (6.155c per litre) coupled with the increase of 2 1/2 per cent Sales Tax on all items used by the industry will necessitate dramatic increases in prices to the consumer. As our prices are forced to rise consumer resistance increases, volume of work decreases. Consequently employees may be stood down and the community will have to pay greater unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>The writer of the letter went on to make other points but I will leave it at that. However I will highlight some of the problems that were mentioned in those two paragraphs. The person who owns this dry cleaning business pointed out that there is a great increase in the cost of the fuel that he will use. An extra 2 1 /2 percentage points in sales tax will be levied on any of the items used by the industry. He also points out that because the volume of his work will decrease, he is liable to stand down employees and we will have a greater pool of unemployed. I wonder, when I read such statements, whether the Government thought through all of the consequences of what would happen when it imposed an excise on diesel fuel. People who use diesel fuel did not even have an inkling that this was about to happen; so they did not have an opportunity to change to an alternative fuel if that was available. </PARA>
<PARA> I could talk at length about where increased sales tax is having a disadvantage . A moment ago Senator Macklin mentioned bakeries. I think that we have all received representations from the tourist industries. I would like the Government to take stock of what it has done, have a look at the sorts of industries that are going to be disadvantaged by this policy change and see whether it can redress what it has done to some of these industries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under the circumstances that is very gracious of the Government and I appreciate it. The documents tabled yesterday were damning enough for reasons that I will summarise in a moment but they would be even more damning if they contained all the items for which the Opposition asked and not just a politically sanitised selection of them. I remind the Senate that of the 22 documents or sets of documents that were sought in my Notice of Motion No. 168, we have received only eight. Of those 22 documents, 14 were in the form of opinions or advice of one kind or another but only three of those kinds of documents have been tabled. Whether there is any credible basis for the denial of access in respect of those documents is something that I will deal with in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The documents that have not been supplied are set out in the amendment which has been circulated in this chamber and I will not spend time going through them . They are set out in a slightly different order. They deal with the Brinsden Q. C. opinions, the Traill and Lockhart opinions and so on. They include all of the documents that were on the list in my notice of motion plus one additional item, No. 12 on the current list-the report of senior investigation officer Todman which was inadvertently omitted from my notice of motion. It is a document which has been referred to in the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. I am sure that it is a document with which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) would be well familiar and on which the Government would have had an opportunity to form an opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that although many other documents are missing from the purportedly complete file that we have been given and in respect of which we may well need, after considering these matters over the next few days, to move yet further motions-I refer to replies, attachments and enclosures, the existence of which is revealed by the main documents in the file in question-there are two main categories of missing documents. In terms of what we are asking for previously they are these: In the first place what is missing are opinions, mainly from distinguished Queen's Counsel, which in the view of Mr Costigan were persuasive arguments for the adequacy and availability of existing legal remedies. The second class of documents which are missing covers opinions, memoranda of advice and documens of that kind which, in the opinion of Mr Costigan, were inadequately argued statements of the case against the availability of such legal remedies. When one sees that, of all the hundreds of pages of documents that have been tabled, those are the kinds of documents to which we have been refused access, it becomes very obvious indeed that the Government has something to hide. It is already obvious that the Government is profoundly embarrassed by the revelations that do appear in the documents that have already been tabled. Those documents reveal a number of very embarrasing things which I will briefly attempt to summarise. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, as far back as July 1977 the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the then Treasurer and Sir Phillip Lynch were aware of Slutzkin type tax schemes involving sales of companies with current year profits. Secondly, as early as January 1978 the Treasurer, Mr Howard, knew enough about pre tax profit stripping to propose legislation for the 1978 Budget sittings to combat it. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the documents reveal that on as many as 18 separate occasions, between 20 February 1978 and 12 November 1980, the Commissioner of Taxation pleaded with the Treasurer and the Government to take urgently needed legislative action against company stripping or bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Fourthly, they reveal that there was extensive and very frank and detailed correspondence between the Commissioner of Taxation and the Treasurer and, to a lesser extent, the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), in relation to the problem of bottom-of- the-harbour or straw company tax evasion which shows that the attempts by those Ministers to invoke section 16 secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act in their defence was no more than a cynical ploy to avoid accepting responsibility. There is an extraordinary amount of detail as to the nature of schemes and the nature of particular kinds of stransactions which appear in these documents, and the section 16 excuse is revealed starkly in these documents for the nonsense that it is. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, the documents reveal that at no stage prior to the introduction of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980 in November 1980 was any serious consideration given by the officers advising the Treasurer and the Federal Commissioner of Taxation to the question of the adequacy of existing law as a basis for prosecuting tax avoiders. There is no evidence whatsoever in any of the numerous minutes or accounts of meetings of that informal interdepartmental committee which was established from mid-1978 onward to deal with these matters and to advise the Treasurer about legislation-not one iota of reference-until the end of 1980, to the adequacy or otherwise of the existing law. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixthly, the documents reveal that in direct conflict with the Treasurer's public statement on 27 June 1982 no advice as to the adequacy of existing law was given by those officers to the Government before the decision to proceed with the new legislation was made. Seventhly, there was a delay of seven months between the Treasurer's request in December 1978 and the advice he finally received from the Attorney-General regarding one very central and important aspect of the proposed new legislation, that seven month's delay being until the Attorney-General finally got around to replying in July 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> Eighthly, the documents reveal that the despair of the Federal Commissioner of Taxation, Mr O'Reilly, reached the point were by November 1979, in his letter on 7 November, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Unless something effective is done along the lines proposed, we may almost as well not bother with anti-avoidance legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Ninthly, the documents reveal that the primary cause of these delays was the Treasurer's craven weakness in the face of pressure from his own Liberal back bench, from Liberal Party supporters in the business community and from the Government's own appointed taxation advisory committee and his complete inability in the face of opposition from those quarters to show the necessary political leadership to steer through this urgently needed-in the Government's own view-legislation before the taxation problem got out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the documents reveal that at the end of the day the Government's own advisers, despite all the neurosis about the evidentiary effectiveness of the new provisions that they were drafting and where the onus of proof and so on should reside, retained enormous doubts about the efficacy of the law that they had so laboriously, over a period of nearly three years, drafted. That is revealed in the memorandum that was in fact tabled originally in this place on 4 December and which appears in these documents. At the very end of the memorandum in question, which is covered by a letter from the Commissioner of Taxation, the officers in question say:</PARA>
<PARA> Even with the enactment of the present Bill, which is addressed directly to countering these activities, it can be expected that the evidentiary burdens on the prosecution in proving its case beyond reasonable doubt will prove to be very substantial indeed. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have a revelation in these documents that the Government's officers in the Australian Taxation Office, the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and all the other areas that were consulted, retained grave doubts as to the efficacy of the 1980 legislation upon which they are now hanging their hat. Of course, that may be one reason why there have not yet been any prosecutions under the 1980 legislation, even though we now know that there are at least nine cases in respect of which substantial evidence exists to justify such a prosecution, as revealed in the Estimates Committee hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> So on all those fronts the Government has found itself embarrassed by what is actually in these documents. Now, in addition, for it to be nakedly revealed that during the period in question the Government had strategies open to it under existing law-that it could have actually prosecuted under existing law but it did not; that it could have run civil proceedings to recover the taxes in question but it did not; that it did have well and cogently argued opinions and memoranda from leading counsel and others saying that such proceedings could proceed; that it did not have well and cogently argued opinions and memoranda arguing the contrary, just a series of bleating ex post rationalisations from senior officials to justify their inaction-for all of that now to be nakedly revealed, as it would be if the documents we are seeking were now to be tabled, would really drive the last nails into the coffin in which the credibility of the Government on this issue now lies. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no wonder that the Government does not want the truth to come out. It is no wonder that the Government has sterilised and sanitised these documents to the extent that it has. It is no wonder that it has tried to create by this snowstorm of largely irrelevant documents the impresion that it was engaged in a frenzy of activity, struggling with difficult, almost intractable, conceptual problems during the nearly three years that were involved in drafting the new legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not satisfied with the claim that these documents have already been scutinised by the Solicitor-General. We are not satisfied about the filtration process that has, on the Government's own word, already taken place. As I will say again in a moment, the Solicitor-General is an officer whose legal ability we very highly respect. I am on record speaking about his ability and no doubt I will be quoted to that effect in a speech later in these proceedings. Let me tell the Senate why I am not satisfied-I believe and hope that the majority of honourable senators will not be satisfied-with the process of sanitisation, of sterilisation, of filtration that has occurred so far with the process that is described in the tabling statement on page 2 about the Solicitor-General's personally examining each of the documents in question and advising the Government that certain of them should not be tabled on the ground that public disclosure would be harmful to the administration of justice, in some cases would cause harm to those who may be prosecuted or proceeded against or to the cause of the complainants themselves, the further point being made that the injury would not in the Solicitor-General's view be avoided by excising names.</PARA>
<PARA> This is the basis on which the sterilisation process, the editing process, has so far proceeded. Why are we not happy with that? Let me tell the Senate why we are not happy. In the first place it is the case that the Solicitor-General, on the evidence of the ministerial tabling statement, has not confined himself to the application of the single criterion that he was requested to apply in the terms of my motion; namely, prejudice to any pending criminal or civil proceedings. He has clearly taken into account or been asked to take into account other criteria; namely, the impact of public disclosure on the general administration of justice or the impact of disclosure as far as the position of individuals is concerned. I do not know, we do not know how much weight was given to those criteria as distinct from the criterion of prejudice to pending proceedings. I do not know, we do not know, what other unstated criteria, might in fact have been applied. </PARA>
<PARA> My second point is that to the extent that the Solicitor-General was applying and properly applying some criterion of prejudice to pending proceedings, it has simply not been explained how that prejudice is likely to occur in relation to the documents that have not been produced. It has not been explained how that prejudice is greater in respect of the untabled documents than in respect of those documents that have been tabled, many of which obviously refer to particular cases, including the Perth case, and many of which obviously refer to the general legal strategy which may well now lie behind any such attempts that might be made to engage in legal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point is that, to the extent that it is claimed that the release of these documents would be harmful to individuals and to the extent that the Senate might be minded to treat that as a relevant criterion although it is not one that was set out in the terms of my original Order of the Day, it has simply not been explained how individuals could be harmed if their names and other identifying characteristics were removed, as was readily accepted to be appropriate in the Order of the Day and as has in fact been done in respect of a very large number of the documents that have been tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth reason why we do not accept the censorship process that has gone on so far is that to the extent that it is implicit in the claim made by the Government purporting to reflect the views of the Solicitor-General that the documents that are being totally withheld cannot be sanitised or cannot be partially edited and the whole document must be withheld from publication, it has simply not been explained how it is impossible for these documents to be partially edited in a way that it was not possible for other documents that have been produced to be partially edited. In other words, there is no evidence whatsoever as to the basis on which it is claimed that the process in respect of the documents which have been totally withheld could not have been done in exactly the same way as it was in respect of those documents which have in fact been put on the table. </PARA>
<PARA> So we say this: The filtering job that has been done has not been done in a way with which the Senate can now rest content. We believe that it can be done only by someone who is totally independent of the Executive Government and yet in whose competence and experience to make these kinds of judgments about prejudice the Senate can have full confidence. On Senator Harradine's suggestion we accept that the appropriate person to make this judgment, to perform this editing process, is Mr Costigan himself. If the Government might be minded to say that it is inappropriate for Mr Costigan to perform this role or if the Government might be minded to say that Mr Costigan should not be doing this consistently with his charter, I will simply ask the Government whether it takes that view about getting Mr Costigan to investigate the affairs of Mr Horgan, which it has been very keen in the last 48 hours to confer upon him as yet another particular mantle that he is to wear, appropriate to, consonant to, the general terms of reference that he is exercising. Obviously the task here to ensure that prosecutions will not be prejudiced by anything that goes on to the public record is one that Mr Costigan is enormously well-equipped to perform, totally familiar as he is with these particular documents and, presumably, totally committed as he is to ensuring that those who have been in breach of the law will be brought to justice. </PARA>
<PARA> We make it clear, finally, that we make no suggestion whatsoever that the Solicitor-General, Sir Maurice Byers, is in any way politically biased in the judgments that he may have made about the status of these particular documents. I do suggest that he may have erred on the side of caution in protecting information, in protecting documents in the hands of the Executive Government of the day. He may have erred in this respect on the basis of his well-known personal views about the proper extent of Executive privilege, the proper extent to which Executive information should be made available to the public. It will be recalled that Sir Maurice Byers, as Solicitor-General, took a very strong view on this particular issue, which he stated to be one of principle, at the time of the loans affair in 1975 when he was brought before the Bar of the Senate to give information, which he refused to do on these grounds. In taking that position in 1975, he did not go without significant criticism from the Opposition benches for the very strong view he took as to the extent to which these matters ought to remain outside the public domain. Simply, I suspect, by his attitude and by the very rigorous censorship process which he seems to have applied with respect to these documents, he is, I believe, simply being consistent with the attitude he took on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is appropriate for someone totally outside the apparatus of full time Executive Government, someone who is not an officer in any sense, statutory or otherwise, of this Government, to perform this particular task. It is only by the documents in question being looked at, by a process such as that, and those documents, after they have been filtered, and screened, being put into the public domain so that we can see for ourselves in particular the quality of the Crown Solicitor's memoranda and letters of April 1979 and late in 1980 and the quality of the legal opinions that were in circulation about the extent to which legal action could be taken, that we will be able to make a responsible evaluation as to where the real blame lies for this extraordinary debacle in the history of Australian public administration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this month the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union exposed some sections of the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth as being, at the very least, inept and inefficient, and at the worst, guilty of encouraging, simply by doing nothing, certain illegal tax evasion schemes. The documents that are before us today-a set of documents which do not bear a great deal of resemblance to the documents that were asked for by the Senate some weeks ago-chronicle an equally sorry saga of dithering, timidity and stalling by Ministers and some departmental officers. In addition, the talkathon and the paper war which developed between the years 1977 and 1980 reveal a rather unfortunate rivalry between some departments, notably the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Attorney-General's Department and the usual conflict of opinion, of course, that exists whenever more than one lawyer gets involved in anything.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The documents consist of a series of not-always-legible letters, minutes, memoranda, opinions, Press releases and so on, in more or less chronological order. They were not, unfortunately, the easiest of pieces of paper to find one' s way around or to get information from. The documents do, however, outline collectively a story of burgeoning tax avoidance at best, and evasion at worst, interspersed with some plaintive cries from the heart of the Commissioner of Taxation complaining about staffing inadequacies. The papers demonstrate just how long government decisions can be prolonged by ministerial dithering, by Cabinet jitters, by understaffed departments, by requests for outside opinion after outside opinion, by government actions, which varied in this case from requesting urgent action for legislation to deciding to introduce that legislation on the last day of a session, so that it would have to lie around for a while for discussion-all of which simply allowed by default the development of a massive tax evasion industry and the formation of a situation costing the Government, and hence the taxpayers, what the Commissioner of Taxation indicated were millions of dollars per month. And all of this, despite the fact that as has already been pointed out, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the then Treasurer, Mr Lynch, as he then was, knew at least as early as 1977 of the schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> In a letter to the Treasurer, dated 13 February 1978, the Commissioner of Taxation makes the point:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that the Prime Minister has recently expressed a renewed interest concerning a number of current tax avoidance practices that last July were drawn to his attention by an individual outside the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, it was expressed by the Commissioner on 20 July 1977 that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has asked that the documents be examined most urgently. He has expressed the view that, if the schemes are correctly described, appropriate amending legislation should be introduced into Parliament at the earliest possible date. </PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately for the Commissioner of Taxation, he felt constrained somewhat by what he pointed out as being the fact that:</PARA>
<PARA>We are spread very thinly with officers who have the necessary background and aptitude to develop anti-avoidance and other tax legislation. Any attempt to take on too much at any one time can be counter-productive. </PARA>
<PARA>Nowhere following his comment of that date has there been any indication that action was taken by anybody at all to provide more staff and, indeed, more specialised staff. In fact, of course, as we all know, the razor gang acted at some stage to cut down the number of staff in the office of the Commissioner of Taxation, to what end we are already aware. </PARA>
<PARA> By May of 1978 the Commissioner of Taxation was questioning the legality of the schemes under existing law. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I am led to suggest that what is needed is the creation, under the tax law , of a criminal offence of company or trust stripping so that the company or trust cannot meet its tax liability. </PARA>
<PARA> In making this suggestion I mention that officers have been pressing the Crown Solicitor to investigate whether prosecution action could be taken under the Crimes Act or the Companies Act against people involved in two cases of 'straw company' evasion. Despite the possibility that such prosecutions may be able to be launched I think that a specific taxation offence of the kind indicated should exist. </PARA>
<PARA>But concern at the increasing number of such schemes had reached what could be determined panic proportions in the Taxation Office. On what looks to be page 125 of the document, in which the page numbers are in the most extraordinary sequence, reference is made to straw companies. This comment is made:</PARA>
<PARA> In some of the trust schemes referred to above the trustee may be a $2 private company and may not have sufficient assets under its control to pay the tax. This touches on a now-serious problem encountered in other contexts involving the inability to collect outstanding tax payable by companies. </PARA>
<PARA> In a growing number of cases-the taxation office in Adelaide alone has reported 30 of them--</PARA>
<PARA>This, I might add, was on 24 May 1978--</PARA>
<PARA>profitable companies have been acquired by promoters and stripped of their assets, in what amounts to an informal liquidation, leaving no funds in the company by the time it is assessed to pay the tax clearly payable by it. In the meantime, the profitable operations of the stripped companies have been continued by other companies. </PARA>
<PARA> The people who are made owners of the stripped companies are themselves men of straw. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact that reference to the T. S. Eliot poem may be continued when we realise that the whole thing has in fact ended not with a bang but with a whimper. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA> If legislation imposing tax, and legislation to counter tax avoidance, is not to be frustrated by such evasion--</PARA>
<PARA>And the Commissioner underlined the word 'evasion'--</PARA>
<PARA>it may be necessary to introduce an effective penal sanction against people who employ these techniques . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, it is further recommended that officers of the Attorney-General's Department and the Australian Taxation Office be asked, as a matter of urgency, to examine this matter and, if found appropriate, to draw up proposals for the introduction into the income tax law of an appropriate criminal offence against stripping of companies and trusts to evade payment of tax that is legally due. </PARA>
<PARA>That matter of urgency was raised on 24 May 1978. Despite the increases that were referred to in that memorandum, the urgency apparently expressed by the Prime Minister in July 1977 had diminished somewhat by the middle of 1978 when the Commissioner was constrained to write in a memorandum to the Secretary of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs:</PARA>
<PARA> Submission No. 2290 of 6 June 1978, agreed that officers of this Office, the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs examine as a matter of urgency the problem of tax evasion through '' straw'' companies and trusts, and prepare, if appropriate, a Submission on the question of introducing into the income tax law an appropriate criminal offence against the practice. Ministers have directed that any implications that there may be for company law be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Submission has been before Ministers for some time does not, in my view, detract from the urgency of the matter. It is important that there be the speediest examination and resolution of the problem. Legislation to counter tax avoidance schemes and arrangements will be of limited effectiveness if ''straw company'' evasion is not checked in some way. </PARA>
<PARA>By October 1978 the Taxation Office had, as expressed in its memorandum, 'drawn up draft legislation as an aid to firming up our thoughts'. Questions of the onus of proof were being raised, as were definitions of 'director', 'knowledge', 'actions', and things like 'aiding and abetting' and 'conspiracy to defraud'. While the lawyers argued about these, officers of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Attorney-General's Department were apparently circling somewhat warily around each other to the probable detriment of a speedy solution to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> By November 1979 there was still doubt about whether existing legislation was adequate to prosecute and the Commissioner was attempting to soothe troubled Ministers by pointing out:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . while the words are different and the proposed tax measures more elaborately drawn, those measures do not in principle break ground that the company law has not already touched. </PARA>
<PARA>Why the Minister should still have been troubled, in view of the comment a year earlier from the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, is beyond my comprehension. This point was made in that comment of 16 November 1978:</PARA>
<PARA> The evidence that is disclosed in the draft Cabinet submission indicates that a very serious fraud on the revenue is being carried out through straw companies and trust tax evasions and that the potential for more wide spread abuse is also very real. There is, therefore, an urgent need for an effective deterrent against this form of abuse. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet, at least some of the Ministers still appeared to have been troubled by what form the legislation was to take, who was to be challenged under it and what definitions were to apply. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1979 the Commissioner made this further point:</PARA>
<PARA> I continue to receive indications from our State offices that the problem of ' straw company' and 'straw trust' evasion is already very serious and is growing. It is my considered advice that the situation needs to be remedied urgently and with stern measures. I accept the opinion of the Crown law officers that the evidentiary aid would generally assist the prosecution case although I do not underestimate the evidentiary problems that will remain. Those problems have to be weighed against the consequences for a person who is convicted and there is something in the view that people will be reluctant to risk gaol or the heavy fines proposed once the Government has expressed in legislation its resolution to stamp out these practices. </PARA>
<PARA>As late as 7 November the Commissioner had written a particularly strong letter on tax evasion to the Treasurer which said in part:</PARA>
<PARA> I am gravely concerned to hear that there may be some question about going ahead with the planned legislation on this matter, the nature and level of penalties proposed being, I understand, a source of difficulty for some of your colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to make a series of points which emphasised the criminal and fraudulant nature and the extent of and the cost to the Government of the activities. Yet, the Government lurched on, often appearing at times to be taking one step forward for every two steps it took backwards. Therefore, instead of legislation being passed in the Budget session of 1979 the matter was referred to the Taxation Advisory Committee which consisted, for the most part, of accountants. I am not arguing that those gentlemen had anything to hide or that they were other than people of absolute integrity. But they certainly must have had at least some interest in the outcome of any tax avoidance legislation that was passed. As they appeared to be involved with companies they could not have avoided being asked by their clients about the best way of at least minimising their taxation. It is almost impossible to avoid asking what those accountants who made up the Taxation Advisory Committee should have been expected to produce which could not have been done at least as well by the combined forces of the Taxation Office, the Treasury, the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and the Attorney-General's Department. One's concern, if one had been moved to ask that question, would have been proven justified by the comments made on the outcome of the TAC inquiry by the Australian Taxation Office in June 1980. Points 43 and 66 of the memorandum indicate some disturbing elements. Point No. 43 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the TAC--</PARA>
<PARA>alternative would, even in the areas it purports to cover, not offer an effective solution. </PARA>
<PARA> On its face it is only a partial one. </PARA>
<PARA>Several pages further on paragraph 66 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The draft Bills--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the draft Bills put forward by the TAC--</PARA>
<PARA>do not attempt to address themselves to tax avoidance in any form. They are not aimed at Slutzkin-type arrangements-arrangements under which tax-paid company profits are liberated tax-free to vendor shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA>For something like six months there had been a delay while the Committee looked at the whole problem of tax avoidance and evasion. It then came up with recommendations which did not even face up to the problem which they had been asked to look at. The overwhelming evidence contained in the papers before us indicates that for a variety of unspecified reasons the Government has been stalling over, first, the introduction of questionably necessary legislation and , secondly, its implementation. Indeed, I point out that, at least so far as I am aware, no prosecutions have been made under the new Act in the two years since it came into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Some comment, if not actual criticism too, must be made of the Commissioner of Taxation, who appears, on the surface at least, to have been somewhat too ready to accept the advice of the Crown Solicitor without questioning it and/or too timid to instigate any sort of test case on the information he already had of the existence of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. The question remains: Why did it take the Government so long to crack down on a scheme or a series of schemes which were costing the taxpayer so much in lost revenue? It has been put to me on a number of occasions in the past week that the Government should have some moral duty, if it ever gets around to collecting that lost money, to hand it back to the people who suffered in the first place, that is--</PARA>

There ought to be some way in which the Government can return to pay-as -you-earn taxpayers the money they were forced to provide to supplement the lack of money coming from tax avoiders. The answers to the questions about why it took the Government so long to do anything can be obtained only through the tabling of the documents that the Senate asked for originally, 14 or so of which were not included in the hefty volume before us. They were not included on the rather cautious reasoning of the Solicitor-General that they may impede future prosecutions. I put it to the Senate that surely it is not beyond the combined forces of all concerned to sanitise the Government's dirty linen sufficiently for the missing papers to be brought before us without ruining the outcome of whatever future prosecutions the Government manages to find the energy to undertake. Surely we can find a dry cleaner who is acceptable to all sides of the chamber and who can quickly delete those parts of the still outstanding documents which may inhibit future prosecutions so that this whole unsavoury affair can come to a swift and, one hopes, satisfactory conclusion in the very near future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we do not get those documents and if the Senate cannot make up its mind through the provision of written evidence from the Government about what has been going on since these schemes were first mentioned as far back as 1973, our only real alternative is to take the rather drastic step of calling before the Bar of the Senate those public servants who may be able to tell us what has been going on. That is an action which is, as I said, drastic and one which my party certainly would be loath to support. Nevertheless, we may have to resort to that action in the last instance because of some squeamishness on the part of this Government. It is certainly a move not to be taken lightly. It is for that reason that we support the Labor Party's amendment to the motion. We hope that the Government will act in accordance with it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is reviewing those documents which have been tabled in response to Senate notice of motion No. 47 concerning straw companies and the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980. In reviewing those documents, which have been in the hands of honourable senators for only a short 24 hours one finds that already, partial though they be, the Australian public has come to its own conclusions as to what those documents reveal. In the headlines of today's Press throughout Australia-the same can be said of the electronic media-revealed in the most graphic form are the conclusions of the most able political commentators in this country on the contents of those documents. What has been suspected by the Australian people for so many years has been definitively, though not finally or fully, revealed. In the Australian Financial Review one reads the headline 'Extraordinary Government History of Inaction'. In the Sydney Morning Herald one reads the headline 'Government inaction on tax lurks dates to 1977'. On page 2 of that journal another headline states 'Cabinet blamed for delay in tax bill'. In the Australian, hardly the most radical journal of left wing politics in Australia, one reads the headline 'Moves on tax cheats blocked by ministers'. Finally in the Daily Telegraph-I am giving only a sample of headlines-today's headline states 'Tax scandal: PM knew five years ago'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the most damning and comprehensive indictment of the monumental lethargy of this Fraser Ministry in the face of the tax rip-off of the last decade. It has gathered force under the lethargic patronage of this Cabinet led by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). What is important to note in the documents-this had been adverted to in those headlines to which I have referred- is that, whilst the Australian Taxation Office itself may take some comfort from the vigorous letters written by Mr O'Reilly, it is quite clear that the Ministers responsibile for protecting the revenue and for enforcing the laws of the land were derelict in their duty. Not only is that revealed but also, for the first time, it is revealed that the Prime Minister failed to take those adequate robust steps which should be expected from the leader of a country whose revenue is being defrauded to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars- a matter in respect of which he had some information back in 1977. Let us not forget for one moment that we are talking about the defrauding of the revenue to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars by those people engaged in tax avoidance schemes-those social parasites and tax bludgers who, because of their activities, required the ordinary Australian PAYE taxpayer to bear a much larger tax burden year after year than should have been the case. The evidence is extremely clear from this documentation. The Ministry at no time sought to invoke the existing law against conspiracy to defraud the revenue. Everything proceeds on the assumption that the existing law was inadequate to lay prosecutions or somehow to recoup the moneys involved. It is quite clear that it is not the existing law that was inadequate but rather the Ministers whose task it was to stop the defrauding of revenue and, as I said, to enforce the laws of the land. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no evidence at all as I looked through these papers-I scanned them but briefly-to back the claim of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) that Government advisers had thoroughly examined the adequacy of existing law. Indeed, these documents substantiate what was revealed in the proceedings of Senate Estimates Committee A, namely, that the bureaucracy and the Ministry were quite content to put to one side any possibility of successfully undertaking prosecutions in the belief that legislation ought to be drafted to deal with this defrauding of revenue. But would not one expect that if the Ministry really believed that existing law was inadequate it would take steps of absolute and extreme urgency? The most effective haste could be imagined in order to stop these social parasites and tax bludgers from walking away with millions of dollars and denying to this country, this great democracy, those funds which are necessary to facilitate our Government's programs. I speak now as an Australian and certainly not in a party political sense. Instead, one finds a chronology of events which are revealed in this document which causes one to despair. </PARA>
<PARA> In mid-July 1977 the Prime Minister wrote to the then Treasurer, Sir Phillip Lynch, who is now languishing in a hospital bed, no doubt to the great relief of this Government when we are dealing with this series of debates, pointing out that urgent steps needed to be taken. But there is no evidence at all of the Prime Minister following up this initial letter. In fact, the first request of the present Treasurer, Mr Howard, to the Cabinet for draft legislation to deal with the problem does not emerge until 12 months later in mid-1978. It is not until October 1979 that Cabinet's initial agreement was obtained to the imposition of criminal sanction. No wonder one gets a cry of despair from Mr O' Reilly, the Commissioner of Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> I take the liberty to repeat much of the content of the letter from Mr O'Reilly , because of its importance in the chronology of events. In a letter dated 7 November 1979, Mr O'Reilly wrote to the Treasurer:</PARA>
<PARA> I am gravely concerned to hear that there may be some question about going ahead with the planned legislation on this matter, the nature and level of penalties proposed being, I understand, a source of difficulty for some of your colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> May I make these points:</PARA>
<PARA> These activities are criminal in nature and fraudulent-they are not merely an aspect of tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the considered opinion of the Commissioner of Taxation. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The potential of the practices, if left unchecked, is such that legislative action against tax avoidance (including revision of section 260) could be largely to no avail. </PARA>
<PARA> This activity is occurring on a large scale daily. </PARA>
<PARA>The activities of one promoter are then detailed. The Commissioner continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The above figures are but part of the story-in many cases it is futile to even raise assessments. </PARA>
<PARA>He stated, in relation to one particular scheme:</PARA>
<PARA> It is costing over $1m. per month already and one person merchandising these scheme boasts that his clients will be 'saving' $5m.-$6m. per month. </PARA>
<PARA>He makes the very good point:</PARA>
<PARA> White collar crimes in other areas of Australian law are punished by imprisonment. </PARA>
<PARA>He concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the only way to curb white collar crime-of which these practices are an integral and costly part-is by imposing criminal penalties and the threat of gaol. Unless something effective is done along the lines proposed, we may almost as well not bother with anti-avoidance legislation. I say that advisedly.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a considered statement of the Commissioner of Taxation to his Minister on 7 November 1979 and yet one has to wait 12 months to find legislation titled the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act being presented to this Parliament and passed into law. Can anyone doubt when regaled with that saga of ineffective ministerial surveillance of the work of the bureaucracy, that behind that chronology of timidity and behind that revelation of an absolute lack of will on the part of the Fraser Ministry lies the fact that at all times Mr Howard was looking over his shoulder at his own back bench members, who themselves were looking over their shoulders at the various members of the Liberal Party who were benefiting from those schemes, as has been adequately and exhaustively revealed in these chambers? There is no doubt that it is the association of the Liberal Party Ministry with those who were taking advantage of these schemes to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars week after week, month after month and year after year which provides the answer to the question of why it should have taken four to five years for effective legislation to be passed by this Parliament in order then to enable effective prosecutions to be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party has taken the step of ridding itself of that group of painters and dockers who, in their affiliation with the Labor Party, could have brought that great party into some disrepute in the public mind. But there is no doubt that the connections of the Liberal Party with those who benefited from these schemes is far more extensive, far more pervasive and, indeed, riddles the whole of that political organisation in a way which explains the lack of robust activity by the Ministry in relation to these matters until the political pressure led by the Labor Party nationally and by Mr Cain in Victoria in particular when he came into office, became such that steps had to be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly wish to speak in this debate in order to support the amendment moved by Senator Evans, which calls for the tabling of further papers. That amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that there be also laid on the table the following additional papers relating to the consideration by the Government of possible legal action against those participating in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, subject to:</PARA>
<PARA> (A) The deletion from such papers of the names and identifying characteristics of individuals to the extent necessary to satisfy the requirements of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, and</PARA>
<PARA> (B) The editing of such papers by the royal commissioner, Mr Costigan, in consultation with the Crown Solicitor, to ensure that no material is published which in his opinion would prejudice the conduct of legal proceedings against those involved in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>I have foreshadowed a slight alteration to the wording which will be moved by my colleague, the shadow Attorney-General, in a few moments. They involve only some three or four words which strengthen that attempt by the Senate to obtain for itself the fullest possible range of documents to enable it finally to come to what is already a conclusion available to it-namely, the ineptitude and lethargy of this Government in following up tax avoidance on the huge scale of which we are all aware. </PARA>

If honourable senators on the other side of this chamber refuse to join in support of this amendment in a way which prevents this chamber from carrying out that function which Senator Lewis has spoken most passionately about as the Senate's proper function, namely, the review of the activities of the Executive in a fair, impartial and a ruthless way, if need be, they reveal themselves as the creatures of that Executive. The Senate has a particular role, formalised in many committees, of scrutiny of the activities of the Executive, and that is what this amendment is all about. We should not be frustrated impeded or prevented from carrying out that task by the Government's refusal to table the very documents which lie at the heart of the question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will remind the Government, amongst other things, of Senator Withers's statement of 9 July 1975 when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . it is up to the Government to produce the necessary information which will clear its name or which will condemn it. I put to the Senate that the Government has a duty to produce full disclosure, not selective tabling of documents. </PARA>
<PARA>There one has in the clearest terms from the then Leader of the Government the obligation on a Government to respond in the fullest possible way to the request of the Senate for the tabling of those documents which will allow it to form its fullest opinion. I repeat what Senator Withers said:</PARA>
<PARA> I put to the Senate that the Government has a duty to produce full disclosure, not selective tabling of documents. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we have such a selective tabling. Here we have a refusal to table, not documents which are only barely relevant to our inquiry, but documents which lie at the very heart of the matter, the most relevant documents of all-those which contain the opinions of learned counsel as to whether the law which existed before the passage of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act was adequate. They go to the heart of the charge against this Government that it failed to marshal all of the vast resources available to it to combat this fraudulent denial of moneys to the Treasury. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) said that that analysis of the documents that were missing was stupid. If he can show that in some way my understanding of the importance of those documents is dense and stupid, so be it , but I doubt whether he will be able to convince the Senate that that is the case. As I say, the Senate is not asking that every file be ransacked and brought into this chamber, or every piece of paper that is barely relevant to the issue. It is merely asking for those documents which are absolutely crucial, absolutely vital and which absolutely go to the heart of the matter-that is, those documents which relate to the understanding which the Government could have had available to it of its ability to undertake prosecutions under the then existing law. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not surprised that the Minister finds this embarrassing, because at Question Time he found himself unable to tell the Senate whether the Special Prosecutor could undertake prosecutions in relation to matters arising before the passage of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. Therefore, his understanding of the Government's willingness to deal with these matters, even now, is defective. The documentation reveals a total history of defective understanding by the Government, from the very beginning of what is possible by way of prosecution. As I say, it starts with the Prime Minister and the effort then becomes bogged down in a mire of bureaucratic in-fighting and a total lack of political will on the part of his Ministry. </PARA>
<PARA> There is only one way in which this matter will be finally resolved to the satisfaction of the Australian people. The full tabling of the documents will enable the Senate to come to some conclusions. But the final resolution of this matter, the final robust dealing with it by a government committed to ordinary taxpayers being able to pay tax honestly, knowing that those on a much higher income are also paying their fair share of the nation's revenue, will only come about with a change of government and with the placing on the Treasury benches in the House of Representatives of an Australian Labor Party government led by Mr Bill Hayden. I assure all who are listening, all who read Hansard and all those representatives of the public who are in the gallery today that only as a result of the election of a Labor government will we finally have a fair and equitable tax system in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are dealing with a motion that we take note of the papers that have been presented to us in the paper termed: 'Documents tabled in response to Senate Motion No. 47 (given 7 September 1982) concerning straw companies and the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980'. To that motion an amendment moved by Senator Evans seeks further documentation and asks that such documentation be so edited as to take out any material that would prejudice the conduct of legal proceedings against those involved in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. I am anxious, of course, to ensure that that proviso be maintained. I would even go further: I hope that in some way, before this motion is proceeded with, it could be couched in more general terms, rather than specify only bottom -of-the-harbour schemes. I hope that it will use the more general term 'tax evaders'. Therefore, I propose to support a proposition which would include such words as I first indicated in respect of this matter on 8 September 1982. Honourable senators may recall that on that occasion I indicated that I would support the tabling of certain documents, with the following proviso:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> And with such papers edited by Mr F. X. Costigan, Q.C., in consultation with the Crown Solicitor, so as to delete from the papers any material which would prejudice any future prosecution of tax evaders. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, the material that is currently before us includes tax evasion schemes other than the so-called bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. I believe that it would be possible to extend the amendment that is currently before us to ensure that all tax evasion schemes would be included, and the perpetrators of those schemes would be denied any unnecessary advantage as a result of the tabling of these documents. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me place in perspective the debate at this moment. On 25 August 1982 the Senate debated a motion moved by the Opposition calling for the resignation of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard). On that occasion I had no information available to me, nor was any documentation placed before the Senate, to convince me to vote for that motion. I therefore voted against the motion and it failed. On 7 September 1982 a proposition was advanced that certain documents be tabled in the Senate. I was disposed at that time, and am still disposed, to support the proposition for the documents to be tabled. I insisted at that time that they should be edited in the manner that I have mentioned previously in this speech. I still support that viewpoint although I suspect that members of the Opposition may now be wanting to obtain retrospective evidence for the decision that they made on 25 August 1982. I am not in a position to know what exercise influenced them in their decision, nor do I criticise them for taking that particular stand at that particular time. They may have known more than I knew. However, I am in the position, as an Independent senator, of having to judge matters on their merits as they come before the chamber. It is a strange quirk of democracy that one has to listen so intently these days to the debate in this chamber in order to make up one's mind . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, on one's eardrums. I could not at that stage go along with the proposition and I believe, probably because the Opposition is engaged now in attempting to obtain some retrospective proof, that it has already shot its bolt by reason of the fact that it did move that motion prematurely on 7 September 1982. As I said on that occasion, part of that motion was not premature. I would have gone along with the censure of the Government. A reading of the documents now before the Senate shows that the Government ought to be censured. But at that time I was not prepared to go along with the calling for the heads of Senator Durack and Mr Howard. As I say, I believe that probably the Opposition put the cart before the horse and maybe it has shot its bolt. Maybe that result will never come about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think that we can discuss these matters and these papers in a vacuum. We have to refer to a previous debate that has taken place today. If I am not out of order-I am sure, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you will pick me up if I am out of order-I say that I believe these documents show that certainly failings within the Public Service have highlighted the problems that the Government and the taxation revenue were faced with at that time. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has suggested that the way to overcome this is for a thorough investigation of the Public Service. I remind the Senate-as the Senate has not been previously reminded, as I understand it-that such an examination did take place in early 1976 and the person who was chosen by the current Prime Minister to undertake the examination was none other than Sir Henry Bland. He was the man appointed to what was known as the Administrative Review Committee. Also on that Committee was none other than the person who is now proposed as the Chairman of the new inquiry, Mr John Reid-an eminent industrialist and businessman. </PARA>
<PARA> I hazard a guess that had the recommendations made by the Administrative Review Committee, presided over by Sir Henry Bland and on which Mr John Reid, Mr John Taylor and Mr Gerald Gleeson served, been followed then maybe a number of the problems with which the Government is now faced would not have emerged. Of course that is guesswork. Maybe it is informed guesswork, but let me say this: The report of that Committee was never made public. I would certainly like to see-I am sure the Government would not allow us to do so-the report of that inquiry made public. Sir Henry Bland was a man who, over many years, gave service to successive governments. He was a man who was asked by the Prime Minister to perform certain functions when the Liberal Government was elected in 1975. He performed those functions to the best of his ability and in fact he did so with the accumulated knowledge and experience that he had obtained in the Public Service in Australia over a great number of years. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, I hazard the guess that had the recommendations of the Administrative Review Committee been implemented then we may not have been faced with the problems with which we are faced at this time. Again I emphasise that that is only a guess because I have nothing firm to go on. The report has not been presented to us by the Government and therefore we really do not know with any degree of hindsight whether or not that would have been the case. Only the Prime Minister and a number of his close Cabinet colleagues know that. But it is interesting to note that the very person whom the Prime Minister has now chosen to head up the new inquiry was a member of the Administrative Review Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the people of Australia would be interested to know what is contained in the documents which the Opposition motion now seeks to have tabled. Why would they like to know that? I think they are entitled to know the thrust of advice that was available to senior public servants and to the Ministers at that time. They are entitled to know whether, on a reasonable assessment of that advice, certain action should have been taken. My only regret is that the Opposition did not move this motion before it chose to include in its motion of 25 August 1982 the calling for the heads of two Ministers. But that is water under the bridge. It is important, however, for the Senate to pursue this request. How it will be enacted and how it will be accomplished are matters for determination by Mr President or by the Executive Government. Because of circumstances beyond my control, I have not been in a position to seek information-a position chosen, of course, because of circumstances that arose last night-and to know precisely how this particular measure is to be enacted. The amendment says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . and that there be also laid on the Table the following additional papers relating to the consideration by the Government of possible legal action against those participating in bottom of the harbour schemes, subject to . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Then it goes on to refer to section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and, in paragraph (b), the sanitisation procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> However, who will ensure that these papers are laid upon the Table? Once the motion is passed, will the executive Government get in touch with Mr Costigan to relay to him the Senate's decision, or is this task to be performed by the President of the Senate? These are the questions that ought to be answered before a vote is taken on this matter. There are those two questions. As to the first, I am happy to support the amendment moved by Senator Evans provided that it involves and includes all tax evasion systems. On the second, we must be clear about who is responsible for the implementation of this motion or the amendment to the motion when it becomes a resolution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had a debate today which, in the main, has focused on the amendment moved by Senator Evans with respect to the production of additional papers, which amendment replaces a notice of motion which he withdrew during his speech and of which he gave notice some time ago. I indicated to the Senate on the day that that notice of motion was given, or on the day after, that the Government had determined to take an open approach on the disclosure of documents and that it intended to produce documents freely, limited only by the question of prejudice which might occur if certain documents were tabled. Time was sought to give the Government a chance to go through the relevant documentation and to respond to the motion. There was, I think, agreement to that course, the caution being put down by Senator Evans, on behalf of the Opposition, that he did not want undue delay, for reasons which I accept, for both political and practical purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. There is no suggestion of bad faith in that sense. If there were some peculiar inference to be drawn from my remarks which gave rise to that , it was accidental. As I indicated, the Government's wish and, in particular, the wish, I think it fair to say, of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) was that there should be openness in this area so that what had actually happened could be assessed. The matter has been approached on that basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I uttered the word 'stupid'-and I thought that I was speaking very sotto voce-during Senator Tate's speech, it was not that I was accusing Senator Tate of being stupid, but rather that I thought that at a particular point of his argument he was putting a stupid argument, because he accused the Government of having engaged in a selective tabling of documents when in fact what has always been sought, as I understood it, by the Opposition, and what is sought even in the amendment before us today, is a selective tabling of documents, the selection being based on the agreed position that there can be documents with respect to which disclosure might prejudice legal proceedings. I understand that whilst there is a difference between the Government and the Opposition on the degree or the point of detail, there is no argument between us on the proposition that there ought not to be disclosure which would be of assistance to those who might otherwise be subject to prosecution, or indeed, to pick up a point made by Senator Harradine, other legal proceedings or prosecutions going beyond the question of bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. I make that explanation about my use of the word 'stupid' because I have a healthy respect for Senator Tate. I just thought that on this occasion he was using an argument which really overlooked the basic thrust of his own party's request in this area, which is for a selection of documents, the exclusions being based on some method of determining which material should not be published in order to avoid prejudice to the conduct of legal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches made this afternoon have almost suggested that too much has been tabled. In between accusations of inadequate material, there have been accusations that a great deal has been put down that is, perhaps, not helpful. I can only say that it is most unusual for a government to have put before the Parliament and hence the people of Australia such a wealth of material going across a fair period in a significant area of government administration and an area in which it has been subject to robust criticism by the Opposition. The material includes advice offered by the Taxation Office to the Government, correspondence between Ministers, draft Cabinet submissions, and material which even on, I think, the most generous interpretation of what might have been contained in the fullest possible freedom of information legislation would not generally have been available. The fact is that there has been very wide disclosure because the Government appreciates that there is a public interest in seeing the totality of the scene. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the dispute before us this afternoon is a dispute which involves the question whether there should be even greater disclosure, in the light of the advice that the Government has received that the material could be prejudicial. I should like to refer to the statement put down by the Treasurer because he there explained the basis of the exclusions which were made by the Government. I think that it is necessary to go into that matter because I think that there was some misunderstanding on the part of Senator Evans in part of what he said about the basis of the exclusions. The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> The third batch consists of three legal opinions. The Solicitor-General has considered that counsels' opinions and other legal advice referred to in items 2 , 7, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21 and 22 of the Senate resolution should not be tabled on the ground that public disclosure of the contents would be harmful to the administration of justice. He personally examined each of the documents in question. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans made something of the point that the Treasurer had said that there was an exclusion on the basis that the contents would be harmful to the administration of justice and I think he said that he saw that as too broad an exclusion and not as one necessarily going to the question of prosecution. I go on to quote the Treasurer because there is a more definite explanation of what is meant by those earlier words in his statement. The Treasurer went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> He has stated that, in his view--</PARA>
<PARA>'His' means the Solicitor-General's-</PARA>
<PARA>harm would be caused both to those who may be prosecuted and to those who may be proceeded against civilly, or to the cause of the prosecutor or civil complainant. In many instances both sides would be injured. That injury would not, in his view, be avoided by exercising names. </PARA>
<PARA>We have a clear statement that it is the view of the Solicitor-General that harm could be caused in a number of ways, either to those who may be prosecuted and those who may be proceeded against civilly or to the cause of the prosecutor or civil complainant and that there was a possibility of injury to both sides. That is a serious matter and I understand that, in the broad, it would be accepted by honourable senators from all parts of the chamber as being an appropriate reason for not producing the documentation. The issue is a narrower one and that is the question of whose opinion should be accepted by the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the words are quite clear. There could be injury to the legal cause of those who are engaged on either side of either the prosecution or civil action involving taxation matters. I think the basic query is one as to whose advice should be taken by the Government. My view that that is the basic dispute is strengthened by the amendment which Senator Evans has made this afternoon. It is an amendment which, in a sense, has left me not quite without instructions but certainly arguing on a brief which is not quite the brief which I had when I entered this chamber. What is now to be excluded, if the motion is carried, is not material which might prejudice the conduct of legal proceedings but material which would prejudice the conduct of legal proceedings. The effect of that is to say that there should be a narrower exclusion because there has to be certainty that there would be prejudice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite frankly, I think that is far too strong a test to place on whether or not the documents should be produced. I would have thought that to achieve that degree of certainty requires a degree of prescience which even a Solicitor- General, an ombudsman or the Royal Commissioner might find difficult to produce. I think it is far too generous a suggestion that only material which, in the opinion of some eminent legal person advising the Government and the Senate, would-not might-prejudice the conduct of legal proceedings should be withheld. I question whether in that form the motion ought to receive the support of the Australian Democrats and the Independent. Presumably, since it is moved by the Opposition spokesman, it certainly has the support of the Opposition. </PARA>

For that reason alone I believe that the amendment moved by Senator Evans should be rejected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also pick up the point which was made by Senator Harradine. I adopt it and support it. The amendment as it is put forward is far too narrow. It requires us to withhold only documents which would prejudice the conduct of legal proceedings against those involved in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. There are, of course, other areas of tax avoidance which are picked up in some of the opinions which have been sought. For that reason, again I believe that since the Senate would not wish to see prejuduce to either civil or criminal proceedings in any of those cases, we should not accept the amendment which has been put forward by Senator Evans. I go back to the Treasurer's statement because part of it is relevant to the point that I have just made. The Treasurer stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that it should accept the advice of the Solicitor- General on this matter. I believe that there is no other proper course that the Government could follow, even though the opinions, if they were able to be tabled, would show that counsels' opinion were not all 'one way' on the availability of adequate and effective legal remedies in the cases that they related to. Thus, the opinion of counsel referred to in item 2 of the Evans motion advised that there was insufficient evidence to warrant criminal proceedings on a charge under section 86 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Lockhart opinion referred to in item 7 of the motion--</PARA>
<PARA>It now has a different number because we are speaking to the amendment as amended and not to the original notice of motion--</PARA>
<PARA>while it advised of reasonable prospects of success, recognised the difficulties inherent in establishing a charge of conspiracy to defraud or similar charges. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General pointed out to that Senate on 7 September 1982 that this opinion did not relate to a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. He also referred to the question of further action being taken on this case and made the obvious point, now confirmed by the Solicitor-General, that the opinion should not be tabled. </PARA>
<PARA>The position is that the Senate faces a situation in which the Solicitor-General , the second law officer of the Commonwealth, has advised the Government in the terms which I have laid before it. Who is the Solicitor-General? The Solicitor- General is, of course, an independent statutory officer who, under the Law Officers Act 1964, is given very considerable statutory independence. I was pleased that on this occasion Senator Evans was careful not to suggest that the Opposition was throwing doubts on either the political or professional independence of the Solicitor-General. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not trying to slide in this speech. I believe that the assistance that I am getting from Senator Evans is of no help to me or the Senate. I was not trying in any sense to gloss on the points which have been made. I remind honourable senators-I am sorry that we do not as yet have Hansard for the early part of this afternoon's debate-of the care that Senator Evans took, unlike in some of his earlier comments in this discussion, to be quite clear that he was not casting doubts on the ability, the position or the independence of the Solicitor-General. Today he certainly did refer back to what he saw as the view of the Solicitor-General on matters of Executive privilege and so on. He referred to some historical events in which some members of this chamber were involved in 1975. But the fact is that we have a person who, by statute, is given independence and is given the function under section 12 of the Law Officers Act to act as counsel for the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, or the Commonwealth itself and for a Minister or an officer of the Commonwealth and so on. The position of the Solicitor-General is clear and established and, in the view of the Government, establishes him as the appropriate person from whom to seek advice, advice on which this Government is going to have to act and advice which is going to affect, in the end, the conduct of prosecutions for which this Government will again be held responsible in the ongoing interest which has been taken in the development of this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course the Government is aware that a number of honourable senators have made suggestions as to who might be involved in vetting the material. I have not spoken directly with the Attorney on this matter for reasons which will be understood. Over the last week or so he has not been available to talk about business matters. But I have checked and been advised by the Department that the Attorney, in company with a senior officer of the Department, did have a discussion with Mr Costigan on 10 September in light of the suggestion which at that time had been made by Senator Harradine that he would move that the papers be examined by Mr Costigan in consultation with the Crown Solicitor. I am advised that in that conversation Mr Costigan said that it would be outside his terms of reference and that in any event it would not be appropriate for him to carry out such a role. I was not privy to that conversation and I cannot give any more detail to it than that. But that is the basis upon which I understand--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a matter on which I am not in a position to advise the Senate finally, as I said this morning, but that may well prove to be the case. But the fact is that, quite apart from the question of the terms of reference, the advice which I received through the normal departmental channels is that Mr Costigan was saying not only that it was outside his terms of reference but also that in any event it would not be appropriate for him to carry out such a role. Therefore, the Government has gone to the Solicitor-General who has all of the qualities that we have just been talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Harradine" NAMEID="6H4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator Harradine</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He identified nine of these 14 documents in his report. He identified them.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is one thing to identify the documents. It is another to provide the opinions to government of the sort which are sought in this amendment. I simply say to the Senate that that matter was raised following a suggestion made in this place, with the result that I have just indicated. For the variety of reasons that I have expressed, the view of the Government is that this amendment is not appropriate. I believe it is extremely important to the Australian community, and of course to the Government, that the dealings in these matters should be both expeditious and effective. We now have the legal advice from the Solicitor-General that there is a possibility of prejudice if these documents are produced in the way that is sought. I believe that on that basis it would be wrong for the Senate to place its judgment above that of the Solicitor-General, and to endeavour to impose a solution in a situation where the Senate will not be held responsible for what follows, but the Government will. I believe that it would be quite improper for this chamber to try to exercise power in the way that it has over and above the opinion which has been put before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I address my remarks very seriously to those honourable senators who are capable of making an independent judgment. I accept that all honourable senators in the Australian Labor Party, for reasons that are right and proper according to their light, are incapable of making their own judgment on this matter once a firm decision has been taken by the party; we know that none of them is going to cross the floor. But I ask the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine to consider very seriously the risk of prejudice that could occur if material which informed those who might be involved in prosecutions or civil proceedings of legal views, both positive and negative, of the prospects of success and so on was disclosed. I ask that the amendment be opposed and that the material which has already been submitted be accepted as the adequate response to the Senate's original request. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other point. Senator Evans, just before he spoke, drew my attention to a matter which I had already had drawn to my attention, namely, that item 12 in his amendment represents new material in terms of its not having been mentioned in the original list. That of itself might not be thought critical because clearly the Government has gone through a great deal of additional material and produced what is thought to be relevant to the spirit of the request originally made. However, on this occasion I have been unable to get clear instructions on the precise status of this document in the terms in which it is described; that is, being the 18-page report of a senior investigation officer Todman to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in 1979. Of course, it may well be that that is a report which directly impinges upon aspects of cases which could be involved in prosecutions. I simply do not know and in opposing this motion I do so on the basis that I take no final stance on that particular request on behalf of the Government because I think I will need to obtain more information. I have been unable to get it in the time available since this debate commenced. I only sought advice at that time. I ask the Senate to reject the amendment moved by Senator Evans and I hope that that course will be followed. I do that, by way of reminder, on two bases: Firstly, the substitution of the word 'would' in my view greatly increases the risk of having material brought in which might prejudice a prosecution or civil proceedings. By definition, that must be so. Secondly, because in the view of the Solicitor- General it would be or could be detrimental to prosecutions or civil proceedings . </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to say very much on the broader issues which were canvassed with less intensity in the debate. However, I wish to remind the Senate that in looking at the material, it is important to look at the totality of the material and not merely to try to dive into the heap and to find one narrow area in which one can say 'we find real cause for complaint'. This morning I answered a question from Senator Evans on a particular segment of delay. I am happy to concede that it is open to any honourable senator to raise any particular area which is disclosed by these documents and to seek further information. I suspect that I will not be as fortunate on every occasion to be as appropriately briefed as I was this morning on the particular point raised. This morning I was able to respond immediately. But the point I really wish to make is that the totality of that documentation demonstrates the point that I mentioned this morning at Question Time. In the years with which we are concerned-which are fundamentally the years of this Government because as Senator Evans is wont to say the failures of the previous government after all occurred over a relatively brief period in the field of trying to do something about tax avoidance-if one looks at the areas in which this Government has been operating, one finds not a single line of inquiry on a single taxation problem but a whole range of inquiries across a great range of taxation schemes which were being devised in the community, many of which posed a substantial threat to the revenue and some of which I understand the Opposition would say are of more significance, or were of greater significance in terms of revenue lost, than bottom-of-the-harbour schemes which we made criminally punishable in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past the Government has included material in Hansard which sets out the various things which were tackled during the life of the Government. I wish to refer quickly again to that because it demonstrates the context in which these matters were occurring. It was not a context in which nothing was happening. It was a context in which a series of things were happening across a series of fronts in the general area of trying to prevent the leakage of revenue through tax avoidance schemes. It would not be useful to the time of the Senate to read this list. Rather, I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate in Hansard a list of tax avoidance legislation which has been implemented by the Government over the years 1977 through to 1982 as an indication of the breadth of the activity which has taken place at the bureaucratic level, at the political level and, indeed, here in the Parliament at the legislative level, in an endeavour to stamp out what all of us agree has been an anti-social level of tax avoidance which has been no good for the country and no good for those who have been paying their full share of taxation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over recent weeks the Senate has been discussing, correctly so in my view, criticisms about the Executive Government's role in the collection of revenue-in other words, the degree, the magnitude, of wholesale tax evasion and tax avoidance. I think it is a matter of regret that yesterday Senator Austin Lewis suggested that we were wasting our time debating these sorts of matters when we ought to be dealing with matters associated with legislation. In the other House this afternoon I heard a Government speaker defending the Government's role in the whole question of tax evasion and tax avoidance, suggesting that in fact the Government was defending the principles of parliamentary democracy. As we would understand parliamentary democracy parliament itself has the role to exercise some power over the Executive Government. That precisely is what the Senate has been seeking to do. We just happen to be in that rather fortunate position of there being a majority of senators who are prepared to play their correct role of exercising some jurisdiction over the deficiencies in the Executive Government in respect of tax evasion and tax avoidance. We have been looking at bottom-of-the-harbour schemes . We have been looking at asset stripping and trust stripping exercises which show the complete deficiency in the role of the Australian Taxation Office as a result of this Government's lack of attention to introducing strong enough legislation and regulations that will force every person liable to pay his due portion of tax to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will be relating my few remarks this afternoon to a matter that has been brought to my attention and which has operated in the post-war years; that is, the 30 of the 33 years in which we have had conservative governments since 1949. It has even been suggested that some of the deficiencies that exist are as a result of the Whitlam Government, for three years, not being able to rectify these matters. But over all of the post-war years there has been a great variety of weaknesses in the taxation legislation. A case which has been brought to my attention officially in my capacity as shadow Minister for home affairs show how tax havens exist and are countenanced and permitted by the inactivity of the Fraser Liberal-National Country Party Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take the opportunity today to give an outline of one of the many ways in which unscrupulous and ruthless operators, people who are in positions of so- called trust, power and influence-the sorts of people who are close to the conservative parties of this country-can and do manipulate their affairs and shirk their responsibilities to the ordinary taxpayers of Australia. As a result , the ordinary average citizen of this country pays a larger share of taxation. It is my view that as a result of these sorts of schemes which have been permitted to operate, because of the attitude of this Government, the average taxpayer is paying something like $32 a week more than he should be. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take a look at the operations of a certain John Terence Brown, late of Sydney but more recently a resident of Norfolk Island. John Terence Brown was admitted as a solicitor in 1972 but sold up his practice in 1980 and moved to Norfolk Island where he continued to do legal work as well as becoming a member of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly and, until recently, a member of the governing conservative executive in that area, a trustee of the Norfolk Island Art Gallery and a Director of Norfolk Island Airlines. So he is part of the establishment, he is part of the atmosphere which this Government tolerates. </PARA>
<PARA> In the financial year 1979-80 a certain company by the name of Holding Rubber Products Pty Ltd, registered in Victoria, made a substantial profit and was liable therefore to pay tax on this profit. The company decided it did not want to pay that tax, that it wanted to keep the money due to the Australian Government and the Australian people for its own use. A chain of quite remarkable events then took place which put into motion the processes to strip that company of its assets, to avoid the payment of the tax due, to line the pockets of the people involved in this bald-faced dishonesty and finally to consign the company to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean-not the bottom of the harbour but the bottom of the Pacifc Ocean. </PARA>
<PARA> The first step was to sell the company's assets to another company. For this purpose a shell company was found which took over the assets and became Holding Rubber Products (Victoria) Pty Ltd. This company also retained the tax liability . Two days after this transfer John Terence Brown was appointed a director and on the same day various sums by way of loans and journal entries were passed back and forth in order to pay off the original shareholders in the company and place the remaining funds in the hands of the prime mover in the scheme-that is, after some debts were paid off, an amount of $1.6m was placed in the hands of John Terence Brown. At this stage, however, approximately a quarter of a million dollars disappeared and it has not yet been uncovered despite court actions to try to establish what happened. </PARA>
<PARA> The next step in this elaborate scheme was to lend the $1.6m asset to a certain Wharton Finance Ltd and to change the name of Holding Rubber Pty Ltd to Fermoyle Pty Ltd. Of course, the laws of this country permit this sort of procedure to take place. It was only because of the activities of the Corporate Affairs Office in Victoria that some of these facts started to unfold. Wharton Finance repaid the loan to Fermoyle which then made a so-called donation-heaven forbid- to the Norfolk Island Art Gallery of that same amount. The Norfolk Island Art Gallery used that donation to repay a loan supposedly taken out to buy works of art. Thus, the amount was once again returned to Wharton Finance. I will talk about the Norfolk Island Art Gallery in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The key to all this paper shuffling was the provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act that allows such a donation to be made a taxation deduction. In my view it is criminal that the Government permits this sort of behaviour and legitimises it. This effectively reduced the tax liability of the original company to nil and placed the profits of the original company back in the hands of the original beneficiaries without the liability of paying tax. The way this donation was achieved was a particularly extreme example of abused trust. It indicates the degree to which individuals in high places-educated people and people who are part of the establishment-are able to get around the laws and the decent honest practices of this country. The Norfolk Island Art Gallery, of which the same John Terence Brown, a solicitor from Sydney and a member of the Legislative Assembly, is a trustee, had to agree to this donation, had to agree to its being used to buy virtually worthless paintings and had to agree also to put a totally unrealistic astronomical value on those paintings. He had $1.6m to buy paintings which he could have bought for $600, $6,000 or any amount one likes. He then claimed that they were worth $1.6m. </PARA>
<PARA> The major manoeuvring having been completed, it was then necessary only to sweep the remains under the carpet. That is what he set out to do. In fact Fermoyle Pty Ltd, the company with the tax liability, was put into voluntary liquidation. The same John Terence Brown-this shows the guile and the deceit of individuals who are trained in law to protect the community and how they are able to use the laws for their own benefit-then appointed himself as the liquidator of the company. There is just no limit to the brazen way in which such people use the laws of this country. This liquidator then proceeded to lodge liquidation declarations with the Corporate Affairs Office in Victoria, declarations containing brazen untruths in order to cover his dishonest intentions. This is the type of dishonesty that exists and is taken advantage of by persons of this pathetic calibre in Australian society. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view these are matters which fall within the area of tax evasion but unfortunately, because of the legislative way in which this Government makes tax collections, they fall within the area of tax avoidance. This is what is going on in business and legal circles tens of thousands of times. It is a feature of the way in which tax operates in this country. This parasitic underworld-that is all it can be described as-with a legal framework, a legal front, is the burden that ordinary taxpayers of Australia have to carry. They have to carry the main tax burden. That is the principal reason why 53 per cent of all national revenue collected by the Federal Government comes from the PAYE section of the community . Of course, according to the document, nothing is done either by the Australian Taxation Office or this Government to rectify this sort of malfunction of the whole tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> Legal action was required and a judgment, delivered on 7 May 1982, set aside the liquidator's role in this whole process in order that there could be some justice and determination of the matter concerned. This indicates how absurd it is for this Government to claim that it acts on behalf of all the people of Australia. I am certain that if we were able to look at the whole tax structure and at the way the Australian Taxation Office functions-I am not criticising the Australian Taxation Office, unless, of course, it has failed to advise the Australian Government of the sorts of lurks and perks that go to make up the way in which the tax system operates-we would find a deficiency; we would find that the Government has failed to carry out its proper obligations with respect to tax revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I was somewhat disturbed to find, on the very day after the Treasurer (Mr Howard) returned from his sojourn overseas, that he stated that deficiencies existed within the Australian Taxation Office. As has been said in the debate generally, the Government is attempting to shift the blame away from itself and onto sections of the Public Service. It matters not whether it is in the area of tax, the medical fraud, the Department of Primary Industry, the Australian Dairy Corporation or the meat inspection scandal; the Government clearly is trying to make the Public Service and its senior officers the scapegoats. In the particular case to which I am referring-the Australian Government was aware of this case because it was party to some of the proceedings-the Government was aware that John Terence Brown was using Norfolk Island as a haven. Where is the legislation it should have introduced into this Parliament to close off those sorts of loopholes? Mr Brown, not only with respect to this issue but also with respect to other issues, is involved in tax matters on Norfolk Island. That is the reason he and many of his colleagues live on Norfolk Island. I do not have time to talk about the tax haven that exists in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Again that is an area which comes within our jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> In due course the Opposition will be seeking to bring to the public's attention the means by which unscrupulous wealthy people-people who have considerable assets and profits-are using the loopholes and the weaknesses in the laws of this country, whether they be State or Federal laws, for the purpose of robbing the Australian people of due revenue. As a result, extra revenue has to be raised from the PAYE area and by way of indirect taxes. We expressed strong views about that a year or so ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of this breakdown in public morality is that revenue that should be available to be spent on the areas of social security, child care, education and funds to the States to carry out their proper responsibilities is reduced. Tax revenue has been lost as a result of the deficiencies of the Fraser Administration. On this occasion it is clear that it is not only the big but also the small taxpayers that this Government has indicted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The facts of the meat inquiry are as follows: The Woodward Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry was set up on 12 September last year to investigate allegations of corruption arising from the discovery of horse and kangaroo meat in Australian beef exports. Among other things, Mr Justice Woodward was specifically asked to report on whether allegations were made to any Minister about malpractice in the meat export trade , and importantly-I quote from the terms of reference:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . whether such allegations were dealt with in a manner that was adequate and effective. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a fact that on 11 February 1980 Mr Bert Kelly, then the Liberal member of the House of Representatives for Wakefield and a former Minister, went to Melbourne and met Mr Nixon. Mr Kelly presented Mr Nixon with a report, commenced in 1978, on the problems of the dual inspection service for meat. It is a fact that Mr Kelly used that occasion to advise Mr Nixon of the widespread corruption and skulduggery in the meat industry. Allegations of bribes to meat inspectors, threats, blackmail and theft of meat were among the allegations passed on by Mr Kelly to the Minister. What did the Minister do, having been advised by a reputable witness as early as February 1980 that there was something rotten in the meat game? According to Mr Nixon, he discussed it with Dr Gee, the head of the Bureau of Animal Health in the Department of Primary Industry. The Bureau of Animal Health has responsibilty for supervision of the export inspection service . Dr Gee then discussed the matter with Mr Landos, the executive officer of the Kelly Committee of Inquiry to Examine Commonwealth and State Meat Inspection Systems. Dr Gee apparently satisfied himself that there was no hard evidence of any malpractice and reported that back to Mr Nixon. Mr Nixon then let the matter rest. </PARA>
<PARA> The question arises whether the Minister's limited action was good enough. Was that an adequate and effective response to Mr Kelly's allegations? Clearly it was not. Not only with the benefit of hindsight but also clearly for an industry of that importance and on such a sensitive matter, the Minister having been given information by a reliable witness who was conducting an inquiry into the meat industry for a slightly different purpose, the Minister's response was not good enough. The conclusion of Mr Justice Woodward is that Mr Nixon was culpable . In paragraph 8.45 of his report he states:</PARA>
<PARA> I have carefully considered the Minister's role in this matter, having due regard to the responsibility attributable to senior departmental officers, the heavy workload which Ministers accept . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He concludes the paragraph by saying:</PARA>
<PARA> In spite of these considerations, I am bound to record my view that the Minister did not deal with these allegations adequately and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>The judge goes on to say of Mr Nixon in paragraph 8.46:</PARA>
<PARA> He says that he can recall Mr Kelly saying that it was a pretty 'shonky' industry . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph 8.47 he says:</PARA>
<PARA> The possibilities of such action should have been fully investigated; instead it was assumed that nothing could usefully be done. </PARA>
<PARA>These questions, among others, leap out from those paragraphs: Why did Mr Nixon not investigate the matter further? He had an allegation of widespread corruption and blackmail from a responsible source. Why did he not investigate it fully? Why did he not himself press Mr Kelly for details of his allegations? Why did he not ask his departmental officers to follow them up? Why did he not press his departmental officers for full written details of the allegations and/ or ask Mr Kelly for written details of the allegations? He did none of those things. Mr Nixon merely made cursory inquiries and let the matter rest. Is it too much to ask that a Minister should have shown the will to get to the bottom of the matter, to satisfy himself fully that the allegations were without foundation? Mr Nixon did not. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequences of his sloppy and half-hearted administrative effort are that it was left to an inspector in the United States-the only circumstance which could be more embarrassing than that would be for someone in the Middle East to discover that pork was labelled as beef-to discover, to Australia's acute embarrassment, that a meat substitution racket was taking place. Because of that a billion dollar meat exporting industry has been placed in jeopardy. The damage that this negligence has caused will continue for many years. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) attempted to defend Mr Nixon on three dishonest, shameful grounds. The first of those techniques was that of selective quotation. The Prime Minister quoted the first sentence of paragraph 8.39, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Insofar as allegations were reported by the Department to Mr Nixon, I do not consider any criticism can be levelled at his handling of them. </PARA>
<PARA>That says that the allegations were passed on to him by the Department. That does not refer to the allegations passed on to the Minister by Mr Kelly. The Prime Minister dishonestly presented that quotation in a context which purported to refer to Mr Kelly's allegations. The Prime Minister should have quoted the following sentence from the middle of paragraph 8.44:</PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who had previously assumed that by and large, Commonwealth meat inspection was functioning well, ought to have been jolted out of complacency by what the Kelly Committee had to say. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister did quote the following sentence from paragraph 8.48 concerning the Minister and his advisers:</PARA>
<PARA> They seem to have given all their attention to the central issue dealt with by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Kelly Committee. In other words, the Prime Minister was trying to show that Mr Nixon was dealing determinedly with other matters in hand. But the Prime Minister quoted only a portion of that paragraph. The whole paragraph reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Thus neither the Minister nor his senior advisers took any substantial steps to look into the questions which had been raised by the Kelly Committee. They seem to have given all their attention to the central issue dealt with by the Committee-the question of a single inspection system-and hoped that any problems of corruption or abuse of power would right themselves in due course. In the event, of course, they did not. </PARA>
<PARA> The second leg of the Prime Minister's spurious defence of Mr Nixon was his attempt to set himself up as a better judge of the evidence than Mr Justice Woodward. The Royal Commissioner took 11 months to weigh the evidence and to form his view. The Prime Minister took a maximum of two days-a weekend-in between consulting a disinterested party, to it, Mr Anthony, the National Country Party leader, as well as Mr Nixon himself. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the Prime Minister's action, the standing reputation and basis of royal commissions are under threat. What judge will now risk serving on a royal commission, knowing not only that his findings will be peremptorily dismissed but also that his personal competence and/or integrity will be impugned? All this, from a Prime Minister who in 1975 used to talk piously about accepting the umpire's decision. Will the public believe the Prime Minister and his Country Party advisors or will it believe Mr Justice Woodward of the Federal Court?</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's action in declaring Mr Justice Woodward's judgment suspect has raised another matter. It will be remembered that for many years Mr Justice Woodward was the head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Will the Prime Minister, having now discovered that Mr Justice Woodward's judgment is not only suspect but also wrong, order a review and the overturning of all security decisions made by ASIO while he was its head? If Mr Justice Woodward's judgment is so bad in this instance, is the Prime Minister suggesting that it was bad in other instances? If so, what does the Prime Minister intend to do about it?</PARA>
<PARA> The third leg of the Prime Minister's spurious defence of a worthless Minister was to attack Mr Kelly. One wonders whether there is any depth to which this Prime Minister will not sink. Is there nothing that he will not do to save the Country Party? The standards of this Government and of its performance are in total disarray. The standard now is one of casting around for a scapegoat. We have had the Royal Commissioner scapegoat, the Public Service scapegoat, the police scapegoat and now the Kelly scapegoat-anybody except the Minister who is responsible. The new ministerial standard is one of finding someone else to carry the can. The plain truth, shown again as before, is that the Prime Minister will not, for whatever reason, take disciplinary action against Country Party Ministers. I wonder for how long the members of the Liberal Party in this place, in the other House and outside, will tolerate that double standard. Decisions on the future of Ministers are made according to whether they would be good for the Cabinet, whether they would damage the Government politically, rather than on any standard of ministerial responsibility or integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, the standards keep changing. Senator Withers, who I regret is not in the chamber, would be more conscious of that than anyone. On 15 August 1978, Mr Fraser said in the House of Representatives regarding the McGregor report and its consideration by senior Ministers:</PARA>
<PARA> We had no doubt that our first and foremost responsibility was the maintenance of the high standards of propriety set and maintained by this Government. We were of the view that we had no option but to accept Mr Justice McGregor's report and accepting it had inevitable consequences in respect of the finding of impropriety. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, what that meant was that Senator Withers got the sack for making a telephone call. The final irony is that the urgers surrounding Mr Fraser and telling him to sack Senator Withers were senior National Country Party Ministers Nixon, Anthony and Sinclair. For how long will the Liberal Party tolerate those double standards?</PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of ministerial responsibility, in the last couple of weeks we have heard quoted, ad nauseam, what the Prime Minister said about that in 1972: That, of course, if a Minister was aware of maladministration in his Department and did nothing about it he should resign. But he said also that if there were a serious blunder in the department, even if the Minister were not aware of it, he should still resign. That was his view, in 1972, of ministerial responsibility. In 1982 Senator Durack said that a Minister should not resign unless he were personally responsible. That is a million miles from the Fraser view of ministerial responsibility as expressed a decade earlier, but even on the Durack test, Mr Nixon should go. He was personally responsible. He was told of blackmail, bribery and corruption in the meat inspection service. He did nothing , yet he stays. Time and again new standards are dreamed up and then blown away by the fierce wind of prime ministerial cynicism. The only constant for this Government is that the Country Party is never guilty. There is no standard or doctrine of ministerial responsibility beyond that. The Prime Minister said in his 1975 election speech:</PARA>
<PARA>What can be done immediately, and must be done, is to establish-for the first time in three years-sound and honest management of Australia's affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>If another Opposition leader were to repeat that today and to substitute 'seven' for 'three' it would be, to use a word much favoured by the Prime Minister, appropriate. I wonder whether this man, the Prime Minister, this now self- appointed judge of the evidence before the Woodward Royal Commission, realises what he is doing in a constitutional sense-in the sense in which that word is used to describe all the conventions and practices under which we operate? Do all the Liberal Party members of Parliament endorse what the Prime Minister has done? He has now set himself up to judge the evidence and findings of a royal commission on the basis of a weekend's reading, as one who takes an interested position in consultation with others who are an even more directly interested position. He puts himself above the assessment of a distinguished judge who took months to sift the evidence, having first heard of all of it, and who had no vested interest in the outcome. This is the Prime Minister, who, last year, proposed to the Premiers that Mr Justice Woodward should head an inquiry into industrial relations. He now attacks Mr Justice Woodward, as he attacked Mr Kelly. All this from the man who talks about propriety, whose lofty arrogance, he seems to imagine, marks him as a man of principle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to Senator Tate for drawing to my attention what Mr Ellicott said about Mr Justice Woodward when he was appointed head of ASIO. Mr Ellicott said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Obviously the personality of the person is tremendously important. The Government, as did the previous Government, has confidence in the capacity of Mr Justice Woodward to bring to bear in this organisation those attributes which are obviously necessary. They are not always attributes which are essential to the judicial function. This position requires a great deal of practical common sense and a good administrative capacity. These are gifts which His Honour has demonstrated he has in the experience that I think all of us have had with him. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said earlier, since by prime ministerial assertion it has now been decreed that the judgment of Mr Justice Woodward is not to be trusted, will the Prime Minister review all the security decisions taken by ASIO when Mr Justice Woodward was its head-security decisions which would have affected the careers of people and about which those people themselves were not even told? Are not the implications of that very serious? The Prime Minister asserts that the judgment of Mr Justice Woodward is suspect and wrong. If the Prime Minister is to be believed, there should be a reassessment, by someone who is competent, of all the security decisions made by ASIO while Mr Justice Woodward was its head. I would not like to hold my breath waiting for the Prime Minister to respond to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Judges, by convention, do not enter into public debate-for very good reason. But is this judge supposed to stand by mutely and take this prime ministerial denunciation of his findings-a denunciation, I repeat, based on a hasty weekend reading of the report by an interested party and in consultation with even more deeply interested parties? The judge may well decide to do so out of respect for his profession and the now sure knowledge that he will still be around when Malcolm Fraser has gone. Public servants were once expected to act almost anonymously through their Minister, and the Minister took responsibility. Do the new Fraser rules mean, for example, that the Crimes Act will have to be amended to let public servants disclose information which they need for their defence, or are we to expect a class of people to remain defenceless-an idea which is totally at variance with existing law and custom? If this is to go on we shall have to rethink our entire system of public administration. I understand that the Prime Minister's latest stunt, an inquiry into that matter, also fell rather flat on its face in the House of Representatives today. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, there is only one alternative-to clear this Government out. It has run its course. The Liberal Party can then purge itself of this man and he can retire to brood on his sins. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon to discuss the report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry. I hope to concentrate almost totally on that report and on the propositions, recommendations and actions that have come out of it. I was interested to hear Senator Walsh talking of the role of the Royal Commission and in particular of the Royal Commissioner. As is normal in this chamber, Senator Walsh generally confined himself to personalities and not to the real issues. Surely the Royal Commissioner is capable, as is any human being, of making a mistake, of having evidence that is perhaps not entirely accurate put before him. Mistakes he may make may be related to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I presume that Senator Walsh makes the assumption that it is totally wrong to query any conclusion arrived at by the Royal Commission. That assumption is not entirely capable of substantiation. The great bulk of the Royal Commissioner's findings and recommendations to the Government have been put into place or are in the process of being put into place. The mere fact that in one or two cases a differing view from the judgment of the Royal Commissioner is taken is not extraordinary-far from it. It might well be a perfectly normal reaction to a proper measure of vigilance over the reports on an important industry such as the Australian meat industry, or indeed of any other industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commission, the report of which the Senate is discussing this afternoon, arose on about 13 August 1981. It was appointed as a result of the revelation in America of adulterated meat or, more accurately, I believe, horse meat found in that country having been imported from Australia apparently as boneless beef. There is no doubt at all in the mind of the Government or in the mind of the Australian population that the investigations of this Royal Commission and the great mass of its conclusions and recommendations make a very valuable contribution to correcting the faults that have developed over many years. Many of those faults developed purely as a result of human weakness, I suppose. Often those sorts of faults are not revealed until a chance incident occurs. These has been some concern-I put it at least as high as that-about the royal commissioner's handling of the report of the Kelly Committee of Inquiry to Examine Commonwealth and State Meat Inspection Systems and, more particularly in that case, of the references and reflections that are made on the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon. </PARA>
<PARA> In this sort of discussion where we are taken into the field of personalities, be they inside the Parliament or outside, there is always some measure of emotionalism. I suggest to the chamber that, irrespective of whether a Minister for primary industry is a member of this Government or a member of an ALP government, it is almost crazy to imagine that he would have any involvement with anything that would be significantly damaging to an industry in Australia such as the meat industry. The meat industry, which was the subject of this inquiry, represented in Australia a total production value in 1981 of something like $3.2 billion. It has an export earning capacity of no less than $1.3 billion, a capacity earned by finding markets, very often with significant difficulty, in no fewer than 60 nations around the world. To imagine that that sort of circumstances, that sort of industry, could be threatened with the full knowledge and cognisance of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) is almost a crazy assumption. </PARA>
<PARA> This industry not only represents those statistical matters in the Australian context but, more particularly, it also involves itself with a large range of employment, from the basic livestock producer, through to the transport industry , the abattoirs, the processing works, and ultimately the transport of the exported commodity to other countries. Likewise, the industry, through its research and breeding capacity-it is a famous industry in both those fields-is of great significance to Australia's trade relationships and her contribution to the economies of many countries around the world, in particular, the countries to our immediate north. The Minister himself, in this circumstance, has a deep- seated background in the very industry under discussion. I mention these matters to highlight the fact that it appears to be a ridiculous assumption that a responsible Minister in this country could in any way involve himself in circumstances which would denigrate the capacity of an industry such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of this Royal Commission-I look at it only briefly-began as a result of the horse meat incident of August 1981 in the United States of America . I want to recall that the reaction to that circumstance was immediate, quite dramatic and absolutely effective. So it needed to be. The product itself, in Australia and in America, was impounded and the works that were involved were closed down. We can all well recall the public outcry that followed the revelation of sales of horse meat instead of beef in the United States of America, bearing an Australian brand. It was an outcry which began in the livestock industry itself, in the producer field, but which spread, I believe, to every Australian. It was likely that that would be the case because our reputation as Australians was at stake. We in this country need to develop, probably more than anything else at this time, a significant pride. The circumstances that surrounded the outbreak of this problem were indeed seen as a reflection on the reputation and the pride of every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of continuing the rapid action taken by the Minister and the Government on that occasion, there was established the Royal Commission whose report we now discuss. That Commission was established and in place within one month of the actual occurrence in America. The Royal Commission headed by Mr Justice Woodward was appointed on 12 September 1981. Its area of investigation included the administrative arrangements of the export meat industry and an investigation of malpractices, of allegations over 10 years, and whether those allegations were properly dealt with, and any illegality or corruption that may have been found in response to those allegations. The report of that Commission was brought down on the 17th of this month. </PARA>
<PARA> After substitution had been revealed, the Commissioner commended the Department and the Minister on the efforts to which I have just referred; his further suggestions and recommendation were already in train. Many of his recommendations had been implemented and most of the others were under close consideration and probably close to implementation. Substitution naturally relates to inspection, and that is where in this chamber, in our discussion, and where the Royal Commissioner himself came basically in contact with the Kelly Committee, whose investigations were concerned with the matter of meat inspection. That is one of the great problems that relate ultimately to the substitution circumstance, because inspection in this country has to this point been a dual inspection system which has been very costly and very cumbersome, and from many points of view totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet there is an absolute case for the Federal control of export standards and export licences. Similarly, the States, with their concern for their own sovereignty, to this point at least, have insisted on being involved in the inspection of meat. It is to be hoped that in the not-too-distant future a solution will be found to this very great problem, because there is no shadow of doubt that the quality requirements of our competitors around the world, not only in primary industry but also in secondary industry, are extremely high. Australia must meet-I believe that it will meet and is meeting-the challenge of those standards. Only by meeting that challenge will we successfully compete in an ever more competitive world. </PARA>
<PARA> It was in November 1978 that the Minister for Primary Industry appointed the Kelly Committee to look into the problem of meat inspection and to come up with a strong recommendation for its solution. Mr Kelly exhibited a very great determination to come to a conclusion and finally came down with his recommendation for an Australian meat inspection service, which was to be a single service which would overcome and replace the dual service under which we had laboured for so many years. I want to make it abundantly clear that when that recommendation was brought down by the Kelly Committee in February 1980, the Minister concerned, Mr Nixon, took then, as he has taken since, every possible means of establishing the recommendations of that Committee. I believe that about seven or eight meetings of the Australian Agricultural Council have occurred since that time and the question of establishing an Australian meat inspection service has been in the forefront of consideration. Of course, the ultimate implementation of such a system needs the total and absolute co- operation of all the States, and that is where the problem lies basically at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the comments of Mr Kelly in the passage of his report where he referred to 'bribery and corruption' and to 'minor skulduggery'. He reiterated that the Australian Meat Inspection Service was the ultimate objective and the main area of his inquiry. He believed that these other matters were on the periphery of his investigation. When pushed for evidence he repeatedly advised the Minister, as did other men who were involved with the inquiry, that there was no specific or hard evidence. There was nothing of a specific nature available from Mr Kelly or any other member of his Committee that would warrant the establishment and continuance of police investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically this is the answer to the constant suggestion that the Minister for Primary Industry failed to respond. He certainly did respond. he sought that the Director of the Bureau of Animal Health, Mr Gee, follow up these suggestions, these allegations, vague though they may be and although they were described as not being capable of being put together as hard evidence. In spite of those things the Minister had his Director follow those suggestions and propositions as far as it was humanly possible to do. Mr Gee came back to the Minister several times and on every occasion he confirmed that in his view there was no way in which the matter could be followed through to a prosecution or even to further successful investigation. There were no names, no addresses; there were no hard facts on which an investigation could continue. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier in the day, Mr Kelly's main thrust was the meat inspection problem. The Kelly report was not a confidential document. it was around for 18 months without even a question being asked. The Royal Commissioner said that if, in April 1982, he had been reporting his findings-he would have reported that there were no problems in the meat industry. That is an extraordinary thing to say and it reflects on the whole problem that confronted the Minister and the industry. A further three months of intense investigation was needed to uncover some meat inspectors and even some police who were involved in the problems. There were no cases of species substitution of meat before late 1979. There is no mention of meat substitution in the whole of the Kelly report and no evidence of Mr Kelly raising these matters with the Minister. As I read the report the only matters that were raised with the Minister were matters referring to perks, cheap meat and this type of circumstance which, of course, has been acted upon severely and against which all sorts of controls were written into the rules and regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that in fairness we should remind ourselves of what the Minister did in the face of the revelation and concern that occurred in August 1981. As I mentioned earlier, he deregistered a whole range of establishments. He instituted forthwith spot checks in all States of the Commonwealth. He increased security and surveillance in the whole meat industry. Within a matter of days a new system of security seals was in place. Within days a task force to co- ordinate the wide sampling and species testing of meat was also in place. Police investigations were intensified. All these things happened within a matter of days of the revelation of the circumstances that surfaced in America in August 1981. Penalties were increased to a very significant level-up to $100,000 or five years gaol or both-for the illegal export of meat. There were new security controls in cold stores, transport and containers. An outside consultant was appointed to review the whole meat industry situation. A special meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council was held on 4 September 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The quick result of all this activity can be seen in the fact that no less than 24,000 tonnes of American beef were released to the American market on 4 September, some three weeks after the original finding of meat substitution on the American mainland. Some $40m worth of meat was released into the American market. That is evidence of the effectiveness and strictness and speed of the action taken by the Government, the Minister and his Department in the face of the revelations to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer for one moment to the Export Control Act 1982 because it is relevant to the discussion this afternoon. That Act was brought down in March 1982. It established strong, decentralised control and management. It sought stronger compliance and investigations by the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. It seeks to raise the calibre of the inspection staff. These are matters that finally have to be agreed to by unions and State governments as well as the meat industry. They are matters that clearly will increase the effectiveness of control over his important export industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner said: 'I have no doubt that the industry has never been more free of malpractice than it is today.' Further, he said that 'in consequence of the strong reaction of the Minister and the Department, and the establishment of the Royal Commission itself, the current level of malpractice is lower than it has ever been.'</PARA>
<PARA> Lest we become too emotionally concerned it is also worth while to remember that in the American meat industry the average rate of rejection is 0.5 of one per cent. Over recent years the amount rejected from New Zealand has been 0.3 of one per cent, from Australia 0.2 of one per cent and from Canada 0.8 of one per cent. I am not suggesting that we should not become better-of course we should; but on those grounds over recent years Australian meat compares more than favourably with other meat imported into the United States. I refer again to some of the words of the Commissioner. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence to suggest there was any illegality or corruption by any Minister or official in response to any allegation of malpractice in the meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Generally Ministers have been adequate and effective and the Department has acted well under the Minister's instructions. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope I am building up a proper case that suggests that the Minister, with the knowledge that he had-that is all anyone can move on-acted responsibly, that the Department and the Australian Government reacted to a great problem with speed and efficiency and with effect. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to the meeting on 11 February 1980, referred to on many pieces of paper, between the Minister and Mr Kelly and his committee when Mr Kelly presented his report to the Minister, a report which was tabled on 27 February that year. A number of confusions have become widespread about that meeting. In the first place, it was a meeting specifically to present to Mr Nixon the report on meat inspection and the recommendations of Mr Kelly. Clearly, in such a circumstance that would have been the predominant area of discussion. As the time of that meeting has been stated and confirmed to have been about 20 minutes , it is unlikely that a great deal of time could have been spent on other allegations. There were suggestions-no more than suggestions-of malpractice in a number of peripheral areas. Mr Kelly described them in a number of ways, none of them seriously, mostly in his inimitable whimsical manner. Although they were proven to be at that time incapable of being developed into hard evidence or into circumstances that could be followed up with any real hope of success, the Minister charged the Director of the Bureau of Animal Health to follow those suggestions, those implications, and to see whether indeed any form of real useful evidence could be established that might develop into a proper base for prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA> I close my remarks by saying that the meat industry incident and its solution have proven the need for absolute vigilance in this great industry. Our capacity for that vigilance has been assisted by the report of this Royal Commission. It has equally been identified that the Minister involved sought to do his job, as indeed it should be done, with speed, with accuracy and in a comprehensive way. The result has been the rehabilitation, if one likes, of an industry that was at least momentarily severely threatened. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are discussing the report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry. The vast bulk of this report deals with the range of allegations that have been made in recent times in relation to practices within the industry. Although very little has been mentioned of these malpractices, it is worth remembering that they are the essential feature of the report. I will detail the types of problems that were in the industry and which were raised in the report. They were species substitution; local connivance in overseas malpractices; substitution of local for export meat; false descriptions of age, quality and cut; misuse of Government stamps; false statements of slaughter dates; forgery of transfer certificates; failure to obtain export documents; forgery of export documents; corruption of Government officials; pet food in smallgoods; illegal knackery operations; breaches of knackery operations; failure to dye meat and deliberate mis-descriptions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the tally of problems that were detailed in this report. On any description, I think that list is certainly one that must give any government in charge of the various government instrumentalities concerned with the meat industry pause. I do not believe that it can be shrugged off as lightly as the Government has done. Later in my speech I will come to the matters involved with Government and ministerial responsibility. But I wish to concentrate briefly on those aspects of malpractice which I have just detailed. They are indeed a list of problems that have threatened the existence of a billion-dollar industry. It is not possible to suggest that those practices occurred and at the same time to suggest that no one should take responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> What is undisputed in the report-Senator Scott reaffirmed this-is that the report has some trenchant criticisms of the Department of Primary Industry and of the Australian Federal Police. It is not only Mr Nixon who is concerned in this matter but also Mr Newman. If one took the bulk of the report to weigh up which of those two bodies received the most trenchant criticism, it would certainly not have been the Department of Primary Industry, but rather the Australian Federal Police, which falls under the portfolio of the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman. Although many of these allegations were referred to the Australian Federal Police at no stage did the police undertake diligent investigation. Indeed, Mr Justice Woodward said that very little attention was paid at the various stages to the allegations referred to them. At one stage he allowed them to be let off the hook on the basis that the Department may not have pressed one set of allegations in an urgent manner. I suspect that in that case the onus falls back on the Department. But on balance I think that the Australian Federal Police must take a large amount of the responsibility for what resulted from not investigating the allegations that had been made. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike Senator Scott, I think that one cannot be too sanguine about the activities of the Department of Primary Industry even after the allegations were referred to it and after they became public. The Department, in its final submission, refers to itself and its activities as proving to be inefficient, costly, poorly managed, overstaffed and in many respects corrupt. At that point Mr Justice Woodward said that he could not but concur. Surely within the report we do have a listing of gross maladministration, gross practices, corruption, forgery and a range of other activities that are serious and would be serious in any industry. They are serious in this industry because of the delicate nature of the United States market, which is our major source of exports. I think that in this case one must pause and seriously consider such a report being handed down by a royal commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that it is possible to say of a royal commission report that anything in it is necessarily true. Such an assertion, I believe, is absurd. One must take a royal commission report in the way that one takes other detailed inquiries, even of the most eminent kind. One must take the evidence that they present, the cogency of their arguments, the marshalling of their facts and the connection of their conclusions to their premises. But I think if one reads Mr Justice Woodward's report into the Australian meat industry, in as unbiased a light as one can manage, one must be struck by the fact that in this report there is considerable attention to detail and that a considerable attempt is made by the Royal Commissioner to link the evidence in a reasonable way to his conclusions and to his recommendations. Indeed, unlike the Costigan Royal Commission on the Acitivites of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, Mr Justice Woodward allows himself only one brief moment of levity, when he refers to the trembling inspectors who may 'find fault with the work of a large and perhaps excitable slaughter man with a knife in his hand'. </PARA>
<PARA> The report maintains a thorough and, I believe, consistent and logical argument from start to finish. I think it is on that basis and on the basis that the Royal Commissioner presumably is acting under his charter in a manner in which he has been directed, that one cannot brush aside the comments that he makes about ministerial responsibility. Of course, one would expect a government as beleaguered as this Government to approach this particular report in a much more political way than it has approached other royal commission reports in calmer times. I think the example has been oft quoted of the way in which Senator Withers was treated in the royal commission report that brought down the findings of some impropriety on his part. Surely the reasons for the Government' s differing approach on this occasion lies in the sensitivity of the Government at this time. That is not to be wondered at and it should be taken into account when considering its response to this royal commission report. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very difficult for anybody who wishes to stand outside the mud- slinging that has gone on to weigh up in an impartial way what the Royal Commissioner has said about ministerial responsibility and what the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has said about ministerial responsibility. I think we must take it that the Prime Minister is seeking to defend one of his senior Ministers at this particular time for reasons other than those raised in this report. I do not think anybody in Australia would be surprised that that is the case. However, I think it goes beyond that when the Prime Minister seeks to call into doubt the points that the Royal Commissioner has made in this regard. I do not see them as an essential item in this report but I do see them as an important item in the report. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the point that Senator Scott discussed at some length, that is, the report of the Kelly Committee of Inquiry to Examine Commonwealth and State Meat Inspection Systems. In fact, in the first speech that I made in this place in relation to meat last year, I discussed at some length the Kelly report. It is not true, as the Prime Minister has said, that to the best of his knowledge no attention had been paid to the Kelly report. That is not correct. I will, however, accede to the fact that the Kelly report was about meat inspection. Mr Kelly, in his comments since the report was put down has said in his own defence that he is a single minded person and that, indeed, what he was about at the time was to look at meat inspection. However, there are a number of comments that must be made in this regard. Mr Kelly, at the time he met the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) made comments other than those that went into the diary. He made comments to other people, some of them in this chamber, about the problems that he had uncovered. I quote a section in the report taken from a minute sent to the Acting Secretary of the Department. It is a record of the meeting between Mr Kelly and the Minister. The section states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee in meeting the Minister last week expressed strong views as to the 'sordid' nature of the meat industry and meat inspection. Particular reference was made to examples of graft and the misuse of inspector power, both by DPI and State inspection staff and to the poor reputation that the DPI service has in too many quarters of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>It has subsequently been stated that there was not sufficient evidence available in hard form to do anything with these allegations. I suggest that these allegations are of a very serious nature in an extremely important industry and that the Minister did have an obligation to follow them up. It is not sufficient to say that the Committee did not have hard evidence. The seriousness of these allegations should surely have prompted the Minister to go to Mr Newman and seek the support of the Australian Federal Police for a thorough investigation of matters at that time to see whether hard evidence could be uncovered. Surely that is the nub of the Minister's job. It is said that hard evidence was not uncovered by a committee which was looking at something completely different. But it had turned up, as part of its investigation, some serious allegations. One would not have expected the Committee to have that hard evidence. But one would certainly have expected the Minister to put in train a thorough investigation of the matter by the Federal Police. That investigation did not take place. There is no evidence of a thorough investigation by senior departmental officials of the Department of Primary Industry into those allegations. I say again that those allegations are of a serious nature. As Senator Scott has already stated, the inspection system is at the heart of our export trade. Allegations made about corruption within the inspection system must have given pause to anybody. This could have extended further. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me too, judging from the evidence obtained by Mr Kelly, in his investigation, that it is unlikely that an investigation as thorough as the one conducted by Mr Kelly, which even Senator Scott praised, would not have turned up some quite considerable problems in the inspection system, ones which surely ought to have been followed up at that time. What we have to examine in relation to this and other problems the Government has raised is ministerial responsibility. The Government's doctrine eventually must be seen to be one under which a responsible Minister in no way can be held responsible. That, I suggest, is an absurd doctrine-a doctrine which will not serve this country well in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats do not believe that the Westminster system of ministerial responsibility can be called a fair system. One is not interested in whether ministerial responsibility is fair or otherwise. What we are talking about is that somebody finally has to accept responsibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree that the buck has to stop somewhere, and that is not necessarily a fair thing. I think the Prime Minister spelt it out in very clear terms in a statement in 1972, in which he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They ought to be aware of all major matters and, therefore can be clearly and directly responsible for them. </PARA>
<PARA> But if a major blunder occurred in a department of real importance to Australia and if the Minister were unaware of it, that Minister should accept responsibility . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That seems to me to spell out what most people at that time believed we were talking about in terms of ministerial responsibility. It is not good enough for the Government to say 'Well look, he did not know', or 'He did know', or 'He tried to do this', or 'He tried to do that'. The arguments are not about individual failings or otherwise. Indeed, the new doctrine put down by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) that a person should resign only if there have been individual failings is the one exception made in the Westminster system, when this consideration is not brought into play. The Westminster system does not refer to a personal failing. A personal failing suggests that a Minister should resign, not on a point of ministerial responsibility but because he is no longer a fit person to be a Minister. That is the doctrine which is alive in Britain and which is probably in most people's minds best associated with Mr Profumo, a British Minister for War. His was a personal failing and that made him unfit to be a Minister. The doctrine of ministerial responsibility did not apply in that case. As I said, this is a hard and harsh doctrine. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that if the new doctrine of ministerial responsibility that is being propounded were to be the one which became general in this country, particularly in private enterprise, the problems we would have in industry and commerce would be magnified alarmingly. Indeed, even within the law we do not recognise such a doctrine. Within the law we visit upon directors of companies responsibility for actions. They cannot rise in court and claim that they knew nothing about a certain activity, particularly if that were an activity of which, under their directorship, they ought to have been aware. The fact that they were not aware of it is not a claim to innocence. At some point we must re-establish the very harsh doctrine under which somebody eventually has to take the responsibility for what goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not talking about the personal propriety of the individual Minister or whether he has been a fair, reasonable or honest person. These considerations are entirely beside the point. Rather, we are suggesting that somebody must finally accept responsibility for the problems that arise. If that is not the case we have finally reached the stage in this country where nobody accepts responsibility for what goes on. If that is so, the Government has established a doctrine which will be used in future not only by political parties in government, but also by other political parties when they are in government. It will be a system of buck passing, of duck shoving and of evasion of responsibility. It will also, of course, lead to what we have seen appearing on the scene, namely, bureaucratic scapegoating. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought a Public Service union official made a rather apt comment in relation to this. He said that a wink is as good as a nod. In other words, he was saying that if a Minister is not going to be tramping around with heavy boots, why should a public servant stick his neck out? I think that we will see this sort of flow on. If the new doctrine of not knowing something is going to be used by the Minister, presumably it can be used by his departmental head and every officer under him. The idea now is to know as little as possible because then one cannot be held accountable. That is not good practice in a bureaucracy. It is not good practice in private enterprise. In fact, such a practice is not acceptable under the law for the group in our society that the Government keeps talking about supporting. In fact, the Government has set in place a series of laws which affects private enterprise and which it now says does not apply to it and its dealings with its own bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the two matters concerning the gross inefficiency which has been turned up within the Department and within various Government instrumentalities in relation to the meat industry give us some unease when we hear a variety of other allegations floating around. Allegations have been made, for example, concerning the fishing section of the Department of Primary Industry. I am sure that is not the only allegation of which honourable senators have heard. There are allegations in relation to a number of primary products that presumably at some stage in the future will come to light. If this does happen I am afraid that there will have been set up a precedent for inactivity by this Government and by future governments of any political persuasion. That cannot be good for Government or for the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Scott made the point that it would be a ridiculous assumption to suggest that the Minister for Primary Industry would want to harm the industry. I agree totally-it would be a ridiculous assumption. I think we can give the benefit of the doubt to all the Ministers in this Government-and accept that they would wish to act in such a way as to do the best they could for this country. I think that is a reasonable assumption to make, and I am quite happy to make it. But quite frankly, I do not see what that has to do with this matter . Nowhere in the report is the suggestion made that the Minister would want to harm the industry or harm this country. I certainly would not want to make such an allegation. What we are talking about is a totally different matter. We are talking about whether the Minister is the person finally responsible for what went on. If he was-and I believe that by his own actions in offering his resignation to the Prime Minister he showed that he was-it would have been in the best interests not only of this Government but also of future governments for that resignation to have been accepted. In that way we would re-establish that very harsh doctrine that the Minister accepts final responsibility for major problems that occur within the administration of his portfolio. Only then will we have confidence that the Minister and his officer will diligently pursue matters within his own department and seek to ferret out all that he can concerning major items within his portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA> If we allow the new doctrine to remain in place we will have the worst of all possible worlds. We will have the situation in which a Minister who is assumed to be responsible will not accept responsibility. We will have in place a doctrine which says that if a Minister does not go ferreting around his department he cannot be held responsible for what he does not know. We will have departmental officials using identical justification for their inactivity for supervising their part of the department. We will have, in fact, a continual negation of what I believe has been an essential part of the way our government operates. We have a range of drawbacks within our system in which the Executive resides within the Parliament. We must make sure that we do not give away any of the conventions that have been established around the Executive that resides within a parliament-those types of conventions which indeed are essential to and necessary for the continuing function of good government. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this report of the Woodward Royal Commission has served a useful purpose. I admit, as other honourable senators have said, that the vast bulk of what the Royal Commissioner said in his report was known before the report was presented to this Parliament. However, I do believe that the Royal Commissioner has done a service to the Parliament of this country by raising in a very clear way the problem of ministerial responsibility-as the end and ultimate goal of what goes on. If that alone is maintained and if that debate can be maintained, I hope that some time in the near future we will be able to re-establish a convention which is acceptable to all sides of this Parliament, a convention which embodies what we believe is necessary from our Ministers and others who hold high office. I, for one, do not believe that that is a task which will be simple. Neither is the task of a Minister simple. It is probably one of the most onerous tasks in this country and one which is rarely accepted in the community as such. Along with that high office goes an awesome responsibility. That responsibility has to be accepted when an issue such as is the subject of this Royal Commission report occurs again in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been looking forward to the report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry for some time. I have been looking forward to considering whatever its findings were. Therefore, I should like to do just that this afternoon. I would not want to divert from my intention on the basis of what Senator Macklin had to say, except to say to Senator Macklin that if he wants to get some good information on the subject of ministerial responsibility and how it should operate in our system, he should refer to some debates on the issue where current political mileage was not to be made. There are a number of good such debates. There have been some well thought out submissions to this Senate and debates in the Senate on the subject. But I have to say that the debate that has taken place on the subject of ministerial responsibility in relation to the report on this Royal Commission is one of the least enlightened debates to which the Senate has been treated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 21 August last year, very shortly after the meat scandal had surfaced, I raised the issue in Question Time with the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry in this place, Senator Chaney. In my question I asked:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in view of the importance of the United States market to Australian beef producers, particularly producers in Queensland who are overwhelmingly dependent on the United States export trade, and in view of the potentially disastrous consequences for meat producers, processors, exporters and industry employees, there must be no room for doubt in future as to the thoroughness of investigations. All involved must be prosecuted and must face the consequences of this sabotage of our beef industry. In short, not only must justice be done but it also must be seen to be done. Therefore, would the Minister agree to propose to the Government that a judicial inquiry be instituted so that all allegations and information can be publicly presented and no doubts can be cast in the future as to the integrity of Australia's meat industry as a whole?</PARA>
<PARA>A couple of weeks after that the Government announced its intention to appoint a royal commission into the meat industry. That was a matter of considerable satisfaction to everyone involved in, and who cares about, the Australian meat industry. The issues posed back in August 1981 are as current as ever they were.</PARA>
<PARA> We now have the report of the Royal Commission, the so-called Woodward report. I would like to draw the attention of the Senate to some of the content of the report as it relates to the meat industry. There has been much pother about some small sections of the report relating to procedures of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) and the Department of Primary Industry. My concern in this case is the beef industry. I am particularly concerned that because there is a current political issue, the actual report, and the recommendations and findings of the report, will be overlooked. The urgency of the Government attending to the matters raised by this Royal Commission are as real as they were back in August 1981 when there was a fear that we would lose the United States of America market. That fear should be just as alive today and every effort should be given to attention to matters raised by the Royal Commission and to action to make sure that our meat industry can be removed beyond the taint of the scandal that has hung over it for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly want to draw to the Senate's attention two sections of the report. One section relates to the problems of investigating allegations of malpractices and comments that the Royal Commissioner makes on that. The other relates to findings concerning malpractices. The Royal Commission was given terms which concerned past malpractices and allegations of malpractice as well as current ones. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . obtaining material as to past malpractices proved to be a more difficult matter. Initially, both government instrumentalities and industry had been much shaken by the substitution scandal. However, by the time the Royal Commission commenced hearing evidence, there seemed to be a general satisfaction that the new administrative arrangements--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, arrangements announced by the Minister after the scandal had broken--</PARA>
<PARA>were fully adequate to prevent a repetition of that scandal, that the USDA had been appeased by the introduction of the new security measures, and thus the export industry was free from any immediate threat. There was concern that nothing further should occur to 'rock the export boat'. </PARA>
<PARA>That underlines my concern in that whilst the Government certainly took worthwhile steps at the time in order to secure its United States market I urge the Government not to carry out that feeling that was indicated by Woodward as might have been abroad at the time he commenced his hearings. There is need for further action. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> There was thus little general enthusiasm for any detailed public investigation by a Royal Commission of past malpractices, either in the area of species substitution or elsewhere, because of the publicity that would inevitably ensue.</PARA>
<PARA> Lack of official interest in meat industry malpractices was not new. In the decade before the substitution scandal, a total of seven persons had been successfully prosecuted under various Commonwealth Acts for offences relating to export meat handling. Only one successful prosecution had been brought under the Exports (Meat) Regulations. In January 1981, the Bureau of Animal Health . . . the branch of the DPI then responsible for meat inspection, sought information and assistance from regional directors to aid a review of those Regulations, because of the considerable difficulties said to be experienced in proceeding with prosecutions. However, with one exception, the responses to this request revealed little enthusiasm for any such review. </PARA>
<PARA> The files of the Australian Federal Police . . . revealed a handful of police investigations conducted over the previous decade, most of them being unproductive. There had been no concerted effort by BAH and the police to detect and prosecute offenders. Indeed, the difficulties of prosecution inherent in the then-existing regulations, and the trivial penalties prescribed for offences,-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that those penalties have since changed-</PARA>
<PARA>provided little incentive for any such effort. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor did the files of the BAH reveal any systematic attempt to collect or disseminate information about malpractices, either in Canberra or at regional level. When the setting up of the Royal Commission was announced, steps were taken by DPI to secure the files of the BAH and to search them to provide information for the Royal Commission. To that end a Royal Commission Information Centre . . . was established. </PARA>
<PARA> The labours of the RCIC over several months produced a bundle of 164 files relating to allegations of malpractice. In no sense did these files represent a comprehensive body of information previously available to BAH in the area of malpractices. They were specially constructed files, consisting of copies of documents gleaned from an examination of some 30,000 DPI files in Canberra and regional offices and of 'off file' material. This process was necessary because it was apparent that no comprehensive system of recording allegations of malpractice as such existed either in Canberra or in the regions. I had occasion to comment on the BAH files in giving my ruling on certain allegations that documents had been improperly destroyed at the time the Royal Commission was announced. (I found there was no substance in the allegations).</PARA>
<PARA>That underlines complaints and allegations made at the time of the announcement of the Royal Commission that those who should have cared about allegations of malpractice had in fact not put any strenuous effort into those previous allegations. It justifies the claims made by those who had long since expressed concern, firstly, at an apparent lack of interest by at least a good number of those who should have had a responsibility in this area and cared about the effect that substantiated allegations of malpractice might have had on the Australian beef industry. In the second instance it shows just what a muddle things were in, and that muddle was one of the criticisms being made at the time of the announcement of the Royal Commission. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Despite the painstaking efforts of the RCIC staff to produce an intelligible collection of files for the assistance of the Royal Commission, the result was disappointing. Often there were obvious gaps in the sequence of events recorded in the documents on the file. Some files lacked either a clear starting point or a conclusion. Some lacked both. In many cases it was impossible to ascertain what action, if any, had brought the matter to finality. Nonetheless, these files did provide a useful starting point for a number of significant investigations conducted before the Royal Commission. It should be recorded that the RCIC was in no way to blame for any defects in the material provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Official indifference to, or ignorance of, the true state of affairs in the industry was reflected in some of the evidence given in the early stages of the Royal Commission. The Director of the BAH testified that he had heard rumours of local meat going for export, but never one that could be substantiated. He knew of no occurrence, and had not heard persistent rumours, of the substitution of mutton for lamb. He had heard no persistent rumours of the substitution of cow- beef for ox, nor of the use of pet food in smallgoods, nor of the substitution of local offal for export offal. The Chairman of AMLC testified that he had never heard of the relidding of cartons for any underhand purposes in his 44 years in the industry. The Australian Meat Exporters Council stated that 'the Council is not aware of any previous incidence of malpractice in the preparation and marketing of export meat', and the Executive Director testified that the question of blatant malpractice had never been raised at a Council meeting in his 19 years in office. </PARA>
<PARA>With the assistance of the Royal Commission's report one could draw some unfavourable conclusions about the interest and activity that some people had been taking in their own industry in previous years. It is only to be hoped that that will change. I emphasise that I am not interested in a witchhunt against public servants or other individuals as to whether they might or might not have done things. I am concerned only that because the situation has been tightened up in the last 12 months these people will feel that the storm has blown over and things are okay. Mr Justice Woodward continued:</PARA>
<PARA> As to the meat inspection service, the provision of free or discounted meat had been seen as a problem from time to time, and some desultory but unsuccessful efforts to control the practice had been attempted. The notion that illegal benefits were being obtained by meat inspectors on any large scale, whether by cash payments or claims for excessive overtime or otherwise, was apparently regarded as so unlikely as not to require any mention. </PARA>
<PARA> It was against this stance by government and industry officials of real or professed ignorance of malpractices that the legal staff commenced to search for evidence of past misdeeds in the industry. That search was to reveal a serious situation that should have been known to, or at least suspected by, the officials concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise that there is a significant statement in paragraph 2.28 of the Royal Commission report and I hope that in things that follow from the report that paragraph will be referred to frequently. The fact that the Royal Commission, through its search, was able to reveal a serious situation that should have been known, might be in part-I am sure it is-an indication that the Royal Commission had tools available to it that enabled it to bring together a number of things that may not have been brought together in the normal course of events. However, the fact that the Royal Commission was able to unearth so much because it had undertaken a serious inquiry might also indicate that if somebody else had undertaken a serious inquiry he might have been able to unearth something of substance. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Direct evidence of past malpractices was slow to emerge. As the Hon. C. R. Kelly had found in conducting a previous inquiry, industry managers professed to be 'proud of the fact that their behaviour was above reproach, but they all cast grave aspersions on the behaviour of their competitors'. However, when pressed for specific information about their competitiors' activities, these managers showed a general reluctance to identify individuals or to provide specific information for the use of the Commission. This approach was consistent with previous industry practice. Eventually it was revealed that there had been widespread malpractices in the industry, and that this was well known, but the industry had usually preferred to remain silent. Only rarely had industry leaders reported known or suspected malpractices, and then only when the activities of some competitors were seen as being so outrageous as to constitute a serious threat to the whole industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Apparently outrageous behaviour of the kind that was revealed and led to the royal commission was not new, at least in kind. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> To this general attitude of reluctance to assist the Commission, there were a few notable exceptions. These were persons who believed that the long-term interests of producers and of law-abiding processors in the industry would be better served by frank disclosure than by secrecy. These persons provided valuable starting points for investigations by the Royal Commission, and it is to their credit that they did so. </PARA>
<PARA>All I can say, in view of the attitude outlined by the Royal Commission's report of other people associated with the industry, is thank heavens there were those few people who were able to help the Royal Commission start a useful inquiry. Those paragraphs I think indicate very clearly that there was a serious problem. Indications are in the report that as a result of the scandal and the appointment of the Royal Commission, as well as government action subsequent to that in the export meat industry, it is unlikely that such malpractices are as widespread at present. However, when we can settle down and consider the merits of the report, we must make sure that we put all our efforts into ensuring that this cannot happen again. If the Australian meat industry were to face another major scandal, even if only in the distant future, the compounding effect following this scandal would be diabolical. I would like now to outline some of the findings on malpractices in the Australian meat industry as they point up areas that demand action by government and probably industry also. The fact that so many in the industry were able to be so casual about it in the past, that so many knew of malpractice but were unable, or unwilling, in at least some cases to provide any substantial information indicates a sickness in the industry which must be rigorously resisted by all concerned in the future. In his findings on malpractices, Mr Justice Woodward said:</PARA>
<PARA> The main question which the Royal Commission has been asked to answer is how widespread have malpractices been in the meat industry in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately there can be little comfort for the industry or the community in that answer. It is clear that malpractices in the nature of commercial cheating have been widespread in the export industry. </PARA>
<PARA>That lays to rest the pious hope expressed 12 months ago that the people who had been caught out at that time were isolated operators. The report states further:</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly there will need to be a change of attitude amongst export meat processors generally, and a much firmer line taken by government regulatory bodies, if Australian meat is to attain the high international reputation which it ought to enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as meat for human consumption in Victoria and the Northern Territory is concerned, there is little to suggest that consumers have been cheated when buying fresh meat from their local butcher or supermarket. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand it is clear that purchasers of some meat products have not always been eating the meat they expected and have sometimes been eating an unwholesome product. There has been, particularly in the last few years, quite a large quantity of pet meat which has found its way into such products in Victoria and been consumed throughout Australia. I am speaking here of hundreds of tonnes of kangaroo, buffalo, donkey and horse-meat which was not killed or processed in the manner prescribed for human consumption, but which nevertheless found its way into the human food chain. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that it was the successful infiltration of pet meat into the human food chain in Victoria which gave several unscrupulous people the idea that the same thing might be done on a large and very profitable scale in the export trade. I believe that this has been a comparatively recent development, that only a handful of operators have attempted it, and that the amounts involved have not been very large-amounting in total, perhaps, to several hundred tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA>One has to bear in mind a comment by Mr Justice Woodward elsewhere in the report that he could not undertake an exhaustive inquiry into all the malpractices that might be identified, one reason being that he had to report. There is no implied criticism of the Government in that, because it was important for the sake of the industry that he bring in a report of substance as quickly as possible. However, he admits himself that his report is not exhaustive in that sense. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Another area of malpractice which has caused particular concern, because of its potentially very serious repercussions in a vital market, has been that involving halal slaughter and certification. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence given to the Commission in private sittings (because of the sensitivity of the subject) showed conclusively that industry arrangements for securing proper religious slaughter and certification for Muslim markets have not worked. </PARA>
<PARA>I can only say that I hope the sensitivity of the market has not been what has deferred a proper investigation of this in the past. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> There have been widespread abuses of the system by industry, considerable inefficiency on the part of the major Muslim group claiming to ensure the religious nature of the slaughter and some corruption among Muslim slaughtermen. Costs to the industry have been far too high. </PARA>
<PARA> Government authorities have, naturally enough, been reluctant to become involved in religious matters, but it is now clear that, up to a point, they must. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed they must for the sake of our industry. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The final issue which I need to deal with in this summary of malpractices relates to the corruption of government officials. </PARA>
<PARA> The most disturbing evidence to emerge from this inquiry has concerned bribery and corruption of a number of DPI meat inspectors and some DPI veterinary officers and Australian Federal Police officers. It is impossible to avoid using words such as 'bribery and corruption' in this context, although it is important to understand that, with a few exceptions, the value of bribes was not substantial and the corresponding neglect of duty not heinous. </PARA>
<PARA> In many cases the bribe has taken the form of valuable quantities of free meat or very cheap meat not available to employees of the meatworks concerned. In a number of cases cash payments or fraudulent overtime claims have been involved. In each of the cases I have in mind, there has been a regular, valuable benefit on which no tax has been paid. </PARA>
<PARA> Sometimes such benefits have been extracted from unwilling operators by the abuse of inspectors' powers. </PARA>
<PARA> Most often the meat has been given, or the payments made, to ensure that the meatworks will not be subject to unusually vigorous supervision by inspectors- that it will be treated at least as leniently as its competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> However in some cases payments were made to ensure that a blind eye was turned to clearly improper practices. In the case of police officers, and a senior meat inspector, meat was given and payments were made respectively in order to secure advance warning of troublesome inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA>That might explain the inconclusiveness of some of the files referred to earlier . The Royal Commissioner adds:</PARA>
<PARA> The really disturbing feature of these revelations was that the people concerned were not evil-many of them would have been regarded as reliable and effective officers. They were ordinary Australians, in positions of some responsibility, who were either demanding, or at least accepting, clearly improper payments which could only have the effect of compromising them in the performance of their duties. The surprisingly widespread nature of these abuses suggests the need to watch all areas of government licensing and control where the decision of an inspector on the job, or similarly placed official, can make a significant commercial impact on persons in business. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Justice Woodward apparently felt that he could not make the comment that I would like to make now. The surprisingly widespread nature of these abuses suggests to me that such abuses had obtained for a very long time. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I urge the Government to take all appropriate action to implement this report and to continue to maintain the priority that it has given in the last 12 months to making sure that the reputation and conduct of the Australian beef industry are beyond reproach. Speed is essential. I can only hope that the political furore with which the Opposition has chosen to surround this report will not cloud its real substance, value and urgency for the Australian meat industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One hopes that this evening, or within the next few sitting days in this place, we will have the final round in the saga of the great Australian meat export racket. Certainly no one hopes more than I do that this is the case. It is rather interesting now to retrace the history of this saga and reflect on what I said when I first raised the matter in this place on 7 March 1978. In part, I said, as recorded in Hansard of that date:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over a period of time a number of meatworks, some of which have Commonwealth registration to slaughter for export and others of which do not have this registration have been processing meat for export which has not been inspected by Commonwealth meat inspectors. Some of this illegally processed meat destined for export can be of inferior quality. What has been occurring is that this meat which is not inspected for export has been brought into registered export works, the packaging has been changed, the meat has been stamped illegally with a Commonwealth stamp made without the knowledge of the meat inspector, and then it has been sent overseas. The most obvious reason for such an operation is to maximise profits for the processors. </PARA>
<PARA>On the following day, in another place in answer to a question the then Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) said in part, as recorded at page 507 of the House of Representatives Hansard of 8 March:</PARA>
<PARA> It would seem that there is no basis now for Senator Primmer's allegations. </PARA>
<PARA>I go back a little further than the date when I initially raised this matter. Last Saturday morning, going through my in tray, in my office in Warrnambool, I found a letter. It was from the then Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Sinclair, and was dated 21 November 1977. It was written to a Mr Alexander of 45 Erin Street, Richmond, Victoria. As I understand it, Mr Alexander was at that time a councillor on the Richmond City Council. It would appear that he had some knowledge of what was going on at a certain meat establishment somewhere in that region. Interestingly enough, the letter showed that people high in authority in this country knew about this malpractice long before I did. I quote in part from Mr Sinclair's letter to Mr Alexander, dated 21 November 1977:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Alexander,</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has passed your letter of 21 October 1977, concerning allegations of export of offal from an unregistered establishment and its possible contamination with salmonella organisms, for direct reply on his behalf . </PARA>
<PARA>That, in my view, proves beyond all doubt that the Prime Minister of Australia as well as the then Minister for Primary Industry were made aware of what was going on in at least one establishment in Melbourne some four of five months before I raised the matter. It is also worth noting that Mr Alexander had written to the Prime Minister on 21 October and it took a month before he received a reply-a month in which no action whatsoever was taken. I seek leave to have a copy of that incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA> The Prime Minister has passed your letter of 21 October 1977, concerning allegations of export of offal from an unregistered establishment and its possible contamination with salmonella organisms, for direct reply on his behalf . </PARA>
<PARA> My Department views such allegations with grave concern, particularly because of the export trade and public health implications. Similar complaints made in Melbourne in recent months are already being investigated by the Commonwealth Police. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Animal Health, which is responsible for the export inspection of meat and meat products, is aware of your correspondence with Colonel McArthur of the Australian Meat Board on this matter and has passed this information on to the Commonwealth Police. I am grateful for your offer to make yourself available during any investigations and the Commonwealth Police will be advised accordingly. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SO7">Senator PRIMMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately we are not privileged to know exactly what Mr Alexander said to the Prime Minister in his letter but, as I have said, it is proof positive that both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Primary Industry knew all about what was going on. Yet, the Minister for Primary Industry could later suggest that I was making wild assertions. That statement can be found at page 508 of the House of Representatives Hansard of 8 March 1978 .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A study of Hansard over the period will show that several members of the Opposition in this place asked questions relating to this matter. They included Senators McLaren, Keeffe, McClelland, Gietzelt and me. Again, nothing happened. I expressed the view that Ministers, departmental heads and the Australian Federal Police were adopting an ostrich-like pose-they put their heads in the sand and hoped like hell that the problem would go away. Of course, it did not. It became worse with the export at a later date of substituted meats. Then, a little over 13 months ago, the dam burst due to the vigilance of the American authorities. By that time we had another Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon . It is interesting, in the light of the findings of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry, particularly paragraphs 1.62 and 1.64 wherein the Royal Commissioner fingered Mr Nixon, to look back at what Mr Nixon had to say about yours truly in another place on 16 September 1981. In reply to some matters raised by the honourable member for McMillan, Mr Cunningham, on page 1415 of the House of Representatives Hansard Mr Nixon, in part, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Primmer does not come out of this smelling like roses by any means for the part he has played. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Ministers have complained that I declined to name the source of my information, and I did. Interestingly enough, the only people who asked me to name my source of information were from the media. The then Minister, Mr Sinclair, any of his officers, or the Australian Federal Police did not ask me for that information. Surely Mr Nixon did not believe that I was going to blurt out across the media of Australia, to all and sundry, the names of my informants particularly at a time when those people were attempting to buck a very corrupt system in operation at that time. Surely Mr Nixon must realise that had I done that, those persons' jobs would have been jeopardised and their future and the future of their families would have been thrown to the wolves. Surely Mr Nixon knows, surely every member of parliament knows, that there are times when members of parliament, like members of the Press, are given information in strict confidence, on the strict understanding that the source of the information shall remain a secret. </PARA>
<PARA> I can recall one other experience some years earlier when I was placed in a similar situation. I was given highly confidential information on exactly the same understanding-that I would not release the source. That was when a Labor government was in office. When the Minister responsible became aware of the information he immediately called me to his office and, after some discussions, we worked out plans and proposals whereby my informants could talk to the police without being placed in jeopardy or anybody other than the people accused in the matter being involved. As a result of that, the police were able to move in and the issue was defused. But not so with this Government. As I said earlier, there was a head in the sand attitude; they hoped like hell it would go away-that it would disappear and that they could forget about it. I ask honourable senators just to go back again to Mr Nixon's assertion that I did not come out of the matter smelling like roses; maybe I did not but I believe I came out of this matter smelling slightly more perfumed than Mr Nixon. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the rackets that flourished for years under two Ministers of this Government. In an interview on Countrywide on 4 September last year Dr Rees, a veterinary officer with the Victorian Department of Agriculture, had this to say :</PARA>
<PARA> Because of their indifference, their lack of action over the past 3 to 4 years when officers of my Department-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the Victorian Department of Agriculture-</PARA>
<PARA>have reported to them irregularities occurring in the transfer of meat from the local market to the export market. We have drawn to their attention at least 3 cases of exporters packing local meat for export. I know that those cases have been investigated by the DPI and the Federal Police but I believe that the exporters concerned are still operating as exporters. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely that is proof that over a period of time the respected people in the community whom one would expect to take some action on matters such as this had failed dismally to put the proper amount of muscle, thought, time or whatever was required into investigating these rackets. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1978, on Estimates Committee D, my colleague Senator Walsh raised before officers of the Department of Primary Industry the matter of the misuse of the Commonwealth stamp in meat works. As everyone seems to know, in January 1980 Mr Kelly, the Chairman of the Committee of Inquiry to Examine Commonwealth and State Meat Inspection System, reported to Mr Nixon and, in that report, pointed up malpractices within the industry. In particular, at page 41, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We were also told that, in many if not all cases, the 'Australia Approved' stamp-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the export stamp-</PARA>
<PARA>was provided by works management, and if a new stamp was required, the inspectors obtained it from management. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Kelly was adamant in his report when he further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This practice should cease. </PARA>
<PARA>But again, no action was taken. The head in the sand attitude, the lethargy by the Minister prevailed, so the corruption continued. </PARA>
<PARA> From reading the Prime Minister's statement, put down in the other place a couple of days ago, relating to this matter-I do not know whether it is he who hates Bert Kelly or whether it is the person who wrote the statement for him-one would get the impression that Bert Kelly was rorting and racketeering, instead of being a very honest, upright citizen who had pointed out problems in the game at that trade. It seems to me that the Prime Minister, caught again in a rather funny situation in which he is prone to get caught, was prepared to go to hell and back to protect his National Country Party Ministers, to put the blame anywhere but where it actually lay. </PARA>
<PARA> It concerns me that this episode had to drag on for the amount of time that it has done-1977, 1978 and right through to 1981, before any action was taken, because of the lethargy, the 'don't care', 'don't give a damn' attitude that was adopted by Ministers of the Crown, by officers in the Public Service and frankly , I believe, by the Commonwealth Police Force. A friend of mine once remarked to me that the Commonwealth Police could not track a wounded elephant across a snow field. At times I think he is right. It may be that the expertise is not there within the Commonwealth Police Force; I do not know. It may be, as the Commissioner said, that some members of the Force have been rorting and racketeering and taking bribes. They may have been able to head off any thorough investigations. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this concerns me, because we live in what we are prone to call a democracy. There are many people in our society who would wax much more eloquent on that subject than I do, but surely none of us would have it otherwise. I believe, however, that our status as a democracy is in no way enhanced by the events and the time taken for their resolving in relation to this matter or many others that have been flourishing under the present Government in recent years. Rackets and cover-ups have become the norm under Malcolm Fraser's Administration . Ministers and departments have been disinclined to accept fully their duties to the Australian people. The full face of capitalism at its worst has been exposed for everyone to see, and it is not a pretty picture. The lucky country has become a haven for rorters and racketeers under Malcolm Fraser's Administration. The only way to resolve that is at the next general election to return a Labor Party government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the report of the Woodward Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry. I need not remind this chamber that the meat industry is one of the great industries that helped this country get on its feet. It is one of our great primary industries. The people involved in it, at the coal-face one might say, do not really have any control over their end product or over the price that they receive for it. So when something like this happens and we have evidence that something is amiss, it is of great importance that something is done about it. When real evidence came to hand, something was done about it with the setting up of this Royal Commission. But I guess that it is a bit indicative of our society today that there is always someone who wants to make a fast buck-or, to use the imperial term, a quick quid. There is always someone who sees the possibility of abusing the system. When that happened in this industry, it cast a pall over the whole industry for the time being, until we were able to set the Royal Commission in place and start to see what it was all about. The people who saw the possibility of this quick quid and saw their way through the system just about brought this industry to its knees in a very short time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I guess that it is unfortunate, and it is now accepted, that a lethargy came into the Department. I suppose that it is indicative of our society. As I have said there are these sorts of people in the world. It is part of the trauma of recent times in this place where there have been indicated to us allegations of businessmen ripping off the tax system. By doing that they are ripping off you, me and every other Australian who loyally and legally, irrespective of whether he likes it, pays his tax. We hear of the padding of expense accounts. But this sort of thing happens in all sections of the community. What about the cash economy? They are the blue-collar people who, quite often working under fictitious names and working for cash only, are also ripping off the tax system. We hear about the fictitious overtime slips. So it goes on. Unfortunately, it is indicative of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that at paragraph 1.53 of the summary on page 12 of the report, the Commissioner brings home this fact when he says:</PARA>
<PARA> The really disturbing feature of these revelations was that the people concerned were not evil-many of them would have been regarded as reliable and effective officers. They were ordinary Australians, in positions of some responsibility, who were either demanding, or at least accepting, clearly improper payments which could only have the effect of compromising them in the performance of their duties. </PARA>
<PARA>That itself is the damning indictment. They were ordinary Australians doing what I guess they had come to expect as the norm in their jobs. As I have said, it is indicative of a malaise which is spreading right around our land and with which all sections of the community have to come to grips ultimately. It is a malaise that crosses political barriers. The only way in which we can overcome it is to recognise the fact that all people have to look to the common good of this great country of ours. Unfortunately, that is what the report is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish that this chamber as well as the other place could come to grips with the problem of this general malaise. Unfortunately, we have seen an attempt to malign a Minister of the Crown. It is significant that the report is about the corruption that existed in the industry at the time, but it is also significant that most of the report is about the speed with which the Minister and the Department-most of those concerned-acted. Paragraph 1.19, on page 5, says:</PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the Department of Primary Industry itself, it is only fair to say that, under instructions from its Minister, it acted promptly and effectively when the meat substitution scandal erupted. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 1.20 says:</PARA>
<PARA> The steps taken were drastic, but appropriate to the situation. There was some confusion as a range of new measures were hurriedly introduced. Not all the detailed rulings made amongst the pressures of that time were sensible, but the Department did succeed in restoring the confidence of the United States Department of Agriculture in a comparatively short time and without excessive disruption or cost to the Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 1.21 says:</PARA>
<PARA> Since then, and during the Commission's hearings, the Department has, for the most part, reacted promptly and appropriately to problems that have been brought to light. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 1.61 on page 14 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Generally such matters as were referred to Commonwealth Ministers were dealt with adequately and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph 1.13 on page 4 the Department was critical of itself. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Department in its own frank self-appraisal contained in its final submission to me. The meat inspection service, in the words of that submission ' 'has proved to be inefficient, costly, poorly managed, overstaffed and . . . in some respects corrupt''. </PARA>
<PARA>So we see that the bulk of this report is really complimentary to the Department . The Department came to grips with a situation when it was found, recognised its own inadequacies and saw that the problem was remedied quickly so that our meat industry would not be harmed. But one would almost think that paragraphs 1. 62, 1.63 and 1.64 were written by another person. One wonders why they were put in after all the complimentary remarks. A sentence in paragraph 1.64 has caused most of the problems and it is the one which some of the media seem to have fastened on to. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> In my view he--</PARA>
<PARA>'He' being the Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>did not deal with this allegation in a manner that was adequate and effective.</PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, this is the one sentence out of the whole report-with all its compliments, all its recognition of and the coming to grips with, the problems- on which the whole debate seems to have centred in the last few days. Of course the allegations which are referred to-I am not going to go into them in great detail-were made by the Honourable C. R. Kelly in his report. But the comments were very general; no names and no places were mentioned, and most importantly, they were unsubstantiated. There allegations were nothing really to do with the reason for the Kelly report. They rated only a very minor mention by the Honourable C. R. Kelly. In any case, the allegations of corruption did not include meat substitution; they were about corruption and malpractice, I think is the term that has been used. They were not even substantiated but only alluded to as the Honourable C. R. Kelly went about his business. They did not include meat substitution. These malpractices, these petty thefts, without excusing them, are something which unfortunately are an every day part of our lives. I guess they happen in every industry-whether it be meat taken home, toilet rolls taken home from a store in which somebody works, biscuits, or a biro taken from a place of employment. They are all malpractices which, as I say , are unfortunately part and parcel of our lives. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the things to which Mr Kelly alluded quite properly. Yet these are the things on which the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) was supposed to act without any evidence being forwarded when inquiries were made. As I have said: No places, no names, no substantiation. The Minister acted as best he could on the information available. Because nothing further could be done at that time on the information available, a Minister has been condemned. Indeed, it has been suggested that he should resign from his position. Unfortunately this has brought out the very much overworked phrase that we have heard recently -ministerial responsibility. Senator Martin alluded to the fact that many people who are not of any particular political persuasion have looked at this matter. I would recommend that those who keep using this hackneyed phrase should read some of the debates. Senator Peter Rae alluded to them very well in this place within the last two weeks. Unfortunately, we still seem to think that when something happens and a Minister does what he can, and even though there is no evidence, under this overworked, hackneyed phrase about which so much rot is spoken- ministerial responsibility-the Minister should resign. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the Department acted so quickly and harsh measures were instituted we did not lose our credibility in world markets. That is the most important thing; that is what the Department of Primary Industry is all about. From talking to people both here and overseas I found that there was more comment in the Australian Press over a period than there was in the overseas Press. Certainly the meat substitution made the Press in sections of the United States but it was only a one or two-day affair. It did carry on here, but our officers were able to put into effect methods by which the substitution could be stopped and prevented from recurring, and gain the confidence of our overseas customers. </PARA>

<PARA> Basically the report is sound; that does not mean to say that it is 100 per cent correct. As I have said, certain paragraphs almost seem to have been written by someone else.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has been given an opportunity to examine and debate what can only be described as a very sordid episode, in respect of our world trade obligations and responsibilities, a very sordid chapter in maladministration by the Fraser-Anthony Administration and a very sordid way in which public administration of an important segment of our economy has been operating for a considerable number of years. I find it almost impossible to believe that every Government spokesman in the House of Representatives and the Senate has placed himself in a position of defending the role that the Government has played and the role that the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, has played in this whole unhappy chapter. As one listens to the debate one wonders where the Government gets the strength to defend what is an indefensible position. There is not a newspaper editorial anywhere in Australia that has not condemned out of hand the Fraser Government's handling of the Woodward Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry, and the handling of the episode involving ministerial responsibilities. One finds it difficult to understand Government members complaining that the public at large understands the Government's position whereas it is clear from all the empirical evidence, all the evidence of the inquiry, and all the evidence of newspaper reaction and public disquiet, that this Government is not only on trial but also has lost the confidence of a very substantial section of Australian public opinion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I regard to be the most serious tactical mistake that the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) has made since he assumed the mantle of leadership of this country was for him to go on the public record and attack the integrity, the standing and stature, of such an eminent person as Mr Justice Woodward who is regarded not only in the legal world as a person of impeccable integrity but also by this Government, insofar as it saw fit to have him in charge for a considerable number of years of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. The Fraser Government has attacked and defamed a Royal Commissioner, who carried out the terms of reference and the task allocated to him by the Government, in an attempt to defend its own position. </PARA>
<PARA> This is just another example of how this Government operates. It blames everybody but itself. When it comes to questions of wages and salaries, it blames the workers. When it comes to a royal commission, it blames the commissioner. When it comes to Medibank fraud, it blames the doctors. When it comes to the Australian Dairy Corporation, it blames people unknown for spiriting between $3m and $4m from a Singapore account. What does it do when it comes to tax evasion and avoidance on a mammoth scale? One eminent person, who shall remain unnamed, suggested to me in the last few days that tax evasion is the biggest scandal to hit Australian politics this century. Of course, it blames the public servants. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) blamed the Australian Taxation Office. The Prime Minister, because of the attitude he has taken with respect to tax avoidance, when he arrived back from his overseas trip had the temerity to suggest that the deficiencies existed in his Department. Senator Durack has attempted to pass the buck down the line to the Crown Solicitor and Deputy Crown Solicitors and people who are not in a position to defend themselves. Every misdemeanour and every deficiency in public administration is, in the view of this Government, always another person's fault. Never is the elected Government at fault. It is never the persons primarily responsible. As the Australian Financial Review stated yesterday in its editorial, this is the death of responsibility. The editorial went on to refer to Mr Malcolm Fraser beginning to rewrite the convention surrounding the Australian Constitution in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> If we just think about it, there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that Mr Fraser was involved in a conspiracy with the former Chief Justice and with the Governor-General in respect of the very sordid way in which he came to office in 1975. We are aware of the conspiracy that existed in this place in 1974-75. Ministers in this Government, who were then in Opposition, admitted that they set about creating the conditions for the downfall of the Whitlam Government by the obstructionist position that they took in the years 1974-75 in forcing two double dissolutions. A government that came to power on conspiracy, deceit and intrigue has continued that process over the years. Heaven only knows what else will emerge. As I understand it, more is to come in respect of the Medibank fraud. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Medical Association, in pursuit of the elevation of the prestige of its profession and organisation, has issued statements in recent days that in the last few years something like $1,000m has disappeared from public and private health insurance funds as a result of inadequate attention to detail and leadership in respect of health care services in this country. One finds it difficult to distinguish which scandal is of greater significance than the other . I can only say that all of them are totally unacceptable to the Parliament and to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot agree with the previous speaker that our trading reputation has been rehabilitated. Surely it has been dealt a death blow by the knowledge that Australia has been involved in a gigantic fraudulent method of meat substitution on the foreign market, as indeed it was on the domestic market, that the Australian Federal Police played an unsavoury role and that officials in the Department had an unsavoury role, according to Mr Justice Woodward's report. The Prime Minister believes that he can overcome the difficulties that the Government finds itself in in respect of this matter by suggesting that Mr Nixon took steps in 1981. In fact it was clear, as Senator Primmer pointed out when he drew attention to these matters in the early years of the Fraser administration, that it was common knowledge in Victoria that there was a degree of malpractice in the meat industry. He was scorned by Government spokesmen. When the Government's committee, headed by a former Minister in the Liberal Government, Mr Kelly, drew attention to these matters, it was suggested that somehow a word or two might have been left out of the report. This is the means by which the Government seeks to defend itself and to cast some aspersion on the integrity of the Royal Commissioner. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

There is a brief statement in connection with the papers and I seek leave to incorporate this in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The first is a report on new telescopes for Australian astronomy in the 1990s. Australia has established an enviable international reputation for its research in the field of astronomy. Many important discoveries and contributions to knowledge and understanding of the universe have been made in this country. The report of the Australian Science and Technology Council recognises that if this high standard of research is to be maintained, new telescopes and other instruments will be required from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> ASTEC has examined two projects: The construction of a radio telescope, the Australia telescope, and an Australian contribution to a multi-national space telescope project, Starlab. Honourable senators will have seen from the Budget announcements that the Government has decided to act on ASTEC'S recommendation and construct the Australia telescope. This is to be a bicentennial project to be completed by 1988 and it is appropriate that it should be a bicentennial project because the telescope will enable Australian astronomers to maintain their high international reputation and build on their past achievements. It is to be operated by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation but as a national facility. The Australia telescope will be a large radio synthesis telescope and will be constructed at a cost of $25m over six years. The sensitivity and resolution of the new telescope will be equal to or better than corresponding instruments in the northern hemisphere. </PARA>
<PARA> The second project examined by ASTEC is Starlab. ASTEC has recommended some public funding for Starlab and the Minister for Science and Technology recently announced that $3.33m will be made available for the Starlab project over the next two years. This will enable industry to develop and acquire the relevant new technology and in two years' time we will be in a position to decide on Australia's future participation in Starlab. </PARA>
<PARA> The second report of ASTEC to which I draw the attention of honourable senators is a background report on Australian science and technology in international co- operation and development assistance. The report draws together information on bilateral and multilateral co-operation, including specific science and technology agreements, and on development assistance programs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Mr President. That is very encouraging. I wish to say a few words in relation to the petition that I presented. I believe that the petition is fairly significant and fairly important. It was signed by nearly 850 people throughout Australia and they seek to have a stockman's hall of fame constructed at Longreach. The committee which was set up and which sought signatures for the petition was non-political. As a matter of fact one of the people on the committee is Mr Katter, the honourable member for Kennedy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After looking at sites throughout Australia, these people believe that Longreach is the place where a stockman's hall of fame, similar to the cowboys hall of fame in Oklahoma City in the United States of America, should be built. They genuinely believe that there should be some form of a museum or other building to establish an area that people from Australia and the world can visit in order to see the basis on which our early pioneers settled this country, particularly people who lived in the west in the early days. Members of the committee, volunteers, and others are gathering material and interviewing some of the pioneers who are still alive. They believe that all of this material should be housed in the hall of fame. Might I say through you, Mr President, to the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) that the committee that has been set up to call for the construction of this hall of fame is not a committee that has just made a statement or sought signatures for a petition to be put before the Senate. The committee has been very active in the way in which it has gone about its job. At this stage, it has established a fund of $1m for the construction of the hall of fame at Longreach and the shire council in the area has guaranteed in the vicinity of $300,000 for its establishment. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the way in which the committee is set up, because of the attitude of the committee, because of the way in which the committee has developed its ability to raise finance and gather support through Australia, I believe that this Government and the State governments should take some note of it. Approaching the Bicentenary celebrations I think it is important to recognise these Australian achievements. The Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt), in a letter about the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program, said that the theme was Australian achievement. It is important that this hall of fame be established and that it be established in a western area where it can provide a much needed tourist attraction. We need to establish some sort of industry in areas of unemployment. I believe that a tourist attraction such as this would alleviate the unemployment which has come about because of the downturn in the rural industries in western areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this project should be financially supported by this Government and by a number of State governments. Many people throughout Australia believe that it is shameful that Australia does not have some form of monument, some place people can visit and see what Australia was once like. The Minister can shake his head, but people are interested in this project. They believe that there should be a stockmen's hall of fame in the Longreach area so that we can see what our pioneers did. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter tonight which I first spoke about on 24 August by way of a question of the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney. The question dealt with the serious unemployment in the south-east of South Australia, which is getting worse. I did not get an answer from Senator Chaney, although he said to me on that day in answer to a supplementary question that he had no information on that matter but would check the points that I had raised and let me have a further reply. I had not had a further reply by 16 September. I then raised the matter in the adjournment debate and went on to mention quite a few other matters. I might say that I still have not had a reply from Senator Chaney about the matters that I raised. I will be dealing with them later on in my speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On Tuesday of this week, 21 September, Senator Jessop spoke on the adjournment. He endeavoured to refute many of the remarks that I had made. That is what I intend to address my remarks to tonight. Senator Jessop, on Tuesday, paid me the courtesy of letting me know that he would raise this matter but because of another commitment I was unable to be present in the Senate. I did not know what he said until I got the Hansard yesterday and read what he said. I asked the Opposition Whip's office today to let the Government Whip's office know and to advise Senator Jessop that I would be raising this matter tonight. Perhaps he is not here. I understood him to say today, when he was tabling a report, that he was leaving the country as leader of a parliamentary delegation. I am not sure whether he is leaving tonight or during the recess. I was hoping that I would get the call on the first reading of a money Bill, but that did not come about. So I now have to use the procedures of the adjournment to reply to Senator Jessop and set the record straight in quite a few areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jessop, in his opening remarks, talked about matters that I had raised. He quoted from Hansard what I had said on 16 September as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> We have a government in South Australia which was elected on a promise, among others, to stop the job rot and to get industry on its feet. Its claim at the time, that industry was lagging in South Australia under the then Labor Government, has been proved to be untrue by what has happened in the last three years. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what I said in the chamber. Senator Jessop went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that this claim cannot be supported by fact. Therefore, I regard it as an attempt to prop up the Australian Labor Party Opposition in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Labor Party Opposition in South Australia, like the Opposition here, needs no propping up. As soon as we can have an election we will have a change of government. That is all the more reason why I should raise this matter tonight. Things may be in train by the time we resume. The writs may even have been issued in South Australia to have an election. What I am saying tonight would be of no value then because John Bannon would be the new Premier of South Australia. Senator Jessop said that he wanted to raise two matters under two headings, investment and employment. He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Since the election of the South Australian Liberal Government over $3 billion has been spent in that State by companies investing in projects or conducting feasibility studies. </PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA>Those projects were identified in a publication that was produced earlier this year in South Australia under the heading 'Major Manufacturing Projects: Announced, Commenced or Completed since October 1979'. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, some very important words are contained in that statement. It is all very well to announce projects. But when will we see them come to fruition? It is all very well to say that they will be commenced and that they will be completed. Then Senator Jessop said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have a list which indicates that 22 projects are valued at--</PARA>
<PARA>He gave a whole series of figures. But he did not tell us who the companies were . He made no mention of the companies, so I am unable to check them. Having read what Senator Jessop had to say, today I went to the Library and I took out a document which was put out by the Department of Industry and Commerce. It is headed 'Major Manufacture and Mining Investment Projects, June 1982'. Later on I will refer to what Mr Stone had to say about this particular document when it came out, I think in May. I will refer also to a Press release issued by the South Australian Minister for Industrial Affairs last week, which was commented upon in the Adelaide Advertiser by Matt Abraham in an article relating to State politics. I have looked through this document and find it very interesting. No doubt this is the document which Senator Jessop was using. Under the heading ' Company: Electricity Trust of South Australia, Leigh Creek, steaming coal mining expansion, implementation' we see that the total project cost will be $130m. But there is no information available on construction employment or on production employment. We all know that Mr Tonkin is not responsible for commencing the mining at Leigh Creek. It was the late Tom Playford, a Liberal Premier, who started that project. It was nothing to do with Mr Tonkin at all. It was a Labor government in office for 10 years which saw that mining venture continue. It was at the behest of a State Labor government and through the good work done by the Labor Minister for the Media, Senator Douglas McClelland, that television came to Leigh Creek. The people there could not get that from a Federal or State Liberal government. The people at Leigh Creek are very appreciative of that service. </PARA>
<PARA> Another mining project mentioned is the Western Mining Corporation venture at Kingston in the south-east of South Australia. No figures are given for the total cost of that project. We are told that 500 people will be employed on construction and 600 people on production. But the timing is between 1981 and 1988. So this is another project which one cannot say is coming to fruition under the Tonkin Liberal Government. I will later quote some figures from the document entitled 'Compendium of Australian Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Project No. 3 December 1981' which will prove that a lot of these things were actually put in train under the Dunstan Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Mannum coal mine at the Sedan site is supposed to have a total cost of $ 100m and a remaining cost of $100m. But nothing has been done in respect of this venture. I have asked Senator Carrick questions about this in the Parliament. He has told me in reply that there has been no request from the Tonkin Liberal Government to do anything about the mining of this coal at Sedan. Of course, that would no doubt be one of the projects which Senator Jessop is talking about in respect of investment in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Preliminary studies are being carried out on the steaming coal mine at Lock, which is 130 kilometres south-west of Port Augusta. That is the stage of development of this project. We are given no figures in respect of the total cost, construction employment or production employment. Preliminary studies are also being conducted in respect of the steaming coal mine at Bowmans. Again, no figures are given in respect of this project. The document also lists the steaming coal project at Arckaringa Basin near Coober Pedy. However, we are not given figures in respect of the preliminary studies, construction and production employment. No one will argue the fact that that location was well known and might have even been found when Hughie Hudson was Minister for Mining, Minerals and Energy in South Australia in the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> No details are given in respect of the total or remaining cost of the Cooper Basin oil and gas development. However, we are informed that construction employment is 2,000 and production employment is 800. But that is another project that was started under a Labor government. I do not think that Mr Tonkin was even in the Parliament-if he was, he was on the back bench-when the Cooper Basin got underway. </PARA>
<PARA> The document also lists the Honeymoon joint uranium mining venture. Senator Jessop, Mr Wilson, Mr Tonkin in particular and Mr Brown are always talking about what a great employer of labour in South Australia uranium mines will be. This is very interesting because we see that the Honeymoon location which is 75 kilometres north-west of Broken Hill will employ 45 people on construction and 36 people on production. This is a long way short of the 15,000 jobs which we are told will be involved in these uranium mines and this includes, of course, the mines at Roxby Downs. Mannahill, another uranium mining project, has been deferred because of low prices. The cost of that project is $5m, construction employment will be 50 and, if it gets underway, it will employ 25 people. This is a very interesting document from which to quote, especially when people like Senator Jessop come into the Senate chamber and talk about so-called facts. Senator Jessop more or less tried to rebut my arguments by saying that I did not have the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> No figures are given for Roxby Downs either in terms of the total cost, the remaining cost or construction employment. We are not told what the level of employment will be if it is recommended in the feasibility study that the project get underway. However, the document does indicate that 230 people are currently living in the Olympic Dam village. Of course, that is 230 people, not 230 employees. The document also refers to the copper project at Leigh Creek. Of course, we all know that the price of copper is rock bottom at the moment. Whilst the Government in South Australia might say it can get money out of copper if Roxby Downs is mined, we all know that copper is not a valuable proposition. That was detailed by the President of the Australian Mining Industry Council at a seminar in Canberra earlier this year. We know now that it is very hard to get orders for uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jessop, Mr Tonkin and Mr Brown have put forward these pie in the sky proposals. There is not much substance in them. If they ever come to fruition the jobs will be a long way in the future. The Wallaroo Fertilizers Ltd venture is also listed in this document. The total cost of that project will be $22m and the remaining cost is $4m. No figures are given in respect of construction employment or production employment. It is important to note that it has been recently reported that the existing plant is to retrench workers in November. Therefore, I am wondering whether that project will ever go ahead and come to fruition. The Government has now decided to pay a subsidy on imported fertiliser . Many fertiliser companies in South Australia made representations begging us to oppose the subsidy paid on imported fertilisers because it will effect the jobs of local people and the sale of local fertiliser. That, again, will have some effect on whether this plant will ever come to fruition. </PARA>
<PARA> No figures are given in respect of the cost of the Asahi-CRA petrochemical joint venture. We are not told how many people will be employed. The document lists the possible sites for the venture as Whyalla, Stony Point or Port Adelaide. We now know that the possible site is Port Adelaide. But again this venture is an off shoot of the Cooper Basin which was developed under the jurisdiction of a Labor government in South Australia. The total cost of the soda ash and salt fields expansion at the ICI Australia Operations Pty Ltd development is $100m and the remaining cost $100m. Preliminary studies are being carried out. However, this is all that is being done at the present time. This is what Senator Jessop has spoken about. No figures are given in respect of how many people will be employed to construct the project; no detail is given in respect of how many people will be employed on production when the project gets underway. We are told under the heading 'Project details' that no decision has yet been made on the project. We are told that the Stony Point operation will cost $1,000m and that the remaining cost is $1,000m. However, development has been deferred indefinately. If the project ever gets underway, it is envisaged that 1,720 people will be employed on construction and 481 people to operate it.</PARA>
<PARA> Everybody knows that the coal gasification project at Port Wakefield was started by the Dunstan Labor Government. Many of us have visited the project. If I had the time to do so I could go on to quote the details contained in this document. I think I have quoted a sufficient number of projects to say that Senator Jessop is quite wide of the mark in his efforts to bolster up the chances of Mr Tonkin. Last week during the hearings of Senate Estimates Committee E I was given a document entitled 'Compendium of Australian Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Pro- jects No. 3 December 1981' by officers of the Department of National Development and Energy. This document gives details of the money that was made available to look at South Australian coal fields during the period June 1978 to June 1982. Of course, the Dunstan Labor Government was in office at that time. The document also indicates that underground coal gasification is being examined during the period June 1978 to June 1985 and that the Honeymoon in situ leach uranium project commenced from January 1977. So a Labor government has the proud record of researching and commencing many of these projects. I suppose the present Liberal Government of South Australia is trying to cash in on a lot of those things and fool people who do not do research into believing that they in fact commenced these studies and encouraged companies to come to South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer again to the documents from which Senator Jessop quoted and to an article in the Adelaide Advertiser of 11 September written by Matt Abraham. The article, which is headed 'Sorting out the Statistics', states:</PARA>
<PARA> When does 2 plus 2 equal a headache? Simple. </PARA>
<PARA> When it's a Government Press release containing the latest 'facts and figures' proving how well the South Australia economy is faring compared with the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a release arrived on Monday, containing a statement from Industrial Affairs Minister Dean Brown from Canberra on the results for South Australia of the latest Federal Department of Industry and Commerce surveys on the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Press release was a neat example of a Minister, running up to an election, with a lot of job and investment expectations to fulfil, pumping out the good news with almost indecent haste. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator Jessop was doing here on Tuesday night. The article states further:</PARA>
<PARA> It is an example of a political statement's being absorbed by the media without either the necessary facts to support the statement or the original survey's being immediately available to the Press, the Opposition, or even to government departments involved. </PARA>
<PARA> And it is an example of those figures, once issued, being enshrined into inviolable facts in political speeches, virtually within hours. </PARA>
<PARA> The Press release did have figures showing SA has a 19.5 p.c. slice of national manufacturing cake, an impressive performance which almost doubles the normal ratios for SA. </PARA>
<PARA> But what about the big rise in SA? How big was that rise over the last six months?</PARA>
<PARA> What figures were there to support Mr. Brown's statement that the State is moving against the national trend and there would be a 'substantial lift in employment' over the next 12 months?</PARA>

<PARA> Once published or broadcast, the speed with which these figures become folklore is staggering. </PARA>
<PARA>I say again that they will not become folklore in South Australia because the people in that State are realists. As Ben Chifley used to say: 'The people take notice when their hip pocket nerve starts to pinch'. That is what is happening. I mentioned earlier that Mr Stone torpedoed these documents which were put out by a Government department-the Department of Industry and Commerce. In the House of Representatives on 22 April my colleague, Mr Hurford, drew the attention of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to a letter written by Mr Stone. There are some very damning statements in it. I will not quote the whole letter because I intend to seek leave to incorporate in the Senate Hansard the letter which appeared in the House of Representatives Hansard. Part of that letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> My officers have expressed their concern about this project . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the document in which all these good things that are going to happen have been set out. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>There is, first, the question of the meaning and reliability of such estimates and their potential for misuse. I understand, for example, that not all the States have responded as fully as requested. Additionally, there are doubts about the extent to which the information received from individual authorities has the imprimatur of State Governments and, even where that might be the case, what meaning can be attached to it in advance, in some cases years in advance, of relevant State Budgetary and Loan Council processes. I believe that publication of the schedule would give any estimates therein a degree of credibility and prominence they could not possibly warrant (and should not be assisted in attaining). </PARA>
<PARA>That was Mr Stone's objection to the Department's action. Further, he states:</PARA>
<PARA> For those various reasons, therefore, I would ask that you consider carefully whether the proposed publication should proceed. As you will gather from the foregoing my own strong view is that it should not. </PARA>
<PARA>That letter was addressed to Mr N. S. Currie, Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce. I seek leave to incorporate that letter in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>

<PARA>Edmund Barton Building</PARA>
<PARA>Barton, ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Neil</PARA>
<PARA>PROPOSED SCHEDULE OF INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that your Department has recently been collecting information from , inter alia, relevant State and Commonwealth authorities regarding their proposed investment in infrastructure over the next several years, and that publication of such a schedule is envisaged within the next couple of weeks as a supplement to the schedule of 'Major Manufacturing and Mining Investment Projects' relating to the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> My officers have expressed their concern about this project on several occasions, but I understand the attitude of your officers to be that a decision now not to publish would be embarrassing because of undertakings given to the State authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this letter is to convey to you personally my concern about the proposed publication of these estimates. There is, first, the question of the meaning and reliability of such estimates and their potential for misuse. I understand, for example, that not all the States have responded as fully as requested. Additionally, there are doubts about the extent to which the information received from individual authorities has the imprimatur of State Governments and, even where that might be the case, what meaning can be attached to it in advance, in some cases years in advance, of relevant State Budgetary and Loan Council processes. I believe that publication of the schedule would give any estimates therein a degree of credibility and prominence they could not possibly warrant (and should not be assisted in attaining). </PARA>
<PARA> Of even more concern, however, are the potential difficulties which I see publication creating for the Commonwealth in its dealings with the States in the area of infrastructure financing at the forthcoming meetings of the Loan Council in May and June, and beyond. Although Cabinet has not yet completed its consideration of this matter, it is my expectation that the Commonwealth will be seeking at the forthcoming Loan Council meetings a significant re-scheduling of borrowings under projects already approved. In the longer term the pressures building up in the economy-as evidenced most recently by the December quarter National Accounts, released last week-in part as a result of resource developments, underline the point that keeping the infrastructure program within reasonable bounds will be a continuing requirement. I need hardly say that the publication in the next couple of weeks of a schedule of the sort proposed would be anything but helpful from that standpoint. I gather that investment totalling $20.8 billion has found its way into the 'committed' and 'final feasibility' categories. In my view, publication of figures of this sort, whatever caveats might be put on them, would be quickly promulgated as a 'benchmark' of the infrastructure 'task' facing the States over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA> Your officers have, I believe, also pointed to a demand by private developers for such estimates as a further reason for publication. Frankly, I find it difficult, in view of the nature of the estimates and the various alternatives available (e.g. the Jackson and Associates survey of construction activity already conducted on a consultancy basis for the Department of Housing and Construction) to attach any weight whatsoever to that argument. Indeed, I would have thought that, notwithstanding the fact that there will always be businessmen eager to have the Government do market research for them at the taxpayers' expense, the added information burden on the States and relevant private developers runs quite counter to what the Government has been trying to achieve in the Review of Commonwealth Functions. This is quite apart from the question of what possible value to private developers there could be in estimates which quite clearly, under the pressure of economic events, are not going to be realized. Better, I should have thought, to have no estimates at all than to have such misleading ones as, under those circumstances, these will certainly prove to be. </PARA>
<PARA> I also put it to you, in all frankness, that it seems more than a little ironic that the Department of the Chairman of the Functions Review Commitee should be seeking a new role for itself as the collator of information on projected public sector infrastructure expenditures, particularly when relevant information is already available to the Commonwealth through normal Loan Council processes and at a time when the capacity of the Bureau of Statistics to undertake collections in this kind of area is being so tightly circumscribed. There is a strong smell of 'making work' about it which seems even less attractive in these times than it would in any case. </PARA>
<PARA> For those various reasons, therefore, I would ask that you consider carefully whether the proposed publication should proceed. As you will gather from the foregoing my own strong view is that it should not. </PARA>
<PARA> I should say that we have mentioned this matter to the Treasurer, who has reacted very strongly to the same effect. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also mention that I am forwarding a copy of this letter to the Chairman of the Public Service Board for his information. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely J. O. Stone Secretary to the Treasury</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator MCLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I point out that those figures, which have been bandied around the country-in particular by Mr Brown-have no worth in them at all. I know full well that the electors of South Australia will not be fooled either. What I was talking about when I raised this matter in my speech during the adjournment debate last week was the desperate employment situation in the south-east of South Australia. Of course, there is unemployment all over South Australia but it is much worse in the south-east. I also mentioned in my speech that South Australia now has the lowest population of all mainland States. I think that is a real tragedy in view of the fact that in 1979 we were accused of chasing people out of the State. Whilst some people might have been leaving the State then, they are leaving in much greater numbers now under the Tonkin Liberal Government. I also said that about 300 jobs could be lost because of the shorter working week and a nine-day fortnight. The day after I spoke in the adjournment debate the Adelaide Advertiser reported that the south-east pulp mill, the Cellulose Aust. Ltd plant near Millicent, is to close and that nearly 150 jobs will go. In the Adelaide Advertiser on the same day appeared the heading 'Murray Bridge firm to cut operations'. The newspaper reported that J. I . Case (Australia) Pty Ltd which operates at Murray Bridge, my home town, is going to cut operations. We now find that it will close down altogether and that 85 people will not have a job. The same situation applies at Mannum, where what is now known as Horwood Bagshaw Ltd also has a problem. The defeated Leader of the Liberal Government in New South Wales, Mr McDonald, is now in charge of operations. The people in Mannum do not have very much confidence in him either. Mr Tonkin, when he was in Mount Gambier last weekend-he took the Cabinet to Mount Gambier to try to bolster support in that electorate-attended a civic reception. A newspaper report of the reception stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Tonkin told the reception he had urged the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, yesterday to maintain the protection of Australian timber against New Zealand imports. </PARA>
<PARA> He said as a result of several representations to Mr Fraser the Federal Government had delayed the signing of the Closer Economic Relationship agreement with New Zealand, which had been due to be settled in August. </PARA>
<PARA> The CER agreement aimed to remove some of the barriers against the importing of NZ goods, including timber. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Tonkin said his hopes that South-East timber would be protected had been encouraged by the delay in signing the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a lot of nonsense because timber is still coming in. Despite the fact that representations have been made, both by the trade union movement in that area and by the Softwood Producers Council to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr Lynch, nothing has yet been done to prevent that timber coming in. All the Department has done is to send a few of its officers to talk to their counterparts in New Zealand. Nothing has been done. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, of course, it is interesting to look at a headline which appeared in the Adelaide Advertiser on 21 September 1982. It is interesting that Senator Jessop did not make any mention of this when he spoke. The headline states: '30 to lose jobs when Whyalla firm closes'. Senator Jessop was quite silent on that. When the Premier was in the south-east he talked about a bid to save the south-east clothing manufacturer, Fletcher Jones and Staff, which had been encouraged to come to South Australia by the Dunstan Government. The next day we found that the manager had to deny that the company was in trouble and had to claim that it was a very efficient industry. There again, Mr Tonkin has fallen flat on his face because he is trying to ginger up a lot of support for Mr Allison. I think he has just about admitted that he is a dead duck and that the seat of Mount Gambier will be represented by the Labor Party as soon as a State election is held. I turn now to the employment figures. I refer to figures which appeared in an article by Grant Nihill in the Adelaide Advertiser on 10 September. He stated :</PARA>
<PARA> The jobless total rose 4,400 between July and August to 50,300. </PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the unemployment rate in South Australia. My State leader in South Australia, Mr Bannon, was reported as stating:</PARA>
<PARA> The Tonkin Government should be ashamed of the total of 50,300 unemployed in SA for the month, which was a post-war August record. </PARA>
<PARA>What did we see today in the figures that came out at noon? I got them from the Parliamentary Library. The figures now show that the number of unemployed has gone up by 100 in the last month. The total figure now is 50,400. It has gone up by 100 in South Australia in just four weeks. The total rate of unemployment in South Australia is now 8.4 per cent, compared with 7.7 per cent last month. There has been an increase in that month. Every month since the Tonkin Government has been in office in South Australia-since September 1979-there has been an increase in the unemployment figures in that State. In not one month has the Tonkin Government been able to reduce the figure. I ask honourable senators to compare the 8.4 per cent unemployed rate in South Australia with the Australian average of 6.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If we examine the figures relating to Mount Gambier we find that they are even worse. I will quote figures obtained from the Department of Social Security on the number of people in receipt of unemployment benefits. We find that in May 1980, 447 people in Mount Gambier-that is in the postcode area of 5290-were in receipt of unemployment benefits. In May of this year the number had risen to 675-an increase of 34 per cent. For the postcode area 5291-which is the other outer Mount Gambier area-in May 1980 there were 69 persons in receipt of unemployment benefit and in May 1982, 102, which is an increase of about 50 per cent in the outer area of Mount Gambier. That has happened since the Tonkin Government came to office. The next lot of figures will be worse because of the problems in the timber industry in the south-east of South Australia, which I have already spoken about. One mill has already closed down. We are in for real trouble down there, but the Government does not appear to be very concerned about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the building trade and the number of homes constructed. Catalogue No . 8703.0 of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, published today, shows that the number of houses approved for construction has also dropped. A total of 1,700 new dwellings were approved for construction in South Australia for the June quarter of 1981, and for the June quarter of this year only 1,400 were approved. That is a drop of 300 homes. If we look at the 1982 report of the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry, which was tabled in the Parliament today, we see under the heading 'Short-Term Forecasts' that private home commencements in the first three quarters of 1981-82 were well below the level for the same period in 1980-81. That is borne out by the figures of the Australian Bureau of Statistics published today. If we go further on in the document we see on page 82:</PARA>
<PARA> During 1981-82 funding made available under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement fell by 13 per cent from the 1980-81 level. However, a substantial injection of funds arranged by the State Government through the State Government Insurance Commission and the State Superannuation Fund, along with financing initiatives by the Housing Trust, has enabled a substantial increase in capital expenditure by the Housing Trust on new construction during 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course the Government has to use the State Government Insurance Commission to make this money available. When the Liberal Party was in Opposition it fought the Labor Government tooth and nail when it tried to set up the State Government Insurance Commission, and now the Government is using it to help the building industry. It has been a very worth-while venture and it is one of the most viable insurance companies in South Australia. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Private house commencements are expected to fall from 4 970 in 1980-81 to 4 400 because of the cost and restricted availability of housing loans. </PARA>
<PARA>So that is the answer to what Senator Jessop had to say to me in trying to rebut what I said. I always use facts when I come in here and make statements. I do not make airy-fairy statements and say that I have a document before me. I quote the document, it is there for people to check. I stand on my record of what I said here the other night. It was absolute fact and I was not trying to belittle the Tonkin Liberal Government with fictitious figures. </PARA>

First of all I raise a matter with you, Mr President, about Hansard and the correction of speeches. Of course, we expect Hansard to improve our grammar and that sort of thing, but I must say I am often embarrassed when Hansard has me saying things that I did not say. For instance, I would never have referred to the Leader of the Government in the Senate as 'Senator Sir John Carrick', yet on about five occasions in a relatively short speech yesterday I am reported as having called him 'Senator Sir John Carrick'. Mr President, I wonder whether it is possible, in my case, if in nobody else's, for Hansard to be told that when I call the Leader of the Government 'Senator Carrick' he is to be so referred to in my speech because I find it rather embarrassing to have those words put into my mouth.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LF4">Senator COATES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would appreciate it, Mr President, if that matter could be attended to. The other matter I wish to raise refers to an answer I received on my desk yesterday from Senator Messner to a question I asked him, as Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, on 18 August. It is Question on Notice No. 2568. When I received that answer I was upset to discover that it had appeared in Hansard a week ago but that the copies of the question that should have preceded that publication were a week late. That is just a minor complaint that I have. My main complaint is that the answer to my question is quite ambiguous. I am seeking guidance from the Minister for Education ( Senator Peter Baume) as to what I should do next. I put an earlier question on notice to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) some months ago concerning the Minister for Administrative Services. I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) What loans have been made to the Minister for Administrative Services under :</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Defence Services Homes Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the Re-establishment and Employment Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the Loan (War Service Land Settlement) Acts; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) any other arrangement involving Commonwealth funds or guarantees. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) When were these loans approved and by whom were they approved. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) What were the amounts of each loan, at what interest rates, and for what terms. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) How much of each loan has been repaid, and when. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked that question of the Prime Minister because it involved several Ministers. I think it involved three Ministers-the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the Minister for Primary Industry, who has responsibility for part of one of those Acts, and another Minister. After some months I got an answer saying: 'I suggest the senator asks those questions of the Minister for Administrative Services himself'. So I did exactly that--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Peter Baume" NAMEID="ME4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not exactly what it said, Senator. It said: 'I believe that it is appropriate that honourable senators approach Ministers directly'.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LF4">Senator COATES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am referring to the earlier question; the question I asked some months ago. After some months the Prime Minister replied: 'I suggest the senator asks the Minister for Administrative Services himself'. I then put exactly the same question on notice to the Minister for Administrative Services. Senator Messner, on his behalf, replied:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: (1) to (4) I believe that it is appropriate that honourable senators approach Ministers directly on questions of this nature . </PARA>
<PARA>I thought that was what I had done in response to the Prime Minister's suggestion, that is, as directly as we can in this place, asking the Minister representing the Minister concerned. Then I thought: Well, perhaps this answer from Mr Newman suggests that I approach the individual Ministers responsible for those Acts by a question on notice; that is, the Minister for Primary Industry, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and so on. But there is a further interpretation that suggests that perhaps I should interview Mr Newman personally about these matters, which I think would be entirely inappropriate. So rather than put the same question on notice again in some slightly different way I am seeking some guidance from the Minister as to what is meant by that ambiguous answer. It may be that Mr Newman has something to hide, I do not know. I am not suggesting that at this stage, but I think I am getting the run-around in my attempt to find out straight, factual answers. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(7.39)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too will not keep the Senate long. I wish to raise an issue concerning a constituent in Queensland -I believe this is an appropriate time to do so-which refers to an anomaly under the tax law in relation to fruit wine made from fruits other than grapes. Fruit wine is the subject of a 17.5 per cent sales tax while grape wine is totally exempt from sales tax. There is only one general commercial producer of fruit wine in Australia. It is very much a struggling industry which was pioneered by a small family concern in central Queensland. The Federal Government has been aware of this anomaly since 1977. The then Minister Assisting the Treasurer, Ian Viner, explained that the correction of the anomaly would require an amendment to the sales tax law. Regular representations seeking such an amendment have been made to the relevant Government Ministers by members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives representing all political parties. The reason given by the Government for taking no action is that it would require an amendment of the sales tax provisions. That does not seem to me to be an adequate defence or reason, particularly as the Government has had five years in which to make this minor change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That takes us to last year, 1981. Senator Messner, in his capacity as the Minister assisting the Treasurer, wrote that the granting of a sales tax exemption must take account of the overall economic strategy. The letter was probably a joke because the family involved is the only producer concerned and in the financial year prior to the writing of that letter it paid sales tax amounting to $3,818-hardly, I would imagine, an amount that would have to be taken into account in considering the overall economic strategy. I suggest that this revenue is gained from the 17 1/2 per cent sales tax levied on wines simply because they are made from fruits, particularly tropical fruits other than grapes which are, after all, an imported fruit, if one wants to be chauvinistic and nationalistic about it. </PARA>

I ask the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) to convey my request again to the Government and see whether this industry may be assisted in the same way as assistance is given to the grape industry of South Australia. I say in closing that if the Government's economic policies are dependent on $3,818 I fear not only for the small firm but for the country in general.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators who have taken part in the adjournment debate. The answer to Senator Macklin's question is yes. He seeks equality as between varieties of wine. I am not certain that he is not asking the Government to consider as one option-I do not know exactly what he is asking-the imposition of a sales tax on grape wine. Mr President, I know that you would blanch if that suggestion were made. However, I will pass it on as requested. I thank Senator Macklin for sitting through some of the long speeches that were made, although perhaps he had no choice. I note that the first two speakers have not remained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Jones raised the question of the creation of a stockman's hall of fame. He is not present to hear my response, so I will be brief. The Government has referred the matter to the Australian Bicentennial Authority. A one-off grant of $10,000 was made in 1980 for the project and tax deductibility has been granted. I cannot blame the honourable senator for not remaining. Senator McLaren showed a remarkable propensity for driving from the chamber all who could be driven. Senator Watson was here for a while but he too gave up and left. </PARA>
<PARA> As for Senator McLaren's speech, I must say that it will never be a best seller . It was too long and too turgid. He said that he would stand on his record. I fear that is exactly what he will do; it is a little broken. I am sure now that the Senate acted properly in amending the Standing Orders regarding the length of adjournment speeches. The honourable senator has not remained either, so I will not address myself to the substance of his remarks.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coates raised several matters, the first of which concerned the style used in Hansard. I assume that before he came into the Senate he went to Hansard and discussed the matter. If not, I suggest that he should do so. Matters of courtesy and title are not for me to judge. It is up to him to make his own way in that regard but I suggest that he take it up directly with Hansard. In relation to his comment that the answer to a question appeared in Hansard before he was informed of it, I point out that a question on notice is one given to the Parliament. It appears on the Notice Paper of the Senate and any response made is made to the Parliament and appears appropriately in Hansard. I am glad that the honourable senator did receive a letter but would emphasise that the answer, in appearing in Hansard, appeared in the correct place. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the other matter raised by him, if I read correctly the question concerned it relates to the affairs of Mr Newman as an individual. It does not refer to the portfolio of Administrative Services. Nor, I believe, does it refer to Mr Newman's administrative functions or duties. It refers to personal matters affecting Mr Newman as a returned soldier and to benefits that he may have obtained as a result. I would suggest that that is no more the business of the Parliament than would be the private affairs of any other veteran who had served his country and had taken advantage of, to use the examples given by the honourable senator, the Defence Services Homes Act, the Re-establishment and Employment Act, the Loans (War Service Land Settlement) Acts and any other arrangements involving Commonwealth funds or guarantees. I have no knowledge of whether Mr Newman is or is not taking advantage of the provisions of those Acts. He certainly may have an entitlement under them as someone who has served his country with distinction in military forces. It is entirely proper that if there be a tradition of not making public what individual citizens may have obtained by way of war service loans and the like, it should be followed in this case also. Thus the answer is appropriate. If the honourable senator wants to learn what Mr Newman is receiving I suggest that he ask him personally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 16 September 1982 Senator Townley asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, the following questions without notice, relating to the proposed code of conduct for the Commonwealth Games:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (i) Has the Minister seen the document?</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Is it true that the New Zealand Commonwealth Games Committee has refused to sign the code because it feels that to do so would be overstepping its authority as it says the code applies to sportsfolk outside its jurisdiction?</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Is it true that, if the Australian Commonwealth Games Committee signs that code, it may well be to the detriment of many sporting Australians?</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Why should such a group and indeed any group be able to dictate to other sportspeople?</PARA>
<PARA> (v) Will the Minister arrange for the code to be released to the public so that we can have some discussion of the issues and so on that may result from the signing by Australia, behind closed doors, of a code that may well be used to apply pressures to people who in no way are involved with the Commonwealth Games?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) No. The code of conduct is part of proposed revisions to the constitution of the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF). The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has been advised by the Australian Commonwealth Games Association that the code has only been distributed to national Commonwealth Games Associations prior to planned meetings of the CGF General Assembly in Brisbane on 27 September 1982 and 6 October 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Recent Press reports indicate that the New Zealand Olympic and Commonwealth Games Association does not support the introduction of a code of conduct into the constitution of the Commonwealth Games Federation since the New Zealand Olympic and Commonwealth Games Association and its affiliated members are already fully committed to support both the principle and the letter of the Gleneagles Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) As I am not privy to the content of the code I am unable to answer this question.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) As I am not privy to the precise nature of the code I am unable to answer this question.</PARA>
<PARA> (v) The code of conduct has only been made available to affiliates of the Commonwealth Games Federation and is not available for public comment.</PARA>
