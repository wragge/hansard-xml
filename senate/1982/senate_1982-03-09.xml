<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to pay a brief tribute to the late Bill Arthur. He was one of the kindest, most unselfish , caring and happy persons that it has ever been my privilege to know. During an association of over 16 years I never heard him speak ill of anyone, betray a confidence or behave in any way other than with honour and decency. He was a man whom it is difficult to contemplate having an enemy. On the other hand, it is well known that the number of his friends was legion. As one of them I deeply regret the way in which he met his death and that he is no longer with us. I send my condolences to the surviving relatives of this fine, decent man.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I knew Bill Arthur over the whole of the post-war years. He enlisted in the Australian Military Forces in August 1940, became a bombardier in the following year and a sergeant in 1942, transferred to the Australian Imperial Force in 1942, was commissioned and served in New Guinea and Borneo and was transferred to the Reserve of Officers in September 1946. He was active on the Liberal side of politics over the next few decades. He was a candidate for the Federal seat of Barton and, indeed, was elected to the House of Representatives for the electorate of Barton at the general election of 1966. He served on a number of committees inside the Parliament. He was very friendly in his approach, was regarded by all as a friend and made a contribution to this Parliament. One can only regret that he has died and particularly regret the tragic circumstances of his death. The Government joins with Senator Chipp in extending to his relatives deep sympathy.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I knew the late Bill Arthur for a number of years, long before he or I entered Parliament, although we were active in politics in different ways. In fact, I was the Secretary of the Barton Federal Electorate Council of the Australian Labor Party in 1954 and in 1955 when he stood as the Liberal Party candidate for the seat of Barton against the then Leader of the Opposition, the Right Honourable Dr Evatt. He offered himself as a Liberal candidate not only then but also in 1958 and, I think, in 1961. He eventually won the seat in 1966 and held it for one term. In that period he was my local member. He was a good member, and I always got on well with him. All members of the Australian Labor Party within the Barton Federal electorate express their deepest sympathy to the late Mr Arthur's relatives.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did the Minister for National Development and Energy say last Thursday, 4 March, that a fall in international oil prices would mean a fall in Australian oil prices? Since then has the Prime Minister said that he doubts whether 'any good purpose would be served by a price reduction'? Will the Minister clear up this apparent conflict between himself and the Prime Minister and inform the Senate how Australian petrol prices are to be fixed in the future , having regard to the matters of fact referred to?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week I made a number of statements simply restating what has been and is the policy of the Government in fixing the price of oil in Australia, which is determined on the basis of import parity pricing. I indicated that, in line with the International Energy Agency's view that all oil in all countries should be priced at world scarcity prices, we in Australia had chosen the price of Saudi light crude as the price for Australia. That happened to be one of the cheaper prices in the world and Saudi Arabia also happened to be the main source of Australian oil. I indicated that it had been our practice since then, on 1 July and 1 January of each year, to review what had happened in the previous six months and to adjust the price in terms of the movement in the price of Saudi light crude in American dollars. So there would be an adjustment in terms of the movement in the price and in the exchange rate as it applied between America and Australia. The answer is yes. I indicated that on a number of occasions last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has commented but has not in any way altered the text of what I have said. Indeed he reiterates the basis of what I have said. When interviewed by the local Press in Roma-I have the text here-he was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Are we going to see reductions in fuel prices . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> Well, the prices that we have been paying up to this point haven't come down. We don't know what is going to happen. The British have brought down their North Sea price. The Government would have to make a decision about that, but there is no doubt that the general trend over time that oil prices is going to be upwards , and whether any good purpose will be served by an actual reduction in Australia that is a question the Government will have to look at.</PARA>
<PARA>He quite clearly meant by that statement that, although for a time a surplus will be created in the world by a number of factors in which Australia has co- operated, in the longer term there will be a reversion to scarcity and higher prices. Of course the pressure on scarcity has caused Australia and other countries to move to alternative policies. In no way has the Prime Minister in that statement come into conflict either with the Government's policy or with statements which I have made. At this moment nobody knows what will be the movements of world prices. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on 19 March to determine its policies. It will have to look at policies in two ways: First of all, to reduce the volume-that will be a determination by Saudi Arabia largely as to how far it can drop its volume-and, secondly, whether Saudi Arabia will lower its price. If prices fall particularly low a number of OPEC countries will find themselves in grave economic difficulties. Indeed, they could find themselves in a destabilised condition. I point out that, whilst there is some alleviation in price at the moment, in the long term an orderly approach to pricing will be the best thing for the world at large.</PARA>

I know of Senator Kilgariff's background and his keen appreciation of the needs of tourists and the need to provide for them. Several camping areas in the park are being improved and there are proposals for new camping areas to be developed. Following the proclamation of the Kakadu National Park in 1979 considerable progress has been made in providing tourist information, and that extends to things such as appropriate signposting and the production of appropriate literature. I have arranged for a set of these items of literature to be sent to Senator Kilgariff.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate . I preface my question by saying that I commend the governments of Australia and New Zealand for their quick and humane action in already rendering assistance to Tonga which suffered such tremendous cyclone damage last week. Is the Minister aware that 45,000 people in Tonga are now homeless, that there is virtually no fresh water available now and no roofing to catch fresh water, that in fact a serious water pollution crisis has developed owing to the escape of raw sewage into the ground water and that an extremely serious food shortage will strike the islands in about two weeks time? In view of this disastrous situation, will the Government encourage a community response from the people of Australia to alleviate the plight of the people of Tonga, in addition to the generous response already announced by his Government? From past experience would the Minister agree that Australian people respond magnificently to people in times of distress? Would he therefore request the Prime Minister, if thought practicable, to invite all political parties to request nation-wide participation of the Australian people in assisting the poor and distressed people of Tonga?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The plight of the people of Tonga is in fact a very serious one, as Senator Chipp has indicated. Cyclone Isaac, as it was called, hit the three main islands of Tonga on 3 March and, as he described, caused considerable devastation. Whilst casualties fortunately appear to have been few, the hurricane has given rise to an immediate and very serious need for humanitarian assistance. It has also caused long term economic difficulties in what is a small island kingdom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government was pleased to be able to respond promptly, as Senator Chipp indicated, and positively to requests from the Tongan Government for assistance in relieving the hardships which its people now face. The Aid Bureau of the Department of Foreign Affairs, in conjunction with the Department of Defence, as he knows, arranged a number of Royal Australian Air Force Hercules flights which have carried urgently needed supplies of food, shelter, material, communications equipment and other equipment and medicines to Tonga. In addition a contingent of Australian Army engineers, comprising some 70 officers and men, is helping to assess the damage and re-establish services. I sketch this against the background of Senator Chipp's further request. Two RAAF helicopters to assist in re-establishing inter-island communication and the distribution of supplies to the outer islands have also been provided. We have co-operated closely with other countries, particularly New Zealand. In conjunction with the Government of Tonga we are now assessing the most effective ways in which we can continue to meet Tonga's immediate emergency relief and longer term rehabilitation needs. Honourable senators may be assured that we will continue to do that.</PARA>
<PARA> On the question of the community response-I take note of it-the Government is actively encouraging the provision of assistance by private individuals and organisations. Honourable senators will be aware that the International Disaster Emergency Committee Appeal for Tonga was launched yesterday. Indeed, the Government urges the people of Australia to give the appeal full support. The Government hopes that the Committee's appeal will be met with wholehearted support throughout the Australian community. So what Senator Chipp is seeking has already been done. If there are aspects that I have not covered I will draw the Prime Minister's attention to them.</PARA>

I cannot say whether the Australian Taxation Office has some way of dealing with the individual cost of a simple pay-as-you-earn or individual's tax assessment.

This equally would need to be looked at in terms of equity where people of a similar income level are making their contribution in accordance with the Income Tax Assessment Act. If there is some fact that I can give that would assist the Senate in its concern I will see that the Treasurer advises us . With the millions of tax returns that are processed and with the collection of tax in accordance with the Act it must be assumed that certain tax assessments cost more than others to administer.

Further, is it the case, as appears from the information sworn out in support of the search warrant in this matter on 18 February, that the Department knew of a possible inaccuracy in the billing of certain ultrasound scanning procedures by the clinic as early as May 1981, and certainly by June 1981, and yet took no action whatsoever in this respect until the police raids in February this year? Is it further the case that it is not uncommon for itemising errors to be made as a result of honest and reasonable mistake, given the thousands of items on the fee schedule and the close similarity and description of many of the procedures in question, and that that is the reason for the existence of the advance warning and counselling system that currently applies?

It is also correct for Senator Evans to say that it is normal for counselling to take place where genuine errors are thought to have occurred and that police action is generally a second step.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I would be happy to refer to the Minister the suggestion made by Senator Coates. Based on the information that I have with regard to the Tasmanian projects, I understand that the decision not to continue funding some projects was made only after careful consideration of information and advice received from the State CYSS committee. The Department considered this and, after consultation with local members of parliament, the decision was taken. I understand that the CYSS committee in Tasmania prepared recommendations on projects in three groups: Firstly, those it considered viable; secondly, those with particular problems which give doubts about their viability but which the committee considered should be given sufficient time to overcome their problems; and thirdly, those with particular problems largely related to low levels of youth unemployment and low participation. The continued viability of some projects was considered to be in doubt and the four projects which were closed in Tasmania fell into the third category which I mentioned. There was never any suggestion that the State committee, in making those recommendations, was showing any bias against country projects. I understand that every project in Tasmania received the same consideration by the committee. However, I have noted the suggestion in the question from Senator Coates.

My understanding is that the hospitals to which he referred-the hospitals operated by the Bush Nurses-are not public hospitals in the legal sense. Therefore, they do not have access to some of the privileges which public hospitals attract. He therefore points out that some pensioners in Victoria may suffer disability because of this and because there is no access to other facilities. He asks whether we will undertake to include this matter in any review that is undertaken of hospital arrangements. I will certainly pass this request on to the Minister for Health.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That would be a very over-simplistic precis of what the submission in fact said. The submission indicated that the Department had revised downwards its previous estimate of the needs of Tasmania at the time. It did so because a number of enterprises which had been foreshadowed are not going to take place. On the other hand, it has no way of knowing at all whether, when the recessive tendencies of this world disperse in the months and years ahead, there will be in fact new enterprises of a particular nature. All it could do was to indicate that, based upon the present situation and the present expectation of industries and development, it had lowered its estimate of the capacity. But it made the point that any assumption of demands for electricity must take into account an estimate of the future development of Tasmania. That is not a judgment that the department can make. I take it that it is a political judgment for Tasmania. Therefore, the submission itself does not conclude that there is no need for any extra power, whether hydro or thermal.

As Chairman of this statutory corporation, the Aboriginal Development Commission, I think Mr Perkins has a responsibility to leave political controversy to the elected representatives of the people. Honourable senators know that on a previous occasion some weeks ago I had occasion to make this known. I note that his remarks are related to a number of his concerns.

The Government would deplore any action or statement by any party which would further increase tension and risk the renewal of hostilities.

It has been suggested that to allow time for proper evaluation continued funding of the Youth Support Scheme should be made through 1982-83. Again that is a matter which I am currently considering. The request was made by State Ministers fairly recently. I will advise the honourable senator when a decision is taken. The original commitment was for, I think, $1m a year over three years. To the extent that claims came forward that commitment has been met. The scheme is one which, as I have said, is currently subject to evaluation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some information on the matter raised by the honourable senator. The question he asked mainly involved allowing an income test free area equal to the pension itself. The cost of increasing the free area of income to that level is estimated to be about $165m in a full year for existing age pensioners. That estimate is a gross cost because, of course, some taxation revenue would flow from such an increase in pensions as all pension payments are taxable for pensioners above the taxable limit. If this were done the income limit at November 1981 rates for the payment of pension would increase from $159 .40 to $209.10 a week for a single person. In other words, a part pension would be payable from the income limit to a total income level of $209 a week. For a married couple the peak income at which a part pension would be payable would be $348.60 a week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This increase would mean that new pensioners would come on to the roll. People who currently are beyond the income range for the pension would be admitted to a part pension. There is no up to date comprehensive income data which would enable me to give the Senate an estimate of the cost of adding those pensioners to the pension roll. The cost estimate I gave was based on the reported incomes of current age pensioners in December 1981. At least 325,000 pensioners could be expected to gain. It is assumed that pensioners aged 70 years or more who have not stated their incomes, of whom there are about 126,000, would not be affected by the proposal. This could mean that the cost is underestimated. There are a number of uncertainties in the figures I have given to the Senate as I do not have figures which would enable me to state a precise cost in answer to the question which has been asked.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think all honourable senators would be aware of the campaign being undertaken in this regard by local government and would have received representations from various organisations in their own States from time to time . Presently the Commonwealth is committed to the provision of grants totalling $ 3,650m to the States and the Northern Territory for roads over the five years from 1980-81 to 1984-85. This very substantial Commonwealth commitment, in the light of public expenditure restraints imposed as a result of its anti- inflationary budgetary strategy, in the circumstances does seem to be as much as can be possibly done to enhance the development of the Australian road system at the moment. In 1981-82, $685m has been appropriated by the Roads Grants Act 1981 . This represents an increase of 9 per cent when compared with the $628m provided by the Commonwealth last year. All States and the Northern Territory have been allocated a uniform 9 per cent increase in their grants in this current financial year. Of course, the Minister is aware of these concerns expressed in the community and shortly will be introducing legislation in the House to appropriate the levels of funds which the Government has undertaken to provide over the remaining three years of the current roads programs.</PARA></TALK.START>

Hence I will have to seek from the Minister for Industry and Commerce the information which she has sought. However, she concluded her question with the general observation that the shorter working week could demonstrate that high protection was not necessary. It certainly is true that the shorter working week , by pushing up the unit cost of labour, renders any industry affected less competitive and undoubtedly gives rise to a desire for a higher level of protection; indeed, often it causes a demand for a higher level of protection. However, the simple fact of the matter is that the more the cost of labour is inflated the more difficult it will be for the Government to ensure that we have a country in which employment creation continues. I think all sections of the community, be they trade unions or employers, have a vested interest in maintaining the cost of labour in Australia at a fairly competitive level.

This opposition has been frequently stated, both in bilateral talks with the French Government and in multilateral forums such as the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne last October. It is not the Australian Government's practice to lodge a protest with the country concerned whenever a nuclear weapons state carries out an underground explosion. Since 1975 all the French tests at Mururoa Atoll have been conducted under ground. The Government does, however, make formal approaches to the country concerned whenever an atmospheric nuclear test is carried out. The last such approach was to China in 1980. Australia has long been committed to the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty which would bring about an end to nuclear testing by all states in all environments. Such a treaty would clearly increase international pressure for an end to all testing and leave those states which continued to test in an isolated and exposed position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In response to inquiries by the Australian Embassy in Paris, the French authorities have denied the reports of structural damage and have stated that the radiation situation at the atoll is fully under control. The French response was the subject of a news release issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs on 18 December last year. I know that the Foreign Minister is aware of unsubstantiated reports that France proposes to move its nuclear test site to Kerguelen Island in the southern Indian Ocean. The Minister has seen no evidence to confirm these reports and the French Government has declined to comment on them. If other matters were raised by Senator McIntosh I will refer them to the Foreign Minister for a response from him, but I give that general background to Australia's attitude on this matter so that the Senate may again be informed of it.</PARA>

I was referring to a recent Press statement which said that France was considering shifting its tests to a nearby atoll in the Mururoa region.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; On 25 February Senator Mulvihill asked me as the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs a question concerning the situation of Mr John Fraser, an Australian citizen in Zimbabwe. Mr Fraser had been compelled to leave Zimbabwe and his Zimbabwean family because of the Zimbabwean Government's immigration policy as it affected the residence status of foreign husbands. In replying to Senator Mulvihill's question I said that there appeared little that the Australian Government could do, but undertook to find out whether an approach had been made to the Zimbabwean Government on this case. I am pleased to be able to advise that the Government of Zimbabwe has revised its policy governing residence permits for foreign husbands. On 3 March the Zimbabwean Minister of Home Affairs announced that the foreign husbands of Zimbabwean women will be granted time-restricted conditional residence permits when they return to Zimbabwe provided that they can satisfy the Immigrants' Control Board that they are of good character and have no criminal records. The Minister of Home Affairs in Zimbabwe made it clear that the new arrangement will apply to husbands who have previously been refused residence permits and who wish to rejoin their wives in Zimbabwe. I am sure that senators will welcome the flexibility demonstrated by the Government of Zimbabwe in responding to the domestic and international reaction to its earlier policy. A problem which used to confront families like the Frasers has now been removed, and the Zimbabwean goal of building a multi-racial society has been advanced.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The Daily Telegraph of 5 March, under the heading 'Restaurant Link in Graft Payout' and a photo of myself with the wording underneath 'Attended dinner', stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Sergeant Molloy said that at a dinner where Mr Allen gave him an envelope containg $500 in cash, two Labor politicians were standing nearby, in conversation.</PARA>
<PARA>Naturally, I deny absolutely and unequivocally that I was in any way aware of, party to, or remotely associated with any transaction of the kind which is alleged to have occurred at the dinner.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commercial Travellers Association annual dinner is one of the most prestigious annual dinners to which persons from both public and private life in New South Wales are invited. The facts concerning the dinner are as follows: I was approached by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, to represent him at the Commercial Travellers Association of New South Wales ninety-second annual association day dinner. Mr Allan Stewart, the State member for Manly, was representing the Premier of New South Wales, Mr Neville Wran. This is the second occasion that I have represented Mr Hayden at the dinner. On these occasions the Prime Minister of Australia is represented, as well as the Leader of the Opposition in the State of New South Wales. The Lord Mayor of Sydney or his representative, along with prominent and distinguished persons in public life, also attend. The invitation states:</PARA>
<PARA> This Association is proud of its royal patronage and we are invariably favoured with distinguished persons from both public and private life.</PARA>
<PARA>On the two occasions that I have represented Mr Hayden, including the dinner referred to, the official guests included Mr John Dowd, leader of the Parliamentary Liberal Party in New South Wales; Mr Jim Cameron, the then deputy leader of the Parliamentary Liberal Party in New South Wales; the then Lord Mayor of Sydney, Mr Nelson Meers; the Deputy Lord Mayor of Sydney, Mr Tony Bradford; Mr Pat Rogan, M.L.A., representing Premier Neville Wran; and Mr Bruce Graham, then representing the Prime Minister. The official guests of honour have included the then Governor of New South Wales, Sir Roden Cutler, and Sir Charles Moses. This function is hardly a private or restaurant function, as implied in some of the newspaper articles. I find it extraordinary that the evidence was apparently given in the form that it was with no mention apparently being made of any of the Liberal politicians who happened to be present, but with Mr Stewart and myself singled out and even more extraordinary and indefensible that some of the newspapers that I have referred to reported it in such a manner. I have been advised that there is a clear course of action in defamation arising out of these reports and I intend to take the appropriate legal proceedings.</PARA>

Indeed, we have a Committee meeting on the ordinance only tonight. That was the extent of my conversation with the lady reporter from the Canberra Times.

I do, however, make clear that the misreporting was as to the substance really rather than the spirit of my comments. I make it clear that I believe the ordinance in the form in which it was circulated last week publicly to the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly is manifestly unacceptable and based on fundamentally misconceived principles.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The record of this Government during the past six years is, indeed, a sorry one. It is in many ways the sorriest record of any government in the history of Australian Federation. It is a record which is littered with parliamentary and ministerial excess, deceit, trickery, thuggery and evasion. It is not the record of a government which deserves respect and support from the Australian electorate. The fundamental reason for this is the manner in which the Government has time and time again given its word, given its promise on just about every issue and time and time again disregarded its commitment. From the moment this Government barged into power, scattering the Constitution, it has broken promise after promise. It has, through election policy, through ministerial statements, through speeches, through Budgets and in just about every other public forum made what seemed to be unequivocal commitments and then proceeded to reverse them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is, therefore, proper that at this stage the record of this Government should come under close scrutiny for it was to the people of Australia to whom these promises were made and it was the people of Australia who have entrusted the administration of this country to the Liberal-National Country Party coalition. It is the people of Australia who have not just once, not twice but hundreds of times had that trust betrayed. This Government has blatantly and deliberately betrayed the trust of the Australian people. On this issue alone, I submit, it should stand condemned. As I said earlier, this Government does not deserve the respect of the people of Australia or their support. It does not, as I mentioned, because of the scandalous way in which it has on three occasions used the method of the mugger and the confidence trickster to grab power. It has juggled figures and come up with so-called tax cuts which never really materialise for the average Australian. We all remember full well the advertising before the last federal election which talked of a fistful of dollars; what we were not told then was that the dollars were being taken away, not given to us. The Government has promised not to cut services and programs essential to the welfare of Australians and has done just that with scant regard to those in need or those who have a basic right to the provision of these services. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us begin with taxation, the area in which this Government has probably told more lies than any other, the area in which this Government has time and time again gone to the electorate with promises. In fact, this Government has surpassed the world's great magicians by making tax cuts disappear before the very eyes of the taxpayer. During the 1980 election campaign the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made a number of statements about taxation. The promises can be summed up when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government will maintain its declared taxation objectives: to keep taxes at the lowest level possible compatible with responsible economic management and community needs, to distribute the tax burden as fairly as possible, with particular concern for low income families; and to provide incentives for initiative and enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what he said. In doing so, he repeated a tired old theme which has been issued by this man and his former lackeys, former Treasurer Lynch and present Treasurer Howard. The promise in essence was that this Government would keep taxes at the lowest level possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us just look at the record. Taxes presently are at a record high. In the last year of the Whitlam Government-in the last Hayden Budget-total Commonwealth tax receipts as a proportion of gross domestic product stood at 23.3 per cent. In the last financial year of the Fraser-Howard economic approach this had risen to 25 per cent. The estimate for the current financial year is 25.5 per cent. If the same ratio operated in this current financial year as operated in the year of the last Hayden budget then every taxpayer in Australia would be paying $13. 60 a week less in tax. The burden has fallen upon the wage and salary earners of this country, those who pay taxes as they earn money through hard work. In the years from 1975-76 to 1980-81 the wages, salaries and supplements of ordinary pay-as-you-earn tax payers rose by 72 per cent. In the same period the money collected under PAYE taxes grew by over 100 per cent. This can be contrasted with the position of those people who are non-PAYE taxpayers; their incomes rose by 94 per cent while their tax burden increased by 56.6 per cent-almost half the increase of PAYE taxpayers. Are these the fair and equitable tax arrangements that the Prime Minister talks about? Is this the work of the low tax party? Is this compatible with community needs?</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister said also during the election campaign that the Government would have particular concern for low income families. This is an outrageous untruth coming from a government which has done more than any other to drive a wedge between the haves and the have-nots and to make the poor poorer and the rich richer. One has to draw out only one example to show this. A person earning $9,500 a year at the moment would, given the assumed increases in wages over the last five years, have been earning $5,000 a year in 1975-76. The additional tax payable by that person this financial year compared with his 1975-76 tax is an extra $404 or almost $8 a week. Meanwhile, however, a person earning $95,000 a year now-somewhere close to the salary of the Prime Minister and his ministerial colleagues-on the same salary increase assumption would have been earning $50, 000 a year in 1975-76. Under this Government this person's tax would have decreased by an astounding $2,537 per annum in that period, almost $50 less tax a week. That is how the Government has adjusted tax scales to benefit those most in need. That is how the Government has paid particular concern to the low income earners. It has paid them no attention at all in a positive sense. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's taxation promises are, in fact, hollow just as its promises to provide incentives for initiative and enterprise are hollow. The only incentives provided by this Government are those aimed at big business. Small business has suffered intolerable pressure from this Government, pressure so intolerable that in the last financal year we saw almost 5,000 bankruptcies involving small businesses in this country. Almost 5,000 firms went to the wall not able to sustain the economic policies of this Government, policies which through record high interest rates and scarcity of money supply made it impossible for small business to borrow in an attempt to compete, to expand or to hire more staff. At the last election the Government's promises on taxation were just empty rhetoric . We had promises of full tax indexation which never eventuated in any realistic sense for any realistic period. The promises about repaying increases in the crude oil levy, which the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) knows about, and the promise to repay those increases by way of tax cuts or increased family allowances are other promises not yet kept. Throughout his term as Prime Minister, Mr Fraser has harped on sound economic management. In September 1980 he told the Australian people that the domestic deficit would be wiped out altogether. But where is the talk now of wiping out the domestic deficit, with an expected overrun in the Budget deficit of at least $1,300m-a figure that we are not sure of because the Government itself is unclear as to its extent?</PARA>
<PARA> This Government has, in fact, been pinning its whole strategy on economic performance-the promises of wiping out Budget deficits, full employment, economic growth and lower inflation; but nothing of the kind has happened. The Prime Minister parades as a tower of strength while his policies are falling all around him. Inflation is now just as high as it was when six years ago Fraser assumed office, and it is going even higher. Nothing has been done to combat unemployment-the unemployed being the fodder in the fight against inflation. Policies used by this Government have simply and consciously made matters worse. Unemployment-using the official number of jobless-stands at almost 450,000 with the expectation that it will climb to half a million. Six per cent of the work force is officially unemployed and unofficially the figure stands at almost twice that. In the area of economic growth-something for which this Government professes to stand-the record is appalling in that, as one of the richest countries in the world, we have no growth and in fact we are going into reverse. The Government's record is one of broken promise after broken promise and it goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to education, the Government has for six years talked about maintaining real levels of spending. It has talked about providing services and resources in the areas of greatest need. In 1977 Prime Minister Fraser talked about helping the isolated and handicapped children, Aboriginal children and unemployed youth. These promises are in tatters. Those who are really in need of equal educational opportunities have been tossed on to the social scrap heap. Spending on Aboriginal education has been cut by more than 30 per cent since 1975. Expenditure on isolated children's allowances has been cut by more than $ 5m in real terms and handicapped children's allowances were not increased between 1976 and 1980. As a consequence they have been substantially cut in real terms. In the area of unemployed youth the Government's record is pitiful. The Fraser Government slashed programs for training and retraining. It has given token funding increases for the Education Program for Unemployed Youth and the school to work transition program is just not working. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of health we need only begin with the famous statement made by the Prime Minister in 1975 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We will maintain Medibank, and ensure that the standard of health care does not decline. </PARA>
<PARA>Since then we have gone through six tortuous changes to the health system, all brought about by enormous pressure from private medical funds and resulting in two things-higher health charges for all Australians and a decline in standards. What sort of standard of health care is it when the system is so shabbily organised and presided over that doctors are able to defraud the system of, at the lowest estimate, $1,000m a year? Community health care programs have been disregarded by this Government. Spending on such schemes as a proportion of the health budget is well down on 1975 levels. We have no Medibank in the true, original sense of the word and fewer and fewer people, because of exorbitant doctors' and health insurance fees, have access to adequate health care. </PARA>
<PARA> One other area which this Government has ballyhooed about time and time again is that of ministerial responsibility, although one must admit that, with the recent activities, indiscretions, dealings and extra-parliamentary indulgences of the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair), the Government has gone somewhat quiet in this area in recent days. But let us look at the promise and the performance in this area. In March 1978 the Prime Minister, in an electorate broadcast, said:</PARA>
<PARA>My Government has demonstrated again and again our fundamental commitment to restoring integrity to public administration in Australia. Our record in this regard is without parallel in our history. As long as I lead the Government, there is no way known that anything less than the highest code and practice of public administration will be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA>I challenge the Government and the Leader of the Government to affirm this statement here today. Just when the Government was getting off the ground in 1975 we had the first set of allegations-against Minister Garland who was involved in bribery allegations in the Australian Capital Territory Senate elections. He was charged and had to resign. He subsequently resigned from Parliament and has been honoured with a knighthood for his services to the Government. In 1977 Mr Lynch, who was then Treasurer, had to resign because of dark clouds over land deals involving his family trust in a land speculation company in Victoria. In 1978 there were allegations of favoured treatment for a firm called Stawell Timber Industries Pty Ltd in the Prime Minister's electorate . The same year the Australian Postal Commission bought land at Boondall in Queensland, a deal which involved a windfall profit for friends of the late Eric Robinson, a Fraser Minister. Government Ministers were involved in the rigging of electoral boundaries in 1978, as some people in this House will remember more easily than others. Then we have the still shadowy case of Ian Sinclair's family business-forgery and fraud. In 1979 one Minister, Newman, said that he changed an answer he gave in Parliament after consulting Mr Fraser and Mr Lynch. On the same matter, a former Minister, Senator Webster, misled the Parliament in respect to oil rigging on the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>

Then we had the case of the now departed Mr Tony Staley who in 1980 refused to take action against Mr Rupert Murdoch, although it was quite clear that the latter had been proven to have breached aspects of the Broadcasting and Television Act. Late last year we had Mr Sinclair appearing once again in the Asia Dairy Industries affair. This list is not exhaustive and it is not comprehensive, but it serves to make a mockery of what the Prime Minister said in these matters. This is, in fact, a government which, more than any other in the history of this country, has been riddled with allegations of skulduggery, dirty dealing, trickery, faslehoods and deceptions. Since 1975 the record shows that 12 Ministers have had to resign, four have been sacked and two have been asked to stand down, have been suspended, until the heat cooled down. Where then is the integrity as promised by this Government? Where is the highest code and practice of public administration which the Prime Minister promised and which honourable senators opposite do not seem to be too concerned about today?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one aspect of this area of policy on which I agree with the Prime Minister; that is, when he says that his Government's record is without parallel in Australia's history. If any other Government had, in fact, achieved the record of this Government in this area it would long ago have resigned. Can we reasonably expect a Government with such a shameful record in relation to its own affairs to honour anything else it says? In every area it has continued to break its promises. In respect to unemployment, the poor, the migrants, Australian women, the sick, the disabled, and the needy, it has broken promises to the workers of Australia, to the taxpayers of Australia and to the Australian people. Despite the words of Liberal-National Country Party members and senators , this Government has not looked after Australians. Through massive cuts in public expenditure in those areas which provide real benefits for Australians it has reduced living standards for the majority of citizens in this country. The Government's response to this might be one of denial but in answer to questions which I have put on the Notice Paper, which already appear in the Senate Hansard and which I do not need to provide once again, the record stands clear and the Government stands com- mitted. As I have said, those records are available to those senators who wish to peruse the table to see how spending priorities have in fact been changed since 1975. It is a table which graphically illustrates the cold-hearted attack this Government has made on living standards. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short time available I have only scraped the surface of this Government' s broken promises, and my colleagues Senator Robert Ray and Senator Jones will follow this up. I could also look into the areas of women's affairs, industrial relations and consumer affairs where the promise was made that the Australian consumer would be protected and that the plans of the Whitlam Government would be proceeded with. In the last five years we have seen a growing silence in respect of this area. We can look at waste and extravagance; we can look at the overseas trips; we can look at the current situation of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) who has gone off to a conference for three days but who will be out of Australia for four weeks without justification for the extra time spent. I could talk about social security payments, pensions, welfare and wages. One can look at the Prices Justification Tribunal and the broken commitments made in relation to it. One can look at the Trade Practices Commission and consider the commitments made there. I could mention also the very serious backdowns in relation to uranium export and safeguards, commitments that were made over two elections but which have not been met by this Government. But, overall, this Government's record speaks for itself. It is a record of disastrous deceit which will ring in the ears of every Australian, of every elector in the seat of Lowe this weekend, of every elector in Victoria on 3 April and of every elector in Australia at the next general election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a matter of public importance on a subject submitted by the Australian Labor Party, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The continual failure of the Prime Minister and the coalition government to honour the promises made to the people of Australia as outlined in their 1980 policy speech. </PARA>
<PARA>The debate is about those promises made in the 1980 policy speech and whether they have been honoured. One should remind the Senate and the public that in 1975 the Fraser Government was elected because of the outrageously bad performance of the then Whitlam-Hayden Government. Subsequently, in 1977, following a very good performance by the Fraser Government, the Government was re-elected because of its ability to perform on its promises. Again, in 1980, based upon the performance of the Fraser Government over the three years from 1977 to 1980, the Fraser Government was re-elected. The public, having had the opportunity to scrutinise, first of all, the performance of the Whitlam-Hayden Government, rejected it out of hand. Now, three times the public has looked at the performance of this Government and returned it to office. </PARA>
<PARA> The focus of Senator Bolkus's speech was really when he said that the whole strategy of the Government was based on its economic performance. He indicated that it had been abysmal. Indeed, I found it most refreshing to go to the Government's policy speech. It is a very refreshing document because it proves the truth of what we said then and our performance since. The document states that the first challenge that faced the Government in the 1980s was the pursuit of responsible economic management. Responsible economic management may sometimes sound far away from our everyday lives. As the first witness on that statement I refer honourable senators to the economic survey of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on Australia just published. It is a document which judges Australia, both in the narrower sense of Australia itself and in its performance by contrast with other countries. How does it judge our economic performance? The documents put Australia ahead of other countries in economic performance. It indicates that there will be more economic growth in Australia this year and in the years ahead than in other countries. The basis of this matter of public importance is that the Government has failed in its economic performance. But the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Influenced by strongly rising private fixed investment, mainly associated with large resource projects, the economy expanded rapidly in the eighteen months to mid-1981-the period reviewed in this Survey. The upswing was broadly based. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me pause there. Here is an influence by strongly rising private fixed investment. Does anyone know any business corporation or individual that will invest in an economy that is not performing well? The only time that we get strongly rising fixed investment is when we have good performance. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . mainly associated with large resource projects</PARA>
<PARA>If one turns to the policy speech, it identifies the fact that we, as a government, were able to attract such large resource projects. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the economy expanded rapidly . . . The up- swing was broadly based: most components of demand have been buoyant, employment has continued to rise rapidly and unemployment has fallen for the first time for several years. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a contrast to what Senator Bolkus has said. That has been stated by the OECD, not by a partisan Labor senator who thinks he can get some quick trick out of a by-election. It is an objective study of Australia. It states that Australia, measured against its peer nations, is doing better than other nations . Senator Bolkus's second significant statement in that wholly written speech- there were not too many-was that inflation is just as high now as it was six years ago and going higher. Because some doubts have been cast in this place about inflation, I sought figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It indicated that the annual changes in inflation rates from 1972 to 1975 were from 5.9 per cent to 15.1 per cent under the Whitlam Government. It noted that in the March quarter of 1975 the inflation rate was 17.6 per cent. It noted also that the inflation rate fell to 9.7 per cent in 1981 and, as honourable senators know , it is now in the vicinity of 10 per cent. How can a responsible senator say that inflation is just as high now as it was when it was 17.6 per cent, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in March 1975? The Australian Bureau of Statistics states that in 1975 the inflation rate was 15.1 per cent. That, if I may say, rather puts the statements by Senator Bolkus to shame. </PARA>
<PARA> A considerable amount of wordage has been used regarding taxation. It was stated that the Fraser Government was a much higher taxing government than the Whitlam Government although it claimed that it would reduce taxes. So that we will have no doubt, I seek leave for Table 6-Commonwealth Government Budget Receipts 1971-72 to 1980-81 and 1981-82-to be incorporated. If we take the increase in revenue takes year by year we find that in the last year of the McMahon Government, the increase in revenue was 6 per cent. In the first year of the Whitlam Government there was a 28 per cent increase; the next year it was 29 per cent; the next year it was 19 per cent. So over those three years there was an average increase year by year in revenue take of 25.3 per cent. Then in the six years of this Government the increase was 17 per cent, 8.6 per cent, 9 per cent, 17 per cent, 19 per cent and 16 per cent, making an average of 14.4 per cent. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the table and the percentages added thereto. </PARA>

Australia' s most prominent and very distinguished actuary, Professor Pollard, having studied the figures, said that clearly the last six years had been a period of significant fall in the real income tax burden. Professor Pollard has now produced a further table which shows comparisons between 1974-75 tax, the last period of the Whitlam Government, and 1980-81 tax, the last period measurable of this Government. This table shows that for each of the various income groups after making allowances for tax rebates, dependent spouses and various adjustments, there has been a significant percentage fall in the proportion of tax paid now compared with that paid in the past.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be perfectly happy to show this document to the Opposition and then again ask for its incorporation in Hansard. Repeatedly we grant leave for a document to be incorporated without sighting it. So far I have referred to two tables. One shows that year by year increases in revenue under the Whitlam Government were virtually double the average increase under the Fraser Government. That entirely refutes Senator Bolkus's statement. I have also shown that year by year over the past six years there has been a decrease in the proportion of income tax take. Need one remind the Senate that under the Whitlam-Hayden Labor scales people who earned $7,000 or more paid 35c in the dollar tax, those who earned from $10,000 up paid 45c in the dollar tax and those who earned from $15,000 up paid 55c in the dollar tax. Under our scales in 1980 we had a standard rate of 32c in the dollar tax for people who earned up to $17,000, and that embraced the great majority of all taxpayers. Yet it is alleged there was no reform of tax scales. Professor Pollard has indicated that in the last six years the purchasing power of average weekly earnings rose 6.3 per cent-if that is not performance I do not know what is-average household income in real terms rose 5.4 per cent, household consumption expenditure per household in real terms rose 9.5 per cent, real non-farm gross domestic product per person rose 8.2 per cent and registered motor vehicles per thousand population rose 18.6 per cent-from 419 to nearly 500. Despite price rises the average cost of a car, measured in terms of weekly earnings, fell 5 per cent between 1975 and 1980.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me turn to a matter that the Labor Party was very shy about and which was its main negative campaign in the 1980 election. The Labor Party has said that we have failed to repay the increase in the crude oil levy. If one reflects upon the 1980 Federal election campaign one will see one clear issue. The Labor Party spokesman for national development and energy, Mr Keating, tried to frighten people in the election campaign. He said that under a Fraser Government there would be monumental rises month by month in petrol prices in Australia. He said that prices would rise through the roof to 50c a litre and onwards and that there would be great disaster in Australia under our government. He tried to frighten the people. Thank God the people have not been frightened. Mr Keating has been deadly silent over the last year or so because since the election campaign the real price of oil and petrol in Australia has fallen so that the very platform on which the Labor Party went to the people-that we were the people who would increase the real price of oil-has failed miserably. Rather than the price of oil rising it is falling both in real and nominal terms. How can a party that tried to frighten the people now do these things?</PARA>
<PARA> It is alleged that the Government has failed to make good its statement that it would help families through increases it received from the crude oil levy. I make it perfectly clear that there has been no increase at all in the crude oil levy. In fact there has been a decrease, and therefore there has been no increment to disburse. These are the kinds of statements that have been made. Let me look at what has happened. We were elected in 1980, as we were in 1975 and 1977, to manage the economy. The OECD says that we are managing the economy as good or better than our peer nations throughout the world. The OECD sees real growth in Australia compared with other countries. I have shown that taxation, under the Whitlam Government, rose year by year at nearly double the grab of this Government. I have shown using an eminent actuary's figures that the net proportion of personal income tax has decreased. I will take another step and demonstrate the kinds of claims that are made. We are talking of performance. In 1972-73, the last financial year of the McMahon Government, 188,384 dwellings were approved in Australia. The next year the number fell to 179,720. The next year, 1974-75, it fell to 121,323. Over two years there was a fall in approvals of 67,000. That is the record of a party which is now talking about performance. Wherever one looks one will find that, where Labor failed, this Government has performed. It is acknowledged throughout the world by investment flow, by the OECD and by others as performing better than its peers. That is why Australia is experiencing real growth while other countries are in recession. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Sir John Carrick, is almost a political Rip Van Winkle in many ways. He seems to have lived his greatest years from 1972 to 1975 . Since then rarely has he contributed anything to these sorts of debates other than waving about a couple of economic documents. I do not accept that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development necessarily is the best and only fair analysis of Australia's position, nor do I accept the actuary he has put up as a particularly creditable person. Recently in this chamber we saw the grotesque spectacle of Liberals attacking the Australian Democrats on the basis of broken election promises. I got the impression that certain Liberals opposite would like to gaol some of Don Chipp's small group for a crime that this Government, without exception, has been guilty of. These days the community is pleasantly surprised, even shocked, if the Liberal Party Government keeps one of its promises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In defending this Government the Liberals always claim that economic circumstances have changed. One would think they would learn from the past. Of course there will be changed economic circumstances from time to time. That is why it is not creditable to make the sorts of political promises that the Liberal Party of Australia made at the last three Federal elections. Sadly, a majority of the Australian public was gullible enough to fall for the twists and turns in Liberal policy after the 1975 and 1977 elections. The success of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in conning the electorate in no way excuses his pompous and patronising attitude at the 1980 election. He thought he knew best but history has subsequently proved that he did not. The community knows through hard experience that the extravagant and wishful promises made by Malcolm Fraser never had a chance of success, largely because of the economic conditions created by his Government. No doubt, in order to restrain their natural honesty from explaining all this to the community in 1980, the Liberals busily devoted themselves to fabricating non-existent Labor policies. Menzies taught his proteges well-when a party cannot win with its own policies, it should lie and distort its opposition's policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The only success the Government can claim from the last election was-Senator Sir John Carrick said it-the belief that it had better economic managers. I have no doubt that the belief existed in the community before and during the 1980 election that members of the Liberal Party were better economic managers. No matter what party one supports one has to admit that that claim looks pretty sick today. We can prove that the conservative government elected for a third time 16 months ago consists of irresponsible, uneconomic mis-managers. It has failed to deliver its fundamental economic promises, and what it has delivered it has had no mandate for. In fact, after comparing the current economic policies of the Liberal and National Country Parties with their promises, or more often their silence, before the 1980 election, the only reasonable conclusion I can draw is that they lacked the guts to tell the public what the true economic conditions were in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I realise that many Liberals have limited powers of memory, let us cast our minds back to 1975, 1977, 1980 or any year we like. The current Prime Minister damned the Australian Labor Party for failing to control inflation. He promised that the pursuit of responsible management would be the key to lowering inflation. As faithful neo-conservatives, Government members have interpreted that objective as being achievable only through a restraint of government expenditure. This highly principled policy of restraint has brought inflation, measured by the consumer price index, to its highest level in four years. The 4. 2 per cent increase in the December 1981 quarter brought the annual inflation rate to 11.3 per cent. To be objective, the best way to judge inflation is to take the annual rate and not take it over several quarters. I am not saying that only the Liberal Party has used quarterly figures to make itself look better; the Labor Party has done the same in the past. The election claim that Australia 's inflation rate was below the average for comparable advanced industrialised countries has proved to be short-lived. The OECD document quoted from by Senator Sir John Carrick shows that the average is 10.1 per cent for those countries. In Australia it is over 11 per cent and shows every indication of rising. I think that refutes the point made by Senator Sir John Carrick. At least half this inflation rate has been due to Government policies, such as sales tax, health insurance increases and rising prices forced on State governments-all things for which this Government had no mandate, but which it has forced through. The social impact of inflation can be modified provided one has a sympathetic government. At least in 1972 to 1975 there were schemes to help the Australian people to modify whatever effects inflation had. There are no such schemes today . </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at income tax revenue. In the current financial year it will increase by $3 billion, equivalent to an average of $11 per taxpayer in this country. The Treasury estimates that income tax receipts will rise by 22 per cent in 1981-82. These are later and more relevant figures than those cited by Senator Sir John Carrick. Yet the Government is counting on only a 15 per cent increase in wages over the same time. It is hard to interpret this in any way other than as explicit acceptance by the Government of a policy involving redistribution of wealth from the poor to the rich. No one would pretend it is a secret that the current Government is the highest taxing administration in Australia's history. Until 1981 the Prime Minister and his satraps had taken $ 162 billion from the Australian taxpayer. This year alone, the Liberals will tax Australians almost as much as they were taxed in the entire three years of the Whitlam Government. We in the Labor Party have no objection to high taxation as long as it is slotted in among those who can afford to pay it. By that, I usually mean the friends and backers of the Liberal-National Country Party coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1975, when Bill Hayden was Treasurer, pay-as-you-earn taxpayers contributed 41.7 per cent. Today they contribute over 45 per cent. Pay-as-you-earn tax, as a proportion of total income tax, has increased from 59 per cent to 66 per cent. The Prime Minister, 16 months ago, in his policy speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Tax relief purchased at the cost of higher inflation would be no relief at all.</PARA>
<PARA>Today we have higher inflation, and there is still no tax relief in sight, barring, of course, the possibility of some sweetener being put out to help the Government in an early election. In 1975 the Prime Minister promised full tax indexation. Does Senator Sir John Carrick remember that promise? It was never once delivered. After five years of failing to deliver it, in April 1981 it was scrapped for all time. The promise was made in 1975, 1977 and 1980 but it was never once delivered. Today Australians must rely on erratic adjustments of tax scales made for purely electoral reasons. The Australian Taxpayers Association has estimated that, if there is no repeat of the July 1981 adjustments this year , personal income tax will rise by 25 per cent in the next financial year. Is it any wonder that the Labor Party fully supports the efforts of wage earners to defend their declining standard of living? Yet the Prime Minister could offer a real tax cut of at least $9 a week to every Australian taxpayer if he were prepared to tackle Australia's biggest growth industry; that is, the tax avoidance industry which minimally is worth $2,500m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from the undeclared schemes, the Commissioner of Taxation has identified 22,000 Australians who have succeeded in avoiding the payment of $1 billion in taxes. Identified tax avoiders have increased by 30 per cent in the last financial year. They have doubled in the last two years. The number of Australians shirking their tax responsibilities is 26 times larger today than it was under the Hayden treasuryship of 1975. There is no mention of this scandal, I agree, in the 1980 policy speech. The Prime Minister's only reference was to partial adjustment of the scales. Sixteen months later the Government has failed to tackle this problem at all. Instead, the Liberals expect salary earners and those on fixed incomes to pick up the slack-a gap approaching several billion dollars. Even a cautious attitude to reforming Australia's taxation system might be understandable if Australia were in the middle of a boom-but clearly we are not. Not even the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is suggesting that we are in the middle of a boom. To be charitable it is not entirely the fault of the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As part of Labor's commitment to a strong mixed economy we recognise that economic recovery in this country will only occur in a joint effort between government and private industry. The Government has failed completely to create a positive atmosphere in which public and private sectors can grow together and not at each others expense. In 1980 the Prime Minister promised he would deliver economic development because 'It means jobs, prosperity and security for Australian working men and women'. Following a downturn in production towards the end of 1981, economic surveys by the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Bank of New South Wales suggest that a general expectation exists in the business community to the effect that employment conditions are unlikely to improve in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> We can nail the Government on its failure to stimulate employment growth. The employment market has stagnated in the past 16 months. Job creation succeeded in reducing official unemployment by only 0.1 per cent from 6.3 per cent to 6.2 per cent. Existing job vacancies fell and were only 36,700 in November 1981. In comparison with this sort of neo-conservatism I may be regarded as old fashioned and even Keynesian in my approach. I cannot see how any government can justify the contraction of the public sector demand represented by the Review of Commonwealth Functions and the 1981 Budget when massive human and material resources exist in Australia but are not being utilised. How bad do things have to get before the Government will take action? Ben Chifley engineered the commitment by a Labor government in 1945 to a policy of full employment. For 30 years that policy remained intact. The Labor Party has always stood by it as its number one policy. We affirm it today. In contrast, the Liberal-National Country parties have abandoned any belief in full employment but have never been game enough to tell the community that. </PARA>
<PARA> The only good sign recently is that the Prime Minister and his acolyte the Treasurer (Mr Howard) have finally acknowledged that Australia is part of the world economy. I am sure Gough Whitlam and Bill Hayden are suitably gratified to know that the Prime Minister now admits that international economic relations might have some influence on Australia's economic performance in 1975- insignificant though the problems under Labor then look now. The balance of payments situation will no doubt be commented on. All I will do is to add that the real value of Australia's export trade will continue to decline. I emphasise that the Government cannot promise an export led recovery. Of course, the Government has attempted to link Australia's decline in the world economy with our general poor standard of industrial relations. On this I will quote perhaps the only truth contained in the 1980 policy speech of the Prime Minister when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> What is happening is the result of our policies. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe the Government is pursuing a useless and irrelevant set of industrial laws dreamt up by the ideological honchos who hang around the Prime Minister. In their attempt to set up company unions, to extend the stand down clauses to private enterprise and abolish preference to unionists, I get the sad impression that Government members do not know anything about industrial relations-except, of course, when it comes to Solidarity. By maintaining the Industrial Relations Bureau, restricting the Trade Practices Commission and abolishing the Prices Justification Tribunal, the current Government is guaranteeing a hostile industrial environment. The Prime Minister is attempting to undermine trade union organisation and at the same time undermine the confidence of trade unionists that they can get a fair deal. In April last year Mr Fraser signalled the end of wage indexation. As with tax indexation the Liberals claimed at three elections- 1975, 1977 and 1980-to support adjustment of wages tied to the consumer price index. Yet in the first six years Mr Fraser has been Prime Minister his Government has never once supported 100 per cent indexation. On 10 occasions the Federal Government has stepped in and said there would be no increase at all. The best the Government has ever done is 60 per cent wage indexation. In 1980 the Prime Minister said it was a responsibility of trade unionists to put Australia first. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what we can do to keep governments honest. The Prime Minister has a pretty good survival record up to now. How he will get out of answering for the country's problems, I do not know. I suspect the only way to get the truth out of this Government would be to put Malcolm Fraser in a hospital-private of course-and pump him full of sodium pentothal. Sadly, however, I doubt that any private insurance fund would cover the Prime Minister for the length of stay necessary. </PARA>

<PARA> The continual failure of the Prime Minister and the Coalition government to honour the promises made to the people of Australia as outlined in their 1980 policy speech. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the subject nominated by Senator Bolkus. That is the subject we ought to be debating today. Of course, it is an old trick that when a subject one does not like very much is being debated one talks about another subject. I think it is very unusual for someone to nominate the subject of debate and then choose to talk about a different subject. I certainly came into the Senate chamber expecting something on the subject of the 1980 election policy speech. Instead, we have had rambling discourses with only occasional references to the 1980 policy speech. These are speeches which could have been given anywhere in Australia on any subject at all by any Australian Labor Party politician with an interest, at that instant, in criticising a Liberal government, but certainly not necessarily speeches on the subject nominated by Opposition senators. </PARA>

Nevertheless, I say that under any rules of debate, including those of the Senate, if people make allegations then the people against whom those allegations are being made do have some sort of right of reply.

<PARA> I emphasise that I certainly entered this debate expecting to talk about 1980 policy promises and what has or, it may be alleged, has not happened in relation to them. Therefore, it is relevant, I think, that I mention to the Senate something about the 1980 policy speech of the Government. I will quote from the policy speech given by the Prime Minister on 30 September 1980. At the beginning he set the tone of the Government's approach to the election and to the three years that would follow the election when it was returned to government. He said :</PARA>
<PARA> Tonight, I want to talk to you about the challenges and opportunities that lie before us. </PARA>
<PARA>I will take the five points that follow as a key to what this debate should be about. The Prime Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> First, we must maintain responsibility in economic affairs because, without that, all else fails. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, we must harness this nation's resources in a co-ordinated and responsible programme of national development. </PARA>
<PARA> Third, we must see that from the prosperity we generate, we provide adequately for those in need. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourth, as individuals and as a nation, we must encourage ability and cultivate excellence. </PARA>

In fact, Senator Walsh's side has decided that today he will not get a guernsey. I suggest the honourable senator sit still, be quiet and restrain himself because I will talk about those matters. I will take the first point which concerns the Government's 'responsibility in economic affairs because, without that, all else fails'. It is certainly open to the Opposition to make some criticism of the Australian economy. It is not open to it to be quite as scathing about it as it has been because its record in government as an economic manager was the worst of any government in modern Australian history.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. We have never resiled from the fact that we are in difficult economic times and that tough situations leave no soft options. Of course, we and the Australian people have had soft options presented to us by the Labor Party as it did in 1975, 1977 and indeed, in 1980, which is supposed to be the subject of this debate. We have not pretended at any time-we certainly did not during the 1980 election campaign- that that responsibility in economic affairs, to which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) referred, would be, and is, irresponsibility. It is not. I suggest we must accept that that has been to the forefront of the Government's policies and it has maintained that duty and has acted responsibly. Without that responsibility in economically troubled times our society would be at peril in a whole range of ways. It does the Opposition no credit to come into this chamber and list individual items without putting them into some sort of framework. The Opposition could list today a number of areas of criticism. We could list a whole lot of other areas in which we could show that we are above criticism. That would prove nothing at all. But a general proposition has been put to us and we will debate that general proposition. We assert that we have been responsible in economic affairs and that we have not taken soft options in tough situations. The suggestions that we have failed or that we have not lived up to what we said we would do in 1980 fail on the basis of that test because that is what we said we would do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point made by the Prime Minister in his 1980 policy speech was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we must harness this nation's resources in a co-ordinated and responsible programme of national development. </PARA>
<PARA>Earlier in this debate the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) outlined some of those areas. Since it is his area of responsibility I do not think there is need for me to speak on that matter at any length this afternoon. However, some points ought to be made in general terms in relation to it because it has been the choice of Opposition senators today to harp on matters such as employment and unemployment, confidence and one thing and another. I will quote some of the figures relating to the state of manufacturing in Australia available as at February 1982. The figures I have before me are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> In the September quarter 1981-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, at the end of the first year after the 1980 election-</PARA>
<PARA>the real value of manufacturers' sales rose by 0.6 per cent to be 2.9 per cent above the September quarter 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1980 policy speech was given in the September quarter. Twelve months later, after a policy speech and an election in which we laid stress on the importance of the manufacturing sector, of investment in business and the opportunities that that gives for raising the levels of employment, we see that the real value of manufacturers sales has risen by nearly 3 per cent. These are the sorts of facts that Opposition speakers like to overlook. The statement on the state of manufacturing continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Manufacturing employment grew by 2.3 per cent between August and November 1981 to be 2.4 per cent above November 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>Those figures relate to the effect of the Liberal Government's policy on employment and the line that we took then which is part of our philosophy. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a view that the unions had some responsibility for what happened to employment in Trans Australia Airlines. The honourable senator should tell us about that. Employment and the value of manufacturing rose in the 12 months after the policy speech in which the Prime Minister said that our approach to stimulating employment would be to provide a climate of economic stability and responsibility which encourages investment and growth in reasonable and sound ways not in 'make work' ways. The statement continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The trend of manufacturing input and output prices is however encouraging. </PARA>
<PARA> The annual rate of increase in the price index of materials used in manufacturing fell from 12.9 per cent in November 1980 to 0.1 per cent in November 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The annual rate of increase in the price index of articles produced by manufacturers fell from 11.8 per cent in December 1980 to 6.8 per cent in December 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>It appears that good news is unwelcome to some. </PARA>
<PARA> I point to one other critical area of development in Australia in world terms at the moment. The Australian Petroleum Exploration Association Ltd made the following statement on 20 January 1982:</PARA>
<PARA> Between 280 and 300 petroleum exploration wells are expected to be drilled in Australia in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> This is double the 1981 exploration program and will involve expenditure in excess of $800 million. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> A large proportion of the wells, particularly onshore, will be drilled by companies which are predominantly Australian in ownership. </PARA>
<PARA>The spokesman said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the very significant increase in exploration effort predicted for 1982 reflected Australia's healthy political climate when compared to elsewhere in the world, international parity for local crude oil prices, the Federal Government's promise that 'new' oil would not attract secondary taxation, and the success of 23 wildcat wells out of 98 drilled last year. </PARA>
<PARA>That is solid evidence and those are solid facts that the policies that we proclaimed in 1980 and that we have implemented are working. That we have implemented them is clear in that area. Promises in relation to those points have been kept. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that time is running short. The third point which was mentioned by the Prime Minister in his policy speech related to providing for those in need. I point just briefly to the recent increases in the family allowance. I say in passing that the Government has already kept every promise that it made in its 1980 policy speech in the social welfare area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. We are proud of it, Senator. We should proclaim it long and loud, particularly at every opportunity that the Opposition gives us in the Senate. I remind the Senate that the Government announced in its Budget Speech that the family allowance for third and subsequent children would be increased by 50 per cent from January 1982. That has happened. Approximately 540,000 families with 1,860,000 children are now benefiting from this increase, which costs the Government $124m in a full year. Of course, by concentrating on those families with more than two children the Government was attempting to aim that increased assistance at families who, in general terms, could be discerned as most in need of that additional assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fourth point that the Prime Minister made in his policy speech was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we must encourage ability and cultivate excellence. </PARA>
<PARA>I have but two minutes left which means, therefore, that I can make only brief reference to our policies in those areas. I point out to the Senate that very recently, on 29 January 1982, the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) implemented a most significant policy speech promise in relation to the funding of Commonwealth special research centres generally known as 'centres of excellence' . Additional funding of $16m, additional to recurrent funding, was made available for that. This is a great initiative which will indeed encourage that excellence that we think should be encouraged and harnessed for the benefit of all Australians. In the course of the debate we have had only nit-picking criticism, picking at the edges of what is a highly political area. The first speaker in the debate, Senator Bolkus, referred surprisingly to the Lowe by- election. I suggest that probably the only reason why this debate has been initiated is some general political slanging on behalf of the Opposition in relation to the Lowe by-election. The Government is proud of its record in relation to the promises it made in 1980. It is proud to defend that record this afternoon in debating this matter of public importance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a couple of comments. The Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) said we did not refer to the 1980 policy speech. It is my intention to refer to that policy speech and to some of the statements made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I do not have that policy speech with me-Senator Martin read the preamble-there is one statement by the Prime Minister which I should read and which sums up very clearly his attitude in relation to his leadership in this country. He was speaking at an Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science conference on 22 January 1975. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>When political leaders say the present situation cannot be helped, it is part of a world situation, they are expressing the futility of their own leadership when if they were men of real stature, they would be saying 'we can overcome'.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a very true criticism of the present leadership of Australia. Let us look at the 1980 policy speech delivered by the Prime Minister of this country. If anyone reads the document they could wonder whether they were reading a Grimm's fairy tale that began, 'once upon a time'. I would like to refer to some of the statements made by the Prime Minister in that fairy tale. One of the statements that made an impression on me was this:</PARA>
<PARA>Five years ago we committed Australia to a new sense of direction and national purpose. We have fulfilled that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA>It is now more than 17 months, counting this month, since the fairy tale was delivered to the electors of Australia. Let us look at the so-called commitment and the consequences for the people of this nation. It is the product of a fertile imagination or pure self-delusion to assert:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a new confidence is alive in Australia's men and women . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Prime Minister wanted us to believe some 17 months ago. Is it confidence that helps the people of Australia suffer the unemployment forced on them by the policies of this Government. Is it confidence that helps the people of Australia suffer the tax burden that has been put on them by this Government, the greatest tax burden in this country's history? Is it confidence that helps people struggle with astronomical health costs, unnecessary increases in petrol costs, prices on essential goods rampaging out of control, high interest rates- the highest on record-and pension rates that are nothing short of a national disgrace? Any member of this Government who took the time to talk to the people within Queensland or any other State, and particularly those electors in Lowe-I know we mentioned Lowe before-or in South Australia would know what has happened to the confidence Australians have left. We are about to be reminded rather forcibly by the Lowe by-election and the State election in Victoria. I think most honourable senators on the Government side of the chamber would have to agree that the invitation issued to the Prime Minister to participate in the Victorian State election was withdrawn. Now he sneaks into his home in Victoria and sneaks out. He plays no role. I think it was Saturday's edition of the Australian which showed photographs of Mr Peacock electioneering in Victoria, instead of the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser. He is not even welcome in his home State. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if this Government has not lost confidence-I believe it has: the people have-its Budget is in chaos, the cost of living is out of control and the Budget deficit is out of control. The banks are now warning that interest rates are about to go through the roof. What does this Government do about it? It tries to divert the public attention from its hopeless mismanagement of the economy by bringing in industrial legislation designed to provoke the trade union movement and further divide the Australian community. We get into the field of good old union bashing again when we hear about stand downs by employers. We talk about unions of a particular industry. We will have 2,000 odd unions in Australia. It will be impossible to bring about good industrial relations in this country. Let us see how the policy stands up to scrutiny. Seventeen months ago the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . our balance of trade was the best result for the decade . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a statement made by the Prime Minister. So it was. We were $2.7 billion in the black, and 12 months later, under this Government, our balance of trade was $35m in the red. The figure for the 1981 December quarter shows a trade deficit of $867m, nearly $1 billion in the red. Again 17 months ago the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> A measure of our compassion as a society is the extent to which we provide dignity in old age . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Is dignity in old age enhanced by the necessity to eat canned pet food in order to obtain enough protein to survive? Is dignity in old age considered when threatening pensioners with asset tests and then going into recess for Christmas , leaving them to agonise over their future security? Touching compassion, is it not, at a time of traditional good will? But that is exactly what the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) did to the pensioners prior to last Christmas. What about the future security for elderly Australians who have paid their taxes into this country's coffers for all their working lives? In 1975 the pension was 23.2 per cent of the average weekly earnings. Now it is the equivalent of 22.1 per cent of the average weekly earnings. The estimated value of this month is 21.6 per cent. There is no reason why the pension should not be raised immediately to the level of 25 per cent of the average weekly earnings. What sort of future security is nutured by people such as Sir Phillip Lynch warning of sweeping reviews of social security payments? It is a measure of the extent of compassion for fellow Australians that is felt by the puppets of the corporate elite who presently occupy our treasury benches. Let us deal with what the Prime Minister said in the policy speech. Only 17 months ago Mr Fraser said:</PARA>
<PARA> This year-1979-1980-we achieved the best employment growth for 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Seventeen months later we are suffering the worst unemployment level for nearly 50 years. It is now more than 6.5 per cent, and that does not take into account the level of hidden unemployment. If honourable senators think that the Government's attitude to the aged is callous they should spare a thought for the unemployed teenagers. Teenage employment in Australia showed a modest growth until the first Howard Budget after the 1980 election. In August 1981 1,100 more teenage jobs were available than in the previous August. If we look bit further we will find tht in September 1981 there were 2,000 fewer than in September 1980 . Teenage job vacancies have maintained a steady decline ever since. In January this year there were 23,200 vacancies fewer than in the corresponding period in 1981. The most disturbing factor is that more than 75 per cent of the decline was in full time work. So much for the employment record of Mr Fraser. I suppose this question should be asked: How much more meaningless rhetoric of this man will the people of Australia be subject to? How can we believe him any more because 17 months ago he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we must maintain responsibility in economic affairs because, without that, all else fails. </PARA>
<PARA>Again in that fine document-that policy speech-he stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this financial year-</PARA>
<PARA>Meaning 1980-81-</PARA>
<PARA>the domestic deficit will be wiped out altogether. </PARA>
<PARA>It was, at a tremendous cost to families and wage earners. I ask honourable senators not to look so worried; it was. In 1981-82 families and wage earners are worse off than ever and the Budget deficit is disappearing over the horizon like the sun going down. Mr Fraser said in his policy speech:</PARA>
<PARA> We earlier committed ourselves to reforming the tax scales. We have fulfilled that commitment absolutely. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators ought to ask some of the people who are waiting for the vote to come up in this chamber on the sales tax legislation-the indirect taxation-to see whether they believe Mr Fraser has fulfilled the commitment absolutely. Australian wage earners are now paying the highest taxes in history. I suppose it is a case of the rich getting richer and the poor getting the message. The Prime Minister was also quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> We have introduced firm anti-inflationary policies--</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that we look at the figures and let them speak for themselves. When the Prime Minister spoke those words on 30 September 1980 the rate of inflation was 10.2 per cent. I suppose that there was a little improvement 12 months later when the rate of inflation was 9.1 per cent. It went from 10.2 per cent to 9.1 per cent 12 months later. But last December the inflationary figure was 11.3 per cent. I say to the Senate: So much for this Government's fine words about the need for the people of this country to exercise restraint. The people are shouldering the responsibility and the burden of the Government's bungling in relation to its economic policies. Probably one of the classic quotations from the Prime Minister's 1980 policy speech is the one in relation to parity pricing policies. It is somewhat of a disappointment to me that Senator Sir John Carrick is not in the chamber to hear me quote the statement made by the Prime Minister in his policy speech. He said:</PARA>

<PARA>When will this man, the Prime Minister, ever get anything right? We all know the consequences for the motorist of parity pricing. The Rundle fiasco was one of the first development confidence tricks since the Poseidon adventure in Western Australia. Let me give an example. Let us look at the sale prices for the Rundle twins last year when the Minister for National Development and Energy and the Prime Minister were giving such glowing reports and making such glowing statements about Rundle's future. Central Pacific shares peaked at $8.30 when the statement was made by the Prime Minister and supported by the Minister for National Development and Energy. Southern Pacific Petroleum shares were priced at $3.20. Let us look at the share prices for those two companies today. They are listed at 62c and 26c respectively; that is, they have gone from $8.30 to 62c and $3.20 to 26c respectively. It is the depth of irresponsibility publicly to promote a project that has not been proved viable and wittingly or unwittingly to encourage investors to risk their capital and savings in such a gamble for pure political advantage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting I was quoting from the speech of Senator Bolkus. I was about to point out to the Senate that Senator Bolkus and his colleague Senator Walsh, who have been quoting figures at us, are , in my view, using shonky figures. They say that taxes are at a record high and , in order to establish this, they look at the Commonwealth tax receipts during the last year of the Whitlam Government in relation to gross domestic product. Because at that stage they were 23.3 per cent and they are now 25.5 per cent they say, therefore, that there has been an increase in Commonwealth tax receipts. That is correct; I do not deny that. They then go on to say that if-I emphasise the word 'if'-the ratio which operated in the last part of the Whitlam Budget year were still applicable, every taxpayer would be paying a certain rate of tax. Of course, the 'if' is the big thing. We know from history that throughout the years of the Whitlam Government taxes increased at an enormous rate, as they had to, because the Whitlam Government, as a result of its social welfare system and its wages policy, went on creating for us a tax burden which this Government has been trying ever since to meet legitimately, instead of raising the funds by way of printing money or having a deficit. Since this Government came to power at the end of 1975 we have had higher income, higher purchasing power, average weekly earnings have gone up at the rate of 6.3 per cent, average household income in real terms has increased at the rate of 5.4 per cent, real non-farm gross domestic product has increased at the rate of 8.2 per cent and motor vehicle registrations per 1,000 head of population have increased at the rate of 18.6 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Sir John Carrick was endeavouring to incorporate in Hansard a set of figures showing that, in fact, people in Australia are now paying lower tax levels than they were paying in 1974-75. He was not permitted to incorporate this comparison of tax levels for 1974-75 with those for 1980, so I shall indicate to the Senate the figures which it includes. This table takes into account tax rebates for dependent spouses, child endowment, child tax allowances and family allowances for dependent children. The table shows that the proportion of gross income effectively paid in tax at all levels of taxation has fallen in proportion to income from 10.53 per cent to 20.93 per cent. If the Senate will allow me to incorporate the table in Hansard, I will do so. I seek leave to incorporate the table in Hansard. </PARA>

It fascinates me because Senator Bolkus talked about my party representing the wealthy and Senator Robert Ray repeated those words.

Since the 1950s my party, the Liberal Party, has been the party which looks after the mass of people, the people in need. I suggest to the people of Queensland that they turn to the Liberal Party if they want a party to look after the mass of people, the people in need. From 1975 to 1981 this Government has arranged for the earlier retirement of people. The percentage of people retiring now has increased substantially. There is better health now than there was five or six years ago. More people are being educated at university level than there were in those days. Much more money is being spent on overseas travel . Over a million Australians are going overseas every year. A fantastic percentage of the population is travelling overseas. I might add that over 1 1/4 million people are coming into Australia every year. Tourists are contributing very substantially to this country's welfare. If we look at the overseas investment being made in Australia we will see that it is a result of this Government's popularity overseas, this Government's stability, this Government's strength, this Government's action in bringing the people of Australia forward, not taking them back as they were taken back from 1972 to 1975 when, under the Whitlam Labor Government, this country fell into disrepair to such an extent that it has taken us a long time to recover.

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The second Monday in March is set aside to mark Commonwealth Day and as today is the closest Sitting Day, I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise the significance of the Commonwealth, and its importance for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has shown a remarkable capacity to adapt to changing world circumstances, especially in recent decades. It has a demonstrated capacity to maintain its own continuity through a process of evolution and subtle modification and at the same time it has a proven track record in solving problems. </PARA>
<PARA> As Commonwealth Secretary-General Ramphal said in Melbourne last year, ''it is acknowledged that the Commonwealth can handle disagreement and generate accord'' . He went on to say that ''our dialogue is one between friends within the community of the Commonwealth''. These views have been echoed by dozens of Commonwealth leaders. </PARA>
<PARA> We live in a fragile and dangerous world in which there are few enough fruitful avenues open to the nations of the world to come to terms with the problems which confront us. Because this is so, we should all try to nourish and encourage any avenue which exists and which can do good and the Commonwealth is, without doubt, an avenue which has a number of unique advantages. It brings together rich and poor, North and South. It cuts across many prevailing expectations of alignments among nations. It enables people with very different political philosophies to sit down together and work towards agreement on matters that would otherwise divide them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is the only forum in which Heads of Government set aside several days of their time every two years-in the case of CHOGRM leaders, every year-to address a range of problems of common concern. The informality and flexibility of the Commonwealth enable it to bring new and practical perspectives to bear on problems where the rest of the world community has sometimes found itself locked into sterile exchanges between structured groups. Commonwealth leaders have shown their determination to make the Commonwealth work. Difficulties and shortcomings have never been allowed to stand in the way, and there is no doubt that the Commonwealth warrants our continuing support. </PARA>
<PARA> 1982 will be an important year for the Commonwealth. The Third Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting will take place in Suva in October. This will be the first meeting of Commonwealth leaders in the Pacific Islands, and this has a particular significance following the emphasis given to issues of Pacific concern at last year's Commonwealth meeting. This Meeting will involve Commonwalth Heads of Government from the Asian and Pacific regions. </PARA>
<PARA> The development of Regional Commonwealth Meetings was, as honourable Senators will know, an Australian initiative. We look to the Meeting in Suva to carry forward the valuable and practical achievements of the two previous Regional Meetings in Sydney and New Delhi, and we would anticipate that a number of the issues considered in Melbourne last year will receive further attention at the Suva Meeting. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate is well aware that there is more to the Commonwealth than intergovernmental meetings-the Commonwealth is about people with many shared interests and values associating together voluntarily. At the time of last year' s Commonwealth meeting, a number of other Commonwealth Associations also met in Australia, and later this year the Commonwealth Games will be held in Brisbane. Everyone in this Senate wants these Games to be successful, and I am sure they will be; and I am confident that the favourable impression of Australia gained by Commonwealth visitors last year will be reinforced among visitors to the Brisbane Games. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth deserves our support across the full range of its activities and it is fitting that this support should be duly recognised in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Today I would like the Senate to step back from the cut and thrust of everyday political life to consider the direction in which we wish to move as a nation in the next few years. This Parliament has a profound responsibility to keep abreast of the whole range of issues facing Australia. We need to understand Australia's position in a broad perspective as well as in detail, in the light of international as well as domestic factors. We need to understand the choices which lie ahead and the consequences of the decisions we take. We need a clear sense of our nation's values and objectives and we need to develop and explain our policies in the light of our philosophy. The world is full of uncertainty and because of this, Australia needs a policy approach which is marked by balance, vision and realism. The world is also full of unrealistic demands and expectations in spite of the immediate social and economic problems which many countries are experiencing and which are having an indirect impact on most countries. In a situation of significant uncertainty and difficulty, it would obviously be absurd to expect that high and immediate expectations can be attained at little cost or as a matter of course. But neither should we allow the difficulties being experienced by the world economy to be seen in a way which gets them out of proportion-it would be wrong to overestimate or underestimate them. We need to try to understand them realistically because it is vital if we are to move ahead as one nation in the next few years that people 's expectations should be closely adjusted to reality. Nobody has a crystal ball to predict the future fully but we do know that unless we anticipate and adapt our policies in line with changing circumstances, unless we are in a position to take advantage of changes in the world economy as and when they occur, then opportunities will pass Australia by. We also know that the old adage that you only get out as much as you put in remains as true today as it has always been and it is timely to remember, when we are considering realistic levels of expectations, that what some people get cannot go to others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The International Perspective</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In coming to grips with Australia's present position in an overall perspective, it is appropriate to start with the international dimension. Our independence as a nation cannot blind us to the fact that overseas events affect us profoundly. Much of Australia's history bears witness to the recognition by earlier generations of Australians that we are affected by what happens in other parts of the world. At the present time, Australia cannot ignore the tensions and the threats which exist in so many parts of the world to international security and stability. The Soviet Union pursues its militaristic and opportunistic programs relentlessly. We see the effects of that policy in Afghanistan and Poland and in attempts to frustrate the peace process in the Middle East. We see it through Cuba's support for communist insurrection in Africa and Latin America and, closer to home, Vietnamese troops continue to occupy Kampuchea, in violation of that country's sovereignty, and posing a threat to Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA> Without question, the world situation is troubled and uncertain. New trouble spots can erupt with little or no warning. Our policies must take account of the broad global context and we must recognise that Australia's security is bound up with the strength of the Western alliance. We obviously benefit from the security which this alliance brings to us but at the same time we must shoulder the responsibilities which it entails. All of this is part of interdependence and whether we are talking about threats to world peace and security, or about problems of world poverty, or about the slackness of world trade, the growing interdependence of the world must be seen as fundamental. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say here that the development of multiculturalism in Australia in recent years has helped us enormously as a community in gaining the wider understanding which the successful management of interdependence will increasingly call for. I believe it is a tribute to our responsibility and compassion as a community that Australians have felt involved in tragic events in other countries and have given practical effect to these feelings as shown by the massive public responses to appeals like those for Kampuchea, for Southern Italy after the earthquake and for Poland. The same concern is equally apparent in the willingness of hundreds of young Australians to respond to an appeal to go as teachers to Zimbabwe. Interdependence is real and in managing it we need policies which take advantage of the opportunities it creates, as well as minimising the difficulties and dangers which go with it. The growth of world trade provides a compelling illustration of our growing interdependence, of the advantages it can bring as well as its impact on key areas such as employment. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the rapid expansion of trade in the post-Second World War period that was a mainspring of rapid world economic growth that supported the growth of employment opportunities, and of real living standards for countries at all levels of development. Between 1963 and 1970, while the volume of world output grew at an average annual rate of 5.6 per cent, the volume of world exports grew by 8.6 per cent per annum. But during the 1970s, the growth of world output and exports both significantly slowed and as a result unemployment started to get worse. It is particularly worth noting in this regard that between 1973 and 1978 , exports from developed to developing countries rose at an average rate of over 20 per cent. How much worse would unemployment problems in developed countries now be without that trade?</PARA>
<PARA> We must also recognise a further aspect of interdependence-that other nations are taking an increasing interest in our economic and trade policies. Others rightly expect us to be good neighbours, to play our full part in promoting the continued orderly growth of world trade as responsible members of the international economic community. It is plain that the growth of trade, and the growth of interdependence more generally, increasingly exposes a nation's economic system to influences from outside its own borders. Our own increased interdependence with the rest of the world has been highlighted by the quite violent economic fluctuations which have been a characteristic feature of much of the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA> Each surge in the price of oil has led to a crisis which caused the growth of world trade to slacken and Australia has been affected in a number of ways by both the oil price shocks and by the slackening of trade. There was obviously renewed interest in the exploitation of alternative sources of energy and this has given Australia opportunities. But the slower growth in world markets has affected our exports and any dip in commodity prices due to unfavourable conditions overseas is plainly going to have an impact on Australia. Even before the first oil price increase in 1973, inflation had become more or less endemic in most industrialised nations. Excessive growth of government spending and inappropriate use of deficit financing played a major part in this. The oil price increases compounded these problems, making growing unemployment and growing inflation the order of the day. Even then, most countries did not recognise what was needed in terms of restraint of government spending, in terms of firmness of monetary policy and in terms of wage restraint. Although there are now signs in a number of countries of a determination to pursue more economically realistic policies, natural economic processes have run their course. In Europe and North America, economic growth has virtually come to a standstill in the last two years and unemployment is high, and rising. In France unemployment is 8.5 per cent; in the United States of America it is 8.5 per cent ; and in the United Kingdom it is 11.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> By the second half of 1982, total Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development unemployment is expected to rise to 28.5 million people, compared with just over 21 million in 1980. In these conditions of virtually no growth and rising unemployment, overseas inflation rates are falling. The OECD inflation rate is now under 10 per cent and falling, a reduction of three percentage points below the 1980 rate. The United States inflation rate fell from 12.4 per cent in the 12 months to December 1980 to 8.9 per cent in the 12 months to December 1981, and the British inflation rate fell from 15.1 per cent to 12 per cent in the same period. Perhaps paradoxically, sluggish growth and falling inflation have been accompanied by some of the highest interest rates, both real and nominal, that the world has seen. This situation stems from a number of factors. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation should be seen against the background that interest rates rose less rapidly than inflation during the 1970s. Real interest rates were negative for a substantial part of that decade. Whilst falling inflation rates in some countries is a cause for optimism, financial markets are not convinced that the underlying problem of inflation has been solved. The present situation has been aggravated by an unfortunate mix of policies in some countries. Budget deficits have been allowed to soar and the resulting pressures on the money supply have only been kept in check with exceptionally stringent monetary policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Sluggish growth, low business profits and high interest rates have in turn interacted to produce stagnant investment and continued economic recession. Overseas markets are growing very slowly, if at all. International commodity prices fell 20 per cent in the year to the last September quarter. Australia's farmers are also experiencing generally flat or falling prices along with rising costs and they are also subject to quotas and restrictions of many kinds in international markets. Over the last year or so, and partly reflecting some of the factors I have been referring to, there have also been some significant shifts in the world oil situation. At present world crude oil supplies are more than ample to meet demand but oil prices are still very high. The future levels of energy supply and energy prices are full of uncertainty. Our economy is inevitably constrained, and increasingly constrained by its interdependence with the rest of the world. We cannot but be affected by factors such as the present slackness in world demand, and the high cost of funds, nor can we avoid being affected by the protectionism which strikes at many of our exports, especially our farm products. It is important for us to be aware of the very real dangers that are created by increasing protectionism in other countries during a time of world recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Associated with these influences has been a rapid growth in our current account deficit, squeezed profitability for our export industries and some reappraisal and deferment of resource projects. But investment is still moving ahead strongly. We cannot afford, as a nation, to try to ignore overseas developments or their inevitable influence upon us. What we must do is develop appropriate responses. We must be ready to react and ready to adapt, especially to fundamental changes in the world economy while minimising the undesirable effects of unwelcome influences. In so doing we need policies which lay solid foundations for future growth which will allow us to take full advantage of the renewed growth overseas which must occur at some time and which will carry us through the intervening period of world downturn no matter how short or long it may turn out to be. In particular, we must prove ourselves reliable and competitive suppliers. We cannot afford to price ourselves out of world markets, or earn ourselves the reputation of being incapable of meeting contractual commitments because of poor industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Economic Achievement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> When we look at Australia's present position in the light of our economic achievements over recent years, it is plain that great advances have been made and a strong foundation laid for the future. Although we are a trading nation and despite the continuing slackness of world trade over recent years, we have swum against the tide. And I believe that in the current circumstances, when the facts of interdependence plainly make our position increasingly difficult, our determination to succeed through farsighted and sustainable policies will be seen as right. It is an undoubted fact that as a result of our policies Australia has prospered in recent years while the rest of the world has been stagnating. Private enterprise has prospered and Australia has benefited. To be sure, we have had valuable resources to exploit and profit by in a troubled world economy. But that did not make success certain for the opportunities we had could have been squandered. Possession of resources is only the first condition of prosperity. Another necessary condition is sound government policy and there is no denying that the policies we have followed have created the conditions in which private enterprise has been encouraged to take the lead in exploiting the opportunities on offer. The confidence required for investment to go ahead has been created and, as a result of this turnaround, the living standards of Australia's families have been improved and we now stand ready to grasp the opportunities which will inevitably lie ahead for us.</PARA>
<PARA> A consistent assault on inflation has been essential in creating an environment in which private enterprise could plan and invest with confidence. The sustained restraint which has been imposed on government spending which has been virtually unrivalled throughout the world has been indispensable to success. The interests of all Australians require that this restraint must be maintained along with giving proper emphasis to priority needs and concerns. The Budget deficit has been pulled back from almost 5 per cent of gross domestic product to less than 1 per cent. The Commonwealth has eased the pressure on domestic capital markets by curbing its own borrowing requirements and we look for support in this endeavour from other levels of government. Action has been taken to promote industrial expansion and encourage the growth of productivity and there has been a concern for the competitive position of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> While success with inflation has been vital, successful, non-disruptive management of the exchange rate has also been vital. Secure and improved access for our products has been sought on established markets, in the United States of America, Europe and Japan and Australian exports have been helped to make significant gains in new and expanding markets especially in Asia and the Middle East. Industry has been helped by initiatives to encourage industrial research and development and by an accelerated depreciation allowance. Industry has been given due notice of change where reduced levels of assistance are desirable. And to avoid delay in putting in place the stable policy foundation on which industry will be able to plan in the longer term, the general reference on tariffs was brought forward. </PARA>
<PARA> Manufacturing industry is indispensable to balanced development throughout Australia and, in 1981, manufacturing industry investment increased by 32 per cent in money terms. The effect of all these policy approaches has been to build Australia up. Their goal, which we all share, has been higher living standards for Australia's families. And their benefits are now plain to see-almost 400,000 new jobs created in the three years to the December quarter, almost 90 per cent of them in the private sector; real household disposable incomes up by $2.9 billion after tax in 1980-81; average weekly earnings up by more than $13 per week in real terms in the two years to the September quarter. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been reflected in stronger growth in consumer spending and much stronger private investment in housing; between 1977-78 and 1980-81, investment in dwellings rose by 26.5 per cent in real terms. The gains that have been made also point towards a better future. Business profits rose 17 per cent in real terms in the last three years. With that has come a surge in business investment . The 1980-81 rate of increase was the highest for 30 years. The 1981-82 rate is also likely to be over 10 per cent in real terms. And this, as a share of gross domestic product, will bring business investment back close to the levels that used to be taken for granted in the 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA> Business investment is vital to our children's future. It is the only basis of more jobs and more real spending power in the Australian community and this is why it is so important to give high priority to building up the economy. But it is not only in economic matters that Australians expect their governments to apply effective policies. And when we look across a wider range of concerns, there is cause for pride in what has been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall mention just a few areas in order to provide a broader perspective from which to view some of the challenges which lie ahead. In relation to defence, important steps have been taken in the policy of making sure Australia has an up -to-date and balanced Defence Force, including the acquisition of the FA18 fighter aircraft, of the British 105 millimetre gun, and of the aircraft carrier Invincible; and we need to be aware that strong capabilities contribute not only to national security but also to regional stability and security. </PARA>
<PARA> In international affairs, consistent expression has been given to Australia's concerns and actions such as our efforts in relation to the issues of world poverty, our decision to take part in the Sinai peacekeeping force, and our contributions through the Commonwealth have helped to build Australia's reputation as a forward-looking, outward-looking and reliable nation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of tax avoidance, determined measures have been consistently applied-measures which are really biting into this anti-social industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In the field of legal reform, the Human Rights Commission and now the freedom of information legislation-the first that will come into place nationally in a Westminster system-are effective measures to meet important community concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> In the field of environmental protection, the declaration last year of the new section of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park gave further clear expression to the concern for the preservation of our environment which is so widely felt in the community, especially among young people. </PARA>
<PARA> In education, the issue of giving our young people the skills they need is being tackled and the increasing emphasis on technical and further education is an important element in this. </PARA>
<PARA> Families, especially those with low incomes who received little assistance from the old rebate arrangements, have been enormously assisted by the family allowance scheme which was introduced several years ago and family allowances were substantially increased for larger families from last January. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of social welfare, the automatic indexation of pensions has given income security to a very significant number of people in the community and assistance has been extended to particularly needy groups, such as pensioners facing high rents and sole parents on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obviously important that governments work to advance the wider opportunities and way of life which Australians want as well as working to secure and improve the material living standards of Australia's families. I believe that, as a result of what has been achieved, Australia is now facing the future from a position of comparative strength for there is great underlying strength in our economy and, as I have said already, we are well placed to take advantage of future opportunities provided we work hard to maintain our strong position. </PARA>
<PARA>Challenges and Problems</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> But it is not only opportunities which lie ahead although they will surely come . As we look ahead, as we form our expectations for the future, we plainly need to recognise that there are also problems and challenges. It is our task to identify them, to explain them, to address them realistically and, having done that, to seek the co-operation of the community in coming to terms with them. One thing which is plain at the present time is that a fresher and sharper breeze is blowing through the markets of the world as our industrial competitors , faced with their own situation of no growth and unemployment, restructure their industries, as they improve their productivity and efficiency and as their inflation rates fall. When this is added to the fact that many markets are, if anything, shrinking rather than growing, it is clear that we shall have to fight harder to sell the exports on which our economic development depends. </PARA>
<PARA> This harder competition from overseas comes at a time when there are some problems on our own doorstep. Plainly, inflation remains at the forefront as the principal threat to our economy because, while much has been achieved in pulling inflation back, there are substantial inflationary pressures in our economy at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> Demands for higher wages and shorter working hours have been contributing substantially to these pressures. And in Australia's present situation, there can be little doubt that excessive wage rises and damaging strikes are placing economic progress at serious risk. It is imperative that we recognise as a nation that wage rises which are beyond the capacity of the economy harm everyone and benefit no-one. They cause higher inflation; they threaten our ability to compete on world markets and they create more unemployment. There is no doubt that wage restraint in the next few months is vital to us all for further wage increases at this time on top of the wage and shorter hours settlements of the last six months are beyond the capacity of the economy and time is needed to absorb the increases which have already taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me add that there is plainly a continuing need for an appropriately firm monetary policy. In present circumstances, with a weakened balance of payments and strong inflationary pressures, there could be no thought that the money supply would be allowed to expand to accommodate inflationary wage settlements. It is vastly important to us all that demands and expectations should be matched with economic reality as it now is both internationally and domestically. Whatever else may be arguable, there is no doubt that our overall level of economic growth places clear limits on the sustainable real wage increases which can occur. </PARA>
<PARA> We must never forget that everything, including wages, has to come out of what Australia is producing. Further limits on wage increases are imposed by the claims of needy and underprivileged people to share the benefits of prosperity and investors also have their legitimate claim for profits, which are the basis of the further investment on which future growth depends. As the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has said on many occasions, Australia would benefit greatly from rational debate on the proper balance between these respective claims and we believe that such a debate could have a most valuable impact in helping every section of the community to decide what expectations are reasonable, what claims are legitimate, and which demands ought to be moderated. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the industrial front where the level of strikes and industrial disputation is plainly a matter for the most serious concern. The Government is addressing the situation with some important legislative initiatives as part of an on-going concern with reforming industrial relations. First among these initiatives will be the provision giving private employers a right of stand-down in strike situations to bring about a better balance in the bargaining position of unions and employers and to equalise their responsibility before the law. We believe that this measure will help to bring home to unions the real cost to the community of strike action and that it will help bring a degree of balance to the negotiating process. The second initiative is designed to put renewed vigour into efforts to achieve a restructuring of unions more in line with the needs of a modern Australian economy and to move away from a system rigidly tied to craft -based unions. The third proposal, for voluntary unionism, seeks to protect the basic rights of ordinary average Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is also addressing a number of industrial relations issues in co-operation with the States. Important consensus was reached at the recent Premiers Conference and labour Ministers have already met to consider options to facilitate handling of demarcation disputes and the development of a complementary industrial relations system. In considering the problem of demarcation disputes, the objective must be to protect both employers who are harmed and unions which are attacked. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premiers have also agreed to work with the Commonwealth in efforts to seek agreement with unions and shipping interests along the lines of the recommendations of the Crawford report, and to reduce the level of industrial disputation in the maritime and waterfront industries. Thus in co-operation with the States, and through our own legislative initiatives, we are taking a positive approach which should remove some of the hurdles in the path of industrial peace and bring a greater sense of responsibility into industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the threats to Australia's economic well-being posed by wage demands and industrial disputes, there are a number of other issues which are of great concern to the community which need to be explained and addressed with balance and realism. Home ownership is one issue which is causing very considerable concern in the community and nobody wants Australia's high level of home ownership to be damaged. The issue is complex. There are three interrelated problems. The availability of funds, the high interest rates which currently prevail, and the high cost of houses, especially in some cities. At the present time, the Government has this issue under close review and the Government will in due course announce the policy changes it believes are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxation is a further issue of great concern to the entire community and I want to reaffirm that it is the policy of the Government to make further income tax reductions when it is economically responsible to do so. The present tax levels concern the Government as they concern the community and it is important to remember the major taxation reforms which the Government has implemented including initiatives such as the doubling of the rebate for dependent spouses which has taken place, the deductibility of superannuation contributions up to $ 1,200 a year for self-employed persons and others not covered by employer- sponsored schemes, the abolition of death duties, and the tax rebate for health insurance. The cost to revenue of these initiatives alone is well over a billion dollars a year. It is important, when the community considers taxation levels, to be aware of a number of critical factors; the implications for the Budget of an ageing population, the need for increased defence expenditure, and the need to pull back earlier Budget deficits drastically. Consistent with factors such as these, the Government's commitment to lower taxes and greater spending power is clear and we shall continue to follow those policies which provide the only basis for sustainable tax cuts. </PARA>
<PARA> I have sought to draw the Senate's attention to some of the major factors which need to be taken into account by the Australian people as we look to the future and seek to match our expectations with reality. Many of the issues which we are facing are complex. Many of the problems do not offer easy solutions and the right balance between competing claims is in many cases difficult to find. But of course it is not unusual for a situation to exist in which expectations are greater than can be satisfied, in which different groups within the community are making claims which are inconsistent with each other, in which some claims can be satisfied only at the expense of others, in which some short-term aims conflict with longer term objectives. It is easy for people in pursuing their own objectives to overlook the claims of others and put at risk the source of the future well-being of everyone. </PARA>
<PARA> The objectives of the vast majority of Australians are plain. As a nation, we seek rising standards of living. We seek more dollars in taxpayers' pockets. We seek an increasingly compassionate society. We seek wider opportunities and greater scope for people to develop their talents. We seek greater security for all our people. We seek increasingly efficient public institutions. We seek the conservation of our heritage and our environment and much more as well. All of these objectives are consistent with each other and a balanced policy approach commits us to pursuing them all. But we plainly cannot pursue all or any of them as fast as we would wish. Indeed, in times of economic difficulty and stagnation overseas, we may be committed to pursuing them far more slowly than we would wish because one thing which is vastly important is that in pursuing these objectives, we cannot afford to destroy economic growth itself. Without growth, all our other efforts and objectives will come to nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is significant that Australia's growth rate in the last two years has been almost twice the OECD average and it is significant that the OECD predicts a growth rate of over 3 per cent for Australia in 1982 against an OECD average of just over 1 per cent. There is growth in our economy but we cannot take the future for granted. In a situation of international uncertainty and world economic downturn, where our own growth is held back by the no-growth situation of other economies, we must surely accept as a community the need to avoid putting at risk the present strength of our economy. In dealing with these issues, it is imperative that we weigh up our own claims and expectations against the kind of growing Australia which we want to build for our children, considering both in the light of the real opportunities which are open to Australia in the interdependent world in which we live because only in that way can we reach responsible conclusions on the decisions which lie before us both as individuals and as a nation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to the speech which has been read on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) by Senator Carrick I had difficulty for some time in trying to work out what it was all about, so I looked at the title of the speech and it is called: 'State of the Nation'. In fact, if one examines the contents of the speech it should be entitled 'The State of Malcolm Fraser' because that is what it is about. I want to illustrate briefly, in the time available to me, why I make that allegation. When one looks at the final section of the speech where the rhetoric gets somewhat heavier than in the earlier parts, the key to it all, of course, is what the Prime Minister considers to be the objectives of the vast majority of Australians. That appears on page 10 of his statement. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Primmer points out, by way of interjection, that that is the rhetoric of 1975; the exception is that in 1975 these things were not being sought by a Fraser government; these things were promised by a Fraser government . They were promised in 1975 in the context of a speech which was called 'Turn on the lights'. In 1982 they are put forward in the context of 'lead kindly light amidst the encircling gloom', a vastly different concept from that of 1975 . What this speech is designed to do is to go some way towards filling the vacuum in Liberal Party thought and it is not a very good attempt at doing so. What it does is reiterate all the old tired rhetoric of Malcolm Fraser which has been going on since the policy speeches of 1975. If one looks at the circumstances which have brought about this speech one will see that they are nothing to do with national problems which are facing Australia. They are matters which concern not only the future of the Liberal Party, which is important to those who sit on the Government side, but also and more particularly the fortunes of Malcolm Fraser. This speech has no purpose in presenting new policies to the Australian people. There are no new policies in the speech. Its point is to try to force some form of public consensus from the Prime Minister's rebellious colleagues such as Mr Andrew Peacock and his erstwhile supporters and Mr Howard and Sir Phillip Lynch. The speech tries to get some consensus.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator will have his opportunity to tell us about that in his speech.

<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Sir Phillip Lynch, is a very dexterous politician in many ways. One wonders why he got his knighthood. Was it his capacity to obtain loans at interest rates lower than anybody else in Australia or his particular qualities as a politician which enable him, as it was once said of a famous American politician, 'to sense the wind and make sure that he will not be caught in the draught'? That is what Sir Phillip Lynch did last week when he entered into relatively unchartered waters for this Government in expressing some views about policies which were distinct from those espoused by the Prime Minister. Of course everybody in this country knows that no matter how people such as Senator Peter Rae may attempt to interject this speech tries to persuade the people of Australia, but more importantly the Liberal Party, that this Government stands for something when in fact it stands for nothing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The position of the Prime Minister has become very shaky indeed. If the honourable senator wants to talk about our period in office he ought to read the statement with a great deal more care. It is the first time in the history of this Prime Minister that there is some recognition of the international problems, in terms of the international economy-I refer to the first major oil price rise in 1973-which the Labor Government suffered. This is the first recognition from this Prime Minister in seven years in that office of significant international problems at that time. Why does he give that flicker of recognition now? In the context of this speech he wants to use a global alibi for himself and his failures. I will come to that in a minute. What the speech is about is to try to shore up the Liberal Party and shore up his own position within the Party. It is an insult to this Senate and the people of Australia to call this statement a speech about the state of the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is happening is that people such as Andrew Peacock are being pursued by the Phillip Lynches of this world before they win succession by default in the Liberal Party leadership.

The Government's problem is that it promised to do better and it has done worse. That is a problem which it must face up to in front of the Australian people. We have a situation where the Prime Minister comes friendless into this Parliament with a plaintive cry for national unity which he dresses up in the guise of a speech called 'The State of the Nation'. God help us!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to dwell for any length of time on the sort of cliches with which this speech is cluttered, cliches such as 'opportunities will pass us by' or ' you only get back as much as you put in'. This is the rhetoric of a teenage layabout. The whole speech is larded with such cliches, and I do not want to dwell on those matters. What it is all about is revealed in the first sentence, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Today I would like the House to step back from the cut and thrust of everyday political life to consider the direction in which we wish to move as a nation-</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the speech is all about. The Prime Minister is saying: 'For God's sake let us get out of the cut and thrust of politics because I, Malcolm Fraser, am getting the cuts but am not getting too many thrusts. Therefore let us step back and look at the direction in which we are going as a nation'. I thought that the Prime Minister knew all about that because he told us about it in 1975, 1977 and 1980; he told us about the direction in which he was going to lead us. In 1982 he cannot say: 'Let us step back and look at where we are going'. The last person in Australia who can say that is the person who holds himself up as the leader of this society. In 1982 Malcolm Fraser says: 'For seven years I have enjoyed a Prime Ministerial salary because I told you I knew where we were going and where I would take you, but now I want to step back and let us have a look at where we are going'. Therefore the speech is rightly described as 'a state of Malcolm Fraser' rather than 'the state of the nation'. The essence of the speech is contained in the early paragraphs. What the speech is about is to try to establish a global alibi for failures of this Government. Let us look at what the Prime Minister said in 1975 about that sort of thing. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>When political leaders say the present situation cannot be helped, it is part of the world situation, they are expressing the futility of their own leadership when if they were men of real stature they would be saying: 'We can overcome'. Those who suggest that the world is in a cyclical situation, that it will all occur regardless, are equally defeatist and equally wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not a 'we shall overcome' speech. This is a speech about the futility of one man's leadership and it is documented throughout the speech. The Prime Minister says, on the contrary, that our history bears witness that we are affected by what happens in other parts of the world-I would hope so-and that we must take account of what he calls the broad global context. That is an alibi which he seeks for himself but which, according to his universally applied double standards, he was not prepared to grant to anybody else. That is what it is about in the terms of the promises of 1975 and the performances of seven years after. The speech is cluttered with figures which purport to show how well the economy has been managed in the last six years. His policies having failed, he is now trying desperately to talk up the economy. What is the truth of the matter? We now have an unemployment rate of 6.4 per cent of the work force, the highest level for a year. Interest rates are at record levels. Home construction is down by 9 per cent. The latest balance of payments accounts show a deficit for the first seven months of the current financial year of $2 billion. The share market is at its lowest level for more than two years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not before the last election. Senator Rae argues by way of interjection that we should operate in this society by politics of the lowest common denominator-the 'my dad is a policeman' sort of argument. What he says by his interjection is: 'We might be a dreadful Government but, my God, the Whitlam Government was worse seven years ago'. What has that to do with anybody living in this country in 1982? His party's promise was that it would do better. That is Senator Sir John Carrick's sort of lowest common denominator argument about politics. Senator Sir John Carrick, who is fixated in the period 1972 to 1975, is a classic example of Freud's definition of neuroticism-he has an unhealthy obsession with the past. It detracts from his ability to be a successful Minister in 1982. That is the sort of argument which Senator Rae is putting by interjection. Before he interrupted me I was talking about the share market. I was going on to talk about the collection of defects in this Government's performance. The whole strategy of the Government this year assumed a high level of foreign investment in Australia. That has not occurred at the level that the Government planned for. We in Australia are now in an inflating economy in a deflating world. That is another achievement about which, in terms of the promises of this Government, I scarcely need to put salt in the wound. I think even somebody as insensitive as Senator Rae will understand the point I am trying to make. I am speaking medically, not in terms of his natural disposition . The cost of living in Australia went up 4.2 per cent in the December quarter. Tax avoidance in Australia is reaching record levels. It has become a $7 billion a year industry. Nothing has been done, in spite of the Prime Minister's words in this speech, to check tax avoidance in a significant way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The alibi of members of the Government on the tax avoidance issue is to say: ' But the Labor Government didn't do much about it'. The Labor Government never controlled the Senate. The Labor Government had two elections in three years. When the Labor Government went out of office the level of tax avoidance, as recorded in the reports of the Commissioner of Taxation, was about 900 cases a year. In the same report this year the number is 22,700. Tax avoidance has been the only growth industry under the Fraser Government. We know why it has been a growth industry and nothing has been done about it. It has nothing to do with all the good intentions which I am sure people on the Government side have. Tax avoidance is a big industry because Malcolm does not want to upset his friends who are involved in it. It is an industry which goes to the heart of an incapacity of any government to do anything about politics which is honourable in a country such as this. We cannot have an industrial relations policy, a prices and incomes policy or any policies which are predicted on the notion of a fair society while tax avoidance is as rife as it is now under this Government. The interim report of Mr Costigan, the Royal Commissioner inquiring into the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, sets out clearly how widespread this industry is. The next test for the Government will be whether that Royal Commission is given powers to subpoena documents from the Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the level of tax avoidance, the Government has tried to impose new sales taxes whose effect will bear more on wage earners than the very rich. Already taxes have risen by $3,000m this year. This is the low tax party! This is the Government of the Prime Minister who says in the final stages of his speech that he knows what all Australians want. One of the things they want, he says, is to pay less tax. He could have fooled them. I think he has done so in the past. I do not think he will fool them much longer. In the six years of office of the Fraser Government tax collections from ordinary people, income earners, have risen by 144 per cent. One could go on discussing the taxation issue to which even this Government seems to be becoming slightly sensitive. The Prime Minister, in the context of his speech, mentioned a number of other issues . He mentioned housing. I am surprised that he saw fit to mention housing. This is a government without a policy on housing. He also mentioned industrial relations. This is a government without a wages policy. When the Government plucks the eyes out of the report on Australia of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development one of the things to which it is blind and which it does not pluck out is the one which indicates that Australia is a country without any wages policy. I think most economists would agree that that goes to the crux of the issue of economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of housing, let me record for the benefit of Government senators some of the facts. Many home owners in Australia are being forced to sell their homes because they cannot afford to make repayments at current interest rates. That is a very sad fact. It is sadder in terms of the integrity of government that that has happened under a government whose Deputy Prime Minister promised at the election before last to eat his hat if interest rates did not go down by 2 per cent. They have gone nowhere but up since then. The number of private houses under construction has fallen by 12 per cent in a year. The number of public houses under construction in December alone was 11 per cent lower than the year before. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a good interjection. I concede Senator Rae's concern about this matter. If the number of public houses in Australia were down by 11 per cent, Senator Rae would be worried stiff because he is a big user of public houses. What I meant by public houses was welfare housing, as it is sometimes called, or houses provided by the public purse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next issue to which the Prime Minister refers somewhat ominously is a fairly traditional one; that is, the pending legislation on trade unions. I think this is about the eleventh piece of industrial legislation which is designed to solve industrial relations problems in Australia since the Fraser Government came to office. Of course, this legislation is designed to cause discontent and disruption so the Prime Minister can again raise the argument-it raised in 1977 and 1980-of who is running the country. This is a traditional and conservative stunt. It is a totally cynical application of public policy for political purposes. That is all that the industrial relations policies of this Government amount to. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate needs no reminding that one of the important provisions of this legislation will be to provide for restructuring of trade unions which will not be on an honest basis but be carried out in a way to attempt to cause industrial disruption. I remind the Senate of the legislation on union amalgamation which we debated late last year but which was defeated by the Government, it being a private members Bill. I think the industrial relations posturing is important in the context of scooping the barrel of Liberal Party rhetoric when a degree of desperation arises. Of course, in the negative sense it goes along with all the talk of standards of living, more dollars in taxpayers' pockets, a compassionate society conserving the environment and all that stuff. </PARA>
<PARA> The standard of living of the average Australian is down and is falling. Taxpayers are paying more tax; fewer real dollars are going into taxpayers' pockets. No real dollars are coming out of the tax avoiders pockets. The level of compassion of this Government is shown in its harassment of the sick, the poor and the disadvantaged. But while all the fundamental Government policies which might be directed to a consideration of the questions which the Prime Minister poses as to where this country is going and where it is being led are allowed to languish, the security of this country will be guaranteed by squandering the best part of $1,000m on a single naval ship-referred to with some apparent pride in the Prime Minister's speech. Clearly that ship will be vulnerable and unable to pay its way in defence terms. But, of course, that is not the issue. </PARA>

Senator Rae said that it has quite a lot to do with the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. It probably has. Senator Rae is something of a symbolist, if I can use that word. I do not mean in the musical sense but as someone who has an addiction to symbols. The Invincible is a symbol, as is CHOGM. They are both symbols of the Australian antipodean version of what used to be called Sukarnoism in days gone by when that gentleman was President of Indonesia. That is to say, one concentrates the rhetoric on overseas matters, on symbols, on anything rather than the real issues which confront the people over which the so-called 'leader' presides. The Prime Minister's speech was about abdication of leadership. It is a speech which expresses in its own words total concern, anguish and disillusionment about where this country is going. It is a speech which I find incredible to think any so-called leader in a democratic society could have made after seven years of the rhetoric and performance of this man. In a sense I suppose that it is probably a swan song. When old people sense they are going, they tend to write something down for posterity. The Prime Minister is not so old but I sense that he is going and he wants to say something for posterity. He is saying, 'Well, for God's sake it wasn't so bad after all, was it? We have been in government for seven years and we are still concerned about the sorts of issues which we promised to provide solutions to in 1975'. Full marks for consistency of concern ; no marks for leadership, good government, integrity, honesty or any of the qualities which might in leadership go to make this country great.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening we have heard a typically brilliant, amusing and telling speech by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button). Unfortunately, it was reasonably predictable. I am afraid it was a point scoring performance. Without a doubt, a lot of points were scored but that does not really get us very far. I draw the Senate's attention to what the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) had to say in the opening words of his speech and I will go no further. He asked this Parliament to step back from the cut and thrust of every day political life to consider the direction in which we wished to move as a nation in the next five years. I believe that this Parliament ought to give careful and urgent consideration to that offer. This country is in a critical situation. It does not advance the cause of the people of this country one bit to try to apportion blame. What we have to try to do is to get out of this critical situation. We will not get out of it unless we embark on some long term thinking and planning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister in his statement clearly outlines a desire to do this. I believe we should take him at his word. He did not outline a mechanism as to how this can be achieved. He suggests the Parliament should be the mechanism which, quite obviously, is an impossibility. But the issue is far too important for the Parliament not to consider how some long term indicative planning could be achieved. The Australian Democrats believe that we should engage the best brains in this country to try to achieve our goal. We call it indicative planning. We are not talking about rigid planning such as is carried on in the Eastern European countries. We are talking of an indicative plan that sets out the options that are available to Australia in 1982. It can be done. We can quantify the options that are available to Australia. It is done in countries such as Japan, France and Sweden. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8R7">Senator SIDDONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is done in Austria. It can only be done if we set up a planning mechanism to achieve it. The Prime Minister has made the suggestion; we propose that that suggestion be taken up to see whether we cannot get a planning mechanism. There is no other way we will solve the very real problems that face this country whether we are governed by a Labor Party or a Liberal Party. We must set goals; we must set medium term goals; goals for the next five years. We cannot have everything of everything; we have to make choices and we have to quantify those choices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By and large, private enterprise has come to realise that some measure of economic planning is not against its interests. In fact, I believe it realises very clearly today-more clearly than the Government has hitherto realised-that the preservation of private enterprise can be achieved only if it is operating within a framework of national economic planning which takes note of the community's needs. How is this indicative planning done in countries such as Japan? It is done on a co-operative basis. There is a planning authority. The choices available to the country at any one time are discussed with a representative cross-section of the community. The choices are discussed with business leaders, trade unions, consumers and political parties of all persuasions. It is not a point scoring discussion. It is a discussion that looks at the options that are available and what the country can afford and then makes choices-more of this and less of something else. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not have to go further than the defence situation to realise how little long term planning occurs in this country. I wonder whether the Navy has ever been asked to face up to the problem of how much money it has to spend over a five year term or, if it spends X amount of dollars on an aircraft carrier, what will happen to the rest of its requirements. The same applies to the Army and to the Air Force. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, what about business? The one thing that business must have is some firm framework on which to build and to do its own planning. If the rules are being changed every year business cannot operate. If we had in this country a plan that had been thoroughly discussed and could be taken up by business with confidence knowing it was realistic, within the realms of possibility, and that it could expect Government co-operation if it moved in a certain direction, we would achieve great things. </PARA>
<PARA> This planning has to take advantage of computer techniques that have been evolved over recent years and which can give us very detailed information of the options that are available. This planning technique does not require a large bureaucracy; it requires high powered computers. It does not require a lot of people; it requires continual consultation with the interest groups in the community. We cannot sit down and set a plan and say: 'Here it is' and that is set for the next five years. It has to be continually discussed-at least every six months-and modified in the light of changing world circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> But we have no planning at all. We have just seen, with a Budget that was brought down only a few months ago, that we cannot even plan successfully for the next 12 months. Why can we not plan? The answer is that we are attempting to put before this country options in isolation from community interests. There is no real consultation with business or with trade unions. If that could be achieved, if we could get a new approach, if we could get intermediate term planning, we would have some chance of solving the problems that lie ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, I draw attention to the very real possibility that, apart from national medium term planning, I am sure that we could, if we tried, take some note of world trends in the future. We are living at a critical time in human history-of that there is no doubt. The pressures of an exponentially growing world population on depleting resources are creating new problems for the old world and for the new. We inevitably have to move towards a sustainable economy that is in equilibrium with world resources, with the environment and with other life systems. </PARA>
<PARA> Various organisations have attempted to establish a world model. I have seen some of them. The Club of Rome was probably the leader in this field. All these world models show one fact very clearly: Our society will not move to a sustainable condition easily. To develop renewable energy sources, as every computer model clearly shows, will require enormous expenditure in human effort, manpower and capital. When we talk about the advances in technology and the dangers of there being insufficient work for the people of the world, we have only to turn our attention to the problems of the future in trying to arrive at a sustainable economy to realise that what is required is not a shorter working week or concern about unemployment but turning attention to the real problems of the future and to get our priorities right. Getting our priorities right can be achieved only through a planning process on a national basis and, insofar as it can reasonably be accurately predicted, on an international basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has made an offer. The Australian Democrats welcome the suggestion that this country step back for a moment from the cut and thrust of politics to consider where it is heading in the medium term. I call upon the Opposition to join the Australian Democrats in putting pressure on the Prime Minister to be as good as his word. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a brief statement on the same subject. I will not be long as I know other important business has to come on tonight. Some matters of fact should be cleared up. This speech which was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and pompously entitled 'State of the Nation' is an attempt by Malcolm Fraser to recover the credibility he lost with his own back bench when, three weeks ago, he sent in the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to reply to the censure motion on the Government. Now, three weeks later , he has mustered whatever courage he has and his wordsmiths have put his lines together. The result is a schizoid document, the first half of which blames external influences and presents a series of excuses for failures which can no longer be successfully denied, and the second half of which is a re-run of the boasts, false assertions, misrepresentation and wishful thoughts of the last six years. They might well have been taken from the writings of the Stumpy Gully Kid , vintage 1966 and 1977.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Here are some of the specific excuses:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Australia needs a policy approach which is marked by balance, vision and realism. The world is also full of unrealistic demands . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It takes a good deal of audacity for a man with Malcolm Fraser's record to condemn or to castigate unrealistic demands. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . expectations should be closely adjusted to reality. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In coming to grips with Australia's present position in an overall perspective, it is appropriate to start with the international dimension. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot but be affected by factors such as the present slackness in world demand, and the high cost of funds, nor can we avoid being affected by the protectionism which strikes at many of our exports, especially our farm products . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the first half of the speech. External influences are responsible for failures which can no longer be successfully denied. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrast that with the bold words of 1975 when Malcolm Fraser was telling the nation that he had the answer to all these problems. He said at the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science conference:</PARA>
<PARA> When political leaders say the present situation cannot be helped, it is part of a world situation, they are expressing the futility of their own leadership when if they were men of real stature, they would be saying 'We can overcome'.</PARA>
<PARA>This speech is an apologia which fails. The first part contradicts the Prime Minister. The second part is riddled with crucial errors of fact. For example:</PARA>
<PARA> When we look at Australia's present position in the light of our economic achievements over recent years, it is plain that great advances have been made and a strong foundation laid for the future. </PARA>
<PARA>The foundation is unemployment at almost record levels, inflation back in double figures, growth down, record interest rates, record levels of taxation and a balance of payments crisis with all those indicators moving in the wrong direction. Some foundation for the future! He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is an undoubted fact that as a result of our policies Australia has prospered in recent years while the rest of the world has been stagnating. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not true. In fact if we look at the years 1977-80-these figures are taken from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Economic Outlook No. 30 published in December 1981-we will see that the average unemployment rate for Australia has been 6 per cent. The average for the entire OECD over those four calendar years was 5.3 per cent. Individual countries, notably Austria, have average rates very much lower again. In Austria's case it is 1.6 per cent. In 1977-80 Australian real economic growth in gross domestic product was 2.3 per cent and the OECD average was 3.1 per cent. Austria again recorded an average growth rate of 3.2 per cent and Japan recorded 5.1 per cent. In relation to consumer price index increases, popularly equated with inflation, the Australian average for 1977-80 was 9.9 per cent, the same as the OECD average. Austria, to use the same example, had an average inflation rate throughout that period of 4.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is simply not true, however often it may be asserted by the Prime Minister and his toadies that Australia's performance relative to the average of the OECD , let alone to the leading members of the OECD such as the Netherlands, Austria, Japan and West Germany, has been good in the period this Government has been in office. It is correct that in the calendar year 1980 and the latter part of 1979 economic growth in Australia was somewhat higher than it was in other OECD countries. That is a situation which is changing very rapidly and the average Australian inflation rate which used to be the crucial determinant of economic performance by this Government, has now passed OECD levels and is now moving in the wrong direction. The Prime Minister has asserted:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the living standards of Australia's families have been improved and we now stand ready to grasp the opportunities which will inevitably lie ahead for us. </PARA>
<PARA>It is correct that for the financial year 1980-81 over 1979-80 there was, as the Prime Minister asserted, an increase in disposable household income in real terms of almost $3 billion, but there are two important things which the Prime Minister does not bother to tell us. The first is that in that same period there has been a substantial increase in the number of households and that a great deal of that gain-about half of it-reflects an increase in the number of households rather than an increase in actual average household income. The second point is that the figures he uses are not the most recent figures which are available. In fact the most recent figures available are for the September quarter of 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> In that quarter average income per household, in September 1981 value dollars, was $4,994. In the September quarter 1980, in the same value dollars, it was $5, 023. The difference is not vast but the plain fact is that, contrary to the belief which the Prime Minister would implant, on the most recent available figures household income is lower than it was a year before. Those figures, I might add, make no allowance for other factors which have adversely affected household income such as the re-imposition of health insurance payments and the very much higher interest payments. It is true that in the last calendar year and for a few months before that wages had risen at a faster rate than inflation , but household income, on the most recent figures available, has actually fallen compared with what it was 12 months before. The reason for that is what the Prime Minister used to denounce as the great tax rip-off, the secret tax of inflation. Figures published in the Sydney Morning Herald of 13 October last year, for example, show the tax bite on single income families. A family on a single income with a dependant spouse and two dependent children in fact paid in real terms $18 a week more in income tax in December 1981 than it would have paid in December 1975. Certainly, family allowances have increased since then. They account for about half that decline in after tax real income. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter that I want to comment on is this: Probably the greatest misrepresentation of fact in this document is the assertion by the Prime Minister in regard to tax avoidance. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In the area of tax avoidance, determined measures have been consistently applied-measures which are really biting into this anti-social industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The most recent report of the Commissioner of Taxation shows that some $920m tax is outstanding in disputed returns, a figure which has quadrupled in the last 12 months. Other authorities, notably Professor Mathews, put the actual current cost of tax avoidance to the revenue at $7,000m per annum. Far from stopping tax avoidance, as the Prime Minister asserts, the Government has legislated on numerous occasions to facilitate tax avoidance. Much of the effect of this was drawn out in a series of 64 questions put on notice last year by my colleague Ralph Willis, the answers to which came back last month. Of the 65 tax concessions he specified only one-third could be costed, but the cost to revenue of that one-third that could be costed was $1,140m. Mostly those tax concessions have been inserted by this Government. Most of those which have been inserted by this Government are agricultural tax concessions of which at least half of the members of the Cabinet are direct beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA> I shall give a few examples. The answers to Ralph Willis's questions show that the cost of the current arrangements to primary producers' tax averaging is $ 215m a year. This is the arrangement which the Treasury secretary publicly described as an arrangement under which heads farmers win, tails all other taxpayers lose. The cost of investment allowances for agriculture was $75m and $ 20m for accelerated depreciation allowances when all the available empirical evidence shows that farmers already have a propensity to over-invest in plant and equipment, without being encouraged by stupid taxation laws to do so. An amount of $95m of revenue was forgone to facilitate the misallocation of resources. Most scandalous of all in principle if not in quantity were the income equalisation deposit arrangements under which-again half the Cabinet members are in a position to benefit directly from this-a taxpayer may lend $10, 000 for one year, borrow $15,000 for two years and pick up a bonus of $4,500, half of which is tax free. I repeat: A taxpayer may lend $10,000 for one year, borrow $15,000 for two years and pick up a $4,500 cash bonus, half of which is tax free. That rort has been written into the taxation legislation by this Government in the last couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the aggregate effect on revenue, according to the answers to Mr Willis's questions, we will see that the cost of that rort to revenue in the most recent year was $29m. The net gain in the trust account was $28.3m. It is costing the revenue more than is accruing in the trust account. All this is from a government which expects restraint on the part of wage earners when it indulges in such predatory rip-offs of the rest of its citizens through the taxation system. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I thank the other Committee members and the Committee staff for their co- operation and diligence in a very difficult task. The Committee agreed at least on the basic headings that are used in the report, those headings being 'Defence ', 'Commercial' and 'Social'. We also agreed basically on part A of the report. But as time unfolds other Committee members will tell their own story about how they disagree. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's task was to investigate the future of the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, given the decision contained in the Review of Commonwealth Functions to sell the factory as a going concern. The decision of the Senate to form a select committee to investigate this matter arose from the concern of the people of Bendigo and the factory employees at the decision to sell. Initially, the essence of the Senate commitment was the expedition of the report but there are sometimes reasons, as most honourable senators know, for taking very special care and deliberation. In any case, in this particular inquiry interested Bendigo people themselves counselled the same care and deliberation that we were compelled to exercise in considering all of the evidence. I think the recommendations of the Committee should come first. The recommendations are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I. The effort to sell the factory as a 'going concern'-suspended for this inquiry-be now pursued with maximum vigor, and a particular effort be made to show the work force the benefits of sale. </PARA>
<PARA> II. As an incentive to prospective purchasers, the factory should retain certain defence contracts presently unique to its operation. Favourable consideration should be given to the inclusion of suitable parts of new projects such as the 105 mm UK light gun and ammunition and other work. </PARA>
<PARA> III. There be no replacement of personnel or equipment from the date of this report, unless it facilitates the sale of OFB as a 'going concern'. </PARA>
<PARA> IV. If these efforts fail, then the possibility of sale of various sections of OFB as 'going concerns' be investigated. </PARA>
<PARA> V. If all the preceding moves fail, then OFB be wound down with an official closure date to be fixed by the Government to allow time to conclude existing commitments. </PARA>
<PARA> VI. In the event of a wind-down to closure:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) existing apprentices have priority of placement in Federal Government services, locally or elsewhere;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) other employees be given maximum help to relocate at Maribyrnong or elsewhere, or to retire;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) all necessary machinery for continuity of defence projects to be transferred to OFM or elsewhere; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the balance of assets of OFB be sold, either with the factory or separately. </PARA>
<PARA>I say that in the circumstances of the Committee's decision the people of Bendigo need not fear a decision to sell the factory. The OFB was set up as a defence factory primarily to manufacture naval ordnance. It is a matter of record, however, that since the war years defence orders of this nature have decreased drastically, so much so that the factory has had to undertake commercial work in order to provide a work load. The evidence from the Department of Defence did not indicate an urgent demand for the retention of the factory as it is. Significantly, the Department was unable to give any assurances about increasing defence work load into the factory. Without these assurances, the Committee found it hard to impossible to justify the existence of a factory which is operating at less than half capacity. I might add that half of that half capacity is taken up with commercial work at a cost to the taxpayer of millions each year. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the commercial aspect of OFB's operations, the Committee found that this was a very expensive way to maintain production levels at the factory. The commercial work undertaken has not proven profitable to OFB. It is true that it has enabled skills to be maintained. However, the Committee is not convinced that the skills are so unique and their maintenance so necessary to Australia's future defence industrial capacity. What is a fact is that commercial work, priced it would seem, at a break-even return to OFB, has done nothing to contribute to the cost of maintaining the factory. This is what the taxpayer has had to bear. If a decision on the factory's future could have been made solely on the basis of defence needs and commercial considerations, it is unlikely that the factory would still be operating in its present form. In fact, Senator Button in his dissenting report makes the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the decision to sell the factory could probably have been made by a government at any time in the last 20 years-</PARA>
<PARA>That this is so is undoubted, yet Senator Button now argues that it should be retained. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WJ7">Senator MARTYR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button will get his turn in a minute. He suggests that the factory should be given a greater defence work load and more profitable commercial work. This can be done only at the taxpayers' expense. The evidence presented to the Committee has shown that the factory has actively sought a greater defence load since the war years. I think we all commend the factory staff and management for their efforts in this regard, but conditions of peace, the demands for a different kind of weaponry, the high cost of manufacturing in Australia compared with readily available overseas purchase and the fact that our production runs are too small make it inevitable that such requests from OFB could not be gratified. It is true that the factory could be filled with work, but at what cost and what gain?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Siddons in his dissenting report has cited many examples of equipment that could be made at OFB. This equipment could also be made at the Ordnance Factory, Maribyrnong. This factory also has an excess capacity. By concentrating work at OFM, skills will still be maintained and a defence industrial base will still exist capable of expansion in time of difficulty, or, if necessary war. Further, if OFB is sold as a going concern and receives some defence orders, this will also help to maintain the defence industrial base. Except for the 4.5 inch gun and mountings which are being phased out, OFB and OFM are basically duplicating facilities both of which are underutilised. Clearly, this is not the way to achieve full value for the taxpayers' defence dollar. In the past five years the cost to the taxpayer of maintaining OFB has been $24m. For reasons advanced previously, the facts are that work load has not arrived at OFB and the factory has remained at less than half capacity, requiring heavy annual subsidy to survive. The Committee felt that this situation could not continue. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the employees at the factory and the people of Bendigo are concerned at the possible social and economic effects of the announced sale. The Committee received and considered a great deal of evidence on this aspect. However, it is clear that the social and economic effect of not selling the factory would be far greater given the view of the Department of Industry and Commerce, as expressed in its submission to the Committee, that if the factory were not sold as a going concern it would be wound down to closure within five years. It is for this reason, as well as the other considerations I mentioned earlier, that the Committee's recommendation was for a sale as a going concern. This, combined with the recommendations regarding work load to the factory, would result in less effect on the Bendigo region than the alternative of complete and immediate closure. </PARA>
<PARA> Summarising the evidence, the majority report under the heading 'Defence' states:</PARA>
<PARA> Neither the capacity nor capability of Australia's defence would be affected by the sale of OFB as a 'going concern' and indeed would be only marginally affected by closure. There is clearly excess capacity to defence requirements and has been for the last twenty years. </PARA>
<PARA> Better value for the defence dollar could be obtained if the 'maintenance of production capability' subsidy and other high local production costs did not have to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading 'Commercial' it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> OFB is now mainly a commercial factory with a perceived legal problem as a consequence. A mixture of defence and commercial output would be a viable commercial enterprise, and this was the best possible compromise for OFB's future. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading 'Social' it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The concern of employees as to the social consequences of a sale are not ignored. The consequences of a sale as a 'going concern' need not be as pessimistic as that outlined in many submissions to the Committee. This conclusion is based on private enterprise bringing a mix of commercial and defence work to OFB. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe I should mention some other matters. Several reports over the years of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence have made what I would say are dutiful statements about greater defence procurement being placed with the Australian munitions industry. Such reports at least were sensible enough to add 'unless there are clear and overwhelming national interest reasons for overseas purchase'. I am glad this was done because nowhere in the reports of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence is the Bendigo Ordnance Factory singled out for specific mention as absolutely fundamental to Australia's defence. The majority report of the Committee feels that there are several compelling reasons at the moment for the purchase of our defence equipment-not all of it, but what we are purchasing-overseas. I mention this because it will be suggested that we ignored all the work of previous committees. Indeed, I was a participant in some of those committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I want to mention is the proposed amendment of Senator Siddons as circulated in this chamber several hours ago. It seems to me that this amendment hardly relates to the task we were given to report on. It seems to me, with due respect to Senator Siddons, that it is political grandstanding in the context of an election that is taking place in a particular State. I know honourable senators have the amendment in front of them. In the first part of the amendment Senator Siddons has charged the Government with failing to provide modern guns and missiles for the ships of the Royal Australian Navy. It seems to me that, in the first place, this is not true. Secondly, these are matters for a general defence debate. In terms of the scope of the report, I do not think that we were really meant to cover such matters. With due respect to the present capacities of the OFB, I do not think that it is capable of handling the missile part of Senator Siddons' amendment. The other part of the amendment I would draw attention to is Senator Siddons' charge that the Government has shown lack of planning in the aerospace, munitions and shipbuilding industries. He may well have added in that little catalogue the history of the world and chided us for that, too. </PARA>

<PARA> The Federal Government decision of 30 April 1981 to offer the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, for sale as a 'going concern' was completely correct in all the defence circumstances pertaining then and now. </PARA>

<PARA> Commercial ideas and philosophies introduced into what has been up to date a closed government shop have great potential to enhance Bendigo's future and our Australian defence capabilities, with better value for the defence dollar.</PARA>
<PARA> Bendigo would, of course, be far better off if the Factory could be sold as a commercial venture than if it had to be closed immediately or wound down and closed and this has been a major consideration in the Committee's decision. The apparent unwillingness of the professional and wages staff to work for private enterprise, obvious at the hearing--</PARA>

<PARA>Under the heading 'Social' it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The considerable amount of social impact evidence was mainly based on the option of failure to sell, leading to closure and neglected entirely the benefits of sale as a 'going concern'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, together with Senator Martyr, was a member of the Senate Select Committee on the Government Clothing and Ordnance Factories. The decision to sell the Bendigo Ordnance Factory was made in the context of the report of the so-called razor gang or Review of Commonwealth Functions committee of April 1981. As Senator Martyr pointed out to me during the Committee's deliberations, at the time the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee was discussed in this chamber I had some uncharitable things to say about it. Indeed, some of those things which may have seemed uncharitable at the time seemed to have a certain retrospective validity. For example, the sale of the Australian Wool Testing Authority which resulted from a decision of the razor gang was described the other day as abolishing one quango and creating another. It is in that context that my general view about the Bendigo Ordnance Factory was, in a sense, developed right from the beginning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One could say that the Bendigo Ordnance Factory is a quite crucial industry in the city of Bendigo. Senator Siddons, who expressed in a minority report his concerns about defence issues particularly, has drawn attention to that report to the defence implications of the closure of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. My concern in a quite separate dissenting report was to try to draw attention to some other issues which I want to mention to the Senate in the context of the discussion of this report. First of all, in my view the likely consequences of the sale to private enterprise of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory are equivalent to closure. In announcing the sale to private enterprise in April 1981 the Government tried to adopt a device which would avoid the political odium of closing the factory directly. Indeed, if one goes back to October 1980-this is one of the sad parts of the history of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory-one finds in the context of an election in that month the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) talking about an $8m expansion program for the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. Pre-election the Government, through probably its self-appointed spokesman in this area, talked about expansion; post-election-four months later- the Government was talking about a sale which inevitably, in the view of most members of the committee, meant closure. Devicies were adopted to avoid the political odium of closure. </PARA>
<PARA> One can discuss the effect of the sale. Members of the Committee understood that no sale would occur at this point. Probably no genuine buyers are available to the Government. In November last year Sir Phillip Lynch, seeking to distance himself as it were from the decision to sell-he was chairman of the ad hoc committee which decided on this course-and the question of closure of the factory, wrote to the people in Bendigo that if the factory were not sold to private enterprise it would be as a result of the Senate Committee considering the matter. As a consequence of that, the sale would perhaps not take place and it would be necessary for the Government to close the factory. So much for the political devices which have been involved. Indeed, those political devices have created the environment for consideration of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I just make a few points about this exercise which seem to me to be important. The consideration of the sale or closure of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory is not a matter about which, apart from things I have said, I wish to make partisan political capital. I make the point that this action represents a crisis of government. It would not matter which party was in government, the same problems would be there and the same problems would have to be faced up to. It is in a sense a crisis of government because the situation with regard to the Ordnance Factory represents a chronic lack of leadership and mismanagement at the government level and the departmental level here in Canberra rather than at the level of the factory itself. I think all honourable senators were impressed by the equipment and the level of skill in the factory among both the wage labour at the factory and the engineers who perform the design and supervisory functions. There is a very strong semblance of a sort of cohesive highly skilled and quite dedicated and efficient labour unit-some 650 employees. I think we in Australia have to think very hard about the issue of getting rid of a facility such as the Bendigo Ordnance Factory with such apparent glibness as has emerged in the Government decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress one or two points. Firstly, we must consider that the social effects on the economy of a city like Bendigo, if this factory is closed, will be significant. There are 650 people employed in the factory. A lot of evidence was given to the Committee-Senator Martyr referred to it-about the effect of closure in terms of unemployment-in terms of the needs of families which are involved in unemployment to relocate, if that were possible, if another job were available and so on. I do not want to dwell on the social aspects. I just stress the fact that these maters are, in my view, quite crucial to a proper consideration of what should be done about the Ordnance Factory. </PARA>
<PARA> They are important also in terms of the so-called lip service given by governments to decentralisation policy. Bendigo is a regional city. A lot of its work force is dependent on the factory because Bendigo is an isolated city in terms of the labour market generally. It is, I think, very important to emphasise, for example, that there is a very good record of industrial relations at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. It has a regional flavour about it which one does not get in a large metropolis like Sydney or Melbourne. So aspects of regional policy and attitudes towards decentralisation are important as social issues in relation to the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. The social effects, of course, would be important wherever they were but they are very important in the context of a country town. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I make is that I do not think that Australia should glibly be prepared to lose a facility of relatively high technology, engineering and skill where the skills relate not only to the machines and the equipment which is there but also to the capacity to work them. The relationship between employees and machines in terms of a creative capacity is not often found in establishments of this kind in Australia. So, when the Government talks about shifting the factory's capacity to Maribyrnong or somewhere like that, it is not , in my view, facing up to the issues of the capacity involved in terms of the work force and equipment which are available and understood by workers in that factory. There would be a result not only of social dislocation but also of dislocation of a skilled labour force. I think that is an important thing which we consider. It is being considered -in spite of what Senator Martyr says-in general terms by report after report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the extraordinary things is that there is no response by the Government to the sorts of attitudes expressed in the report about the need to retain defence technology in Australia and to retain technology generally. It is probably only this sort of government which could consider disposing of that technology without the opportunity being taken to find an alternative course in relation to that facility. A number of reasons are given in the majority report, and indeed by the Government whose views the majority report reflects in a sense , as to why the factory should be sold. First of all, it is pointed out that the factory has a relatively small work load. Its work load is in two areas: Firstly , defence work and, secondly, so-called commercial work. </PARA>
<PARA> I just deal briefly with the question of defence work. The Committee in the evidence before it was, in my view, given a very sad and shoddy story of the defence procurement process in Australia. The Committee was presented with diagrams which explained the defence procurement process. The diagrams looked like the inside of a transistor with steps going from one level to another. One finds that a small percentage of time in the manufacture of a particular weapon is devoted to the actual manufacture as distinct from very lengthy departmental process in relation to procurement. That is not just my comment; similar comments have been made by the Australia Defence Association and in, of course, reports to the Parliament by the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there is a case to be answered in terms of government management of this factory. The attitude has been to sort of turn a blind eye to what is happening at Bendigo, to forget about it, and then wake up only when a razor gang report is presented. There is no cause for pride in terms of government management of this factory. I refer to the period of the Labor Government as well as to the period of the Fraser Government. There is no cause for pride at all in government terms in relation to defence procurement policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing that the Bendigo Ordnance Factory can do is commercial work. It has the technological capacity to do it. The factory does a number of things for bodies like the State Electricity Commission, the various hydro-electric authorities and some big mining companies in terms of building equipment associated with dredges and things of that kind. It does very highly skilled engineering work. According to the evidence given to the Committee, it would be wrong-it has been government policy over many years-for the Bendigo Ordnance Factory to canvass commercial work on a large scale. I think it is important to understand the reason for this. It was actually said by one witness that if the factory did more than 50 per cent commercial work that would provide a challenge to the constitutional validity of the very existence of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory because it is established under the defence power of the Constitution. If an establishment exists under that power it is not possible for it to engage in a great deal of commercial work. </PARA>
<PARA> That opinion, that Government policy, in my view-I hope it is not too late for the Government to rethink this question-results from a complete misunderstanding of what the law is-from a complete misunderstanding of the so-called 'clothing trades case'. This was a case in which the High Court was asked to consider whether the Australian Government Clothing Factory at Coburg could perform a large amount of commercial work making uniforms for the railways and tramways and things like that. The interpretation which seems to have been placed on that case is that the High Court said: 'No, that is not right. As long as it does not do too much of that commercial work, it can continue in existence under the defence power'. That is a totally wrong interpretation, in my view, of what the clothing trades case said. It said, in fact, that, if it is the opinion of the Executive Government of the day that it is necessary to retain a skilled work force with a view to defence contingencies, as long as that opinion exists it is okay for that work force to retain its skills and to be employed in whatever work is available to it. The second aspect of the work load of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory is its capacity to do commercial work. That has not been exploited by any government in the past because of a total misapprehension of policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The third aspect of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory's malaise, if I can call it that, is simply that no efforts have been made by governments in any real way in Australia to investigate the possibility of Australia becoming a manufacturer of weapons of one kind or another or of weapon components for export. When we asked witnesses from the departments about this, some desultory references were made to trade commissioners talking about it in Manila or somewhere a few years ago but, as the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has also pointed out, there has been no policy of attempting to obtain overseas contracts for work which would have provided longer runs for the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. So, in relation to Government policy, three issues to me seem important: Inadequate defence procurement policies, which have been the subject of earlier criticism by other committees of this Parliament, to which criticism the Government has made no response; secondly, a total misconception about the capacity of a facility like this to engage in commercial work; and thirdly, the absence of policies in relation even to investigating properly the question of a capacity to do defence work in longer runs with a view to overseas sales. In my view, government-I use the word 'government' in the very neutral sense-has been guilty in relation to all those matters and the Ordnance factory has been singled out for condemnation as a result of government inertia and government failure in relation to those matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The next thing said to be important is the question of cost to the taxpayer. I think this is a very important issue-the question of what this factory is costing the taxpayer. There seems to be agreement that it was in the order of $8 .5m last year. Senator Crichton-Browne indicates that the figure was $9m. There was some debate in the Committee about this question, but let us say that the figure was $9m last year; I do not think it matters terribly. That was the cost to the taxpayer in 1981, according to the Committee. If one looks at that figure in terms of the factory itself, one finds that, in terms of cost to the taxpayer , the Government is paying a subsidy of about $12,500 a year per worker. The figures are included in the minority report written by me. </PARA>
<PARA> I might refer the Senate just briefly to some equivalent industries. For example, in a heavy engineering factory which is manufacturing gear- shafts and couplings, which is totally privately owned and which employs 710 people in Australia-about the same size establishment as the Bendigo Ordnance Factory-the taxpayer subsidy provided by the tariff rate works out at about $14,000 per employee per year. I shudder to mention the car industry, knowing Senator MacGibbon's view about that matter, where, of course, a lot more employees are involved and the subsidy is higher still. So, when we talk about cost to the taxpayer in defence industry and we indulge in this somewhat rhetorical exercise about the Bendigo Ordnance Factory, we find that the cost to the taxpayer in a whole area of human endeavour, whether it be by tax avoiders or whether it be by government decision in relation to tariffs, is significantly higher than the cost to the taxpayer per worker in the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, if we look at a sale to private enterprise and what the cost to the taxpayer would be if the same arrangements were made in respect of costing of the defence equipment and the private industry continued to manufacture the defence equipment, as suggested by the Department of Industry and Commerce, again we find that the cost to the taxpayer in a year would be in the order of $ 5m, to start with; and that avoids the question of other subsidies such as the investment allowance and so on which would be available to a private entrepreneur. So, the difference between the cost involved for the taxpayer in continuing government ownership and in private ownership, in my view, is not significant. </PARA>
<PARA> One aspect of the evidence which is most unsatisfactory is the estimate given by departmental witnesses of the costs to the taxpayer in the event of closure of the factory. We really did not have any hard evidence on that point because the departmental spokesman denied, of course, that there would be significant unemployment following the closure of the factory, if it occurred. The cherished belief is that a sale to private enterprise will produce, as Senator Crichton- Browne said in one flamboyant cross-examination of a witness, some vigorous, dynamic private enterprise entrepreneur who will get the factory on its feet in a matter of months. That was the epitome of his particular comforting vision- something which perhaps we all require in a sense-of what might happen, which made him feel better about his decision. I just do not believe that that will happen. I believe that, if a private entrepreneur buys the Bendigo Ordnance Factory, it will be for the purpose of asset stripping. I believe the social consequences of unemployment, which will be very costly, will follow from that sale asset stripping exercise and consequent retrenchment of staff. </PARA>

It is not one that we have grasped here. I do not think we can have a conditional sale. I do not think we could sell the factory on the condition that they keep a number of workers and produce certain things. I do not think that is possible. In any event it is totally contrary to Senator Crichton-Browne's vision because any dynamic establishment as he envisages it would not be faced with those sorts of alternatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So there are a number of factors relating to this matter which go, I think, to poor performance by government-I am not seeking to make a particular partisan point about that-and which are illustrated by inadequate procurement policy, a false policy on commercial or private work being performed by the factory, and inadequate policy in relation to defence equipment sales. All these things have been brought to the attention of governments before by earlier committees and have not been acted on. Government senators have this totally cynical approach to this institution which, I think, is a sort of damaging thing in terms of the fabric of government. These sorts of things have not been done in the past. We get this situation where there is even a promise of better things to come. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the last election there was an expansion program for the factory and then four months later an announcement that it was to be sold. So there is that bad level of performance by the Government which I regard as a relevant factor. If the policies which the Government, or governments, have been criticised for being deficient in had been adopted in the past, then we might have seen a much better result from the factory and a greater work load, greater productivity and so on. Senator Crichton-Browne nods his head; he agrees entirely that the record of governments in the past in their approach to the matter has not been good. I think those matters have to be taken into account. It is important that they be taken into account in conjunction with important issues of social policy like the effects a sale of this kind has on a community such as Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also to be taken into account the whole question of regional policies and how far governments are going to retreat from the provision of jobs in regional areas. I think that is important. Those and the very telling social demoralising effects to which I referred are quite fundamental to any decision about this factory. The other important point which I do not want to dwell on at length because I know Senator Siddons has a lot of comments to make about it, is one with which I basically agree. </PARA>

I do not wish to bore honourable senators with a lengthy description of the history of the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo and the Select Committee which the Senate appointed to study its future and the future of the Clothing Factory at Coburg. Suffice it to say that I found my membership of the Committee profoundly interesting, hard work and intensely frustrating because of the impossibility of agreement as to the future of the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo. This became apparent very early in the Committee's deliberations. Perhaps I was unduly optimistic in hoping that a non-partisan consensus could be arrived at. However, that indeed was my hope. It proved a tragically faint one. Despite my frustrations I believe an examination of the factory has been worthwhile. Scholars and those people who seek development on an increasingly self- sufficient arms industry in Australia will have if honourable senators will forgive the pun, much ammunition in the future. The evidence provided to the Committee depicts a sorry tale of malevolent neglect, of appalling planning, of decisions made for the most shortsighted and narrow reasons, of an incredible waste of human resources, and of a tragic folly. That we, as a Committee, have been able to shed some light on an industry of such strategic importance has been useful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not optimistic, however, that the mistakes of the past will not be repeated. The Ordnance Factory at Bendigo was originally built during the Second World War to manufacture large naval ordnance and to repair large naval guns. Twice in the 1960s the future of the factory was reviewed. Each time it was decided that the sale of the factory was not worthwhile and that it should not be proceeded with. Neither the Government nor the evidence presented to the Committee has convinced me that the situation has changed one iota. I now seek leave to continue my remarks later so that legislation can be introduced into the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) I am aware of the research directed by Dr T. Hoppenbrouwers of the Los Angeles County/University of Southern California Medical Centre, concerning a possible seasonal relationship between sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and environmental pollutants. A report of this research was published in the ' American Journal of Epidemiology,' Vol. 113, No. 6, pages 623-635. I have arranged for a copy of the report to be placed in the Parliamentary Library. The report acknowledges that the statistical data gathered by the researchers do not prove a causal relationship between SIDS and environmental pollution, but suggest that theoretical considerations and evidence from other studies would support such a hypothesis. The research did not, however, establish a scientifically proven link between SIDS and air pollution.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) So far as can be ascertained no similar research has been conducted in Australia.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (i) During 1981 the United States Congress passed legislation authorising the full United States contribution of $US3.24 billion to the Sixth Replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA 6). However, the legislation provided for the United States contribution to be made over four years rather than three years, with steeper graduated payments than allowed for in the IDA 6 Governor's Resolution. (Other donors' contributions, including Australia's, are being paid over a three-year period.) The United States subsequently paid its first instalment of $US500m, which triggered the effectiveness of IDA 6 on 24 August 1981. As advised in the answer provided to Question No. 455, 17 countries, including Australia, participated in a bridging arrangement which enabled IDA to continue its lending program in advance of IDA 6 coming into effect.</PARA>
<PARA> In December 1981 the United States Congress passed a new aid appropriation bill . Under this legislation $US700m was appropriated for the second United States instalment to IDA 6 which is $US150m short of the amount included in the authorising legislation for financial year 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the IDA 6 Resolution, the pro-rata drawdown arrangements provide an equitable and balanced system for the utilisation of donors' contributions, as well as being designed to encourage all donors to lodge their contributions on time. Give the difficulties faced by IDA, donors agreed to a retrospective waiver of the pro-rata provisions in relation to their first instalments; Australia joined in this consensus. This action enabled IDA to preserve its commitment authority to the maximum extent possible in 1981, despite the delays and shortfall in the United States contribution.</PARA>
<PARA> However, most major donors agreed that it was also necessary to maintain the pro-rata provisions in relation to further instalments in order to encourage the continued participation of the United States in IDA 6 and, if possible, to obtain a renewed commitment by the United States to participate in accordance with the terms of the IDA 6 Resolution. Australia joined the consensus and agreed to the application of the pro-rata provisions for the second and third instalments of IDA 6.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (i) As advised in the answer provided to Question No. 455, the Asian Development Fund (ADF) lending program proceeded normally during 1981 following the payment of the United States second instalment in December 1980. On 1 January 1982 the United States paid its third instalment, thus releasing the fourth and final instalments of other donors. Accordingly, the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) 1982 concessional lending program is proceeding satisfactorily.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (i) The shortfall in the first and second of four United States instalments has led to a total shortfall in IDA's commitment authority for 1982 of $US1.5 billion. A further meeting of IDA donors is scheduled to take place in April 1982 to assess the situation. In order to partially offset the loss of these funds, the World Bank management is considering a range of measures, including new criteria for eligibility for concessional IDA loans as well as raising the level of non-concessional lending by $US800m. However, the net result will be a decline in the 1982 level of World Bank lending by $US500m.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (ii) The Second Replenishment of the ADF is still on course and the Bank's concessional lending program continues to progress normally. Consequently, the question of bridging arrangements does not arise and donor countries have not reassessed their contributions.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) See (1) and (2) above.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Is the Minister aware of Press reports (Sunday Mail, Brisbane, dated 8 November 1981) regarding the serious nuclear pollution problems at the French Pacific nuclear test site at Mururoa Atoll where gale force winds and huge waves on 22 March engulfed a 30,000 square metre heap of contaminated nuclear fallout and carried it into the Atoll's Lagoon.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="624" SPEAKER="Guilfoyle Sen The Hon Dame M.G.C." NAMEID="6D7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="QLD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. It is relevant to note that the Sunday Mail article on 8 November 1981 appears to have the same source as an article which appeared in the French daily newspaper Liberation on 6 November 1981. The Sunday Mail article uses the term ' fallout' on several occasions. The Liberation article does not refer to 'fallout ' but uses the French word 'dechets', which translates into English as 'wastes', and covers all categories of physical contamination resulting from nuclear testing activities.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The statement in the Sunday Mail article that 'some loads of contaminated waste have been put into plastic bags which are floating in the Lagoon' would appear to refer to a passage from the Liberation article which reads, in English translation, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> There are now enough wastes on the Atoll to fill 200,000 concrete cylinders of 200 Litres capacity, measuring one and a half metres in diameter and height, which should be buried at a depth of 2,000 metres. The trouble is, to make concrete you need sand, and the sand on Mururoa is contaminated. Some cylinders are for the present partly submerged in the Lagoon. Most of the waste material is in vinyl bags, four or five times thicker than garbage bags.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government has no information which would tend to confirm or deny the specific claims made in this report. The French Government has acknowledged that residue from atmospheric nuclear tests conducted before 1975 was scattered by a storm at Mururoa Atoll on the night of 11-12 March 1981 but has stated that the situation is fully under control.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There have been suggestions in the media from time to time that the French authorities are considering reactivating their nuclear test facilities on Fangatofa Atoll for use in addition to, or instead of, those on Mururoa Atoll. The French Government has made no statement on these reports.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) As indicated above, the Department of Foreign Affairs has not been able to confirm these reports.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Yes. The Australian Government has directly urged the French Government to cease its nuclear testing program in the South Pacific and has given its active support to statements expressing opposition to nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific at the South Pacific Forum in August 1981 and at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in October 1981. Moreover, the Australian Government strongly supports the conclusion of a treaty which would prohibit the testing of nuclear weapons by all States in all environments. Conclusion of such a treaty would considerably increase international pressures for a complete end to nuclear testing and leave those states which continued to carry out nuclear explosions in an isolated and exposed position.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue to express its opposition to nuclear testing in the Pacific and will maintain its support for the conclusion of a treaty which would prohibit the testing of nuclear weapons by all states in all environments.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no connection between the continuation of French nuclear testing in the Pacific and the export of Australian uranium to France or the activities of French mining companies in Australia, and retaliatory actions of the kind suggested in the question would not be relevant or effective. Uranium is exported to France pursuant to commercial contracts, and French uranium mining companies operate in Australia in accordance with Government requirements. The supply of uranium to France from Australia has to comply with the provisions of the Australia/France nuclear safeguards agreement, which ensures that the uranium may be used only for peaceful non-military and non-explosive purposes in France's nuclear industry.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) The acceptability of people registered with the local CES to fill, after training, a vacancy for which a RAS applicant has applied would be determined by whether or not the employer had lodged an on-the-job training vacancy and, if so , whether the CES office in the area judged that a local applicant would be capable of being trained to the level required and would prove satisfactory to the employer.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) An applicant for a position from outside the area is eligible for assistance under RAS if he or she has received an offer of suitable continuing employment and the CES office in the area in question judged that there are no local unemployed who are suitable immediately for the position, or would be suitable even after training in the case of an on-the-job training vacancy.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="627" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="SA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Following the Commonwealth's review of its health funding arrangements in the light of the Report of the Jamison Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals, it was decided that section 34 of the Health Insurance Act should be repealed from 1 September 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the section 34 arrangements the Commonwealth met the full cost of private hospital treatment to certain patients (eligible pensioners) in private hospitals. The arrangements were limited to nine private hospitals in South Australia, including the Ashford Community Hospital. The arrangements were made to meet a possible demand, after the introduction of Medibank in 1975, by patients seeking full hospital care without charge. This demand did not eventuate and, in fact, available data indicate that there was adequate capacity in the then existing South Australian public hospital system to cope with demand . Notwithstanding this, there has been growth in the number of hospital beds in the public sector since the introduction of the section 34 arrangements. South Australia had 6.9 hospital beds per 1,000 of population in 1980-81 as compared with an Australian average of 6.4 and there were occupancy rates of 69.4 per cent in the public sector and 55.4 per cent in the private sector. These figures indicate that there is substantial unused capacity in hospitals in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The South Australian authorities were advised on several occasions from 1977 onwards that the Commonwealth would review the arrangements unless the State accepted that there was a need to supplement its public hospital system with the section 34 beds and agree to cost-share them with the Commonwealth. Since South Australia showed no willingness to confirm that the beds were needed to supplement the public system, the Commonwealth considered that the section 34 arrangements were no longer appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> State governments have the responsibility to manage the total hospital system within their State, including both public and private hospitals. If there is concern about the level of occupancy, and therefore the financial viability, of the Ashford Community Hospital then it would be possible for the South Australian Government to develop co-operative arrangements between public and private hospitals for the provision of services to hospital patients. Such arrangements could be considered for inclusion under the cost-sharing arrangements within the terms of the Commonwealth's no growth policy.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is a condition of Commonwealth funding to South Australia under the hospital cost-sharing arrangements that eligible pensioners and their dependants , plus those in special need and their dependants, be provided with public hospital treatment and accommodation free of charge. How the State arranges for the provision of such services is one for it to decide.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The new health funding and insurance arrangements have reinforced the Commonwealth's commitment to private hospitals as an essential component of Australia's health care delivery system. The confining of free access to public hospitals to those in genuine need and increased public hospital charges will considerably strengthen the position of private hospitals in the medium to long term. The Commonwealth's decision to continue to pay the $16 bed day subsidy and to increase this to $28 per day for patients receiving prescribed surgical procedures, will also assist the private hospital sector. All private hospitals, including the Ashford Community Hospital, share in the Commonwealth's subsidies.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. Recently the tobacco manufacturers and importers adopted a voluntary code in respect of corrected particulate matter (sometimes referred to as 'tar') and nicotine labelling on cigarette packaging. Clause 2.3 of the Code states:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The collaborative test result will be that recorded in the latest (Australian Government Analytical Laboratories) published round of tests and, for the purposes of the initial implementation of the Code, that round of tests contained in the News Release of 11th August, 1980 from the Commonwealth Minister for Health except in those cases where</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a brand did not appear in that round of tests or,</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the formulation of a brand has been significantly altered since that round of tests.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of brands falling within the exceptions in 2.3(a) or 2.3(b) above the test result will be that recorded by the manufacturer's own laboratory or, alternatively in the case of an imported brand, the laboratory of one of the signatories to the code but such brands will be submitted to the AGAL for confirmatory testing under the current collaborative testing procedures and the result of such collaborative testing will, when known, supersede the result of the individual laboratory test. The result of that individual test will, in the case of a new brand, be notified to the AGAL as soon as distribution of the brand in the market place commences and in all other cases be notified to the AGAL as soon as it is completed.'</PARA>
<PARA> In the terms of the code, manufacturers must advise AGAL of their own laboratories' results.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes. The Department of Health has been asked to pursue the matter of ' mildness' labelling with the tobacco industry. In the meantime the labelling with tar and nicotine yields will enable smokers to weigh the claims of advertising concerning mildness.</PARA>
<PARA> Smokers who consider that they need precise yield details can refer to the ' Smokers' Tar Table' published by the Department of Health.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. The code provides for a modified form of 'banding' of tar and nicotine yields. It is not proposed at this stage to require yields to be stated more precisely than by the appropriate band, which is quite narrow. The propsed yield labelling is consistent with the technical difficulties that exist and the present limited capacity of AGAL to conduct the collaborative testing program that is involved.</PARA>
<PARA> The code is subject to review after two years. Moreover, further reductions of the maximum permitted tar and nicotine levels would be considered in consultation with industry once the code had been in operation for at least twelve months.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Consultations between AGAL and the tobacco industry are continuing on the matter of an agreed uniform testing methodology for ascertaining carbon monoxide yields of cigarettes. It is intended that a pilot study of the testing of carbon monoxide yields will be carried out by AGAL during the first half of 1982, in order to resolve the technical difficulties involved.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst in the terms of the Government's response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare entitled-'Drug Problems in Australia-an Intoxicated Society?' only tar and nicotine yields are required to be stated on cigarettes packets, Consideration is being given to the inclusion of carbon monoxide yields as well.</PARA>
<PARA> As regards additives used for flavouring of tobacco, I should emphasise that it is well known that there are many complex chemical compounds in tobacco smoke and that very little is known about the potential harmful effects of most of these in humans. It would therefore be difficult to prescribe which components should be specifically tested and labelled on cigarette packets. However, in terms of the need for advice to the consumer on health hazards, this issue should be viewed against the already widely publicised and prominently labelled health warning-'Smoking is a health hazard'.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) What are the reasons for the disparity between the States in per capita funding for Aboriginal programs whereby in the 1981-82 Budget South Australia was allocated $614 per person, Western Australia was allocated $431 per person, Queensland $162 per person and New South Wales only $96 per person for Aboriginal advancement.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The per capita figures quoted appear to refer to States grants only . Funds for Aboriginal programs are also provided through grants-in-aid, through the Aboriginal Development Commission, through Aboriginal Hostels Ltd, and through other Commonwealth departments such as the Departments of Health, Education, Employment and Youth Affairs, Housing and Construction and Social Security, as well as from State resources. Funds are provided in different States on the basis of need rather than on population figures, and there is no basis for equating the per capita allocation to New South Wales to that of Queensland.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 September 1981 (Hansard, page 890) Senator Sibraa asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, refers to two questions asked last week by Senators Bjelke- Petersen and Townley concerning Zimbabwe and the presence there of North Korean military instructors. As the Australian High Commissioner to Zimbabwe was recently in Canberra reporting to the Minister and he also recently briefed the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on this matter as well as on the biased anti-Zimbabwean Press reports which were being reprinted in the Australian media, will the Minister bring down a statement on current events in Zimbabwe and Southern Africa for the information of honourable senators? Will the Minister not agree that Zimbabwe, a non-aligned country, whose armed forces are currently being predominantly trained by British instructors, is entitled to invite instructors from other countries, including Australia, to train its armed forces?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following additional information in response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> You referred to the military assistance being provided by North Korea to help train the Zimbabwe Army. Senator Guilfoyle confirmed that the Government of Zimbabwe had accepted an offer of assistance from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and that this was intended to train and equip a brigade of defence forces of Zimbabwe.</PARA>
<PARA> As you quite correctly pointed out, the Zimbabwe armed forces are being predominantly trained by a British Military Training Team, under an arrangement which has operated since Zimbabwe attained independence in April 1980. I agree that it is a decision for Zimbabwe itself whether to invite instructors from other countries to train its armed forces. In announcing its decision to accept the North Korean offer, the Government of Zimbabwe said this was consistent with Zimbabwe's policy of non-alignment. I would repeat Senator Guilfoyle's observation that we hope that North Koreans are approaching their task in the same light. The question of providing Australian military training assistance to Zimbabwe is not under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> The task of restructuring and integrating into one force the three armies which operated in Zimbabwe prior to independence-Mr Mugabe's ZAMLA, Mr Nkomo's ZIPRA and the former Rhodesian security forces-is obviously crucial for the future stability of Zimbabwe, and from the outset Mr Mugabe has accorded it high priority. This task is clearly not an easy one, and it will take some time to achieve complete confidence among three such previously antagonistic groups. However considerable progress has been made to date, and this is a cause for encouragement.</PARA>
<PARA> You also asked if I would bring down a statement on current events in Zimbabwe and Southern Africa. I believe the Government's policies towards Southern Africa, and the conduct of its relations with Zimbabwe, are widely known and understood. I do not think it necessary at this particular time to table a statement specifically on current developments in the region. I will, however, keep this under review.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 November 1981 (Hansard, page 2268) Senator MacGibbon asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) Is the Minister representing the Minister for Transport aware that AIC Q5- 1981, which prohibits the use of Brisbane Airport between 2100 and 2415 hours eastern standard time, is being abused by the Department of Transport insofar as it demands that aircraft departing Brisbane Airport have to be 90 nautical miles away at 9.00 p.m., which means that they must be taxiing by 8.40 p.m.?</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Is the Minister aware that a NOTAM, a notice to airmen, to the effect that Mackay Airport is now to be closed at 8.40 p.m. on a Friday night has been issued?</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Why cannot regular public transport jet aircraft operate into those airports where air traffic control staff are not on duty, as they have for years into Gove without any incident whatsoever? How can the Government tolerate a double standard from the Department on this point? Will the Minister , as a matter of urgency, instruct the Department of Transport that it cannot inflict the economic consequences of its mismanagement on the economy of one State of the Commonwealth in isolaton?</PARA>
<PARA> (d) How much does the Minister estimate that fares Australia-wide will rise as a result of the lack of use of aircraft coming into these airports because of these limitations?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The circular mentioned states that the airspace within 90 nautical miles of Brisbane becomes a temporary restricted area from 9.00 p.m. to midnight daily and that flights within this area will not be permitted except for mercy flights or other emergency operations. The taxi time of 8.40 p.m. is chosen to ensure that any aircraft departing Brisbane is outside the 90 nautical miles position before 9.00 p.m.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The currently published hours of operation of Mackay Tower are: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday 6.15 a.m. to 8.15 p.m.; Friday 6.15 a .m. to 8.30 p.m.; Sunday 6.15 a.m. to 9.30 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time). The only change between these hours and the previously published hours of coverage are to accommodate the changes in airline schedules arising from daylight saving in the southern States. These hours of operation cover all airline scheduled jet services.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) In order to meet standards of operational safety appropriate to regular public transport flights by jet aircraft, the provision of controlled airspace and associated air traffic control services is required. In certain areas of relatively low traffic density and in remote locations such as Gove, concessions against these requirements have been granted. However, it is not proposed to extend such concessions against safety standards to those areas where some form of equivalent safety cannot be said to exist compared with the protection afforded by the services of Air Traffic Control.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) With the establishment of the Independent Air Fares Committee, I no longer have the responsibility for determining domestic air fares. I would expect that , should additional costs be incurred, the airlines would raise the matter in the context of fares submissions to the Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 November 1981 (Hansard, page 2266) Senator Crichton- Browne asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in the Senate. The question concerned the six Indian castaways on Irvine Island, as well as the general question of coastal surveillance and the entry of illicit drugs into Australia. The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The civil coastal surveillance program co-ordinated by his Department gives coverage to the north western coast of Western Australia in a number of ways.</PARA>
<PARA> Light twin aircraft under charter to the Department of Transport patrol the northern littoral daily from Karratha to Cairns, principally for quarantine purposes, including selected tracks through the area in question.</PARA>
<PARA> RAAF P3 Orion long range maritime patrol aircraft give radar coverage of the entire 200 nautical mile Australian Fishing Zone two or four times per month; this includes the north-west.</PARA>
<PARA> RAN patrol boats pass regularly through the area and are available to intercept and investigate particular sightings reports when requested.</PARA>
<PARA> The coastal surveillance program provides for routine patrolling in selected areas with emphasis being programmed according to the priority requirements of Commonwealth Government departments having a major interest in coastal surveillance.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is alert to the need to keep pace with trends in coastal activity and is currently reviewing the civil coastal surveillance program. The Minister for Transport has advised that the circumstances of the unauthorised arrival of the Indian nationals in the area are being investigated by officers of his Department in conjunction with officers of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to that aspect of your question which concerned the entry of illicit drugs into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> My colleague, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has advised that, insofar as his Department is responsible for policing the entry of illicit drugs into Australia, to be totally effective enormous effort and virtually unlimited resources would need to be applied to the surveillance function.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has advised that the provision of resources of this magnitude would involve considerable economic and physical practicabilities. However, within the resources available he does consider that materially effective use is being made of those resources for the detection of illegal immigrants, quarantine risks and illicit narcotic importations.</PARA>
<PARA> The effectiveness of coastal surveillance has recently been re-considered by the Government and steps are being taken to even further enhance the surveillance activity.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 November 1981 (Hansard, page 2500) Senator Walters asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Transport, a question without notice concerning the operation of tourist passenger trains in Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following additional information to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to correspondence with the Australian National Railways Commission , I have received representations on a number of occasions concerning a proposal to operate a tourist passenger train in Tasmania between Launceston and Hobart. The proposal has been examined by the Commission which advised that the operation of tourist services cannot be considered at least until after the completion of the Tasmanian rail track rehabilitation program.</PARA>
<PARA> I have considerable sympathy with regard to the effect that this may have on the viability of such proposals but I regret that it does not seem possible for the Commission to consider any proposal at present, given the current state of track in Tasmania. In this regard, the Commission has advised that the track is only suitable for freight operations at present and it is expected that these operations will increase in future.</PARA>
<PARA> These services are subject to an overall speed limit of 55 kph, with many sections being restricted to 35 kph.</PARA>
<PARA> To date, a total of 19.62 kilometres of the track between Launceston and Hobart has been upgraded in areas where such work was considered necessary to continue operations and a further 50.72 kilometres is planned for upgrading under the Commonwealth-funded program by 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> In the final event, the question of operating a tourist passenger train must be one for the commercial and technical judgment of the Commission. However, I am sure the Commission will be in a position to review such proposals once rehabilitation of the railway line between Launceston and Hobart has been completed.</PARA>

<PARA> I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the high regard which Australia is accorded in the Middle East and in particular to the fact that that regard is not at all enhanced by the dilapidated condition of the Australian Embassy in Cairo. Will the Minister advise what action has been taken to improve accommodation conditions of the Australian contingent in Cairo ? I understand that modern accommodation is to become available in the area and I ask whether the Government has considered acquiring a lease to protect Australian accommodation in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I should like to take this opportunity to record that I wrote to the Minister for Administrative Services on the matter as responsibility for the provision of office accommodation overseas is vested in the Minister, and I wrote to the Ministers for Trade and Resources and Immigration and Ethnic Affairs as their Departments are represented in Cairo.</PARA>
<PARA> My approach to the Minister for Administrative Services was essentially to seek his support in seeking supplementary funds out of additional estimates to permit a lease to proceed in Cairo and I have since been advised that the Minister has asked for a report on the matter and will contact me as soon as it is available.</PARA>
