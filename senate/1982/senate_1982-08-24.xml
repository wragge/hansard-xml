<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that there has been no increase in the amount of the defence service homes loan since 1980, nor have there been any other significant changes to the scheme. However, it is also true that the Budget was designed with the welfare of the most needy in mind. In fact, most resources in the repatriation area have been directed towards those in greatest need. Senator Lewis may have regard to the fact that very significant benefits accrue to home owners, be they defence service home owners or others, as a result of the new housing interest rebate and, of course, the housing package which was announced last March. If we apply the test of need, we will see that that is a very clear example of the way in which the Fraser Government is assisting those who need the most help, particularly those with problems in meeting mortgage payments and so on at the present time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that Mr Barton's citizenship was carefully examined in 1978 and 1979. On the evidence then available, the Attorney-General's Department concluded that it could not be assumed that Alexander Barton lost his Australian citizenship, by virtue of the operation of section 17 of the Australian Citizenship Act. He is in possession of a valid Australian passport and, on the basis that he is an Australian citizen, he is not restricted. As I said, that matter was considered on the evidence available in 1978 and 1979.

As I understand it, we have had endless consultations on dual citizenship with Italy, Yugoslavia and Greece but we have never had such consultations with Latin American countries.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MQ7">Senator SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. As the drought in New South Wales is probably the worst in living memory, if not ever, and extends into Queensland, Victoria and South Australia, I am concerned at Press reports from time to time that often confuse what is being done and can be done by the Commonwealth and the States. It is not a time, after three or four years of drought in many areas, for allegations and distortions. I ask the Minister to outline again the contributions of the States and the Commonwealth and the Commonwealth's current effort and policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="385" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Australians generally are becoming increasingly aware of the state of affairs raised by Senator Scott. In many parts of Australia the drought has persisted for a number of years. At the moment it is at its worst on the eastern side of the country. Parts of my own State of Western Australia, particularly the northern wheat belt, were very severely drought stricken for a period of four years. Certainly there are widespread drought conditions in New South Wales and Victoria at the moment, and that is being recognised by all levels of government. Senator Scott is correct in saying that there are now well -established procedures for Commonwealth-State co-operation in the area of drought assistance. This is certainly one of those areas where one wishes to see co-operative action between governments in the common interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The natural disaster assistance measures, which are subscribed to by the Commonwealth, provide that the Commonwealth will apply $3 for each $1 of State expenditure after States have spent a certain base amount. The base amount which is required to be contributed by the States varies according to the size of the States. In New South Wales the base amount is $10 million; in Victoria, $7 million; in Queensland, $4 million; in South Australia and Western Australia, $3 million; in Tasmania, $1.2 million; and in the Northern Territory, $250,000. But the important point is that once those base amounts have been met-and they are amounts set having in mind the revenue resources of the States themselves-the Commonwealth stands ready to make a three to one contribution to further drought relief measures. Those precise measures tend to vary according to the particular conditions, and the longer the drought, often the more assistance is required to ensure that people do not have to leave the land and suffer the final effects of drought.</PARA>
<PARA> There is some concern on the part of the States that the base amounts exist at all. In that regard it is perhaps relevant to state that the base amounts were set in 1978-79. There has been no change since that time, so that their relative value compared to State Budgets has considerably declined.

It stands ready to work with the States to ensure that appropriate measures are taken.

Secondly, the Commonwealth Government has acted to have the south-western area of Tasmania included in the World Heritage List. It is Commonwealth Government policy that that listing take place. As far as I know, the Government has made no further comments at all. My Department made a submission to a Senate select committee in which, as I understand it, it said that, based upon present indications of future consumption-for example, the Department was greatly influenced by the fact that it had been indicated that two major projects would not be proceeding-there was no necessity for major expansion.</PARA></TALK.START>

Since there are perennial complaints, let me simply say that every Minister comes into this chamber each day equipped with briefs on major subjects so that he can give factual and helpful answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a brief on the tin industry. A serious situation faces the Australian and indeed the world tin industry. Without the buffer stock operations of the International Tin Council there would, without doubt, have been a much more serious slide in the world tin price. I am informed that the Tin Council's Buffer Stock Manager has purchased over 50,000 tonnes of metal, or 25 per cent of the world annual output, in support of the Tin Council floor price. The Commonwealth Government is assisting the Australian tin industry through its contribution of $12m to the financing of the buffer stock operations of the Tin Council.</PARA>
<PARA> Owing to the depressed world demand for tin and the continuing level of world production, the very large purchase of tin by the Buffer Stock Manager was insufficient to correct the imbalance and the International Tin Council found it necessary to supplement the buffer stock operations by the introduction of controls to limit the supply of surplus tin coming on to the market. These controls were imposed initially on 27 April of this year. In the absence of these controls there would have been a very grave risk that the International Tin Council's buffer stock operations would not have been able to support the market price at the minimum of the price range under the International Tin Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is very conscious that the controls are causing hardship to large producers and small miners alike. We have been very concerned that the burden of the controls should be shared fairly. The Department of Trade and Resources has established the Tin Export Control Advisory Committee and the decisions on quota allocations have been taken after advice from that Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Government is not in a position to give any indication of when the controls might be removed. However, they are now starting to have an effect and the Government will be seeking to have their severity relaxed as the situation improves.</PARA>

At the time the re-arrangement of the Ministry took place in May, Mr Fife, my predecessor, had before him a proposition in relation to the Bendigo College of Advanced Education. Senator Robert Ray will be aware that an engineering course was available there. The Commonwealth indicated that it was necessary that new arrangements be made in relation to this course. The agreed position for which reconsideration was sought was that one year of applied science, which would count towards an engineering degree, was to be carried out at Bendigo while the other three years were to be carried out elsewhere. What was sought was that two years of applied science at Bendigo might count towards an engineering degree, with two years being finished off at some other college such as Ballarat or elsewhere. I am aware of the representations that were made. I had made an initial assessment of the facts but I am re-examining the matter. If it is possible within the guidelines laid down by the Commonwealth to meet the request that two years of applied science carried out at Bendigo College should count towards an engineering degree, even if that degree is completed elsewhere, and if it can be done within existing funding and meets with the approval of Victoria, then it is something that I would want to examine very carefully.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has correctly quoted part of the statement which I made on Budget night about the welfare budget. I did point out that inflation has caused special problems for some groups of people. It is probably fair to say that inflation causes problems for everybody but not least-perhaps most-for those on low incomes and those on fixed incomes. It is not, however, only in the field of income security that there are particular problems. If one looks at the problems faced by those who are running institutions for the aged one will find plenty of examples of organisations which have been in severe financial difficulty because of the increases in their wage costs. A delegation saw me in Sydney earlier this year about the cost of running hostels for the aged. It produced figures for the last 12 months. The wage costs in four organisations had increased by, I think, 32 per cent in two organisations, 36 per cent or 38 per cent in another and 48 per cent in another. That, of course, makes the operation of those organisations extremely difficult. That is why the additional provision for personal care subsidy which was announced in the Budget was backdated to the beginning of July.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Probably, however, the most substantial point to be made in response to the honourable senator's question is with respect to those who are on low incomes. Most social security beneficiaries and pensioners are protected against changes in the cost of living by twice-yearly indexation. There are some important elements of the system-in particular, benefits paid to the single unemployed and the young unemployed-which are not indexed benefits. Those benefits have been subject to indexation level adjustments in the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> I think most people are coming round to a realisation that inflation poses a very large problem and that wage restraint is an important element in bringing inflation under control. The attitude which has been adopted by members of parliament-certainly on this side of the chamber and I think probably also on the other side-in showing a high degree of wage restraint this year is some mark of that. A substantial number of companies have come to arrangements with their employees over recent months to provide for relatively low wage increases- certainly low compared with those of the past 12 months or so. I mention companies such as Leyland Motor Corporation of Australia Ltd, Qantas Airways Ltd , ICI Australia Ltd, Kennecott Explorations (Australia) Ltd, the Myer Emporium Ltd, Grace Bros Pty Ltd, G. J. Coles and Co. Ltd and Wormald International (Aust .) Pty Ltd as a group which has tried to give some lead in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> From a purely welfare point of view I believe there would be many benefits if we could achieve a period of wage restraint. There would be obvious benefits to those people who have the running of institutions as their responsibility and who find ever increasing wage costs a very substantial burden. In particular, I think all low income Australians would accept that anything which does something to reduce the rising costs which make their lives difficult is something which should be encouraged not only by government but also by the community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision that was taken in 1978 was, as we have discussed in the Senate quite often, against the background of advances which had been made in medical science at that time and which, as Senator Macklin would recognise, are applicable today. It was taken against a background of people recovering from disease. Veterans had nothing taken away from them if they had their disease properly assessed as a disability resulting from war service. At that time, as Senator Macklin would know, many tuberculosis veterans were reassessed and received higher disability pensions as a result. Accordingly, the Government at the time felt quite justified in taking the action that it did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In restoring the pension to the 100 per cent general rate in the latest Budget decision, the Government considered representations that had been made by all sections of the ex-service community since that time with a view to having restored to those people the benefit which they deemed affected their lifestyles at critical times of their lives. Consequently, as those people get older, it is felt justifiable that they should have that benefit restored. In both circumstances the decisions have been justified in terms of considerations of the moment. The retrospectivity to which Senator Macklin referred in his question is not a matter which the Government felt the need to consider.</PARA>

It contains a great deal of material and I have no wish to burden the Senate with what would amount to a ministerial statement rather than a reply. I will take a few very brief points and perhaps provide additional information later for the honourable senator. There has been an 8 per cent staff reduction over the 12 months to June 1982. The number of registrations in June 1982 compared with registrations in June 1981 shows an increase in Victoria of 7 per cent. I do not have the figure for Western Australia but I have no reason to dispute the figure put forward by Senator Giles. However, I will have it checked . The variation from June 1981 to June 1982 in the number of unemployed looking for full time work, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, shows an increase in Victoria of 18.5 per cent, the comparable national figure being 26.2 per cent. There will be some reductions in staff due to the Job Bank, which will produce more effective and efficient methods of work in the Commonwealth Employment Service offices, but I know of no suggestion that there have been particular difficulties in the Commonwealth Employment Service because of the changes in ceiling which were effected last year. As I have said, the matter is one on which I have available a fair amount of detailed information.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Missen has asked some questions which call for a rather detailed reply. I propose to answer them only generally and to provide him, and the Senate of course, with a detailed answer which I have but which would take rather a long time to read out. As to his first question, the present establishment of the Commission is 25 full time and 5 part time office staff, and I understand that the Commission is now working at that full strength. Those staff members are located in Canberra but, of course, some spend a good deal of time out of Canberra investigating complaints. The answer to the second question in regard to the Queensland and West Australian governments applying pressure to prevent the opening of offices in those two States is no. The Commission is intending in the near future to appoint a part time representative in Perth. Of course, the Human Rights Commission Act does contemplate that arrangements will be made with the States to have offices operating jointly with them in each capital city. Although none of those offices has yet been established, that is certainly still the policy of the Commission and it is well known to the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the third question-that 60 or 70 per cent of complaints could not be handled as they relate to State matters-I understand that this was so in the first one or two months of the operations of the Commission but a recent analysis shows that of complaints up to 30 June, 25 per cent were outside the jurisdiction of the Commission because they related to State matters and a further 30 per cent were outside its jurisdiction because they related to rights not covered by the Commission's charter. As to the final question, in regard to what action the Federal Government will take to persuade States to establish State human rights commissions, at this stage the Government does not believe that there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the States will not co- operate with the Commonwealth's Human Rights Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I think the Senate will be satisfied by the detailed answer that I will provide that the urgent problem that Senator Missen fears, and which he expressed in his question, does not exist. The Commonwealth believes that these are matters for the States to decide. A ministerial meeting on human rights takes place whenever the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General meets. There is a good deal of discussion about various problems concerning our international obligations at these meetings in respect of proposed and existing covenants and conventions and, all in all, in the last couple of years there has been a very much greater recognition of the international obligations that Australia has assumed, not only by way of the Federal Government but also by way of State governments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a little disappointed that Senator McLaren left out my fourth and primary hat of Minister for Social Security because I think that even the Department of Social Security has done something to contribute to the solution of the problems about which he is very properly concerned. The concern that we have about the employment situation is in part reflected in the programs which are administered by my Department which, as well as having a welfare impact, have an impact on activity. I would point to the announcements which were made a month or two ago with respect to welfare housing. The increased allocation in that field is an important contribution to all areas of Australia. I would point to the announcements which I made a couple of weeks ago with respect to the Aged and Disabled Persons Accommodation Program and the Handicapped Persons Assistance Program, where additional capital funds are being made available this year and next year, not only for the welfare benefits that that will bring but also because it will result in some increased activity in areas of the economy which are certainly underutilised at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations is concerned, I mentioned earlier in Question Time the large increase in the allocation for training and income support programs for the young. There is a whole variety of things in the current Budget which acknowledge the need for increased activity in Australia at a time when the private sector is less active. The Bicentennial Road Development Program which was announced, and which is not one of my responsibilities, is a program which will not only do something to meet the real social need for better communications in many of the more difficult parts of Australia but also lead to an increase in physical activity at a time when I am sure it will be welcomed by Senator McLaren and all other honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA> The timber industry is a matter which has been the subject, I know, of a series of representations from the honourable senator and, indeed, from the industry. There have been meetings between the Minister for Industry and Commerce and representatives of the industry. I have a note of a meeting which he had at the beginning of August with representatives of the Australian Softwood Producers Council on the position of the industry and the Council's request for a reference to the Temporary Assistance Authority covering sawn softwood timber. He has also met with representatives of the South East Trades and Labor Council of South Australia on the same matters and therefore the Minister is fully aware of the concerns which were raised in the latter part of Senator McLaren's question.</PARA>
<PARA> After studying a report from the Department of Industry and Commerce, Sir Phillip Lynch reached a decision that the most appropriate action would be for the permanent heads of the relevant Australian and New Zealand departments to discuss the matter. Those discussions are currently under way. That was because of the impact of the New Zealand industry on the industry which is the concern of Senator McLaren and which he is purporting to represent here today. I will see whether there is more up to date information available on the initiatives which have been taken by Sir Phillip Lynch in this area and whether there are other particular departmental activities that can be pointed to. But in general I would point to the Budget as expressing the Commonwealth Government's concern for the whole of Australia in the important area of employment and to our different attitude to capital expenditure in this Budget and, indeed, at the time of the Premiers Conference.</PARA>

I am pleased to advise that arrangements are being made for interested senators to visit the site and inspect the work during the first week in September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to construction progress, I have been provided with a brief statement on the current status of the project, which I now present for the information of honourable senators. In September last year, approval was given by both Houses of the Parliament for the third declared stage of the project. This approval permitted the commencement of work on the construction and fitting out of the new Parliament House, together with the construction of on site access roads, parking areas, other facilities and the landscaping of the site. Authorisation for this work was given on the basis of the schematic design, which was a major design phase submitted to Parliament by the Parliament House Construction Authority. Since that time considerable work has been undertaken in finalising the design and in actual construction. The motivation for early construction of the major underground car parks has been the large covered storage and workshops they will provide during the remainder of the construction phase and the need to complete the access road around the building complex.</PARA>
<PARA> Construction work is also well advanced on the main entrance to the building, with the grand verandah and foyer taking recognisable form. Construction will be undertaken progressively through the central core of the building, with a start already having been made on foundation work for both the reception hall and members' hall. Work has also begun on the House of Representatives chamber which is located to the east of the central core of the building and construction will move progressively to the east to enable construction of the House of Representatives office areas. A similiar process will be adopted for the Senate chamber and offices.</PARA>
<PARA> In this way three main work faces will be maintained throughout the building construction phase. The main structure is programmed to be largely completed by the end of 1985. Fit out and commissioning of the building will continue through to 1987. The build-up in construction activity is reflected in the work force on the site which now exceeds 450 and will continue to increase to the maximum employment figure of approximately 1,200. I believe the best way to appreciate the progress of construction is to visit the site and I hope honourable senators will take the opportunity to visit the site early in September.</PARA>

<PARA> After pointing out that the Commonwealth has, over the past three years, provided $100m to the States for drought relief under the existing arrangements , the Prime Minister has gone on to express his grave concern about the effect of continued drought conditions and has asked for a meeting between relevant State ministers and the Commonwealth Minister for Primary Industry as soon as possible on the subject of drought relief. I mention that to honourable senators because, as I said before, I think it is a matter which is of great importance to the constituents of many of those who are in this chamber.</PARA>

I am unable to give answers to all the questions which Senator Ryan addressed. However, I can indicate that the Federal Police will be providing assistance for VIP protection, airport security, bomb search and mail screening. These are functions which Federal Police would normally undertake. It is true that the Federal Police has been asked to provide a liaison officer in the Queensland police headquarters operations room and assistance in policing the marathon route. Assistance for that could involve the use of the Queensland Commonwealth Games Act. For that reason the whole question is still under consideration by the Government and I will not be able to give Senator Ryan any further information until I have had discussions with my colleague.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Following my contribution last week in the debate regarding closer economic relations with New Zealand, a Tasmanian senator and a member of the House of Representatives drew my attention to an oversight, namely the omission of Senator Archer's contribution while acknowledging the work of Senator Tate. It was not my intention to direct attention to all members of parliament who had been involved in the closer economic relations, but because of Senator Tate's interjection I naturally acknowledged his role. Under the circumstances I believe that possibly, with hindsight, I should have gone further and mentioned Senator Archer. A Tasmanian Minister has reminded me, and also the State Council of the Liberal Party of Australia, that Senator Archer has met with all affected industry groups and has reported the outcomes to government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>This report on Namibia is tabled against a background of conflicting trends. On the one hand, there is the optimistic note of Press reports in recent weeks which indicate a Namibia settlement could be near. On the other hand, there is the South African incursion into Angola of a fortnight ago to strike at South West Africa People's Organisation bases, a move which could further delay a settlement. There have been conflicting explanations of the South African incursion. One view is that South Africa timed its assault to further delay a settlement. Another view is that both South Africa and SWAPO are seeking to gain maximum advantage prior to the ceasefire which would accompany any settlement. Before the incursion, a settlement had seemed imminent, and there had been Press speculation that a ceasefire involving SWAPO and South African forces might be in force within the month. Whether a settlement does eventuate in the near future remains to be seen. If a settlement is achieved, it will end one of the longest-running international disputes to have been before the United Nations since it was formed in 1945. Until the incursion, the last major obstacle to a settlement was a South African demand that a ceasefire in Namibia be accompanied by a withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola. Cuban troops were invited into Angola in 1975 by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-MPLA- Government to counter a South African incursion and to help the MPLA in its civil war with the other major group in Angola, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, UNITA. Cuban troops have remained since. </PARA>
<PARA> South Africa argues that the continued presence of an estimated 20,000 Cuban troops in Angola during a Namibian transition to independence could encourage SWAPO to continue its guerrilla war should it lose independence elections. South Africa also is concerned at what it sees as a growing Soviet influence in the region. It appears to be using the issue of Namibian independence to try to reduce that influence by making a Cuban withdrawal its condition for an end to the guerrilla war. SWAPO has rejected the South African linkage of a Cuban withdrawal from Angola with the issue of Namibian independence. </PARA>
<PARA> Angola has stated that it will not ask Cuban forces to leave until Namibia is independent and until South African cross-border raids stop. Whether South Africa or SWAPO and Angola will modify their positions on the Cuban issue remains to be seen. South Africa is under Western pressure to agree to a settlement while SWAPO is under similar pressure from the front line states. The front line states, particularly Angola, would like the Namibia issue settled so that they can concentrate on their economic and other problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Like South Africa, some of the front line states such as Zimbabwe would also like to see a reduction in Soviet influence in the region. They see the continuation of the guerrilla war as likely only to increase Soviet influence and further destabilise southern Africa. This was a point made strongly by Prime Minister Mugabe only a matter of weeks ago to the Australian delegation of which Senator Young, Senator Hill and I were members. It could be argued that South African intransigence so far in refusing to grant independence to Namibia has in fact assisted in the spread of Soviet influence in the region. If South Africa had granted independence sooner, or at least granted blacks in Namibia full equality with whites, the major nationalist organisation, SWAPO, would not have had to resort to force to try to achieve those ends. SWAPO might not have had to go to the Soviet Union for arms and other assistance and Angola might no longer have felt the need to maintain Cuban troops. My impression after speaking to President Kaunda and Prime Minister Mugabe, amongst others, including SWAPO, is that there exists an unofficial understanding that with a settlement in Namibia, Angola will in fact phase out Cuban troops in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that for South Africa to link the issue of the Cubans in Angola with a Namibia settlement will only further delay independence for that territory. It further considers that South African policies in the region serve only to increase openings for the Soviet Union to expand its influence rather than minimise it. What is happening is that the events in Namibia are linked to events in Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. If South Africa continues to ignore African nationalism and confuse it with communism, and also continues to try to destabilise the countries of southern Africa, it will import the very thing it fears most; that is, communism. If southern Africa goes up in flames the biggest loser inevitably will be South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report on Namibia traces the history of the Namibia dispute from its origins in a League of Nations mandate to the situation obtaining at the beginning of this month. It considers a number of political, social and economic issues, including the controversy over the status of Walvis Bay, and examines Australian involvement and interest in the territory. The report is a comprehensive one and is the result of some three years' deliberations by the Sub-Committee on Middle Eastern and African Affairs and its predecessor, the Sub -Committee on Southern Africa. The report on Namibia follows the Sub-Committee's study of the Gulf region, tabled in May of this year and its report on Zimbabwe, tabled in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, I realise that there are limitations of time today and that this report will be debated on Thursday. I certainly do not wish to pre- empt the report of the parliamentary delegation to Africa. However, events in southern Africa are extremely volatile and notoriously badly reported in Australia and I believe that a full debate on these matters would be in order as soon as possible. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate Select Committee presented its report on the future of the Ordnance Factory Bendigo to the Parliament on 9 March, 1982. This statement responds on behalf of the Government to that report.</PARA>
<PARA> On 7 July, 1982, the Minister for Defence Support (Mr Viner) announced that the Government had decided that the Ordnance Factory Bendigo would continue as a Government Factory. The Government made that decision after considering a single expression of interest for the lease of the factory following public advertisements inviting expressions of interest for the sale or lease of the factory with a closing date of 11 June, 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall the history of this matter which, however, I will shortly recapitulate. One of the decisions of the Review of Commonwealth Functions announced on 30 April, 1981 was that the Government proposed to endeavour to sell the Ordnance Factory Bendigo as a going concern to private enterprise. In consequence of that decision expressions of interest fro the acquisition of the Factory were invited with a closing date of 12 June, 1981, which was later extended to 8 July, 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> Before that process could be completed, the Senate resolved to refer the Government's decision to sell the Governmen Clothing Factory at Coburg and the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo to the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. Subsequently, on 23 September, 1981, the Senate resolved that a Select Committee be established to report on the future of the Government Clothing Factory at Coburg and the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo. As I earlier mentioned, the Senate Select Committee presented its report on the Ordnance Factory Bendigo on 9 March, 1982. It is still to present its report on the future of the Government Clothing Factory, Coburg.</PARA>
<PARA> The members of the Committee were divided in their views on the future of the Ordnance Factory. Senator Martyr (Chairman) and Senator Crichton-Browne recommended: the sale of the factory as a going concern; that if efforts to sell failed then the possibility of sale of various sections of the factory as 'going concerns' be investigated; and if all efforts failed then the operation of the factory be wound down and closed with appropriate assistance to be given to apprentices and employees thereby displaced. The other two members of the Committee, Senator Button and Senator Siddons, dissented.</PARA>
<PARA> On 17 March, 1982, the Prime Minister, (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in answer to a question in the House from the honourable member for Bendigo, Mr Bourchier, expressed the Government's position in the light of the Senate Committee's report in this way:</PARA>
<PARA>I have seen the report on the future of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. The Government will be looking at the report quite closely. I note that the main part of the report recommends that the Ordnance Factory still be sold. That is consistent with the Review of Commonwealth Functions recommendation of a year ago and the Government's efforts since then which in a sense had been suspended during the Senate Committee inquiry. The Government will evaluate the various proposals, or offers of tenders and, when that process is finished, it will come to a final decision as to whether or not the factory will be sold.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government would much prefer that the factory could be sold to private enterprise so that new investment could be attracted to Bendigo and to the Ordnance Factory. This would provide opportunities for expanded activity. More money would flow through the factory and into the city.</PARA>
<PARA>In respect of the Committee's recommendation that if the factory could not be sold it should be closed down the Prime Minister advised the honourable member that the Government did not accept that part of the Committee's recomendations. The Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government believed that its reaction to that part of the recommendations ought to be made known quickly so that the concern that would be felt as a result of that recommendation could be put completely and absolutely at rest.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister assured the House of the future of the factory by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Having examined all the options and in particular the impact on Bendigo, the Government, if it is not successful in its efforts to sell the Ordnance Factory to a vigorous and vital private enterprise concern, will continue to operate the factory as a government operation.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister visited Bendigo on 22 March, 1982, and, in the company of the honourable member for Bendigo, addressed the factory employees and repeated that assurance. Thus, in order to bring the matter to a conclusion, the Government decided to explore the interest of private enterprise in taking on the operation of the factory, in the light of the Senate Committee Report, by re-advertising for expressions of interest for the purchase or lease of the factory.</PARA>
<PARA> As I advised the Senate at the beginning of this statement, the Government has decided that the factory will continue as a Government factory. An expression of interest was received from one company, Vickers' Australia Ltd., to lease the factory. The Government did not consider that the company's proposal met the Government's requirement for the future operation of the factory or the commitments which had been made by the Government to the people of Bendigo.</PARA>
<PARA> In his public announcement of the Government's decision on 7 July, 1982, Mr Viner emphasised the responsibilities that lay ahead of the Government, the management of the factory and the whole work force in assuring the future of the Factory. Mr Viner said:</PARA>
<PARA>It remains for factory management and staff to work together with the Government to demonstrate that the Ordnance Factory Bendigo has an important part to play in the field of defence support and that cost and performance achievements in the future will justify the Government's decision to continue its operation as a Government factory.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, in view of this background Mr Viner has, since undertaking the responsibilities of the new Department of Defence Support, been concerned to remove the uncertainties about the future of the factory and put in train action which will allow the employees to look ahead with growing confidence.</PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Government had agreed that implementation of recommendations contained in a Joint Management Review of the Munitions Factories should proceed. With the exception of Ordnance Factory Bendigo and the Australian Government Clothing Factory, the recommended changes in upper structure positions in the factories have been implemented and staffing of the positions is proceeding. Consequential changes for junior management are in hand. Now that the Government has made its decision to retain the Ordnance Factory Bendigo, action is in hand to implement the necessary management changes in that factory.</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take this opportunity to indicate the investment being made by the Government in the factory and actions being taken to establish a better workload for it. In the 1982-83 Budget, expenditure of $947,000 is provided for. This includes $80,000 for computing facilities, $190,000 for rationalisation of production facility for 500lb bombs, plant acquisitions of $200,000 and repairs and maintenance of $477,000. Such expenditure of nearly $1m in this financial year is an emphatic demonstration of the Government's readiness to meet the commitment made to the factory's employees, to the civic authorities and the people of Bendigo by the Prime Minister, Mr Viner and the member for Bendigo, Mr Bourchier.</PARA>
<PARA> But more than that, there is included in the works design list of the Department of Transport and Construction for this year provision for a new electroplating facility at an estimated cost of $550,000, and it is planned to call tenders for extensions to the metrology laboratory-a key facility in meeting the precision requirements of ordnance manufacture-in March 1983 at an estimated cost of $415,000.</PARA>
<PARA> The factory has budgeted for 310,000 man hours of work in the current financial year, being an increase of 50,000 hours in defence work and an overall increase of 18,000 hours over the 1981-82 workload. The future of the factory is really dependent upon the volume of defence and commercial work which can be directed or attracted to it under the nation's defence program or the guidelines for engaging in commercial activity. Thus the workload of the factory will respond to the overall national defence effort in time of peace or the competitiveness of the factory to obtain commercial work.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless one of the most significant prospects for increased workload, as well as opportunity to acquire and apply new and advance technology, lies with Project Hamel. This project is designed to equip the Army with the British 105mm light gun as a key weapon over the next decade. It is anticipated that the Ordnance Factory Bendigo will manufacture a significant proportion of components and the gun will be assembled at Bendigo.</PARA>
<PARA> An executive engineer from the factory will play a significant role in the furtherance of this project. Dr J. Barclay has been selected to fill a new post in the United Kingdom as the liaison engineer for the project. Dr Barclay will leave Australia on 16 September, 1982, to take up a three year posting. In another effort to open up new opportunities for Bendigo a factory representative has recently visited the United States to discuss the possibilty of sub-contract work with United States firms. Discussions have taken place at officer level with the Victorian Government. It is hoped that the Victorian Government will be true to its public statements that it wishes to direct more of the major engineering work of its own instrumentalities to Bendigo.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, whilst the Government would have been happy to have been able to sell or lease the factory to a private enterprise purchaser, able to put new investment into the factory, expand the commercial opportunities for the factory within Australia and overseas and to secure and expand employment at Bendigo, it was not, in the events which have happened since the announcement of the decisions of the Committee of Review of Commonwealth Functions in April 1981, possible to achieve such a sale or lease within a reasonable time and with appropriate guarantees. Nevertheless, I am sure honourable members, the factory work force and the people of Bendigo will understand that, by the actions which I have related, the Government will now do all that it reasonably can to improve the efficiency of the factory and expand the workload of it and thereby improve the prospects of its future operations.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>Situated in a 61-acre site in a leafy suburb in the provincial city of Bendigo is a factory which has become a monument to the incompetence of the Fraser Government. It is the subject of this report. It symbolises incompetence in action over a period of 18 months at considerable cost to the taxpayer, at considerable cost to the people of Bendigo and, ultimately, at cost to the Fraser Government in terms of the Bendigo electorate when the next Federal election is held. In April 1981, the Government made a decision about the Bendigo Ordnance Factory as part of the so-called razor gang decisions. I briefly refer the Senate to the decision that was made. In that decision, part of the so-called Review of Commonwealth Functions, the razor gang stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In the view of the Government, activities of a commercial kind are generally best performed in the private sector, where they are open to greater influence from consumers and to the disciplines of competition . . . We propose to offer for sale as a going concern the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose it is rather late in the day to draw attention to the fact that influence of consumers and competition in the production of defence equipment do not exist in Australia-at least, one hopes so. I thought that the only recipients of defence equipment in Australia were the Australian military forces . I hope there are no other recipients which would make this factory receptive to the wishes of consumers. Of course, the Ordnance Factory has gone the same way as have many of the other establishments mentioned in the razor gang report of April 1981, a report which represented an ideological commitment to reduce the public sector in Australia. That commitment is not being carried out because of the incapacity of this Government to see that its decisions are carried out. I refer to such other organisations as the Australian Wool Testing Authority, the proposals in relation to Telecom Australia which are now the subject of the Davidson Public Inquiry into Telecommunications Services in Australia and various other establishments mentioned in that inquiry which were to be sold and have not, in fact, been sold. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference of the Senate Select Committee on the Government Clothing and Ordnance Factories involved, in essence, inquiring into the wisdom of the decision to sell the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. As a member of the Committee, all I can say is that many days later, after very long and detailed work at an estimated cost to the taxpayer in excess of $100,000, a Senate committee of four senators reached a conclusion about this matter. When I say a Senate committee of four senators, two senators, constituting a majority-plus the more mystical part of Senator Martyr's personality in exercising his casting vote as Chairman-decided that the Bendigo Ordnance Factory ought to be sold. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations of the Committee were no mealy-mouthed recommendations such as were made by the Fraser Government. I refer the Senate to one or two of its recommendations. Senators Martyr and Crichton-Browne, two Western Australians who lobbed into the city of Bendigo on this bizarre excursion on behalf of the Fraser Government, said that there should be no mucking about with regard to the sale of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. They stated, in effect, that it should be 'now pursued with vigour, and a particular effort made to show the work force the benefits of sale.' They added that the Government should give some extra work to the Bendigo Ordnance Factory so that it would be more attractive to private enterprise to buy. That is a part of the peculiar relationship between the Government and private enterprise. It is to be encouraged to provide orders for a factory which will become a private enterprise so that a better price will be obtained when it is sold. That is the theory as expounded by the two honourable senators concerned. They then considered that sections of the factory could be sold if the Government was unable to sell the lot. Paragraph V of the Committee's recommendations states in essence that if all else fails the factory should be wound down with an official closure date to be fixed by the Government , to allow time to conclude existing commitments. They went on to say that in the event of winding down the factory the slaves should be sent to Maribyrnong and various other places where, presumably, they would be provided with work by this benevolent Government which does not provide work for many others in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the conclusion of the majority of the Senate Committee on this matter. It cost the taxpayers $100,000 to reach that conclusion in terms of the work of the Committee alone-work which started in September 1981 and concluded, in essence, with the publication of the Government's response to the Senate Committee's report. The recommendations of the two senators were full blooded indeed. There was no mincing of words on their part. But look what has happened. The Chairman of the Committee was truly named Martyr, because if ever a senator was martyred by the Fraser Government in pursuit of its ideological rubbish, it was that unhappy Chairman-a Western Australian senator who, with his Western Australian colleague, was sent to the provincial city of Bendigo to do this bit of ideological hatchetry on behalf of the Fraser Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Mulvihill said, a pair of hit men who knew when they left Bendigo that they would not be going back because they recognised the consequences of what they were saying on the city and people of Bendigo. Somebody else who recognised the consequences very slowly was Mr Bourchier, the ever-silent member for Bendigo in the other place. Suddenly he recognised there were consequences for him. Even the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) began to recognise that there were consequences for him also in what the Government had had to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the performance of the Liberal Party, the so-called 'economic managers' of this country during the last few years. Let us look at this issue as a symbol of its performance. For 30 years the factory has been operating under Liberal-National Country Party governments. It has been operating at a loss to the taxpayer. In any one of those 30 years a decision could have been made to sell the Bendigo Ordnance Factory and exactly the same conditions would have obtained as obtained when this Government made the decision in April 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> But what was the attitude of the Fraser Government to the Bendigo Ordnance Factory five weeks prior to the 1980 election? Mr Bourchier, the member for Bendigo, presumably speaking on behalf of the Government, announced in Bendigo that if the Fraser Government were re-elected in 1980 it would spend $9m in upgrading the factory. That is what was said a month before the 1980 election. In April 1981, three months after that election the Government announced a decision not to spend $9m on it but to sell it. It is exactly the same performance as occurred following the 1977 tax cuts. It is exactly the same performance as took place with regard to tax indexation. As Professor Russell Mathews said, on three occasions it was promised before an election and abandoned after an election. The Bendigo Ordnance Factory was treated in the same manner. Before the last election it was to be upgraded, but three months later it was to be sold. These two courageous senators at least stuck with the decision of the captain on this issue and were prepared to go down with the ship . It was only when Mr Bourchier started to go down with the ship as well that the yelling really started. Earlier this year the Prime Minister went up to Bendigo and started to back away from his decision. That is recorded in the statement of the Minister for Defence Support, Mr Viner, who said that perhaps it was not such a good idea after all and that they did not really want to close the factory but in any event it was still possibly up for sale. It was a backing away comment made by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Having decided in April 1981 that the factory was for the chop and ought to be sold because it could be best run by private enterprise, in the current Budget of August 1982 the Government said: 'Now we will spend $1m on it'. I wonder what changed in that time. Look at the sequence of events. Prior to the 1980 election $9m was to be spent on the factory and three months later there was a decision to sell it. There was then an inquiry and a decision not to sell it but to spend $1m on it. No wonder people are suspicious about an early election. It is no wonder that the people of Bendigo do not believe for a moment that this factory will survive if the Fraser Government is ever re-elected. They do not believe it for a moment because they have been played for suckers by this Government for too long over this issue. The Fraser Government has no credibility left in that city. Mr Bourchier can break his elected silence of seven years in Parliament, during which he hardly said a word to crow about the Bendigo Ordnance Factory, but it will do him not a bit of good. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Senate inquiry into the sale of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory was not in vain. For the first time, I, as an Opposition senator participating in an inquiry, prevailed, with Senator Siddons, as a dissenting member of the Committee and the Government accepted our advice rather than the advice of the two unhappy characters over there, Senator Martyr and Senator Crichton-Browne, who no doubt will think twice before they again volunteer as shock troops for the ideological commitments of Malcolm Fraser. I have noticed in the last few years that it is not a course that commends itself to Senator Withers, and I guess it does not commend itself any more to Senator Martyr and Senator Crichton -Browne. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Select Committee did establish a few things. The first is that the defence forces procurement process in this country is incompetent. The report contains a chart of how defence equipment is procured. It looks like the inside of a transistor. It shows all the various committees through which the process goes. There was every indication in the evidence given to the Committee that the system is incompetent. Secondly, the Committee clearly established that this Government takes absolutely no notice of House of Representatives committees relating to foreign affairs and defence which on a number of occasions have recommended an upgrading of the defence procurement process as well as a whole series of new guidelines for the defence procurement process. This Government has taken no notice of the recommendations of the House of Representatives member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence in relation to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The third thing that the Senate Committee established was that the word ' decentralisation', often used by this Government, particularly National Country Party members of the coalition, is absolutely meaningless in any sort of philosophical terms to a government led by Malcolm Fraser in which the National Country Party is in coalition. I can understand it in relation to areas like education where the National Country Party has a vested interest in keeping people in the country ignorant, otherwise they would vote Labor or Liberal, but I do not understand it in relation to a factory like the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. In these terms the Government's lip service to such an expression is absolutely meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the Committee showed that for 30 years governments had been labouring under a delusion about whether this factory could perform so-called commercial work-that is, work for private enterprise-in addition to defence work. Yet Mr Viner, after all these 30 years, went into the House of Representatives the other day and made a statement saying how delighted he was to see that the Victorian Government would give work to the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. For 30 years governments and public servants have been hiding behind a totally false interpretation of the decision of the High Court of Australia in the so-called clothing trades case. That is an extraordinary thing. At least it is some justification for Senate committees that that was found out by this Senate Committee and that charade cannot go on any longer. </PARA>
<PARA> The final thing which the Senate Committee was able to establish was that the so-called razor gang was totally incompetent in the way in which it went about its business. If it had properly considered any of the information which must have been available to it before it could have made such a decision then it could not have arrived at the conclusion which it did because the fact of the matter is that to sell the Bendigo Ordnance Factory to private enterprise and keep it going would cost the Australian taxpayer just as much money as it would to keep it under its present management. So the Senate committee of inquiry has been worth while. I congratulate the Chairman and Senator Crichton-Browne on the experience which they have gained as members of the Committee. I do not think we will see them volunteering much again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was almost a year ago that I rose to propose that the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations examine the future of the Government Clothing Factory at Coburg and the Ordinance Factory at Bendigo. I did so because, having visited both factories, I realised that they were efficient operations performing a vital function as part of our defence manufacturing capabilities. Unlike Senator Button, I do not propose to use the time available to me to have a rerun of what has already been said in the three reports-the Government report, Senator Button's report and my own report. I am delighted that the Government has been big enough to change its mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate Select Committee on the Government Clothing and Ordnance Factories has performed a very valuable task. It has focussed attention on both factories and I believe everybody now has a much better idea of their worth to the community. Heavy engineering should be looked on as an important national asset. It should be an asset of which we are proud. I believe that that is now much more the Government's attitude. I have read the Government's report with some interest. There are just one or two things that I believe should be highlighted, some lessons that, undoubtedly, we have learned. The first is that although $1m is to be spent at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory in the next 12 months, this represents no special allocation. This money is to be spent on replacing certain vital pieces of equipment that have been in the system for quite some time. Replacement was needed at least two years ago. Therefore, so far there has been no commitment by the Government to modernise substantially the plant at Bendigo. All members of the Committee pointed out that much of that plant, whilst essential, was tending to become obsolescent. </PARA>
<PARA> The other important lesson that the Committee has drawn to the attention of the Government-I do hope the Government will take note of it-is the need to work sufficient man hours in the factory at Bendigo to make it economically viable. This year 310,000 man hours are budgeted for, only 6 per cent more than the number of man hours worked last year. Until the factory reaches at least 340,000 man hours a year it cannot even approach viability. This is an urgent task. From there on, there should be a long term plan for the man-hours worked to increase by at least 60,000 per year. </PARA>
<PARA> There is almost unlimited scope for that to happen. The Government is already well advanced in planning to build and assemble most of the British Hamel 105- millimetre howitzer at Bendigo. This is very good news because the burning lesson that we as a nation have already learnt from the catastrophe of placing the order for the 155-millimetre howitzer to be built in the United States of America is very real. The 155-millimetre howitzer was urgently needed within one year of the placing of the order in the United States. That time is now. The Army urgently needs that piece of equipment. On the spot investigation only a few weeks ago indicated that it will be at least three years before that urgent piece of equipment will be available to the Australian Army. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the critical lesson to be learnt. Relying on off-shore contractors to produce for us vital pieces of equipment is safe only when there is no urgency. As soon as there is a world emergency or any likelihood of war in any part of the world, the availability of these sorts of vital pieces of defence equipment tends to disappear. We must have the capability in our own country to produce at least the basics of what is required for our fighting forces. Surely field artillery is one of the basics. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot of scope for additional man-hours to be worked in the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. In negotiating contracts over the years, the Government has great scope to use off-shore facilitation procedures, commonly known as the memorandum of understanding and Australian industry participation. Under both of these concepts we have available considerable scope for negotiating additional defence work in Australia. It was very noticeable to members of the Committee that sufficient attention had not been paid by the Government to insisting upon our rights in regard to parts of contracts being undertaken in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I draw attention to the most significant lesson of all. Senator Button alluded to it. It was very obvious to us that the way in which these defence establishments are organised is very unsatisfactory. Here again, I should like to commend Mr Ian Viner, the Minister for Defence Support, who recently visited Bendigo and sought the opinions of management, the unions and the professional staff as to how best to reorganise the management of the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo. I understand that he is very co-operative in regard to a basic reorganisatoin and the principle of decentralisation of management. Greater authority to the chief executive of the factories has been at least verbally supported by the Government. There is some talk of going back to an organisational structure that we had 40 years ago-it worked very well-under which all the defence factories were essentially under the control of the Defence Department. An ordnance officer could make decisions quickly, as opposed to the present arrangements whereby the factories report to a bureaucracy here in Canberra, which is so remote and so removed from what is going on in the various areas around Australia as to be very ineffective as a final point of authority. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, although the Committee has taken exactly 12 months to produce its final report, I believe the exercise has been very worth while. We now have a much better appreciation of the great asset we have in our Government defence factories. There is every indication that the Government will concentrate on making them efficient, changing the management structure and generally gearing these assets up into something of which the nation can be proud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to minimise Senator Button's triumph in any way, but it seems to me that the bodies were disposed of and cast up on the beach on 17 March of this year-St Patrick's Day, if I recollect rightly. It seems to me that everyone knew what the situation would be . I do not know why there should be so much fuss about it now. The first thing I wish to do is to defend the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and particularly the honourable member for Bendigo, Mr Bourchier, both of whom entirely disagreed with one of the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Government Clothing and Ordnance Factories. The Prime Minister has made that abundantly clear, and so has the member for Bendigo. As long ago as 17 March, the Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>that part of the recommendation-</PARA>
<PARA>The Government believed that its reaction to that is the proposal for closure-</PARA>
<PARA>ought to be made known quickly so that the concern that would be felt as a result of that recommendation could be put completely and absolutely at rest. </PARA>
<PARA>Why it is that the Prime Minister should now be critised for that all these months later is beyond me. But there are political reasons for people doing things, and we see that daily in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that I can speak on behalf of Senator Crichton-Browne and myself when I say that we have no reason, and have seen no reason so far, to change our minds on anything that we recommended so long ago about the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. The evidence is all there for anyone who wants to read it. That evidence will not change. There can be no pulling away from the fact that the departments concerned with the factory did not believe that it was essential to Australia's defence. Senator Crichton-Browne and I can only assess evidence of this kind and all the other evidence put before us as objectively as we can and come to our conclusions. I think that we arrived at our conclusions honestly. They were difficult conclusions to reach, but we reached them, and I think that we are still at one about those conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA> Everyone in this place knows that it is the Government's right to accept reports, to reject reports, to take pieces out of reports and to put things into reports, if it wishes. I have no objection to that. I shall not argue about this particular matter with the Government in any way. The Government did not totally reject our report. The Government accepted the first part, which was that a vigorous attempt should be made to sell the factory as a going concern. The Government pursued that objective. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that Senator Crichton-Browne and I, or the Government, can be condemned because no buyer could be found. I think that Senator Crichton-Browne and I have had in our minds the fact that the delays, the rather strong debate in this chamber, the trade union activity and the pressuring that occurred had quite a lot to do with no responsible buyer making himself available to take over and to run the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. So I think that everyone ought to bear that in mind, too. It is not too much to suggest that prospective buyers may well have been frightened off. In any case, the Government has made its decision. I have no doubt that in some ways it was a hard decision to make. It has not left Senator Crichton-Browne and me in any way abashed. We intend to carry out our responsibilities and the other part of the responsibilities given to us by the Senate in relation to the Australian Government Clothing Factory at Coburg. Whatever the Government decides to do in this instance will have no effect at all on our objective assessment of what we think ought to be done about the Coburg Clothing Factory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief because what I wish to say has been recorded in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Government Clothing and Ordnance Factories concerning the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. In my view it is a well documented, articulate and definitive report which expresses a proper view. Senator Button makes much of the fact that $100, 000 was spent on this inquiry. I remind the Senate of who set it up in the first place; it was the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. In my view, as a result of their delay of 12 months-I suspect it may have been part of their motive-the Government had difficulty in finding people who might be inclined to purchase the factory. There was so much vacillation, so much time spent, so much anxiety set upon companies which might have been inclined to purchase the factory that ultimately a suitable buyer was not found.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Senate also that between 1972 and 1975, when the ALP was in government, it had an opportunity to do something about the factory. What did it do? There was a thundering silence; it did absolutely nothing. This Government had the courage to make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not make a judgment as to whether the Government is right or whether the Committee is right. That is something which only history will demonstrate. I am sure that Senator Martyr shares my view that the object of the Committee was not to represent a government; it was to examine the evidence and draw the proper conclusion. On the evidence presented to us I am sure that it was the proper conclusion under the circumstances. What the Government chooses to do afterwards is not something about which I have to concern myself. We will pursue our endeavours in relation to the Australian Government Clothing Factory at Coburg with the same enthusiasm, dedication and responsibility. The evidence has not been completed and I do not know what the final result will be, but I am quite sure that Senator Button knows in his heart how he intends to draw his conclusions and what the result will be. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The volume I have tabled is part of a series of interim reports the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union has provided since it was established by the Commonwealth and Victorian governments in September 1980. The first two reports dealt with unfolding investigations and, on the advice of the Royal Commissioner, Mr F. X. Costigan, Q.C., they were not tabled. The third interim report, which dealt largely with fraudulent taxation schemes, was tabled earlier this year. The Government recently received the Commission's fourth interim report, in three volumes. Mr Costigan recommended against tabling the second and third volumes, but saw no objection in regard to volume 1 and envisaged that it would be made public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has given very close consideration to the question of the tabling of volume 1. That volume includes findings and observations that make damaging allegations in relation to a number of individuals. Findings and conclusions of a royal commission are matters that need to be taken seriously, though they are not, of course, findings of guilt whether they relate to criminal offences or to matters of discipline. For criminal charges, the guilt or innocence of a person is determined by the courts; for disciplinary charges, Acts of parliament provide for decisions by appropriate tribunals. Notwithstanding these considerations, the Government has concluded that there is an overriding public interest in the maters canvassed that calls for tabling of all but two paragraphs of that volume. Two paragraphs have been excluded having regard to their contents and to the fact the Commissioner is to make further inquiries into the matter discussed in them. </PARA>
<PARA>Matters Relating to the Union, its Members and Others</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The report gives substance to the grave concerns that led the Government to set up the Royal Commission. Volume 1 deals with the Commission's knowledge and findings on some aspects of the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, its members and persons associated with them. It describes a history of violence, and the ruthless means by which members of the union have arrogated to themselves a position outside the law. It tells of the union's ability to provide individuals with a new name and a new identity, and some of the uses that are made of these. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commission has developed a practice of referring to appropriate law enforcement agencies particular criminal activities as they are identified. Many of the activities described in the report are of direct concern to Victoria and its police. The Victorian Government has a copy of the report except for paragraphs 1.13 and 1.14 and chapter 3 which appear only in the report to the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commission has pointed in another volume to the need for a special group to prepare and conduct the prosecutions necessary to suppress the criminal activity uncovered by its continuing investigations. The Government stands ready to set up such a group. I will be considering this matter urgently in consultation with Mr Costigan, who is overseas at the moment, and the Victorian Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Action to Progress Taxation Prosecutions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Attention is also being given as a matter of priority to the prosecution of offences associated with 'bottom of the harbour' tax evasion schemes which are referred to in volume 1. In June this year the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and I took steps to obtain advice from the Solicitor-General in regard to the availability of prosecution action in the particular case dealt with in chapter 3 of volume 1 . The Solicitor-General, in an opinion delivered later in the same month, advised that certain remedies were open. Advice was also sought from senior counsel in June on possible criminal proceedings in relation to a major promoter in Sydney. A final opinion is expected shortly. On the particular case referred to in chapter 3 of the report, the Crown Solicitor sent an officer from his central office in Canberra to Perth to work in association with the Australian Taxation Office to complete a brief to advise on evidence and to draw charges as appropriate. That brief has now been delivered to senior counsel. </PARA>
<PARA> More generally it has been decided to appoint a special prosecutor to concentrate special effort on action with a view to prosecution of persons who were directly involved in the promotion and execution of bottom of the harbour schemes. The special prosecutor will be assisted by a task force of lawyers, taxation officers and police. There will be liaison with the Royal Commission. Additional staff and resources will be provided as needed. We will be seeking the fullest co-operation from State authorities where they may be involved. The Victorian Government has already proposed a joint effort and I will be discussing this matter with it. </PARA>
<PARA> Decisions on prosecutions or other proceedings will, of course, be made on the evidence available and on the law applicable. But I am firmly of the view that those who were most directly involved in the promotion and execution of blatantly fraudulent tax evasion schemes should be dealt with when their conduct can be shown to have been in breach of the criminal law. Where appropriate, civil action for recovery of moneys will be pursued as well. </PARA>
<PARA>National Crimes Commission and the Future of the Royal Commission</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commission's fourth interim report underlines the need which the Government has seen for some time for the establishment of a National Crimes Commission. Mr Costigan himself has recommended action along these lines. The Commonwealth envisages a National Crimes Commission as a standing body, established by legislation, with special powers to investigate and initiate action against serious criminal activity. Such a body would supplement existing law enforcement efforts in areas of need. In particular, a Crimes Commission could be directed to organised crime; white collar crime; and corruption of officials and official bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary objective of such a Commission would be to bring about prosecutions in appropriate cases. The Commission would be involved in such prosecutions rather than recommending prosecutions and leaving action on them to others. It would not produce reports naming individuals as suspected of committing criminal offences. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is seeking the co-operation of the States. The matter was discussed at the Police Ministers Conference last week and will be discussed further at the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General later this week. The Royal Commission's report is relevant to the deliberations of those meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Costigan refers in the volume that has been tabled to other areas, mentioned in the confidential volumes, that are of major significance and concern to Government and the community. He says his Commission will be unable to complete its investigations by its present report date of 31 December 1982 and states that continued investigation must take place whether by his Commission or some other body. The Government would see the proposed National Crimes Commission as an appropriate body in due course to carry on the work of the Royal Commission. In the meantime, the Government will consult with the Victorian Government on the question of extending Mr Costigan's commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Findings Affecting the Crown Solicitor's Office</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 3 of volume 1 focuses on an episode of particular concern to the Government. The episode relates to the performance of the Crown Solicitor's Division of my Department and in particular of the office of the Deputy Crown Solicitor in Perth. The report recounts the handling by the Crown Solicitor's office of a case of an alleged fraudulent tax evasion scheme referred to it in 1974 by the Australian Taxation Office in Perth following an investigation by that office. The scheme, of the kind commonly referred to as a bottom-of-the- harbour scheme, involved the stripping of company assets so as to cheat the revenue of taxes. The report states that, after counsel's opinion was obtained, the Deputy Crown Solicitor's office was requested in August 1975 to commence a prosecution. Mr Costigan reports a history of events and circumstances in the handling of the matter by the Crown Solicitor's office, and of dealings between that office and the Taxation Office. The history reveals inaction and negligence on the part of the Deputy Crown Solicitor's office in Perth. The problems described are said to go further than the Deputy Crown Solicitor's office in Perth, and to bear on the control and supervision of the Perth office by the Crown Solicitor's central office in Canberra. The matter concluded with advice from the Crown Solicitor's central office that the evidence was insufficient to establish a criminal conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> I should not be taken as accepting without reservation all the conclusions and views expressed by the Commissioner in relation to individual persons. I do not accept the views expressed by the Commissioner in paragraph 3.89 of the report to the effect that a new law was not needed. But the views expressed require action. </PARA>
<PARA>Remedial Action in Regard to the Crown Solicitor's Office</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The standing of the Crown Solicitor's office, and the integrity and competence of some of its officers, are brought into question by these matters. The proper course is to deal with the problem quickly and effectively. A number of officers referred to in the report have retired since the time of their involvement. There is no suggestion that any committed a criminal offence. The Commission has been critical of some officers who remain on staff. It has expressed conclusions of a very serious character in relation to two officers. One of these officers was directly involved in the conduct of the particular case referred to by the Commission. Another was not officially involved in it but in the course of its investigation the Commission found some association between this officer and a number of companies which seem to have been involved in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. Other conduct in which this officer was found to be involved also gives cause for concern. </PARA>
<PARA> As a first step, the divisional manager of the Crown Solicitor's Division was sent to Perth to undertake inquiries there and to examine work in the office that was allotted to those officers. The two officers have been suspended from duty pending decisions whether or not to charge either or both of them with disciplinary offences under the Public Service Act. Appropriate action under that Act is in process. </PARA>
<PARA> On the wider questions of organisation, management and control of the Crown Solicitor's Division, the former Crown Solicitor initiated an internal management review in 1978 which culminated in the establishment of a Joint Management Review of the Crown Solicitor's Division in 1979. That review was carried out from November 1979 to June 1980. That review, by a team consisting of a private management consultant, a representative of the Public Service Board and a Crown Solicitor's officer, recommended major changes in the management structure. Its recommendations were readily accepted by my Department. Considerable progress has been made in implementation. One of the major recommendations of the Joint Management Review was for the establishment of a Management and Co-ordination Branch of the Crown Solicitor's Division headed by a First Assistant Crown Solicitor having a local designation of Divisional Manager. A major function of this Branch is to develop and improve Deputy Crown Solicitor's offices and to co-ordinate, guide and oversight the work of those offices. The three top positions in the branch are filled and working. Other appointments are in train. </PARA>
<PARA> There remains however, a question as to the adequacy of the staff resources of the Crown Solicitor's Division. The Government has asked the Public Service Board to report to it as a matter of urgency on the adequacy of the staffing and resources of the Crown Solicitor's office. In view of the Royal Commission's findings, however, the Government sees a need for a more particular external examination of the Perth office and its relationship to the Crown Solicitor's central office in Canberra and with the Australian Taxation Office and other client bodies in Perth. I am arranging for such an exsmaination to be carried out by the President of the Law Council of Australia or by a suitably qualified person nominated by the President. In brief, the terms of reference of the inquiry will be as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> To review the operation of the Deputy Crown Solicitor's office, Perth generally , but with particular regard to- (a) the professional performance of the office;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the adequacy of the management and the effectiveness of work control systems;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the adequacy of numbers of professional and support staff to ensure the timely performance of work at an appropriate level of quality;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the effectiveness of the organisation of the office for the provision of legal services for the Commonwealth Government;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the effectiveness of supervision of the office by the Crown Solicitor's central office; and</PARA>
<PARA> (f) the effectiveness of procedures in client Departments in relation to matters referred to the office. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations for Changes in Section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Royal Commissions Act</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Mr Costigan has recommended a number of changes in the secrecy provisions of sectionb 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act to allow in particular for more access to, and use of , Taxation Office information in law enforcement. These recommendations are for changes additional to the amendments to the secrecy provisions made earlier this year. The Government will give early and careful consideration to these recommendations. The Government will also examnine carefully the Royal Commission's recommendations for amendments to the Royal Commissions Act to provide additional powers in regard to search warrants and compulsion of witnesses. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although the bland character of the statement by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and its manner of presentation tended as always to conceal it, the Costigan Report-Interim Report No. 4 of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union- contains a mass of stunning revelations and findings not only, as might have been expected, about the criminal activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union on and off the waterfront, not only about the professional ethics, credit and credibility of Mr Frank Galbally, the lawyer who has acted for that union over the years in a variety of diverse capacities, but above all else, about the incompetence and corruption that is rife within the Public Service over which this Government presides and for which this Government is responsible . The report is, in particular, a stunning indictment of the Attorney-General's Department and, by extension, the Attorney-General himself, as the Minister responsible for that Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The focus of the report, in the first instance in chapter 3, the 80-page chapter which is the nub and essence of this particular document, is upon the Deputy Crown Solicitor's office in Perth, within the Crown Solicitor's Division of the Attorney-General's Department. That focus arises from the fact that it was in Perth, as a result of some effective investigation in the first instance by an investigative officer of the Australian Taxation Office, that the matter of a prosecution of a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme was first referred to the Deputy Crown Solicitor's office for prosecution. It was in Perth that the first clear-cut example of a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme, exposing, on the face of it , the participants in that scheme to criminal liability, arose in such a way that a prosecution seemed beyond doubt. That a prosecution was beyond doubt was established to the satisfaction of the Australian Taxation Office after taking independent advice from external Queen's Counsel in 1974 and 1975. Certainly by 1976, if not earlier, the possibility and indeed the necessity of launching such a prosecution and the certainty of its standing up was a matter of satisfaction to the Australian Federal Police. But it was in Perth and in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's office of the Attorney-General's Department in Perth that that particular, crucial test-case prosecution ground to a halt. It was as a result of an extraordinary sequence of events which are retailed in this report that in fact no prosecutions were ever launched against any participant in a bottom-of- the-harbour scheme anywhere, with consequences of which we are well aware and which Mr Costigan documents. </PARA>
<PARA> What this report exposes in the result in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth is an unbelievably festering mess, involving not only extraordinary professional incompetence and extraordinary professional negligence, but also corruption in the form of active participation by a senior member of that Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office and his wife in a whole series of his own bottom-of-the -harbour companies. It has been said there were as many as 200. The report itself states that Mr Costigan is unable to judge just how many were involved but within the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office itself was a flourishing mini-tax evasion-avoidance industry going on. To make matters complete, also within the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office one particular gentleman-the same gentleman who was actively involved in the tax avoidance exercise-had a nice little call-girl prostitution racket being run partly out of the DCS Office itself. This is the matter which the Attorney-General's statement rather coyly describes as 'other conduct giving rise for concern'. </PARA>
<PARA> While the rot started in the DCS Office in Perth it is clear that the rot did not stop there. The Costigan report makes it very clear that responsibility for the extraordinary sequence of events which resulted in the lamentable non- prosceution, as Mr Costigan says, of these cases is shared by senior levels of the DCS Office in Perth-not just junior echelons-and by the Central Crown Solicitor's Office, extending all the way up to the Crown Solicitor himself. The report also makes it evident, although Mr Costigan's sympathies are rather more with the Australian Taxation Office than with the Crown Solicitor's Division, that a degree of responsibility is also shared by senior officers within the Australian Taxation Office who, although they were clearly unhappy with the quality of the responses they were getting from DCS, allowed themselves to be shoved about from pillar to post by what was obviously an unbelievably implausible dilatoriness on the part of the officers within the Attorney-General 's Department. Nor does the rot stop there. By extension it is clear that the rot extends all the way up to the top of the political tree itself, to the Ministers in this Government and especially the Attorney-General and the Treasurer (Mr Howard), both of whom have been claiming to have been acting so diligently to counter tax avoidance and evasion in its most horrendous forms. I should add that the Commissioner, Mr Costigan, does find some extenuation, so far as the Ministers are respectively concerned, in the secrecy provisions of the tax Act-section 16-which he says makes and made the task of ministerial supervision of the officers in question somewhat difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it clear-I do so on behalf of my party and I think it will be very clear to the community at large-that I do not accept that that supervision was beyond the resources, beyond the capacity or beyond the power of either of the Ministers concerned. It is clear from the very existence of this report and from some of the events that led up to its production that section 16 certainly does not stop the communication of the substance of alleged offences in the taxation area. Although it may well be the case, and in fact certainly is the case, that it is unlawful to communicate the names of persons involved in these schemes or any other names that come to the attention of the Deputy Commisisoner of Taxation in the exercise of his statutory duties, there is no reason whatsoever why the nub and substance of these cases and the issues they give rise to cannot be communicated either to the Ministers, to the Parliament or to the community at large. To the extent that the Ministers in question seek to shelter behind section 16 of the tax Act and to the extent that attention is devoted to the need to amend this particular section as the answer to our prayers so far as ministerial supervision of these things is concerned, I put it to the Senate that that is simply a blind, that section 16, the secrecy provision, offers no effective excuse for the failure of knowledge and the failure of supervision on the part of the Ministers concerned who, if the doctrine of individual ministerial responsibility means anything in this day and age, bear the personal responsibility for everything that has gone wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The Costigan report makes a number of things very clear. It makes clear that the failure effectively to prosecute the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, the failure effectively to move in and cut them off with a test case prosecution which would certainly have been successful in the mid-1970s, has cost this nation hundreds of millions of dollars. Anything between hundreds and thousands of individual companies have been involved in the evasion of taxes that are payable. Mr Costigan is unable himself, he freely admits, to quantify the cost to the revenue and to the nation of this failure to prosecute but he certainly puts it in terms of at least hundreds of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing that is made very clear in the report, by some very solid legal analysis spread over many pages, is that there is and always has been a solid legal foundation for the criminal prosecution of those involved in bottom- of-the-harbour schemes, whether as vendors, as purchasers or as promoters of the schemes in question. There are and always have been remedies available under the Crimes Act, the Companies Act, under the common law and also under the civil law of misfeasance. </PARA>
<PARA> The third thing that Mr Costigan makes clear is that there has always been a solid factual foundation on which a test case-in particular the test case in Perth around which this report focuses-could have been prosecuted. The notion, which was assiduously promoted by the officers in question who had charge of this matter in the Perth office, that what was needed was something almost like a confession on the part of the participants in order to establish the necessary intention to defraud is exploded by Mr Costigan and demonstrated to be the nonsense that it is. All that is necessary is that the fraudulent intention be able to be inferred from overt acts-and there were plenty of overt acts which were amply documented and which were always available not only to the Taxation Office but also to the DCS, which was charged with the task of implementing a prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth thing that Mr Costigan makes admirably clear in his report is that the bureaucracy knew these things, knew about the legal and the factual foundation in the first instance no later than 1974-and certainly by late 1975- that there was not just one but two Queen's Counsel's opinions from Mr Brinsden, QC, in Perth by then. This was then confirmed by the subsequent police investigation which concluded-it was rather long-winded but very thorough-in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth thing that Mr Costigan makes clear is that there is no foundation in law or in any emerging new further facts for the change of heart which occurred within the bureaucracy, resulting in the prosecution of the Perth test case, and with that the prosecution of everything else that was in issue, being abandoned in April 1979 on the say so of the Central Crown Solicitor's Office. The reason for it being abandoned owed nothing to any re-evaluation of a serious kind of the law or to any change in the facts available; it resulted from the saga of incompetence, indolence, negligence and possibly worse which occurred, and is documented in enormous detail in the Costigan report, within the DCS Office in Perth and which was not subject to any challenge, second guessing, or proper supervision by higher officers within the Crown Solicitor's Division in Perth, Canberra, or anywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA> The final thing that Mr Costigan makes clear is that there is no basis on which it should be assumed that the 1980 Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act was ever necessary, at least to correct the deficiencies in the present law as it related to bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. It may have been helpful in dealing with the sales tax frauds that became apparent some time earlier-Mr Costigan acknowledges that-but there was no reason why effective action could not and should not have been taken a lot earlier than that. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have a situation that, under the noses of the Treasurer, the Attorney- General and others whom I will mention, an absolutely extraordinary situation occurred. Not only was there a flourishing small-beer prostitution racket within the DCS Office, not only a mini tax avoidance industry within the Perth DCS Office but also a combination of corruption, negligence and incompetence which was rife within that office and clearly higher up the tree too resulting in a situation where a prosecution which could have been launched and turned the whole bottom-of-the-harbour industry on its head as early as 1976 did in fact collapse in a heap. What happened is that the nation incurred, as a result, at least hundreds and possibly thousands of millions of dollars worth of lost revenue which has had obvious effects elsewhere in the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> I say it occurred under the noses of various people and I make that point as clearly as I possibly can. It occurred in the first place under the nose of the Treasurer, Mr Howard, who has been claiming, of course, for the last five or six years that he has been taking every possible legislative and administrative step to cope with tax avoidance and tax evasion in every one of its manifestations. But certainly the Australian Taxation Office knew what was going on, knew the way in which this matter-which was crucial to the whole administrative attempt to counter what was going on-could and should have been dealt with. Certainly the Australian Taxation Office could have communicated through the Commissioner to Mr Howard the substance, if not the details, of the particular prosecution strategy. Certainly, what was going wrong and what was causing the delay should have been communicated to Mr Howard, and I do not doubt that it was communicated . </PARA>
<PARA> We have had from Mr Howard something less than total frankness in his own explanation of the course of events and the failure of the prosecution in question to be launched on the McCabe-Lafranchi report of 27 June which indicated in a very sketchy kind of a way the sequence of events, as it was known, according to Mr Howard, to him, the Treasury and the Taxation Office during the relevant period. While Mr Howard acknowledges that as early as 1974 and 1975 there were opinions which made it clear that prosecutions could have been launched, he simply says, at a passage in his statement, that as a result of further discussions which took place over the period 1976-79 it became clear that there was no foundation on which the prosecutions could successfully have been launched. Well, Mr Costigan has flushed Mr Howard out and shown that particular Press statement and the account in it for the fudging that it in fact represents. Whether that fudging was deliberate on the Treasurer's part or whether it owes more to the incompetence of his own officials rather than to any malice or dishonesty is something that will be for this Parliament and the community to judge. But let there be no mistake about it; Mr Howard's statement was less than full, less than frank, and certainly gave a less than adequate account of the Treasurer's own role in this whole unhappy unfair. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, is concerned, he, of course, is the chief law officer in this country, responsible ultimately for the prosecutions that are launched under the Federal criminal law, and committed, supposedly, as he is in that capacity, to waging the Government's war on tax avoidance. He is the Minister responsible for everything that happens within his Department. It may also be noted that the Minister happens to live in Perth and might perhaps as a result be expected to know a little bit more than perhaps some others about the personnel involved in that enterprise. Whether again it is a result of something worse than negligence on the Minister's part must be a matter for this Parliament and for the nation to judge. But negligence it undoubtedly was, negligence which is totally incompatible with the doctrine of ministerial responsibility which is assumed to exist, which is claimed to exist, in any Westminster system of Government. The Attorney stands condemned, I believe, for his role in allowing this extraordinary sequence of events to occur . Someone else stands condemned and who I do think deserves to be mentioned, although it is not with any great pleasure that I do this, is Mr Alan Neaves, the present Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department, who was Crown Solicitor from February 1975 until July 1979 and a man of whom Senator Durack and this Government thought so highly that he was subsequently elevated to the position of Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department. It is clear from the Cositigan report that Mr Neaves knew, certainly, of everything that had been going wrong in relation to this prosecution and the abominable saga of mismanagement within the Perth DCS at least as early as March 1978. I would not wish it to be thought that Mr Neaves or indeed, any one of a number of others in a large cast of characters comes off scott free form the Costigan report. I believe there is an element of culpability at that level, that very senior level , within the Department. I make the point and I make the reference to indicate that we are not talking about some minor order characters in the play being incompetent, being negligent or being corrupt. We are talking about that incompetence and that negligence, at least, leading up to the highest levels of the Department, with implications that should be obvious so far as the responsibility of the Minister himself is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The question then becomes this: What action does the Government propose to take ? What has it said it is going to do in response to the Costigan report? The Attorney's statement today gives no confidence, or should not give anyone any confidence, that the Government has learned any lesson from this report, no confidence that it will mend its ways, no confidence that it will in the future be any more effective against the tax avoidance and tax evasion industries than it has been in the past. The first things that we are told is going to happen is the suspension of two officers in Perth. My understanding is that those two officers are Mr O'Sullivan, Jnr, and Mr Bercove, both of whom come in for a quite explicit caning, justifiably so, in the Costigan report. Indeed, there could be hardly anything other than a suspension as the appropriate course of action in response to them. They would be very lucky indeed, I would believe, on the evidence in this report if they escape with merely disciplinary action under the Public Service Act which is apparently what is being presently contemplated by the Attorney-General. My query is whether the buck should stop there with those two relatively junior officers, the only two officers against whom it is proposed or it is stated that explicit action will occur. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other figures named in that report. I have mentioned one of them; there are several others. Although some have since retired it seems, at least on my initial reading-I have not had very long to tackle what is a very lengthy report-that the official level of responsibility for the course of events in Perth ought not to be regarded as stopping with the two officers who have in fact been suspended and that responsibility ought to extend at a bureaucratic level all the way up the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing that we are told is happening is that here is to be a full scale management study or exercise introduced in relation to the Crown Solicitor 's Office generally and more particularly the Perth office. Well, that is of course wholly desirable, lamentably belated as it may be. I simply indicate that we can hardly be expected as a parliament, as a nation, to have very much confidence in the outcome of that particular management inquiry unless and until there is a fundamental change of personnel at a very significant number of levels within that particular division of that particular department and a complete clean-out of the mess that is so starkly revealed by the Costigan report. </PARA>
<PARA> The third thing we are told is going to happen is the setting in train immediately of particular prosecutions on the matters which did collapse, again in Mr Costigan's words, so lamentably as the result of the neglect and incompetence and possibly worse of the Attorney-General's Department. Immediate action, we are told, is being taken through all available avenues, including the appointment of a special prosecutor. I simply comment in respect of that and in the light of past experience, that I will believe it, my party will believe it and the community will believe it when it sees that action is in fact taking effect. Whether that action does take an effective course, not only in relation to those particular matters but also to the many others which obviously are crying out now for criminal prosecution, will depend very much on how far- reaching is the Government's action with respect to the next thing it says it is going to do and that is establish a task force of lawyers, tax officers and police to engage, in the fullest co-operation in the first instance with the Victorian Government and then presumably others, in the task of actually prosecuting to fruition under the criminal law, and where necessary the civil law as well, those who so manifestly deserve that particular attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I can reveal that so far at least that co-operation does not seem to have been particularly forthcoming from the Commonwealth level. It is my understanding that over 10 days ago, on 13 August, the Victorian Premier and Attorney-General wrote to Senator Durack proposing the immediate establishment of a joint prosecutorial force to proceed immediately with prosecutions in those areas where the evidence was already on the books. I understand it was said in that letter that the Victorians had a team ready and willing to go consisting of the Crown Solicitor, the Chief Crown Counsel and a special prosecutor with appropriate back-up staff. Not only has no written reply been received to that letter sent more than 10 days ago; but also it is my further understanding that orally Senator Durack has in fact advised the Victorian Government that he is not interested in that particular proposal. He does not want it to proceed in that form but, at best, he will have a think about it. The Attorney-General has been having a think about the procedures by which prosecution should be launched . He and his Department have been having a think about it for something like eight years now-since 1974. The have failed lamentably to deliver the goods and, in the process, this nation and the taxpayers of this nation have suffered enormously. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask him to have a think again, a very specific think, about just what kind of a prosecution policy he and his Government are now going to set in train. We are facing exactly the same lethargy, exactly the same indolence and exactly the same inaction in the face of gravity and in the face of emergencies that have characterised this particular Ministry and this particular Minister, I fear, from the outset. Mr Connolly, the Chairman of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts referred, a few months ago, to the 'glacial' pace at which the Attorney -General's Department moved in giving opinions and advice in response to requests from other departments. I have referred in this place and I refer again to the pathological lethargy of this particular deparment and this particular Minister when it comes not just to talking about something but to doing something. </PARA>
<PARA> The final avow, of course, in the Government's quiver is the establishment-the proposal gets tighter and tighter with each successive public utterance of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) or his Cabinet members-of a permanent National Crimes Commission. This, it appears, is to be the white horse that Mr Fraser and the law enforcers, or those of them who are left in the Government's Ministry, are now to ride home. This is to be the answer to the problem of organised crime, tax evasion, official corruption and everything else that the present court system has failed so far effectively to deliver upon. But what kind of a beast will be constituted by his crimes commission remains still, after this statement today, impossibly unclear. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party has spelt out on a number of recent occasions its attitude to the crimes commission concept. I do it again briefly here today. It is not opposed in any way, root and branch, to the concept of some alternative form of dealing with intractable areas of crime where the existing legal system has demonstrably proved ineffective and where it is arguable that a more inquisitorial approach, at least at the investigative stage, will bear more effective fruit in the community's interest. But the Australian Labor Party has said that it will not jump on to the band wagon and buy the whole package, root and branch, until and unless it is satisfied about a number of very important considerations. The Australian Labor Party is worried, in the first place, about the accountability of any such organisation, particularly one set up on a joint Federal-State basis. As I said the other day and as Senator Peter Rae echoed, organisations which are accountable to everyone in the Federal system can, in practice, end up as accountable to no one. If the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence is to be the model, as some Ministers in other States have suggested, on which the crimes commission is to be established that is potentially a very worrying consideration indeed. Secondly, the Australian Labor Party is worried about the safeguards that will be associated with the exercise of powers by any such national crimes commission. All sorts of dangers are involved in inquisitorial bodies exercising unbridled investigative and reporting powers. There are all sorts of situations in which malicious hearsay gossip can in fact be elevated, through its reporting in the media, to the status of fact when, of course, it will not survive any such scrutiny by reference to ordinary court standards. We need to be satisfied about what is proposed and there is nothing in Senator Durack's statement which does so satisfy us. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all-this is the point which brings us back to the nub of the report presented today-the Labor Party is worried about what any such national crimes commission will actually do with its findings. The Attorney said in his statement that it is not just going to name people for others to prosecute, but about that the concept has changed. We are going to have an organisation which itself is going to 'bring about' prosecution. We are confronted with the possibility that we will have a body, if this is established in the way that the Government seems to want it established, that is armed with the power to investigate, through compulsive oral investigation of witnesses and the subpoenaing of evidence a body which is armed in a fully open-ended way with access to tax records in a way that is more far reaching than the recently amended law-that is a Costigan Royal Commission recommendation; a body which is armed with the power to issue search warrants, which is another Costigan Royal Commission recommendation in this report; a body which is armed with the power to make public any information it wants to at any time either in the course of public hearings or in the context of an actual report; and a body now, apparently, with the power itself to prosecute. </PARA>
<PARA> This proposed national crimes commission lacks only the power to gaol, to have all the elements of prosecution, judging and gaoling vested in the one set of hands-something which has traditionally and quite properly been regarded as inappropriate. It is not clear from the Costigan report that this kind of animal is in fact needed. The Opposition certainly will take a lot more persuading that it is needed. The Costigan Royal Commission made it perfectly clear that the problem with the present law is not the non-existence of a crimes commission body to launch prosecutions itself but the failure of the existing, perfectly adequate, on the face of it, departmental machinery to play that particular role . The job could and should have been done by others.</PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the day, we are left with this: The nub of the indictment against this Government is that in the face of a massive criminal fraud which it must have known about since at least 1976; in the face of easy legal remedies to deal with that fraud which it must have known about from the documents within the bureaucracy in 1974, 1975 and, at the latest, by 1976; and supported as those original opinions were by a series of subsequent high level legal opinions, this Government and these Ministers-the Treasurer and the Attorney-General-failed to take action. There may be some claim of justification on their part for their failure to take action in terms of the information available to them under section 16 of the Act. As I have said, I do not believe that this Parliament ought to take that particular explanation seriously. They must give a more plausible explanation of their action and inaction, their sins of both omission and commission. This Parliament and the nation, will not be satisfied until the relevant Ministers, the Attorney and the Treasurer stand up and do just that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report that we are considering today begins its introduction at page 2 with the rather interesting statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Information obtained during these confidential hearings and from these documents-</PARA>
<PARA>Documents that it refers to as coming in by the semi-trailer load from Sydney and by the container load from another source which I prefer not to disclose publicly--</PARA>
<PARA>is both revealing and disturbing. </PARA>
<PARA>Without question I would say, as Senator Evans has already pointed out, the most disturbing information stems from the behaviour, the actions and the lack of actions of a number of members of the Crown Solicitor's Office, particularly in Perth. Mr Costigan's comments regarding these officers and his assessment of the results of their actions and the cost to the community are damaging indeed. The Royal Commissioner turned his attention in the first part of his fourth interim report to what have recently come to be called bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. They are defined at page 26 of the report in terms used by a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in 1977. I will not bother to outline those since they are considerably detailed and honourable senators can read them at their leisure. Interestingly, Mr Costigan takes some pains to separate, a little later in the report, the operation and intention of these bottom-of-the-harbour schemes from the Slutzkin-type scheme-a scheme which was, shall we say, exonerated by a High Court decision. At page 89, the Commissioner makes the point:</PARA>
<PARA> The statistics provided to me by the Taxation Office concern two types of application of the schemes described in this report. The first concerns companies which have accumulated profits, but on which they have paid company tax. The purpose of the application of the scheme is to avoid the payment of tax on the distribution of these profits to the shareholders. It was this type of operation that the decision in Slutzkin was concerned. It is not the type of case with which I am concerned in this report. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 3.120 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The second type of case is of a very different order . . . the Taxation Office describes it as a 'pre-tax profit strip'. In these cases the object is to avoid payment of the company tax properly levied upon the company by leaving only a shell of the company with no assets to pay the tax. </PARA>
<PARA>More interestingly, he expresses strongly the opinion that these schemes are not only illegal-that is, the second type of case to which he refers-under the present Act as amended but also were illegal before that and were permitted to exist-indeed, permitted to flourish-only because of failure to act by the Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth. In paragraph 3.89 at page 70 he points out:</PARA>
<PARA> What was worse was that the Crown Solicitor's Office permitted the inference to arise that the existing law was not adequate and that new laws were needed. Thus the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia was induced to enact new criminal laws of great breadth and scope when all that was required was the enforcement of the existing laws. To say that the new laws have been effective is not to answer this criticism. The new laws will be effective only if they are enforced. The conduct to which they are directed is conduct which was already criminal. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Costigan is quite definite in his opinion regarding the end result of the behaviour of Messrs O'Sullivan, Jnr, and Bercove. He makes that quite clear at page 71 in paragraph 3.90, where he says:</PARA>
<PARA> The criminal proceedings would have had a salutory effect upon the promotion of the fraudulent schemes. At the very least they would probably have led to the loss of liberty of the particular promoter concerned, thus inhibiting further promotion by him. It would have served as a warning to others who later chose to adopt and promote his schemes. They probably would have deterred them. </PARA>
<PARA>Page 89 gives a list of most disturbing statistics which indicate just exactly how those schemes flourished because of the lack of action by the Crown Solicitor's Office. It is noted that, in 1973, 27 companies throughout Australia were identified as operating this particular scheme. By 1980, 1,412 companies had been identified in Australia as operating this kind of scheme-a proliferation which Mr Costigan makes quite clear occurred only because of lack of action, if not actual negligence, on the part of certain officers in the Crown Solicitor's Office. Given the Commissioner's comments regarding the enforceability of the earlier legislation, one is forced-or at least I am as a mere lay person-to wonder why the Government is mooting yet more legislation to enable it to prosecute promoters of and participants in what are known as bottom -of-the-harbour schemes which the Commissioner quite clearly indicates could have been prosecuted under previous legislation. My concern about this is supported by a letter from a much more learned person than I and which appeared last week in the Australian Financial Review. Mr Geoffrey Lehmann, lecturer in the Legal Studies and Taxation Department of the University of New South Wales made the point:</PARA>
<PARA> The assertion that ''innocent'' vendors of ''bottom of the harbour'' companies will be made liable ''retrospectively'' for someone else's tax under the Government's current proposals . . . requires comment. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that he had published an article in the National Times in which he argued that such vendors were already liable for tax under section 260 and were not protected by Slutzkin's case, a comment which is certainly supported by Mr Costigan. To Mr Lehmann's knowledge, no published refutation of his submission has appeared. He then made the point:</PARA>
<PARA> The position is that there are six previous High Court decisions making such vendors liable and no decision directly applicable to them which would make them not liable. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It is now most unlikely that the present High Court would reverse six previous decisions to benefit a group of blatant tax avoiders. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus, at best, new legislation would clarify a position already existing, according to Mr Costigan. It would speed up matters rather than make illegal something which was previously legal. The Attorney-General's assertion, in his statement to the contrary, appears to me at least to be a mere face-saving exercise to cover negligence on the part of some members of the Crown Solicitor' s Office in Perth. Indeed, one could almost say that the Attorney-General's defence of the need for new legislation justifies the action by Messrs O' Sullivan, Jnr, and Bercove, despite the fact that Mr Costigan found the actions of these officers both indefensible and unjustified. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt in the minds of most Australians that if this Government is serious about ending tax evasion and is concerned about promoting justice in the tax laws in this country, it will prosecute with all vigour and under all the legislation available to it the purveyors of these schemes. To assist the Government in this, Mr Costigan recommends a number of extensive amendments to section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which I do not intend to discuss in any detail. They are listed quite clearly at the beginning of the report for those honourable senators who wish to follow it up. </PARA>
<PARA> It has become a tradition in Australia that income tax details are confidential , as they rightly should be in most cases. An individual is therefore free to give to the Taxation Office whatever details he or she chooses, secure in the knowledge that they will not be, because they cannot be, used against him or her other than by the Australian Taxation Office itself whenever necessary. I do not believe that, given the abuse of these secrecy provisions by the more greedy and less honest among us, most Australians would reject any attempt made by a government to see a relaxation of those provisions as outlined by Mr Costigan. When protecting sections of an Act serve only to protect the more dishonourable among us, and in so doing place an additional burden on the law abiding, there is good reason to view them with some scepticism and, one hopes, to take steps to amend them. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot conclude my comments without making some reference to Mr Costigan's style. Senator Evans has already referred to what he called the coyness of one or two of the Commissioner's comments. This report is most readable. It is couched in what I consider delightfully straightforward language and is spiced with a large number of wryly witty comments and a good dash of irony, particularly in the sections relation to Messrs O'Sullivan, Jnr, Bercove and Gleedman. Indeed, the reference that Senator Evans has already made to the prostitution racket that seemed to be operating out of Mr Bercove's office would give the term 'Crown Solicitor' an entirely new meaning. As Senator Evans has already pointed out, there has been something less than total frankness on the part of some Government officials and some Government Ministers. There has been, to say the least, a lamentable lack of enthusiasm by officials and the Government to prosecute any of the 1,412 companies operating the scheme up to 1980. I suggest that the Government has much to answer for and the Commissioner, Mr Costigan, is to be commended for exposing the saga of negligence, misfeasance and arrogant disregard for the law, a disregard that was probably best summed up by Mr Bercove. In paragraph 3.59 of the report, referring to Mr Bercove, the Commissioner comments:</PARA>
<PARA> When it was put to him that this was intentionally dishonest, he was indifferent. In his view, 'everyone does it' and therefore it was good enough for him. </PARA>
<PARA>If we are going to allow that sort of thing to proliferate in the community, if the Government allows that sort of attitude to continue with the end result of defrauding taxpayers, then it has a considerable amount to answer for. </PARA>

It could start by ensuring that the Crown Solicitor's offices in this country are staffed by people who are well qualified to deal with the cases that they are most likely to run up against.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two of the most damning comments in the report are those relating to the qualifications, or lack of them, of Messrs Gleedman and O'Sullivan. On page 34 the Commissioner says of Mr Gleedman, an officer appointed to handle this particular form of tax evasion in the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office:</PARA>
<PARA> He had no previous experience in criminal conspiracies. He claimed expertise in company law but it was plain from his evidence before me that he had little in that area either. </PARA>
<PARA>With regard to Mr Bercove, the Commissioner notes on page 47:</PARA>
<PARA> He had no experience in criminal law and none in company law. He remains in the Crown Solicitor's Office at Perth, and still has the responsibility of handling this matter. It is not a responsibility that he has pretended to discharge. </PARA>
<PARA>That this sort of thing should be allowed to happen is an indication of more than what Senator Evans referred to as lethargy on the part of the Government. It is, or could be construed to be, an indication of total apathy by this Government towards the massive tax evasion that is going on in the upper echelons of society. it is a Government that is more concerned with harassing pay-as-you-earn taxpayers or small business people. I suggest that the Australian community deserves better. If the present Government is not prepared to look to its laurels in this area, it is likely to find itself after the next election, if not at the bottom of a harbour, certainly on the opposition benches . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Perhaps a subsequent Opposition speaker could move it formally. I merely wanted to give notice of my intention to so move during the second reading debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This matter has been discussed freely for some four or five years. On many occasions the responsible Minister-in fact, it has been around for so long that two Ministers have been responsible for it-predicted that the legislation would be introduced in the next session of Parliament. Finally, last session, it did appear and was passed in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last Parliament I had responsibility for primary industry matters on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. I think I can say accurately that I received more letters on this subject than on all others combined. If I may borrow a cliche, it is a question that has generated much heat and little light.</PARA>
<PARA> The arguments put on both sides in this debate have been unconvincing. On the pro-PVR side it is stated that if plant variety rights conferred upon the producer of new cultivars the right to charge in accordance with what was akin to a patent right, more money would be devoted to plant breeding, with consequential absolute gains. Under some circumstances such an argument could conceivably be correct. It appears, however, that it is unlikely to be correct in Australia. In countries where the agricultural practice is for new seed to be purchased from specialist seed producers each year there is a large volume market and therefore the potential for the producer of new and superior varieties to harvest from the farmers who actually use those varieties a portion of the economic rent accruing to a new and superior variety. However, in Australian agriculture the practice is overwhelmingly that farmers buy seed only once. Therefore, for the producer of a new variety there is no captive market of large volume for either grain or most pasture species. </PARA>
<PARA> The prevailing belief among agricultural scientists is that there is a long term although very slight improvement in yield if the same grain is grown in the same locality generation after generation. So far from there being any economic reason for farmers to change seed-infection with disease and so on aside-there is, although it would be very difficult to calculate and one would need a fine point pencil to do it, an economic advantage is not changing seed until such time as a superior variety may be produced. </PARA>
<PARA> In some minor agricultural industries, particularly vegetables and horticulture , it is the custom for growers to purchase new seed each season, for a variety of both economic and agronomic reasons. So to some extent in the minor agricultural industries there does exist what could be regarded as a captive market for potential seed producers using PVR legislation. However the market is small in volume and therefore unlikely to provide sufficient financial rewards to indue the amount of investment in plant breeding that those who support the principles behind this legislation suggest. I should mention that for broadacre Australian farming, which includes grain growing and pasture production, even when a new variety is produced it is very easy to bulk up large quantities of seed grain or pasture from an initial very small purchase, so that if the producer of a superior variety were to recover from his sales the cost of research, the price of the very limited quantity of seed which he could expect to sell to an individual farmer would be so high that the farmer would be unlikely to make a purchase. In other words, the producers would seem to be facing a catch-22 situation. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been argued, and it used to be argued to me when I had the responsibility for agriculture, that superior plant material has been withheld from Australia because plant variety rights legislation does not exist. With one exception, and despite several requests to produce evidence of such material having been withheld, no proof was offered. The exception was information supplied to me by vegetable growers in the coastal areas of central Queensland, who for the sorts of reasons I mentioned earlier do not keep their own seed generation after generation, that a particular firm producing seed in the west of New South Wales was withholding a superior bean variety until such time as this legislation was passed. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some informed criticism by the opponents of PVR. I will mention more of that later. Unfortunately, the informed criticism has been swamped by ill-informed criticism, the hallmark of which is a collection of fallacies wrapped up in various conspiracy theories usually produced by a species known somewhat scathingly to friends of mine associated with agriculture as Lygon Street farmers. Of course those friends reside in Melbourne; appropriate names for the same species could be devised for other cities. These people are confused in many respects. A major cause of their confusion is their failure to distinguish between plant variety rights and a restricted list. I explained earlier that plant variety rights enable somebody who produces a new cultivar to take out patent rights and to extract a portion of economic rent accruing to a higher yielding variety. A restricted list prohibits the growing of other than a few specified varieties in a region, a region which may be as large as a whole State or country. Australia already has a restrictive list for the wheat industry. It has had for a number of years. Although the production of varieties not on the approved list is not prohibited by law, varieties grown in regions for which they are not approved are acceptable into the bulk handling systems and to the monopoly buyer, the Australian Wheat Board, only at heavy discounts. We could have-indeed, Australia does have-a restricted list for our major arable farming industry without plant variety rights. Conversely, it is quite possible to have plant variety rights without a restricted list. </PARA>
<PARA> The second fallacy proposed by the Lygon Street farmers is that if any plant variety rights legislation were passed all farmers would be forced to buy seeds from the monopolists, who would soon gain control of seed production. That is wrong because most farmers keep their own seed and would be able to continue doing so. They could also keep indefinitely the seed of the varieties they are already growing. A refinement of the multinational conspiracy theory is that these monopolists, who are assumed to be multinationals, I suppose to increase the scare power of the theory, would then devote all their attention to producing hybrid seeds which would germinate or ripen only if they were treated with vast quantities of poisonous chemicals. That was supplemented frequently by allegations that as soon as plant variety rights legislation was passed in the United States of America something like 365 small seed companies were taken over by the said multinationals in the space of about 15 minutes. I have been able to find absolutely no evidence to support that allegation. The real point I want to make is that hybrids either lose their hybrid vigour-that is, their superior yield-in succeeding generations or they produce seed which is sterile. The producer of hybrids is in physical control of the parent stock and is therefore able to extract as large a proportion of the economic rent as he or she feels inclined to try to extract with or without plant variety rights. In other words, plant variety rights are irrelevant to such an argument. </PARA>
<PARA> Such is the quality of the argument which has been advanced by the Lygon Street farmers that they have embarrassed all the informed people who have had valid objections to this legislation and have opposed it. I will deal briefly with some of those valid objections. There is a very real fear-I believe a justifiable fear-that if plant variety rights legislation is passed there will be, particularly under a government such as the present one, a serious decline in funding of the public institutions which have traditionally carried out plant breeding work in Australia. I give one example already of the present Government 's propensity to do that. For more than a year the Australian Wheat Growers Federation has agreed to an increase in the grower research levy on wheat deliveries. Such levies are matched on a dollar-for-dollar basis by Commonwealth money, by taxpayers' funds. Despite such an agreement from the industry and, indeed, a request from the Australian Wheat Growers Federation to the Government that the levy and implicitly the Commonwealth matching grant be increased to finance expanded wheat research, the Government, or the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) at least-it may not have reached the Government-has declined to act, and for the time being the issue has been buried. </PARA>
<PARA> This contrasts starkly with the propensity of Ministers of this Government with agricultural interests to throw away huge amounts of taxpayers' money on wasteful tax rorts and similar areas of expenditure. The amount involved in the proposed increase in wheat research for the Commonwealth is at most something less than $2m. It demonstrates the meanness of this Government when it comes to making public funds available for what is almost certainly worthwhile economic agricultural research. </PARA>
<PARA> The second objection does not necessarily apply to all plant variety rights legislation, but it applies to the type of plant variety rights legislation provided for in this Bill. The only test imposed for the registration of a new variety is that it be genetically distinct or distinctive from varieties already registered and that it have reasonable genetic purity. There is no requirement for performance testing. Given that, two things are likely to happen. Firstly, high pressure publicity, promotion of a new variety, is likely to take precedence over quality. High pressure publicity and promotion will become a substitute for superior quality, and it will encourage the commercial firms which may become involved in the industry to indulge in what some plant breeders call cosmetic breeding-that is, producing strains which are identifiable as being different from other strains but which do not necessarily have any economic advantages. </PARA>
<PARA> Even if there were provision for testing in this legislation prior to registration and release and if a number of institutions became involved in plant breeding, as supporters of the Bill have suggested, the testing procedures would be quite expensive-indeed, at least for the grain industry, so expensive that it seems to me that it would preclude the establishment of a privately funded and based industry. For the reasons I stated earlier, Australian wheat farmers buy seed once only, as a rule-at least until they have discarded the variety. They do not then buy large quantities. They may buy a bag or two bags of a new variety, which can, of course, as anyone who knows anything about wheat growing will know, very quickly be bulked up into very large areas. Indeed, it is possible to pinch a couple of heads and stick them in one's pocket and, provided that one grows it twice in one year in one's garden, it is possible to bulk that up to several thousand acres in matter of a couple of years. So very small quantities will be purchased, and the higher the unit price charged by those who, it is suggested would produce seed grain, obviously the smaller the quantity that would be bought. If, on top of that, it was required that expensive testing be undertaken prior to registration and release, that just seems to remove any possibility that cereal grain seed would be produced in the way in which supporters of the Bill suggest. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, on the question whether plant breeding ought to be concentrated and ought to remain in the public sector, as it is and always has been in Australia, or whether it should be partially or wholly transferred to the private sector, I guess to some extent that it is a matter of ideological preference. It is no secret that the preference in the party that I represent, other things being equal, would be that it remain in the public sector. But apart from ideological preference, there is another good reason for it remaining substantially or entirely in the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the realities of Australian agriculture, and in particular the fact that our broad-acre farming industries seed is purchased once only by farmers, we believe that to the extent that private plant breeding developed at all it would concentrate on cosmetic breeding and high pressure salemanship and promotion as a substitute for quality. In other words, it is likely to be less efficient than the present breeding arrangements within the public sector. I hasten to add that I do not exclude the possibility that they are not as efficient as they could be or that they are without fault. But the very strong probability is that they are more efficient than an alternative source of seed supply within the private sector would be. </PARA>
<PARA> For all those reasons, therefore, the Labor Party has a great number of doubts about this Bill. However, we are not implacably opposed to it. We are willing to listen to further argument. We believe that it is necessary that a proper searching investigation into Australia'a plant breeding needs and deficiencies be conducted, including an examination of the question of all alternatives and the implications of existing plant variety rights matters. Above all, if such legislation is ever to be passed, it must meet Australian agricultural requirements. I move:</PARA>

Like the previous speaker, Senator Walsh, I believe that confusion, odd statements and outright misrepresentations have been features of this matter coming to fruition. Before I go into that, I wish to define how I see plant variety rights-that is, the right to protection of a species and the right to receive a royalty if the variety is believed to have sufficient commercial value to warrant the protection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to realise that the rights will only apply provided the owner of a plant species makes application and pays the appropriate fee. I have been told over and over again that one of the worst features of the legislation is that the rights to every seed in Australia will be owned by some nasty multinational corporation. It must stated first and foremost that a seed can only be registered provided it can demonstrate distinctiveness, uniformity and stability. No plant will be given registration without any of those conditions being met. No registration will be given unless the product concerned is in the ownership of the applicant. Registration cannot cover any existing species. One of the great furphies of all is that it cannot be used to cover any Australian native plant. </PARA>
<PARA> The point which the previous speaker omitted to mention and probably the most important feature of the whole legislation concerns not so much the production of seeds and material in Australia but the advantage of being able to have what is available in other parts of the world. Many species of plants are not available in Australia. Senator Walsh said that he had raised this matter and, apart from one variety of beans, he had not been given any information of what was not available. For that purpose I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two schedules of varieties unavailable in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>RESTRICTION OF ACCESS TO OVERSEAS VARIETIES</PARA>
<PARA> One of the major reasons for establishing a PVR Scheme in Australia is to enable Australian farmers and gardeners to have greater access to improved varieties developed overseas (see DPI Information Paper page 6). Owners of many of these varieties refuse to release them here because of the lack of protection in this country. While some varieties which have been under protection for some time or which have lost popularity in their country of origin can be obtained, popular new varieties are generally unavailable. </PARA>
<PARA> Although PVR Schemes require that new varieties be unconditionally available for scientific purposes, the law applies only in the country where the variety is registered. There is no obligation on a breeder to release material for research to other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Information supplied to the Department of Primary Industry from various sources provides many examples where requests for overseas varieties have been refused because of the absence of PVR in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Grape</PARA>
<PARA>The NSW Department of Agriculture has been refused supply of six varieties from USA. They are ''Carmelion'' ''Centurion'', ''Carmine'', ''GM 323/58'', ''GM 7166 /10'' and ''GM 7166/13''. </PARA>
<PARA> The CSIRO Division of Horticultural Research has been unable to obtain new varieties from Germany and USA. In Germany requests were refused by the Frieburg University (four varieties), the Federal German Vine Breeding Institute and the Alzey Vine Breeding Institute. In USA requests were refused by the University of California. </PARA>
<PARA>Nectarine</PARA>
<PARA>The Linmer Nursery, Canowindra, NSW, has been denied supply of seven varieties from the Don Wilson Nurseries, Modesta, California. They are ''Early Sunground'' , ''Royal Delight'', ''Summer Beauty'', ''Flavour Top'', ''Firebrite'', '' Fairlane'' and ''Royal Giant''. They are claimed to be the top selling varieties grown in California during the past three years. </PARA>
<PARA> Flemmings Nurseries, Monbulk, Victoria, was refused supply of the varieties '' Autumn Grand'' and ''May Grand'' by the Reedley Nursery Inc. Reedley, California . </PARA>
<PARA> A yellow fleshed nectarine which has been very popular on the Sydney and Melbourne markets is a protected American variety called ''Fantasia'' which was introduced into New Zealand under licence shortly after the enactment of PVR legislation in the mid 1970's. The fruit available in Australia has been imported from New Zealand and has been selling on the Sydney market at a considerable premium. </PARA>
<PARA>Peach</PARA>
<PARA>The Linmer Nursery of Canowindra NSW has been denied supply of four varieties from the Don Wilson Nurseries, Modesta, California. They are ''O'Henry'', '' Flavour Cresp'', ''Flame Cresp'' and ''Fairtime''. </PARA>
<PARA> Flemmings Nurseries, Monbulk, Victoria was refused supply of the varieties ''O' Henry'', ''Autumn Gem'' and ''Carnival'' by the Grant Merrill Orchards Inc. Red Bluff, California. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Department of Agriculture was refused supply of several varieties by the University of California. </PARA>
<PARA>Cherry</PARA>
<PARA>The NSW Department of Agriculture has been denied supply of the varieties ''John Innes'' and ''Colt'' (rootstock) from USA. </PARA>
<PARA> The Linmer Nursery of Canowindra NSW has been denied supply of the variety '' Star Crimson'' from the Don Wilson Nurseries Modesta, California. It is a particularly valuable self-pollinating semi-dwarf variety. </PARA>
<PARA>Plum</PARA>
<PARA>The NSW Department of Agriculture has been refused supply of three varieties from USA. They are ''El Dorado'' ''Pixy'' (rootstock) and Lembrum''. </PARA>
<PARA> The Linmer Nursery, Canowindra, NSW has been refused supply of the variety '' Friar'' from the Don Wilson Nurseries, Modesta, California. </PARA>
<PARA>Rootstock</PARA>
<PARA>The Linmer Nursery, Canowindra, NSW, has been refused supply of a ''superb'' rootstock (4G816) for stone fruits by a private breeder of Stockton, California.</PARA>
<PARA>Tree Fruits in General</PARA>
<PARA>The Montague Orchard, Narrewarren, Victoria, has made enquiries to the Carlton, Hill Top and Columbia Basin Nurseries in Washington U.S.A. for a range of desirable new varieties but received a negative response. </PARA>
<PARA>Ornamental Plants</PARA>
<PARA>Oates Nurseries, Victoria, has been advised by Nicholsons Nursery, Ohio, and Lyndon Lyons, California, that they are prepared to negotiate the release of varieties of African Violet, Poinsettia, Begonia and Miniature Roses that are approximately ten years old. They will not consider the release of any new varieties. </PARA>
<PARA>Pome Fruits</PARA>
<PARA>The NSW Department of Agriculture has been denied supply of budwood of apple varieties from the USA. They are ''Prime Gold'' from Prime Gold Nurseries, Zilla , Washington State, ''Prime Red'', ''Jonee'' and ''Paulared'' from Hilltop Nurseries, Michigan, ''Oregon Red Spur'' from the IR-2 Repository, Prosser, Washington. Other varieties refused to the Department are ''Red Chief'', '' Sturdy Spur'', ''Sharp Delicious'', ''Valmer Red Jonathon'', ''Criterion'', and ''Early Golden Hawaii''. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Department of Primary Industries was refused supply of the variety ''Priscilla'' from the Purdue Research Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Department of Agriculture (Knoxfield Horticultural Research Station) was refused supply of a valuable genetic dwarf root stock for apples by Stark Bros Nurseries and Orchards Co., Louisiana, Missouri. The same Department was refused supply of several commercial apple varieties by the New York State Experiment Station. </PARA>
<PARA>Rapeseed</PARA>
<PARA>The NSW Department of Agriculture obtained supply of a valuable disease resistant variety called ''Primor'' from France only after considerable difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA>Beans</PARA>
<PARA>A breeder from Yates Seeds Limited was refused supply of five bean varieties from the Asgrow Seed Company USA for trial in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Tasmanian Department of Agriculture has been refused supply of the very desirable processing bean variety, ''Jubilee'', from Rogers Bros Seed Co., USA. The Northrup King Seed Co. has also refused to supply eight varieties of green beans. </PARA>
<PARA>Peas</PARA>
<PARA>The NSW Department of Agriculture has been refused supply of five varieties from USA. They are ''Lotus'', ''Spring'', ''Rigo'', ''Tristar'' and ''Trifect''. </PARA>
<PARA>Perennial Rye Grass</PARA>
<PARA>The CSIRO Division of Plant Industry has been refused varieties of perennial rye grass from Aberystwyth, UK on the basis that the Division could not guarantee that the varieties would not be grown commercially. </PARA>
<PARA>Multiplication of northern hemisphere crop and pasture seed</PARA>
<PARA>According to a submission made by the Australian Seed Producers' Federation to the Standing Committee on Agriculture, establishment of a PVR Scheme in Australia would result in a significant increase in the number of overseas varieties which could be multiplied, under contract, for re-export (known as bulking-up). Owners of protected varieties in northern hemisphere countries are unwilling to arrange for their bulking-up in Australia because of the lack of protection here. New Zealand's recent experience of expanded trade in this field gives credence to the Federation's claim. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest in a bulking-up trade in Australia has been indicated by the USA ( Northrup King Co.) regarding peas, beans, onions, carrots, lettuce, lucernes, and by the EEC regarding recreational grasses, lucernes, clovers, onions, carrots, cabbage, cauliflower and radish. The European seed companies involved are The National Seed Development Organisation and Cundys of UK and Pederson and L. G. Nungesser (Continental). With PVR, the Australian Seed Producers' Federation claims the value of the potential business would be approximately $10 million per annum compared with a current value of approximately $1 million. </PARA>
<PARA>Appendix 2-RESTRICTIONS OF ACCESS TO FOREIGN VARIETIES</PARA>
<PARA>Tasmanian growers and the Department of Agriculture have had the following difficulties arise with the attempted imports of authentic material of new varieties from overseas breeders. </PARA>
<PARA>SWEET CORN</PARA>
<PARA>A representative of the company owning the desirable sweet corn variety Jubilee indicated that it would be unavailable until Australia had PVR. </PARA>
<PARA>GREEN BEANS</PARA>
<PARA>Eight protected varieties from the USA were not available for testing by the Department, due to the policy of the Sandoz Group of Companies of not releasing patented varieties to countries without PVR. </PARA>
<PARA>NECTARINES</PARA>
<PARA>A former Chief Horticulturist was refused budwood of several improved nectarine varieties by Stark Bros. (USA) despite a close personal friendship with Paul Stark. Starks, who are one of the world's biggest fruit nursery enterprises and includes extensive breeding programmes, made it plain that Australia is out of consideration for receiving new varieties from them unless it introduces a suitable PVR scheme. Similar comments were made to an Extension Officer with horticultural interests, when visiting the same firm in the USA. </PARA>
<PARA>GRAPES</PARA>
<PARA>Newly bred German cool climate grapes cannot be obtained because consideration of European plant variety schemes prohibits their release to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>CHERRY ROOTSTOCK</PARA>
<PARA>The dwarf cherry rootstock 'Colt' has been sought by a grower of Flowerpot, Tasmania but he has been refused propagating material. </PARA>
<PARA>STRAWBERRIES</PARA>
<PARA>A commercial nursery of Flowerpot, Tasmania, approached the University of California for a range of new day-neutral strawberry varieties. The local industry believes that there is a large local, interstate and overseas market for strawberries produced in late December and January. One grower, presently visiting the USA and UK, had discussions with an importer in large city of the USA who said that he was prepared to take up to 3 tonnes of raspberries and strawberries per day during their winter. Because of the short comings of the strawberry and raspberry varieties presently being grown in Tasmania we could not hope to cash in on this offer for at least 5 to 10 years. We have evidence that suggests the types of strawberries requested from California could produce well in this period, with top quality fruit. The request was refused, but the varieties were offered to the Department of Agriculture for scientific trial purposes only. </PARA>
<PARA>APPLES</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Agriculture has several apple varieties (eg. Malling Kent and Malling Suntan) worthy of commercial trial but this step in the testing and development programme is impossible because of undertakings with the NSDO to carry out scientific testing only. The work has been done in anticipation of PVR legislation being passed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Agriculture has been denied access to the best Virus-tested apple selections from the leading U.S. holding centre at Prosser, Washington State, because they can only do so with the permission of the patent holders. Mr R. B. Walker attempted to get such releases for the Department personally in 1980 when he visited the U.S. but had no success. </PARA>
<PARA>BLACKCURRANTS</PARA>
<PARA>A commercial blackcurrant grower from Glen Huon, Tasmania made a personal visit to NSDO to try to obtain the blackcurrant varieties Ben Lomond, Ben Nevis and Ben More. He was refused all three, but they were released to the Tasmanian Department of Agriculture on condition that they were not to be grown commercially. All three varieties are very high yielding and would be of great value in cutting costs in an industry already facing substantial falls in the real price of its product. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been some suggestions that since State Departments of Agriculture have been able to obtain many new patented varieties from overseas for research purposes (the testing of varieties against older varieties), these varieties must be generally available. </PARA>
<PARA> With a number of new varieties, State Departments have been able to get propagation material of patented varieties, but such introductions are generally subject to an undertaking not to release the variety commercially. Examples are strawberries, apples and blackcurrants cited above. It is the Industry that is denied the improved material, not the scientists and/or would be importers who want to look at the variety. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IE4">Senator ARCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The schedules include varieties of sweet corn and green beans. It is absolutely imperative for Tasmania to have these if we are to build up our agricultural pursuits in the vegetable area. The lists contain several varieties of fruit such as nectarines, cool climate grapes, strawberries, apples and blackcurrants. All those products are very important to Tasmania. At present they are not available. The list was compiled on an Australia-wide basis. I have seen some of these varieties of products. I have been to some of the places where they are growing. I can certainly confirm that they are not available to us at the present time. I repeat that by and large it is more important that we should have access to those varieties at the moment than to try to produce new varieties in place. We need to remember that there is absolutely no limitation on people growing whatever seeds they like. It does not matter whether they are new seeds or old seeds. People may sell them however they like, where they like and for whatever they can get for them. This is the position under the present scheme and it is not changed one iota under the plant variety rights legislation .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I too have received considerable correspondence. I have answered in detail well over 300 letters. I too have never had so much correspondence on any subject as I have had on plant variety rights. I have followed very closely the various matters that have been raised in those letters. Whenever any specific allegation has been made I have written back and said 'I am interested in plant variety rights. I appreciate the point you have put. Will you please submit the source of your information? Will you please supply me with the evidence that you have to back it up?'. I have never received a reply to one of those letters. Not once has anybody tried to support some of the wilder claims that have been made. Never once have I had one piece of evidence that would support them. </PARA>
<PARA> The plant variety rights business started about 52 years ago. As of now approximately 22 countries, most of which are fairly major countries, have plant variety rights schemes. At the moment five countries are in much the same position as we are here-that is, they are on the verge of moving into plant variety rights. There is a need for urgency. There are many holdups in our agriculture which plant variety rights would assist. Australia needs the new development. We need the new industries that go with it. We especially need the new varieties of plants. At the moment we are prevented from achieving this by the lack of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have done a little plant breeding. I know what it takes in the way of time and understanding. I know the very poor ratio of good plants to bad plants that anybody is likely to get. In the areas in which I was interested I fully appreciate that there would be no likelihood of registering the sorts of plants that most people grow for decorative purposes, purely and simply because the cost involved would not justify the time needed to be taken. The proportion of seeds that is ever likely to be registered will always be very small. Recently I went to the UK to have a look at the work that is being done. I went to four research stations in England. I met many of the breeders and talked to the people involved. I was informed that in 1964 there were 10 breeders registered in England and that now there are 23. The amount of money going into plant breeding has increased by 500 per cent in five years. Of course, the results match the expenditure. While I was there I looked at wheat, barley and various other products. I was interested to find that the main variety of barley which is grown in Australia-a variety called Proctor-has been superseded in England for between 15 and 20 years. We still use Proctor as the No. 1 Australian barley . That indicates how far out of date we are already. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a lot of talk about the increase which has occurred in cropping in England. People with whom I have spoken have said that it is ridiculous to claim that plant variety rights have resulted in an increased crop, that is due to better insecticides and so on. The scientists who are involved say that the wheat yield has increased by 94 per cent since plant variety rights were introduced. Of this, they attribute 56 per cent as being due to the new varieties. There is not one variety of wheat in common usage in England now which is more than seven years old. For barley the growth rate has increased by 67 per cent since plant variety rights came in, 32 per cent of which is assessed as being due to plant improvement. The lack of legislation in relation to fruit varieties, pasture varieties, and vegetables in particular is holding Australia back. We need to get access to these new varieties. In fact, we are falling behind in some of these areas, and we are falling behind for two reasons. Firstly, we do not pay for what is available. Other people have it; they are prepared to sell it. We are not prepared to pay so we do not get it, and we do not give them the protection that goes with that. Secondly, we provide no protection for our local people; and so in most cases they do not see why this is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to quote one particular case. In Tasmania, one of the major primary industry crops is poppies. The poppy we grow in Tasmania is a species that has been totally developed by Glaxo Australia Pty Ltd. It is nothing like the poppy the company started with 20 years ago. This has been achieved by years and years of very expensive cultivation, to the stage where it is now an absolutely outstanding example of what can be done by breeding. Yet in that case the company has no protection at all. The one company that is in total competition with Glaxo owes it nothing for the many years of research that went into producing that item. </PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania has a great capacity to extend in primary industry. It has an ideal climate for a wide variety of plants. It has a wide variety of conditions and has a natural quarantine factor, which is a great help in the development of livestock and agriculture. The Tasmanian Government wants plant variety rights, as do the Department of Primary Industry, the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association, and the processors. To the best of my knowledge, there is absolutely no one in Tasmania associated with agriculture in any meaningful way and representative of any reasonable group who has brought any objection to me. </PARA>
<PARA> On the Australian scene, we are now in the position of having received approval for plant variety rights from every State and Territory but one. We have received the approval of all national rural organisations, including the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Wheat Growers Federation, the Australian United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, the Australian Seed Producers Federation, the Australian Nurserymen's Association Ltd, and the Australian Seed Industry Association. </PARA>
<PARA> One area in regard to plant variety rights that has always worried me quite a lot is the matter of quarantine. While we do not have plant variety rights, we run a grave risk that material that is stolen or brought overseas and smuggled through Customs could have very serious effects in Australia if it fails to go through the normal checks that are applicable to material that is brought in legally. The lack of legislation unquestionably creates smuggling, and its existence would make smuggling unnecessary. I believe this is terribly important , and I think it is one of the areas to which we need to apply ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the points quite often raised with me is the matter of cost. I could not enumerate the bogies I have heard about cost and the fact that we could expect the price of seeds to rise two or three times. I think it needs to be said that nobody will pay unless they believe they are getting something for their money. They will not pay enormous amounts of money for nothing. I accept Senator Walsh' s point of view about promotion, but I do not think people will get caught or pay out large amounts of money without ensuring that they get something for it. People will pay only for what they believe is value. The price will be regulated by the result. Certainly I would be happy to pay more for a better variety. If we really need a better variety, we need one which will suit our particular requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose it is all tied in with the question of merit. Merit, I think, is a concept of no value whatsoever. Merit to me and merit to somebody else may be entirely different. If I need something for a particular purpose, I might have an entirely different set of criteria. For instance, in England I saw growing several varieties of raspberries that I wished we had in Australia. Some of these raspberries were growing seven feet to eight feet tall and were ideal for mechanical harvesting. While I was at one of these research establishments, the head of a jelly company arrived. His company manufactured fresh fruit jelly. He was particularly interested in seeking a variety of raspberry with an excessively high proportion of juice which could be harvested mechanically. Varieties of that type were available, but the establishment was also growing varieties of exactly the opposite type, shorter in height, firmer in fruit, to be used for a different purpose altogether. Whether the fruits were to be used for jam or jelly or for the fresh fruit market, this establishment was producing several entirely different sorts of raspberries. I venture to suggest that the merit involved would be determined by the person who wished to buy them according to the particular purpose for which they were required. </PARA>
<PARA> I also visited another establishment where wheat trials were being carried out. There were 46 different varieties of new wheats in a row, but the particular item being tested was not the grain at all. The grain was virtually the same in every case and basically the yield was very similar. The establishment was trying to determine different straws and different amounts of flag to be used in areas where there might be a wind problem, where there might be stones and there was a need to cut further up from the ground, where by getting close to the ground they might have induced extra rust, or problems of that sort. Merit is something that the purchaser alone can determine. There is no way in which we can include in legislation the sorts of items that Senator Walsh had in mind. We cannot say that we do not like a variety that grows seven feet tall, that we prefer a variety that grows six feet tall, or something of that sort. I believe it is a matter that the marketplace in Australia will determine, in exactly the same way as it has determined it in every other country which now has plant variety rights. I am unable to find any country where merit is regarded as being necessary to provide details for this range of climatic and other conditions. It does come down to the national lists. I think the biggest single confusion I have found is in the difference between a national list and plant variety rights . The two things are totally different and the reasons for them are totally different. I am pleased to say that at this stage we are having nothing to do with a national list. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I should like now to take up one or two of the points I have gathered from correspondence. When I found that many of the questions were obviously being circulated by people or groups I decided, in view of the fact that the people who were writing to me could not give me the information I was asking them for, to put three questions on notice in the Senate. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard copies of Questions Nos 2309, 2310 and 2311 of 6 May 1982 .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The questions read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Archer asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry upon notice on 6 May 1982:</PARA>
<PARA> What evidence is there that a section of plant breeders may promote varieties needing abnormal support from fertilizers and chemicals?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney: The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I have seen no such evidence and I do not believe any exists. </PARA>
<PARA> From time to time the assertion has been made that once PVR is introduced breeders will breed plants which will require abnormally high quantities of fertilizers or chemicals, or require specific chemicals available only through the same plant breeding company. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt in my mind that in their breeding programs, breeders will place a high priority on resistance to disease and insect pests. To deliberately adopt the opposite course would be commercially foolish. No company is going to waste time (and breeding is a very costly process) in developing varieties which are less resistant to diseases or insects than varieties already available to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> No farmers or gardeners are going to buy varieties which require more fertilizer, or special inputs, unless it pays them to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Archer asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry upon notice on 6 May 1982:</PARA>
<PARA> Are the Plant Diversity Protection Committee's claims that there are thirteen ways of avoiding PVR correct?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney: The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The possibilities proposed by the Plant Diversity Protection Committee for avoiding PVR are extremely limited in providing rewards or protection for plant breeders. None of the aternatives suggested provide the comprehensive protection which will be provided by the PVR Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The various non-statutory provisions proposed by the Committee, such as the use of hybrids specialised production techniques and other commercial arrangements give plant breeders a limited advantage only. Most of these arangements are already in use today. Clearly they do not meet industry needs, otherwise they would be no demand for a PVR Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, the proposed statutory provisions, such as the use of trademarks, resort to common law and inventor's certificates, are limited in effect and do not provide the comprehensive protection which would be available under PVR. </PARA>
<PARA> PVR is the only system which will legally protect the proprietary rights of breeders to new varieties they have developed, and which will also enable Australia to gain commercial access to varieties protected overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Archer asked the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry upon notice on 6 May 1982:</PARA>
<PARA> What levels of royalties and other charges are being made in other countries where PVR is in operation?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney: The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable Senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> A plant variety right gives the holder control over the sale of plants and reproductive material of that variety. It also entitles him to license others to sell plants and reproductive material of that variety. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I am aware, this is the basis of the right in all countries where Plant Variety Rights (PVR) schemes exist. It is a matter for the holder of the right to make a commercial judgment as to the premium that he considers the market is prepared to pay because it considers his variety superior to other varieties. </PARA>
<PARA> The royalties, or premiums, being made in various countries at any particular time are a function of the market forces existing at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to remember that farmers and gardeners will also make judgments about the seeds and plants they are purchasing and it is highly unlikely that a premium will be paid for a variety if that variety cannot return the investment.</PARA>
<PARA> The question referred to 'other charges'. In PVR schemes in other countries there are specific charges related to the granting and maintenance of the right. The level of fees varies from country to country but generally amount to something under $1,000 per variety registered. </PARA>
<PARA> In the USA, for example, the fees are $US250 application, $US250 search and a further $US250 when the certificate is issued. That is, a total of $US750. </PARA>
<PARA> In New Zealand and the United Kingdom there are different levels of fees for different categories of species. In New Zealand, for example, fees for agricultural crops and vegetables amount to a total of $NZ750 and the annual renewal fee is $NZ50. </PARA>
<PARA> In the United Kingdom the application fee for cereals and potatoes, for example is #220. In addition, a test fee in the first year of #385 (slightly less in subsequent years) is charged and an annual renewal fee of #165 in the second year (increasing in subsequent years) is charged. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IE4">Senator ARCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I say, the purpose of those questions was to get information that the people who were asking me about plant variety rights could not give and to check upon assertions that they were making, assertions which they lacked the information to back up. The first question was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What evidence is there that a section of plant breeders may promote varieties needing abnormal support from fertilizers and chemicals?</PARA>
<PARA>The second was:</PARA>
<PARA> Are the Plant Diversity Protection Committee's claims that there are thirteen ways of avoiding PVR correct?</PARA>
<PARA>And the third was:</PARA>
<PARA> What levels of royalties and other charges are being made in other countries where PVR is in operation?</PARA>
<PARA>The answers to those questions will, of course, appear in Hansard so I will not bother to repeat them now. But for those who raised the matters with me and who were unable to provide me with the information, I commend those answers to them and hope they are able to read them and understand the situation a bit better. I hope that those who propose to hold up the legislation appreciate the difficulties and the problems they are creating in the agricultural areas. Every year we lose, we become yet another year behind, naturally. I think to hold this legislation up now is valid, providing the aims are to stifle incentive, to direct private ownership overseas and to retard Australian production! But if that is not the case, I see no valid reason for holding up the legislation at this stage. Australia has such a variety of soils, climates and natural quarantine that it is an ideal place for us to get into plant development on a reasonable scale. We have done a lot of it in the past but we need more now to be able to enter competitively in the world where this is now the main operation . I think it appropriate that I include, for the sake of the record, the names of the countries that currently have plant variety legislation and the group of five that are in the same position as ourselves. I seek leave to incorporate that list in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The list read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>PLANT VARIETY RIGHTS</PARA>
<PARA> While PVR is a new area of legislation in Australia, similar types of schemes are currently operating in-U.S.A., the U.K., New Zealand, South Africa, Japan, Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Holland, Poland, Romania, U.S.S.R., Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and West Germany. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Walsh in that I do not think the multinationals are dominating the seed industry in places such as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Poland, Israel and the likes of those. I do not see them as being the hotbeds of multinational profiteering. To think that it would be any different here or there is certainly incorrect. I saw a letter in, I think, the National Farmer which said it would be illegal to grow non-approved varieties. Again, this is absolute rubbish, and I think that needs to be said. The assertion that it is unfair to the Third World and that we are grinding the Filipinos to death-which is what somebody told me-again is absolute nonsense. If the First, Second or Third World countries can see that there is some advantage in using better varieties and in having better research, they will do so. If they find it will cost them more to achieve nothing, they certainly will not do so. I do not see them as being any different from anybody else in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come to the monopoly question whereby it is alleged that people will get these varieties and hold on to them tightly. The Bill provides that reasonable quantities at reasonable prices must be provided if there is a demand for them. I have no doubt that the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances would be able to establish what reasonable quantities and reasonable amounts would be. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to comment on a couple of matters that worry Senator Walsh. I do not see that the level of government funding is a point at all. So far as plant variety rights, and the legislation that goes with it are concerned, government funding will be provided, as it is for every other area, whether it be education , defence or whatever, depending on the overall budgetary situation. Whether the present Government is doing this or whether the Opposition if in government were to do it, there is no way that the situation would be any different. What I do say is that anybody who is governing the country will at all times endeavour to see that the money that is provided will achieve the greatest possible result. I believe there are plenty of ways in which the Government can be involved, which may not entail it operating the whole system on its own. In the United Kingdom I saw the system that I would certainly recommend here. The Government research stations over there produce a variety of items. I noticed, for instance, the Cambridge strawberries, which are marvellous and which I would like to have here . When the Cambridge research station produces those strawberries and gets them to the marketable stage, it calls tenders for the merchandising of them. The producer of the variety, as the Government, does not get into the commerce area, but passes it off to where it is dealt with by people who are in that business. It is a happy relationship. I think there are all sorts of ways in which if the effort needs to be increased it can be done by perhaps tax incentives, bonuses, joint ventures or whatever. I see no way that it can be claimed and proved that because of plant variety rights legislation the amount of money used by the Government in research would be lowered. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh's other point is one that I cannot argue with. We on this side of the chamber do not believe that private ownership is bad. We do not believe that private ownership is to be avoided. It may even be that we believe a little bit the other way, that public ownership is not to be engaged in unless the private sector is unable to cope adequately with it. I believe we could get an increase in government funding if the system were better. I repeat that it is absolutely imperative that we have access to the varieties overseas. I repeat that it is important that we utilise all the resources there are in Australia, that we encourage Australians to get into this area to the best of their ability and that we try to sell to the other people. There are enormous demands from overseas for things like grass seeds. We could produce millions and millions of dollars worth of grass seeds and sell them overseas if we had this sort of legislation. I ask the Opposition to reconsider this question of deferring the Bill. It is part of government business. We would like to get the legislation going. We want to ensure that the people of Australia get the advantage of it as quickly as they can. I support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Plant Variety Rights Bill 1982 has indeed been, as Senator Walsh and Senator Archer have indicated, the basis of some massive misrepresentations. However, unlike Senator Archer I do not limit those misrepresentations to one side of the debate. In fact both sides of the debate have been fairly prominent in attempting, as they go through this legislation, to misrepresent the arguments which are being presented and to paint yet again in this country a black and white picture of anything which we try to debate seriously. I presume that one eventually becomes accepting of this type of situation. Nevertheless it is galling that an area which is complex, difficult and important should yet again be painted into a black and white context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party has moved an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill to send this Bill to a committee, and the Australian Democrats will be supporting that amendment. I wish to speak on the basis of why we would support such an amendment. I believe that if we wish the matter to be referred to a committee we should not at this stage rehearse our arguments and propositions for and against but rather we should outline why we are objecting to the Bill and why we believe that a committee investigation of the Bill would be of use to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, in this debate we have had an omnibus approach to primary industry. To many people the words 'primary industry' mean only one thing. Primary industry is thought of as a unitary operation. Nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, in terms of market organisation in this country the wheat industry is as distinct from the cherry industry as it is from the car industry. Senator Archer unfortunately did not allude to the intricacies of the marketing operations of the various items he was discussing. One could very well point out, for example, that while it is not unlawful to grow certain varieties of wheat it certainly is unlawful to sell them. Why anybody would want to grow wheat he could not sell I have no idea. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the effects of this legislation must be considered in relation to the overall economy. It is in this area that I am extremely critical of the Government. This legislature is being treated yet again by the Executive to a botched up job in terms of argumentation and is being asked to pass a piece of legislation without being supplied with information. The Executive somehow considers that by remaining silent for a year it has effectively stimulated public debate. Goodness knows why it should consider that, but it does. Not only that, but the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) has castigated the States for not doing more in terms of public debate when indeed the legislation is before this House. This House and this Government have a responsibility to promote public debate, and that does not mean remaining silent for a year. It means providing information to the members of the public so that they can talk about it, so that they can be informed about it and so that there can be lively, detailed and informed debate within the community. That has not occurred. This Government sees absolutely no necessity to give this legislature information upon which it may make a decision whether to pass this piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I allude to one consideration which I believe is most important-that is, the effect of plant variety rights legislation on the economy. I would like to know what the Government has done about projecting the effects of PVR legislation on our rural industry. I assume that if the Government has been doing its work correctly detailed information would have been available and the Government would have been able to produce some of the things to which Senator Archer referred; that is, the estimated cost rises and availability of seed, the flow- on results in terms of food costs and the like. Such effects may be minimal or non-existent. However, I believe, and I presume Senator Archer would agree, that this information should be produced by the Government and its Department for public consumption and, if not for public consumption, certainly for consumption of this chamber. Therefore, I would like information on the projections that the Government has made in this area. If those projections are not forthcoming, I believe one would be compelled to take a much more cynical attitude and suggest that the reason they have not been circulated is that they do not exist and that the Government is indulging yet again in a range of arm waving assertions on the basis that the Minister for Primary Industry resides in the House of Representatives and feels absolutely no pressure upon him to engage in any detailed informed debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The arguments that have been put are in fact detailed. I do not intend to allude to the whole range of arguments raised by Senator Archer. I presume they were raised because they were contained in the 300 letters he has had to answer. The straw people whom the honourable senator stood up and knocked down are indeed just that-straw. Such argument need not detain us. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to one matter which the honourable senator raised and the very simplistic line of attempting to make comparisons between ourselves and overseas . On the receipt of information in respect of a detailed area one of the first things one has to be very careful about is making comparisons between ourselves and overseas operations, particularly in the primary industry area and particularly if one does not also take into account a whole range of factors which may influence the final result, which may have a bearing on the final result and which indeed may have a larger bearing on the final result than the particular item to which one is dedicated and wishes to push. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Archer talked about a burst of improvements in the United Kingdom in the last decade due to the release of semi-dwarf varieties of wheat. The facts of the matter are that the International Wheat and Maize Improvements Centre in Mexico was the main cause of those improvements. We did not experience an enormous boost, despite the fact that the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Centre came by all the vastly improved varieties released in the United Kingdom as a result of work which had been done in Australia by Australians. In other words, through that international centre, the United Kingdom gained improved varieties of wheat for which we received no royalties. However I must point out that I think the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation deserves some praise. We have sought to diversify to other countries the types of advances that we make in this country. I believe that is a perfectly laudable objective. The world in general ought to look at maximising the resources that are available from our rural products. I believe that the results of our work should be made as freely available as possible to other countries. We have done that. Australia should take credit for that. As a country we have been a major contributor to the centre and a major reason for its success. We are a major contributor in that regard to the success of wheat crops around the world. If Australia's contribution is not acknowledged all the facts are not being put on the table.</PARA>
<PARA> People who have looked at the situation in the United Kingdom, as presumably Senator Archer did when he visited that country recently, know that that country has a system of very high inputs in its farming operation. Indeed, reliable estimates put inputs at around the $200 mark per acre. The United Kingdom can operate under that type of high input farming. However, Australia has not done so in the past, it is not doing so at present and in terms of the economics of most of the broadacre crops it is hardly likely to do so in the future. A lack of statistics in this country does not enable us to make firm estimates of the cost per acre but certainly the guesstimates that have been made by reliable people with whom I have had contact put it nowhere near the $200 mark. If that is the case, we are comparing unlike items and any comparison of unlike items must necessarily fall down. We have to get our base level and argue on that level. Without doing that we are talking nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting in this regard, as I have already done, that the Australian Wheat Board strictly controls our operations and does not in fact allow the types of free ranging operations that seemed to be the basis of Senator Archer's remarks. That is for a very good reason. We wish to maintain a steady marketing operation. I believe the Government also supports this objective through the Federal Council of the Liberal Party did exactly the opposite-but I believe it is hastening to rectify its mistakes in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA> Something particularly important in my home State of Queensland is the comparison that must be made in terms of how we go about the operation of storing our seed, again particularly for broadacre crops. In the United Kingdom, the example used by Senator Archer, it is known that about 90 per cent of seed is not stored but is bought from seed merchants. That is due to climatic and economic conditions and partly to historical reasons. In Australia the average figure-I exclude Queensland because a different situation applies-is about 4 per cent. In other words, most farmers store their own seed and sow their own seed. Queensland is different because it has a much more highly developed operation in relation to seed programs and I will come to that in a moment. I also think that it would have been far better for the Commonwealth to look at what is done in Queensland than to press ahead with this legislation, particularly in relation to wheat. The reason for that is that Australia is by no means a unitary country when it comes to primary production. There is an enormous variety of soil and climatic conditions in this country which make invalid comparisons with other countries which have plant variety rights. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is very difficult, possibly even impossible, for a commercial enterprise to look at profitable operations in relation to these varieties. A commercial enterprise probably would not attempt to do so. For that reason I believe that in Australia, whether this Bill is passed or not, we will rely in large measure on our public institutions to provide the basis of varieties to cope with the soil and climatic conditions. I refer to Queensland which in fact has localised comparative field trials. They have been operating for quite some time. I believe that these trials are absolutely essential. I believe they must continue whether this Bill is passed or not. Not only that, the Commonwealth Government also needs to come in behind that type of operation in a much better and more comprehensive way than it has done in the past, particularly in terms of funding. Only by means of comparative field trials within specified local areas will farmers be fairly confident that the type of seed they are getting will be of benefit to them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible, in a large variety of primary industries, to take a punt in relation to the plant or seed variety that one wishes to use. One needs firmly based detailed information. I believe that this particular aspect is of concern, particularly to the small farmer. It has been put, of course, that all the major rural lobby groups support this legislation. I agree with that. That certainly does seem to be the case. If that is the case, one might then go on to argue: Why should we save people from themselves? Our concern is not only for those large groups but also for the small farmer. I believe that the smaller farmers need, and must have guarantees of, protection so that when they actually do use new seed varieties they do so not simply on the basis that it is a commercial proposition, that someone has advertised or put out a prospectus on that particular seed. They rely more heavily, certainly in my State, upon the comparative field trials which are conducted under State auspices. By looking at the results of those trials, in terms of soil quality, climatic conditions and the rainfall that occurred during a specified period, they can feel confident about the commercial judgments they make and what they do with their production. They are not capable of making those estimates if inadequate material is available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not decrying the ability of farmers to make those types of choices as some people have suggested. It has nothing to do with that at all. Flourishing in this country, whether those people who are opposed to this recognise it or not, is a fairly massive media industry which, presumably, rests upon the fact that it can sell a product on a fairly inadequate, often contradictory or irrelevant bases. I do not presume that farmers are any more immune to the operation of that fairly high powered industry than anybody else in this community. The reaction of the farmers to whom I have spoken, the people who actually have to get out and earn a living, is this: 'I do not care what you do with the plant variety rights legislation. It is of no benefit to me. It is of no interest to me. But I want those materials. I need to know what that seed will do. I do not care where it comes from so long as the Government can vouch that it is true.'. In other words, they are not going to trust a commercial operation. They want the Department of Primary Industry or the relevant government department to give and to back up those types of assertions. That is what the small farmer wants. That is what the person who has to earn his living wants. When he makes a punt on his seed he has got to see that crop come to fruition. That is what that person wants. The other stuff really does not concern him much at all. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the type of thing to which a Senate inquiry should direct its attention . It should investigate what types of guarantees ought to be given to farmers who have to make a living out of this type of operation, quite apart from the aspect of the protection of the seed companies or whatever. It is the farmer who has to make a living who wants to be assured of the quality of the seed. I believe that we should not push them out on their own and say that the Government washes its hands of the whole operation. I do not believe that State governments would do that but I believe also that it is a matter for the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to allude briefly to a range of other matters. I refer to the fact that the Commonwealth obviously, in terms of the third amendment moved in the House of Representatives, sees this as part of a patent law. I think it is interesting timing that the Government should send a reference to the Industrial Property Advisory Committee to look at the patenting operation while it is changing the law under this particular legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other types of objections to this legislation. One matter which I believe is important in terms of plant breeding and has come to light in quite recent operations, indeed only this year, concerns genetic engineering. Enormous advances are being made in that area. I raise this matter because of the legal implications that I can see arising. Some legal implications have already arisen . I allude particularly to cases being dealt with in the United States Supreme Court concerning genetic engineering and factors associated with it. A peripheral case in relation to this-it had some rather interesting implications- was raised in the Irish High Court. The Government has not yet, certainly in anything that I have read, given a detailed response. I would not support a second reading of a Bill unless I could have the Government's considered view in relation to advances which are occurring at the present time and the legal implication of them as projected by the Government's legal officers. One is not asking the impossible. One is merely asking for the considered view of the Government at this particular time in relation to what we already know. </PARA>
<PARA> I should now like to turn to a point raised by Senator Archer. I asked Senator Archer where the information came from which he incorporated in Hansard. He did not bother replying to my interjection so I still do not know where it came from . Perhaps the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) may be able to tell me. I see that he is shaking his head so he does not appear to know either. I refer to the only information the Government has put out-the plant variety rights information kit. I put a number of queries to the Department and I acknowledge the Minister's response to them. Information included in the information kit under 'I' concerns the restriction of access to overseas varieties which, of course, is part of the argument being put about this Bill as to whether or not we are losing out in terms of overseas varieties. We have received a document. A variety of items was included in it. Not being a terribly trusting soul in relation to the information given to me by the Government--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is; nevertheless I have learnt by bitter experience about trusting the Government in terms of the information it gives me, even in a glossy brochure such as this. Therefore, I made a number of phone calls. I made only four phone calls and then decided that I was wasting my time because, in making those phone calls, I found out the following information. With regard to one of the varieties included, only one request had been forwarded and no reply had ever been received. It was put down as 'denied access'. It does not seem to me to be a reasonable assumption, because somebody failed to reply, that Australia had been denied access because of PVR. After all, the letter may even have got lost in our mail. I do not know why that should have been included in this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I decided to press on. I made another phone call about the next variety and found that the request had been refused on the first occasion. I asked: 'Well, did you press the request?' I was learning that one had to press one's requests if they were first refused. But that had not been done. I asked: 'Why not?' and was told: 'We assumed that they wouldn't change their minds.' I asked: 'Why?' There was no response. That is hardly hard evidence of obdurate refusal on the part of overseas companies because of PVR. The situation was becoming interesting. In the next phone call I found that the particular source that had been refused is normally extremely generous in the provision of varieties to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, on this one I was not able to find anybody who could help. In fact I tracked down the very division that dealt with it, but nobody had any recollection of a denial ever having been made on that variety. Perhaps the Minister will be able to have a look at this and by the end of the debate give us chapter and verse on it, rather than the sloppy documentation we have received so far. While he is at it, he might also like to look at an area that I did not turn up, that is, the varieties under the heading 'peach'. I was talking to a group of people from the industry who were lobbying me to support PVR, and when I mentioned this fact to them they said: 'Yes, and you also noticed of course that the item under peaches is incorrect?'. I said that I had not noticed . They were lobbying me in favour of the legislation, and they thought it was pretty sloppy that such an item had been circulated to members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not going to vote for legislation on the basis of that type of information . Members of the House of Representatives may do so, as we saw with the honey legislation; but it went to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations and was pulled off in no time at all when the Committee asked the first obvious question: 'Who wants this?' We have that sort of sloppy documentation from a department, yet it is not responsible. The Minister is the person responsible. I will not vote for legislation unless I have detailed information. Let us have reasonable debate and let us have some information if people want it. When people in the industry, as they have done already, ask me: 'Why are you knocking this back? Why are you delaying this legislation?', I say that I am doing it on the basis that this Government refuses to give to me information to which I am entitled, as an elected senator from Queensland, before I cast my vote. While other members here may take their votes from their party, I have to take personal responsibility for mine. I will not vote for legislation upon which I do not have information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator. I will press on because I do not think I can say anything in response to that. One of the other items that worries me, and I have spoken about it often in the Senate, is research. I am particularly concerned about the research budget. The Minister has refused-he refused again in his reply in the House of Representatives-to give a categorical assurance that research moneys will not be cut back to our public institutions engaged in research in this area. I believe that the reason he has not given that assurance is fairly obvious: The intention is to cut back. I and most other people who have anything to do with rural industry are particularly concerned about this aspect. It is an extremely important aspect because, even if we had private breeding programs, they would take only end line operations. There is absolutely no reason for them to do other than that. They are commercial operations and they must look to their commercial concerns. That is perfectly laudable and acceptable and I am not criticising companies on that aspect. That is what they are set up to do and what they must do. But in doing that they must be very careful in their research programs that they do not waste money that cannot have a commercial spin-off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is why we fund fundamental research in public institutions. It is only by the funding of public research in this country that we can afford to take a punt . We have taken punts in the past, particularly with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, that have paid off enormously. Anybody who knows anything about fundamental research will know that there is no possibility whatsoever, when undertaking that research, of knowing that what will come out of the research will be of commercial concern. It is just not possible to do that. That is not the nature of research. It is also not the nature of research to close it up. It is not possible. A person must have free access to information and to publications and be able to engage in debate and controversy in the learned journals. He must be able to do that and, with his peers in that area, learn from them and they from him. By that type of operation in the community we all come to know more about the various aspects undertaken by our public institutions. I believe that is fundamental to the whole notion of public research. This Government has failed to give a categorical assurance that that public research will be maintained. It can be given by this Government and must be given by this Government before I will vote for such a Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I say that the reason we will support the Australian Labor Party 's amendment is on the basis that the Government has given incorrect information , and has not given to the Parliament information that we need to enable us to make up our minds; also on the basis of the lack of an informed public debate which would enable everybody within the community to realise what we are contemplating. We are contemplating a piece of legislation that is probably the most important piece of legislation this century for rural areas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly agree with the point that the Plant Variety Rights Bill is a most important piece of agricultural legislation. I have listened with great interest to Senator Macklin's contribution in an effort to determine exactly why the Australian Democrats desire that this important legislation, as they acknowledge, be referred to a committee rather than passed in its present form. As I understood the contribution of Senator Macklin, there were basically three separate reasons. The first was the alleged lack of information, or incorrect information, on certain details. I hope that those aspects will be clarified later in the debate by the Government and, I hope, to the satisfaction of Senator Macklin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point he made was the lack of informed public debate which, as I understood him, was based on the failure of the Government to give accurate projections. It would appear to me that to ask the Government to give accurate projections as to how many new varieties of plants will come into being as a result of this legislation, or what will be the increasing tonnage of product as a result of it, is an unreal request. The best that can be given by the Government is a reference to experience overseas in the 25-odd countries that have similar legislation and the beneficial effect of the legislation in those countries. An examination of that, and it is something I will refer to in my short contribution, would indicate that there are considerable advantages in passing this legislation, notwithstanding the impossibility of producing precise projections as to the ultimate result. I would like to think that, after I have been able to refer to some of those experiences, Senator Macklin might be persuaded to the advantages of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point is one that I certainly would not want to dispute and I am sure that the Government would not want to dispute. I refer to the desirability, in fact the necessity, of fundamental research in all sorts of areas in academic institutions. It has been the submission of the Government in presenting this Bill and in speeches in the other place, which Senator Macklin would have no doubt read, that fundamental research will not be in any way inhibited by this legislation, that rather it provides an additional method by which benefit can come to the rural community through the likely availability of greater varieties , and increased quality, of plants. If Senator Macklin is convinced on the basis of my few words, and the second reading of speech of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon), that fundamental research will not be detrimentally inhibited by this Bill I hope he will be satisfied on the three objections that he has raised on behalf of the Australian Democrats. I hope that by the end of this debate the Australian Democrats may be prepared to reconsider, and pass the legislation. It is clearly in Australia's interest to ensure that all available means are utilised to increase the potential of our agricultural industry. As a major world food producer that is also Australia's responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last 40 years pasture yields have been determined principally by the development of land husbandry techniques; that is, the increased use of pesticides, chemical nutrients and mechanisation. All have made significant contributions to increased productivity. It has been really over the last few years that the use of new and improved varieties of seeds and plants has provided a means of increasing yields and has become particularly significant in horticulture, fodder crop and cereal production-even in ornamental plant production. For those in the plant breeding industry it is now a time of great excitement and rapid change. I refer to such men as Hugh Roberts, a former Nuffield scholar, who studied the British cereal seed industry in 1977 and who points to the appearance of crops that only a generation ago were a dream-barley that will grow in sand watered by sea water, peas with no leaves to make them easier to harvest, and high lysine grains requiring no protein supplement for feeding to animals, all of which he states are at an advanced level of development. Mr Roberts described plant breeding as the new boom industry of the world, one that is clean, does not pollute and shows positive production growth. The concern of Mr Roberts and others in the industry is that we are being left behind in a world of change. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has a responsibility to ensure adequate investment in plant breeding research. But that responsibility does not have to depend solely on direct government involvement in the form of public funding or public collection of levies for such research. Legislative action to confer property rights on plant breeders represents a means of encouraging private investment in research. That is one of the aims of this Bill-not to affect detrimentally public research activity but rather to introduce a means of inducing and encouraging private investment in this area of important research. There is nothing new in the concept of plant variety rights. As I indicated when I commenced, some 25 countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States of America and New Zealand, have legislation of a similar type. The Bill establishes a system of plant variety rights that is broadly similar to the legislation in such countries. In essence, it enables the granting of patent rights to breeders of a new plant or seed variety. The scheme is voluntary. The rights will be granted for new varieties only. Existing seed and plant types will not be included in the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I submit that implementation can be expected to bring significant benefits to farmers, horticulturalists and orchardists. The holder of the rights for the first time will have the means to realise returns from persons selling new varieties registered under the scheme. Thus the prerequisite for increased private investment activity in the seed breeding industry will have been met. But we are also being left behind because of the reluctance of overseas breeders to release seed for testing and use under Australian conditions without patent protection. Progressively, implementation of this Bill will overcome that hurdle . Therefore, its ultimate objective is to provide improved seed varieties which will lead to higher yields and greater productivity, with consequent benefits to consumers both here and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Overseas experience has tended to confirm the important function performed by plant variety rights legislation in the generation of private investment activity in the seed breeding industry. I wish to concentrate on that aspect for just a few moments. A study by the United Kingdom Institute of Agricultural Botany shows that between 1947 and 1977 wheat yields in the United Kingdom increased by 94 per cent and barley yields by 67 per cent. Of the 94 per cent increase in wheat yields, 56 per cent was due to improved varieties of wheat. Of the increased barley yield of 67 per cent, 32 per cent was due to improved varieties of barley. When examining these figures Mr P. W. Murphy, the Controller of Plant Variety Rights in the United Kingdom, noted that the increase in yield over the last 10 years-bearing in mind that the first full year of operation of the legislation in that country was 1966-represents nearly half of the total yield increase; also that in the same 10 years a large part of the yield increase resulted from the use of new varieties of seeds. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that in itself does not prove the contribution played by the United Kingdom plant variety rights legislation. But going back to 1960, Mr Murphy has pointed out that the presence of commercial plant breeders in the major agricultural crops was virtually non-existent. He said that there had then been little possibility of the private sector breeder obtaining any return on his investment, particularly in the easily reproduced crops; that, therefore it was not surprising that only state breeders were active in the agricultural crops sector. However, he points out that since full implementation of the legislation the number of plant breeding firms in the United Kingdom has increased to 23 and that there has been a continuing increase in the number of varieties being brought forward for protection-by 1978, exceeding 480 in number, in the area of agriculture. He indicates that investment in plant breeding is estimated by the British Association of Plant Breeders to have increased in the last five years by more than 500 per cent Therefore what is being seen is a decided widening of seed varieties available to the English farmer, with substantially increased yields in tandem with higher levels of private investment activity in the British seed breeding industry. That is what we desire, and anticipate as flowing from this Bill when it becomes law. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Roberts, to whom I referred earlier, points out that maize is the highest yielding forage crop in the United Kingdom, but 30 years ago was not grown. Now the maize area moves north by five miles a year purely as a result of plant breeders developing better cold country crops. He gives also the example of sugarbeet. In 1950 it took 445 man hours to grow one hectare, but by 1976 this took only 81 man hours, which he largely attributes to the development by plant breeders of a mono-germ beet. Other examples are dwarf cherry and apple trees, all of whose fruit is within reach, better fleshed nectarines and rape seed with disease resistance. He attributes all of these advances to plant breeding. Of equal importance to the need to generate private commercial activity in the seed breeding industry is the desire to obtain access to seed varieties not currently available due to the absence of plant variety rights legislation in Australia. The Australian Agricultural Council Working Party in its 1976 report cited specific instances in which grapes from Germany, rape seed from France, perennial rye grass, cherries and barley from the United Kingdom, garden beans, cotton, strawberries, pome fruit, peaches, nectarines and apricots from the United States are all being refused entry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this afternoon I made a personal explanation based on an address I gave to the Senate last Wednesday in relation to proposals for closer economic relations with New Zealand. In that speech I drew attention to certain reservations that I had, some of which some people felt were perhaps a little too severe. In my concluding remarks I mentioned that there had been a softening in attitude by the Tasmanian Vegetable Council. It might be recalled that in my speech I said that the two industries that had the greatest potential for growth were horticulture and tourism, and that because of the CER export incentives and other price support schemes certain provisions needed to be made to protect particularly the Tasmanian industries because although CER was being sold as a package it had the potential to cause the most damage to the State of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a part of this personal explanation I wish to quote from the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association publication, Focus, issued in August 1982. It acknowledges the work of two honourable senators and also acknowledges the softening in attitude by the Vegetable Council in relation to its approach to closer economic relations with New Zealand. I will quote from the publication since I was not given permission to incorporate it in Hansard earlier this afternoon. On page 2 of the publication, under the heading 'Closer Economic Relations with New Zealand', it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Since CER first arose the Vegetable Council has been involved with the Departments of Primary Industry and Trade in Canberra. It was apparent that unless a positive and active role was established, the vegetable industry may have been disadvantaged. Through the co-operation of Senator Archer and Senator Tate meetings were arranged in Tasmania with the New Zealand Consul General, Mr. B. Dolan, senior officers of the Department of Trade and the New Zealand High Commission Office. </PARA>
<PARA> These meetings and close co-operation from the Department of Primary Industry, especially Dick Coutts, have ensured-</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the operative words-</PARA>
<PARA>that the final CER agreements for vegetables do not adversely affect Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not wish to question that judgment. The article goes on to say that the Vegetable Council is presently concerned with the finalisation of legislative details on anti-dumping, et cetera. I may be wrong but following my detailed evaluations both in New Zealand and in Australia I still stand firm basically on what I said but I acknowledge the fact that under the circumstances I should have recognised the contribution of Senator Archer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the unexpected announcements in the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) was the tax on certain bank transactions. According to Mr Howard the tax will come into effect on 1 January next year. The legislation has not yet been brought before the Parliament so in some ways we are guessing at what the legislation may contain. What we do know is that debits to bank accounts by cheque or like payments will be subject to tax. Four rates of tax will apply. These are 10c for debits of less than $100, 25c for debits of $100 to $499, 50c for debits of $500 to $4,999, and $1 for amounts over $5,000. I will be talking about cash withdrawals this evening but debits cover many things including cheques written, direct debits from interest payments payable to the bank, transfers to other accounts, bank charges and cash withdrawals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not my intention to debate the legislation before it is introduced. However, I do make a plea on behalf of pensioners that they not have bank taxes taken from their limited incomes. No doubt a number of people will be critical of the new tax when it comes into operation on 1 January but one group in particular has voiced its concern to me. I refer to the pensioners. Many pensioners have their pensions paid directly into a bank account. They do this so that their pension payments will not be tampered with before they receive them. So many cheques have disappeared from letter boxes that some pensioners believe that the best way they can safeguard their payments is to have them paid into a bank account. Does this mean that withdrawals by these pensioners from their accounts will attract a bank transaction tax? It would be the mark of an insensitive government to bring down legislation like that. Those in our community who are solely dependent on a government benefit for their livelihood should not have to be burdened with a tax simply because they want to keep their money secure. </PARA>
<PARA> Charges of 10c or 25c may not seem much to a government and they may not seem much to some of us here but to pensioners every cent has a real meaning. I am fearful that if this tax is payable by pensioners some of them will adopt the hazardous course of hoarding cash. Such a course is hazardous because losses can occur through such things as fire or flood but it also invites theft, sometimes accompanied by violence. Thus I make a plea to the Government to ensure that when the legislation is brought before the Parliament it is framed in such a way that pensioners who have their pensions paid into a bank account are not caught up in a web of bank transaction taxes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been two speakers in the adjournment debate. I acknowledge Senator Watson's gracious reference to Senator Archer. I am sure, however, that all honourable senators would have understood that his earlier reference to Senator Tate was a reference which arose out of an interjection and was not in any sense meant to suggest the exclusion of any honourable senator, whether from Tasmania or elsewhere, from having an interest in closer economic relations with New Zealand .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter raised by Senator Colston affects pensioners. He suggested that there should be an exemption for pensioners with respect to the proposal to tax bank transactions. The proposal will not touch the great number of pensioners who operate directly by receipt of a cheque and the cashing of that cheque. That sort of transaction will not in any way be affected by what is proposed. Nor will it affect those pensioners who arrange to have their pension cheques paid to an account which is other than a cheque account because the proposal relates only to debit entries resulting from cheques written or direct debits for interest and so on. It applies only to accounts with banks that are subject to operation by cheque or like payment instrument. So we are dealing with a limited number of the pensioner population-namely, those who operate cheque accounts-who will be subject to additional charges. The amount of additional charges is really comparable with the sorts of charges to which cheques have been subject for many years. The most common cheques written undoubtedly will be in the less than $100 category and they will attract a rate of tax of 10c. Cheques of $100 to $499 will attract a rate of 25c. So the actual amount of that imposition will be relatively small. </PARA>
<PARA> I note the point made by Senator Colston. I seriously doubt whether it would be administratively feasible to make the sort of exception that he has mentioned because that would require the banks really to segregate all pensioners' accounts from other accounts. I shall ensure that the matter is examined, but my preliminary reaction or response to what Senator Colston has said is that it would be impractical to follow the course that he suggested. I shall, however, have the matter examined, but without wishing in any way to raise an expectation that I would be able to respond positively to his suggestion. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) As was announced to the House on 9 September 1980, the Government advised that it would not make a decision on the actual acquisition of STOVL aircraft until 1983. It was emphasised that, at that stage, there was no commitment to acquire STOVL aircraft. On 29 April 1982, the House was further advised that the Government had decided to buy HMS Invincible, essentially for its contribution to anti-submarine warfare, not its capacity to operate short take-off and vertical landing aircraft. Nevertheless in light of lessons being learned from the Falklands crisis and as indicated by the Prime Minister on 2 June 1982, we will continue to evaluate carefully the need for the acquisition of STOVL aircraft. As a result of the recent decision by the United Kingdom Government not to sell HMS Invincible, a re-examination is being made of the options now available to meet the needs that earlier led the Government to decide to buy HMS Invincible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 November 1981 (Hansard, page 2195) Senator Walters asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning the percentage of the population not covered under the health insurance arrangements at 30 October 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> Because data on population covered by health insurance are collected on a quarterly basis I am not able to provide figures for 30 October 1981.</PARA>
<PARA>However, data now available show that, by 31 March 1982, 63.9 per cent of the population was insured for basic medical coverage with registered health insurance organisations and 67.8 per cent was insured for basic hospital coverage.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition, some 20 per cent of the population is covered by the Federal Government under the pensioner health benefits and the arrangements for people in special need, etc. A further 6 per cent is covered by State government arrangements for free inpatient and outpatient hospital treatment in Queensland and New South Wales. Therefore, it is estimated that at 31 March 1982, 90 per cent of the population (medical) and 94 per cent of the population (hospital) had basic health insurance or similiar Government cover. These figures could be up to 1 per cent higher when all who are eligible under the arrangments for people in special need take up their entitlement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 May 1982 (Hansard, page 2321) Senator MacGibbon asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Have there been any requests from the Department of Defence to send observers to the Falkland Islands? If there have been no approaches, will the Government, as a matter of urgency, dispatch several senior officers from the armed Services, as observers, in a strictly non-combatant role? The opportunity to see this war first hand, particularly the maritime missile warfare which is the first of its kind, is extremely important and relevant to Australia's defence.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> There were no requests for the Government to send observers to the Falkland Islands. The status of such observers, as members of the Australian Defence Force, would have been at best ambiguous, and their presence in the United Kingdom Task Force may have been an embarrassment to the British. We closely followed events, recognising that in any case full information and a comprehensive professional appraisal of military and technological developments would not be available for some time.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>

Where access to service medical records has been requested a copy of those records has been passed to the medical practitioner nominated by the individual concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of National Development and Energy which has a co-ordinating role in matters relating to the atomic tests program, is proposing to assist the Department of Health in conducting a survey of the health of all personnel who were involved with the Atomic Tests and who have been traced. The Department of Defence has already supplied much information to that Department in its preliminary work on the survey. It is expected that the survey will commence later this year.</PARA>

<PARA> Assistance will be paid for air freighted cargo that would normally be eligible under the scheme provided that every effort was made to use a reasonable alternative shipping service operating at the time the service normally used was disrupted by industrial disputes. Further, assistance will be paid only after my Department is satisfied that air freight was required to be used to avoid contract penalties or to ensure mainland markets were not jeopardised.</PARA>
