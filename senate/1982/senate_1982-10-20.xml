<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That citizens of South Australia view with great alarm the removal of the Director of the Office of Child Care and fear for the future of that office and the children's services programme which it administers.</PARA>
<PARA> We believe the Office of Child Care to be inappropriately placed within the Department of Social Security, where children's services are in competition with welfare services for the aged, disabled, and other such groups.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled , should take every step as necessary to obtain immediate withdrawal of the Office of Child Care from the Department of Social Security and the establishment of a Children's Commission.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned journalists employed by the Australian Broadcasting Commission in Tasmania respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That Part VIII of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Bill represents censorship of the most blatant kind and brings to Australia such draconian measures that were outlawed in England five hundred years ago.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled, should reject outright Part VIII of the Bill. Further that you give consideration to one law for all media and not piecemeal control over particular sections.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That Part VIII of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Bill is unacceptable and should be deleted or at the very least amended. The provisions contained in Part VIII are in direct conflict with the independence of the new corporation and would impose unprecedented restrictions on the freedom of information in a democratic society.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should seriously reconsider Part VIII of the Bill and its relevance to the proposed Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</PARA>

<PARA> Your petitioners also call upon the Federal Parliament not to allocate or allow funds to be raised for construction of dams in the South West of Tasmania but to provide such funds as would enable the preservation of this area. This is a national asset and Tasmanians should not be made to bear any financial burden resulting from its preservation.</PARA>

<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of South Australia respectfully showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned at the special privileges bestowed on the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, M.P.-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That in 1964 a Liberal/Country Party Government granted Mr Anthony, M.P. a Commonwealth Government Home Loan Mortgage of $17,964 for a period of 45 years at a fixed interest rate of 4.75 per cent and that at 1-10-81 the amount of principal outstanding was $15,005.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. The latest estimate by the Australian Taxpayers' Association is that $7 000m a year is being lost in taxation revenue;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 261 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Great Barrier Reef is unique and is included on the World Heritage List.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act was to create a marine park to provide for the proper protection and management of The Reef, only 14 per cent of the total area defined in this Act as the Great Barrier Reef Region has been declared marine park.</PARA>
<PARA> The only insurance against an oil drilling blowout in Reef waters is to prohibit oil drilling in the Region and its vicinity.</PARA>
<PARA> This can only be effected by declaring the whole area of the Region a marine park under the above legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should request the Government to take action to hold a referendum together with the next Federal Elections on the question that 'The entire area of the Great Barrier Reef and its surrounding waters, defined as the Great Barrier Reef Region in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, as amended 1978, be immediately declared a marine park under the provisions of that Act.'</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) that US, Australian and allied forces used huge amounts of toxic chemicals for military purposes, such as Agents Orange, Blue and White, in Vietnam during the war there;</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament Assembled. The petition of the undersigned concerned people of Tasmania respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That sections of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Bill will if accepted by your chamber have serious effects on listeners to the ABC's overseas service, Radio Australia. The Bill as it now stands would leave the way open for representatives of foreign countries to have a direct say in what material is broadcast by Radio Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Many people living in countries served by Radio Australia depend on that service for reliable information which is untainted by the views of any political persuasion.</PARA>
<PARA> Further that reports by ABC correspondents overseas could be affected by foreign governments thus defeating the purpose of trying to get independent information from overseas. Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled consider seriously the implications for Australia's image overseas before passing the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Bill.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That there is a very real threat to the independence of Australia's only independent broadcaster from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Bill. We see real danger of interference in the measures outlined in Part VIII (clauses 79 to 102) giving complaints investigators powers, which by threat alone, could seriously hamper the responsibility of the ABC to engage in effective reporting. The ABC has, historically, proved itself responsible in both the collection and presentation of material. Opening the door to complaints which need not be first submitted to the Corporation management for investigation will seriously undermine and abbreviate the Corporation's ability and confidence to maintain its high standards of independence and responsibility to the people of Australia .</PARA>

Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled should ensure procedures for the ABC similiar to those applying to the BBC and that any complaints office be run on the following lines-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Only material that actually goes to air should be subject to any question.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The complaints officer can only request copies or transcripts of the items as broadcast, not journalists' background material etc.</PARA>

I refer to the fact that on 11 October the Acting Attorney- General announced the terms of reference for the so-called Von Doussa inquiry into the affairs of Mr Denis Horgan. The terms of reference were restricted to determining whether certain transactions were 'illegal, dishonest or a conflict of private interest and public duty'. I ask: Why did the Government not ask Mr Von Doussa to determine whether, as a result of those transactions, money which otherwise would have been paid in tax was not paid and whether the vendor shareholders will be affected by the recoupment legislation which is promised by the Government? Will the Government give immediate attention to expanding the terms of reference to incorporate these questions, the answers to which are a matter of public concern?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, refers to a matter that has rightly been the concern of Australians for more than 100 years. In particular, I refer to statements allegedly made this week by the Prime Minister of Vanuatu, Father Walter Lini, concerning the availability of Vanuatu's ports to the Soviet Navy. Are these allegations incorrect or unconfirmed? Has there been some misunderstanding or misreporting?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see an article in this morning's Australian in connection with this matter. I have to say that we have been unable to confirm whether these remarks can be properly attributed to Father Lini, the Prime Minister of Vanuatu. Therefore, I am unable to confirm the accuracy of the report. Nevertheless, I can say that in recent times, and in times past, the Australian Government has made quite clear its position in relation to the matter of Soviet power and its presence in the South Pacific. That is to the effect that we believe Soviet naval power in this area would be a cause of, and a force for, destabilisation in an otherwise peaceful zone. For that reason the situation mentioned by the honourable senator should be reinforced at this time. I will endeavour to obtain confirmation as to whether, in fact, the alleged remarks can be correctly attributed to Father Lini.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I refer the Minister to the recent application by Kelvinator Pty Ltd for urgent temporary assistance and, in particular, to the recommendations by the Temporary Assistance Authority, following its inquiry into air conditioning machines and parts, which are now before the Government. Is the Minister aware that Kelvinator is facing a major threat from cheap imports of room air conditioners, which have increased by some 158 per cent over the past three years? Is the Minister also aware that the jobs of another 400 workers at Kelvinator's Adelaide plant will be threatened if the Government does not grant the assistance which is sought by the company and supported by the Trades and Labour Council? Is the Minister further aware that these 400 jobs are in addition to those of the 300 workers who were given an ultimatum by Kelvinator last week to work a 4-day week or face retrenchment? I ask the Minister: When does the Government intend to bring down its decision on whether to grant increased temporary assistance to Kelvinator? Is the Government deliberately holding back making its decision until after the South Australian State elections on 6 November?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, relates to claims by Mr Harry Martin-I think he was referred to in a question asked by Senator Kilgariff yesterday-who is the Australian National Director of Community Aid Abroad. Mr Martin said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . Australian Government aid programmes to the Third World were a multi- billion dollar failure and that thousands of millions of dollars had been poured into countries like Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines where 'military cliques' had seen that the poor had not got the money.</PARA>
<PARA>Given the seriousness of these claims and the huge amount of money involved which, I think, is $720m for 1982-83, I ask the Minister: First, is it correct, as alleged by Mr Martin, that the Australian Development Assistance Bureau which administers Australia's overseas aid is so undermanned as to be incapable of doing its job effectively? Secondly, what action will be taken by the Government to rectify the situation and to ensure that money allocated for overseas aid is disbursed where it is most needed?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; There was a question on this matter yesterday. Perhaps I could add to what was said yesterday. The staff requirements of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau were the subject of particular consideration in the context of the Government's Review of Commonwealth Functions last year in which it was determined that a substantial reduction of positions could be achieved without eliminating functions or affecting the Bureau's capacity to administer the aid program efficiently. In the light of a recommendation contained in the report by the Auditor-General on an efficiency audit on the administration of Australia's bilateral overseas aid program in 1981, a comprehensive review of the Bureau's staffing needs will be conducted as soon as possible to ensure that staff resources are adequate and are deployed with maximum efficiency.</PARA></TALK.START>

In view of widespread opposition by the citizens of New South Wales to continued rainforest logging on land owned by the citizens of New South Wales, I ask the Minister whether he will seek to ensure that the Government will exert whatever influence it can on the New South Wales Government to ensure that virgin rainforest, especially that in the Washpool region, is preserved in its natural state for the benefit of future generations.

If there were a Commonwealth interest-I doubt that there is-I think it would have to be dealt with through the Department of Primary Industry rather than through the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. Of course, it was as Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment that I was asked this question by Senator Mason. I recall that when I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs I had the opportunity of visiting the Aboriginal community at Baryulgil, now Malabugilmah village. That community has an interest in Collum Collum station, which is on the Washpool. I had a chance to look at some of that country and can confirm the beauty and uniqueness of some of that forest.

Part of the petition presented stated that the Government should legislate to remove sales tax from solar water heaters. Of course that was done some three years ago, in June 1979. The Government is very keen indeed to encourage the use of renewable energy, particularly solar energy. So, the appliances are exempt from sales tax. Taxation concessions have been introduced to encourage commercial and industrial users to convert from oil and liquefied petroleum gas to other fuels, including solar energy. But I think the most important thing is that a total of almost $7. 9m has been allocated on 124 projects relating to solar energy since the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council program was established in 1978. We are now seeing successful technology emerging from this research resulting in collector technology, the heating and cooling of buildings and, of course, the key area of photovoltaic cells.

The funds will be over and above the level of funding provided by the Government for the purpose and, of course, including the amount announced by the Prime Minister at the opening of the Gallery last week.

I understand that the charge of $2 per adult which has been proposed will not be imposed for children, pensioners, the handicapped or the unemployed. To that extent the last suggestion made by Senator Watson has already been taken up in the Government's arrangements.

All the foreshadowed comments, particularly those of the Sydney Morning Herald and others who have been studying the matter, indicate that, after that, there are likely to be significant increases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The New South Wales Electricity Commission, having been the pace setter in wage costs and shorter working weeks, has restricted over the period its maintenance and operational practices. It has therefore suffered very grave breakdowns in its capacity to maintain power generation. As a result of that, it is now facing costs of tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars for the restoration of power generation levels. One estimate I read yesterday in the Press-I cannot confirm it-is that it will cost in the order of $140m merely to restore the Liddell power station to full operation.</PARA>

Will the Minister take action to control the menace that could result from this beer's introduction-for example, greater road danger and the exacerbation of alcohol-related social problems? Specifically, will the Minister discuss the matter with his colleague to ensure that, firstly, all beer labels clearly show the alcohol content of beer; secondly, low alcohol beer attracts a lower excise than other brands, thereby encouraging drinkers to consume the lower alcohol content product; and, thirdly, the excise on beer with a higher alcohol content is increased?</PARA></TALK.START>

As I promised to refer that part of Senator Townley's question, I will add in my reference the part of Senator Gietzelt's question which makes the same point. The critical point-again it was raised by Senator Townley-is that people should know how much of any beer they can drink safely before they become unfit to drive. To that extent, Senator Gietzelt's and Senator Townley's suggestion that labelling would be helpful would be of interest, I am sure, to my colleague. As to whether some of those quite eminent bodies mentioned by Senator Gietzelt have condemned the launch of the new beer is something which I do not have before me, but which I accept as it was set out in the question. The other matter referred to by Senator Gietzelt , which concerned the use of the taxation tool by way of differential excise levels, would need to be referred to my colleague the Treasurer and would require specific Government consideration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do have some information for Senator Kilgariff on the question that he has asked. The Minister for Defence advised the Parliament on 26 August this year that in the interests of containing rising manpower costs and reducing the proportion of defence funds allocated to them the substantial growth of 3, 000 in military manpower over the last three years would not be continued into 1982-83. Generally the Services undertake formal and on the job training of their own manpower, using their own facilities, but not infrequently Service personnel engage in formal, specialised or professional training in technical colleges and tertiary institutions. Manning of new equipment often accompanies a phase-out of old equipment and in this event the retraining of personnel on the new equipment is of a short duration only.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Provision is also made, when required, for the early training of personnel to coincide with the delivery of new equipment. Delays in the manufacture or unavailability of the equipment does occur sometimes and the manpower is then temporarily diverted to other tasks. Alternatively, early receipt of equipment can cause transient manpower shortages, sometimes in technically skilled manpower. Presently there are some shortages of technical and professional manpower, such as engineers, in the radio trades and specialist weapons and electronic categories. The Services conduct special recruitment campaigns to attract suitably trained persons direct from the labour force or trainees from the community. With regard to the part of the question which concerned upgrading , which may need some amplification, I will refer that to the Minister for Defence and obtain another reply.</PARA>

As to the claim that many new industries have been attracted to the State during the last three years, I further ask: What are the names of the companies which have come to South Australia? What is the number of people employed at present in each of these industries?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that if Senator McLaren looks at what I said yesterday he will find that I did not say that the Cooper Basin gas field was developed by the Tonkin Government. I said that it had developed the Cooper Basin-Stony Point pipeline. I commented that it was that Government which took steps to bring the condensate and liquids from the Cooper Basin to Stony Point. As a result of the building of the pipeline-which I understand was finished yesterday ahead of time, and concerning which I congratulate the builders-a new industry of significance is to be developed. The remainder of that part of Senator McLaren's question is irrelevant since it does not relate to what I said. I will seek out the names of companies that have come to South Australia during the term of office of the Tonkin Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From the moment a decision was taken to develop Roxby Downs increasing numbers of workers would be involved. My understanding is that at the time of full development some 2,400 workers will be employed directly, and some 600 or more indirectly; this is quite apart from the multiplier effect in the rest of the State. The decision in South Australia to create jobs for the future is to be made now, but that decision is being resisted by the Labor Opposition of that State. That is the important point that I am trying to make. If South Australia is to have a major mining industry concerned with mining a great complex of minerals in the future and one that will create jobs, the decision has to be made in the near future and a start made soon on all necessary studies. If there is a Labor decision to resist that development, whether it be taken in two, three, four, five or nine years' time, there will be no jobs at all. But, quite apart from jobs, the potentially immense revenue that would be generated in South Australia by such mineral development would create very significant employment and well-being for the South Australian people. I am surprised indeed that one should see something strange in trying now to establish something that, in the course of the next decade, will be of major magnitude provided a Liberal government is re-elected so that the project can get off the ground.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many questions were asked by Senator Lewis, Mr President. I will have to seek detailed answers for some of them. The honourable senator referred to an analysis which appeared in a journal of the Institute of Public Affairs and, indeed, I am aware of that article. I am aware also of the fact that it seems that the operations of Medibank Private differ between the States as to their profitability and therefore, presumably, as to their viability. It is my understanding of health insurance arrangements that there is no national health fund, that in fact health insurance funds are registered State by State, and that their registration is looked at on a State-by-State basis in terms of matters such as their viability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware that the IPA statement compared the various States and indicated that Victoria had been the area where Medibank had been most successful financially. I do not think Senator Lewis mentioned Western Australia in his question. It is my recollection that the operation of Medibank Private has not been profitable in Western Australia. I could refer to the article to get the detailed information State by State for Senator Lewis. It seems to me that it is incumbent upon the fund to prove its viability State by State, as is the case for any other health insurance fund. I cannot answer all Senator Lewis' questions. I have had a chance to look at the annual report on the operations of the registered medical benefits and hospital benefits organisations for 1980-81. It does suggest that the management costs as a percentage of contribution income on average for all states was about 17 per cent for Medibank Private and about 11 per cent for all health funds. That would suggest that Medibank Private is operating at a rather higher level.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the question of superannuation, I believe that the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust has a policy of funding its obligations for superannuation on an emerging basis. It also pursues the policy of taking independent actuarial evaluation of its superannuation liabilities on a regular basis. It feels that the reserves it has provided are adequate to meet its needs . I am not able to answer the other part of the question in relation to the adequacy of the charges which Medibank Private will make upon the Australian Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union for acting as its agent. I will see whether I can obtain more information for Senator Lewis on that point.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do recall the question asked by Senator Sibraa. In fact I thought there was more than one question. He has had an interest in the subject of sun lamps and commercial establishments using ultraviolet radiation for tanning. His interest has extended to questions of standards and appropriate controls. I think Senator Sibraa said that on 24 February 1981 I indicated that we were awaiting further information. It is entirely proper for the honourable senator now to ask whether we have completed the studies. I will seek to find that out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Like Senator Sibraa, I saw the newspaper reports this morning of the remarks made yesterday. They seem to me to be sensible and reasonable and I think they would be remarks that the Minister would want to take into account when bringing together standards. What I cannot tell Senator Sibraa is whether the standards have yet been promulgated following the earlier question he asked some 18 months ago. I will undertake to try to get an update on that for him.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minster for Education aware of the number of non- government business colleges which are asking for an extension of the proposed student loan arrangements to $2,500 a year instead of $1,000? Is there justification for the claims by these business colleges that by extending the loans scheme more students will be able to attend the colleges and thus be better equipped for and more certain of future employment? Even if the loans scheme is not extended beyond the $1,000 limit a year, what effect will there be on business college students if the scheme itself is not established before the next academic year?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think any honourable senator could fail to be aware of the campaign being mounted at the moment by non-government business colleges, or of the point that they are making. Basically, they are asking for an increased loan availability and they are claiming that their students need this. We already subsidise non-government business colleges. In 1983 we expect that some 2,500 students will become eligible for loans at approved colleges. That is , I believe, because some of them qualify now for the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. In 1982 about 5,900 students in colleges were approved in TEAS approved courses and they, therefore, can apply for TEAS. In addition the colleges at which they are enrolled attract the Government tuition fees subsidy of about $73 a month for up to 10 months. So there is a very considerable government subvention now to some of the non-government business colleges, both by way of subvention to the college and by way of availability for TEAS. The Government had the view that the $1,000 limit would make available a greater number of loans in any one year. If there is a $50m limit on the number of loans , and if they are set at $1,000, I think that makes 50,000 loans which would be available. If it is taken up to $2,500 a loan, that, of course, brings the number of loans down considerably. It is a question of balancing these factors. I come back to the point I have been making to Senator Hamer: There is a fairly substantial subvention already to assist students in some of these non- government business colleges. It is not fair for a suggestion to be put out in the campaign that is being run that the colleges are being either ignored or unfairly treated. In fact I suspect that on questions of equity the Government has made the right decision. If a concession were to be made to the non- government business college students it could then be expected that other groups with higher educational expenses might require greater loans. That might include students who have to live away from home and who may have greater expenses. At present I am not inclined to seek to make a greater loan per student as is being sought, although we will keep the matter under review.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Walsh asked me a question and I responded with some information regarding an Export Development Grants Board grant to Westwools Pty Ltd. I now have the additional information that he sought. The information is that the Export Development Grants Board receives applications on a prescribed form and that form provides for a postal address to be given. On the application forms submitted by Westwools Pty Ltd in respect of its claim for EMDG for the financial year 1976-77, the address given by Westwools Pty Ltd was Post Office Box 397, Fremantle, Western Australia 6160.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Once a claim is determined by the Export Development Grants Board, the Board sends a 'Notice of Determination of a Grant' to the Department of Trade and Resources for processing and issuing of a cheque. The Notice of Determination of a Grant includes the name and postal address of the claimant. In this case the name and postal address of the claimant was given as Westwools Pty Ltd, Post Office Box 397, Fremantle, Western Australia 6160 on Notice Number 09244. In accordance with the direction from the Export Development Grants Board a payments schedule number 001478 was sent to the Department of Finance for issue of the cheque. The schedule included a request for a cheque for $97,034 to be made payable to Westwools Pty Ltd, Post Office Box 397, Fremantle, Western Australia 6160.</PARA>
<PARA> A Reserve Bank cheque 01697668 drawn against the Department of Finance, Canberra, Drawing Account No. 1 was issued on 26 September 1978 and made payable to Westwools Pty Ltd, Post Office Box 397, Fremantle, Western Australia 6160. It was stamped 'Not negotiable Account payee only'. The cheque was presented at the ANZ Bank, Fremantle, on 2 October 1978. It is not known into what account it was paid but, in accordance with normal banking practice, a cheque made payable to 'account payee only' should be paid into that account. That is why the endorsement is put on the cheque. If it was not paid into that account, that is a matter between the ANZ Bank and its client. It is clear from the above that both the Export Development Grants Board and the Department have acted fully in accordance with the legislation.</PARA>

I have received the following information: The amount and types of work proposed to be placed with private surveyors by the Department of Administrative Services have been discussed in recent weeks with the executives of all State branches of the Australian Consultant Surveyors Association by the Commonwealth Surveyor-General. Following the Review of Commonwealth Functions decision, it was decided that approximately 40 per cent of departmental survey work be placed with private surveyors by 1986. This target is to be achieved progressively. However, given the changing size and nature of the work programs across Australia it is likely that amount of work will vary from region to region and year to year. Arrangements have been agreed between the Surveyor-General and the Association for continuing consultations on these matters and others which bear upon the private sector resources available to service the Commonwealth's needs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Labor Party presents to the Senate this matter of public importance, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The failure of the Government to devise a national policy in order to provide adequate housing at a manageable cost for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>It raises this matter not merely as a question of shelter for Australians, although for an increasing number of them-one thinks of the homeless and the caravan dwellers-that is indeed their basic predicament, but also as a question of fairness and justice is involved that makes it a matter of national concern that there be a fair deal for those Australians aspiring to decent, affordable housing. That fair deal ought to be guaranteed by coherent national policies devised by the Australian Government. At the moment that is certainly not the case. On the contrary, rather than a fair deal for all Australians in regard to housing, we see a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor and, indeed, between the rich and the middle income earners.</PARA>
<PARA> What sort of society is it when the affluent can pay $6m for a waterfront home in Sydney, saving another $1m for decorating, while millions of other Australians live in caravan parks, in the dwindling number of public sector houses, in the insecurity of private leases with high rents or in private houses which are becoming distressingly impossible to finance? Surely there is a need for a national policy. This is not the view just of the Australian Labor Party; it is the view of professionals within the industry itself. The Director of the Australian Institute of Urban Studies, Mr Leo Hawkins, was reported as saying on 29 September:</PARA>
<PARA> What governments should be doing is looking to a national housing policy. We have the only national government without a housing department as such. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, it is the view of the churches that the crisis is becoming such that a more comprehensive, more vigorous and more robust approach by the national Government is required. In the Australian of 27 September the headline was ' Churches lash Government over housing'. On that weekend in late September all the Australain churches highlighted for the first time, as a priority requiring urgent attention by their congregations, the crisis in the housing industry and the provision of housing in Australia. No non-governmental organisations would be more in touch with the needs of people and with as wide a cross-section of the community than the churches. They see it as a matter of national priority. The Government does not. </PARA>
<PARA> The Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace issued a report on 6 September entitled 'House and Home'. I commend it to all those who want a clear analysis of the housing situation in Australia and a tough-minded, compassionate approach to the suggesting of solutions. I suggest that they read this report by the Catholic Commission. Amongst other things, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no national housing policy upon which all governments agree. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has a particular responsibility as it controls most government resources and has powers over the economy and the financial system.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet, in the opinion of the Catholic Commission, the Federal Government has been unwilling to accept this responsibility. The abolition of the Federal Department of Housing and Construction in May 1982 demonstrated this unwillingness quite clearly. That is a shocking thing. When I arrived here on Budget day this year I looked at the ministerial directory on my desk and thumbed through it in vain to find who was to be the Minister in this Government designated to take responsibility for the provision of adequate afford- able housing for all Australians. That office has been abolished by Mr Fraser and there is nobody within the Government assuming that ultimate responsibility. I say to the Senate and to the people of Australia that the Labor Party, when it comes into government, will establish a department of urban and regional affairs responsible for housing and related social amenities. It will liaise with other departments. It will act in co-operative consultation with State and Territory governments and local government in order to ensure that we have the fullest possible provision of housing at a manageable cost to all Australians. The Labor government will designate a Minister to take responsibility for this most important sector of our society, fulfilling social needs as it does and, of course, generating tremendous employment. </PARA>
<PARA> When we think of housing for Australians we tend to think of home ownership-the vanishing dream of so many Australians. I will come to that shortly. But there are other aspects of the housing of Australians which it is necessary to consider. For example, one Australian in every five depends on the private rental sector for housing. That is some 20 per cent of Australians-a very high figure. Some depend on private rental housing from choice-for the freedom it gives them in choice of address and movement-but for most in the private rental sector there is no alternative. As public housing stagnates due to the failure of this Government to provide adequate funds to the States and as home ownership becomes harder to achieve, more and more Australians are trapped in that private rental sector in which rising rents and diminishing real incomes make it impossible for them to save the deposit which will enable them to escape. In addition, there is all the stress caused by the uncertainty of being dependent upon the whim of a private landlord. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the stress situations which can emerge. Once more, I turn to the report of the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. One finds outlined in that report some graphic examples of the situations which can emerge and which will be known to all honourable senators and those who are listening. For example, a letter to the editor of the Courier-Mail in Brisbane on 10 March this year states, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA> Recently, a block of flats, occupied mostly by old age pensioners, was bought by a group of young men, who promptly raised the rent three times in as many months. </PARA>
<PARA> The tenants were told that if they didn't pay up someone else would, and if they didn't like it they could get out. </PARA>
<PARA>That is happening time and again in Australia. The inadequacy of the private rental sector to provide shelter at reasonable cost to many Australians is largely associated also with the changing character of inner city areas. For example, one finds in the Sydney district of Waverley a tremendous reorganisation of the housing sector within that district such that, between 1974 and 1981, 90 of Waverley's 237 boarding houses were demolished, displacing 1,000 boarders. Many of them were poor, aged, disabled, ex-prisoners, young people or unemployed people. This was all in favour of the strata unit development with its attendant high costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party will promote vigorously a higher level of security for private renters through initiatives to expand rental accommodation and through income assistance to renters. There must be an extension of the supplementary assistance to a wider range of social security and adult unemployment benefit recipients. This will be supplementary to those initiatives already taken by the Government. They need to be extended. This will be the subject of a carefully costed statement shortly by Mr Uren of the other place. But what is needed in the private rental sector is a breakthrough concept-a new initiative within Australia. This can be achieved only by a national government taking the lead with clearly perceived social goals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party believes that the Commonwealth, the States and non-profit community organisations could pool their funds to provide for a mix of public and private sector funds to provide for the expansion of low cost rental accommodation. This would include the construction, acquisition and rehabilitation of boarding houses, home units, flats, et cetera. This sort of initiative, using community housing trusts as the vehicle, will help to enable those presently in this sector to acquire equity, through co-operative effort, in the rental accommodation they need. It is a very sensible use of public funds in conjunction with those of non-profit community organisations. Of course, what is also required is an upgrading of the provision of public housing; not welfare housing, as it is sometimes called by Sir Phillip Lynch in his dismissal of the churches concerned in September-welfare housing, with all its overtones of patronising the poor. We are talking about public housing. Funds need to be allocated to this sector in a way which remedies the neglect of the sector over the past four or five years by the present Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Applications to rent public housing were up by 15 per cent last year whereas the finance given to the States for that sector was only enough to build about half of what was built some seven or eight years ago. Canon Peter Hollingworth of the Brotherhood of St Laurence stated in a letter to the editor of the Australian some two weeks ago in relation to public housing:</PARA>
<PARA> In response to a belated recognition of the crisis brought about by its policies, the Federal Government has increased its direct funding for public housing by $71m. But the accumulated important shortages of those years-</PARA>
<PARA>He is referring to the previous years of this Administration-</PARA>
<PARA>require a substantially greater federal contribution. </PARA>
<PARA>Labor agrees with that and sees the only way of tackling public housing neglect as the instituting of a 10-year program to double the proportion of dwellings held in a variety of public tenures. We grant that this will need the provision of substantial base levels of national funding-some $500m a year-and, of course, a guaranteed real continuity of that funding, but the wasting away of public housing which has occurred in recent years is a disgrace to our nation. I have quoted Canon Peter Hollingworth. There would be few more respected figures tested in the fires of actual experience in attempting to deal with the problems of those who are required to seek public housing for their shelter, and he advocates that course. The Labor Party believes it is essential to undertake that course also. </PARA>
<PARA> As to home ownership, it is quite clear that the Australian dream of owning a home is vanishing under twin pressures-a pincer movement. There is a frightening escalation in interest rates, which is within the control of this Government. It controls interest rates in the home lending sector. On the other hand there is a reduction in the real incomes available to those paying off their home loans, whether it be by reduction of overtime or even reduction of the full five-day working week. When incomes are curtailed the money that goes into mortgage repayments becomes a tremendous percentage of the disposable income of the household. Of course, for those who find themselves without employment and therefore without income to sustain their repayments the situation is catastrophic. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of related measures can and will be taken by an incoming Labor government to try to remedy the situation of home buyers seeking loans and seeking to raise deposits. The problems are not only in the maintenance of repayments when there is a regime of high interest rates sustained by this Government's policies and exacerbated every day as the philosophy of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System takes hold amongst Government members, but also in the escalating cost of blocks of land within the Australian urban environment. A headline in the Weekend Australian of mid-September reads: 'Land shortage threat adds to home buyers woes'. It is a fact, as outlined in the newspaper report, that serious land shortages are threatening to develop, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland, and even in the Australian Capital Territory, which will add many thousands of dollars to the deposit required in order even to get a house off the ground or, indeed, to buy into a block of units built on this extremely expensive land. </PARA>
<PARA> The ideal would be to have some three-years stock of land ready for use in housing development. But for developers in a context of high interest rates it is increasingly uneconomic to hold stocks at those levels. Therefore it requires something other than market forces to remedy this situation, a situation which the Labor Party believes can be met in part by establishing land commissions and urban land councils with three-year stocks of land for residential development in our Australian urban areas. Of course, we would also encourage more cost- effective and uniform land subdivision methods. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt in the course of the afternoon one will hear remarks by Government defenders about the Budget, the March package and the impact they have had on restoring the fortunes of the housing sector. In the limited time available to me I will not have an opportunity to develop a counter argument fully. but I will deal with the Budget first. The Government announced a series of measures which no doubt will have some ameliorative effect. But the linchpin, the key to getting more money into the housing sector, contained in that Budget was the undertaking by the Government to seek from the Reserve Bank of Australia some $ 300m to release into lending for housing. For two months the Reserve Bank has refused to make that money available to the housing sector. For two months it has defied the Government and it continues to frustrate that key proposal in the Government's Budget strategy. Of course, the Government was promising more than it could guarantee to deliver but it will come as no surprise to Australians that this Government is in the business of making rash promises. But the fact is that the failure to come up with this $300m some two months after the Budget indication that the money would be made available has created yet more uncertainty in the funding of Australians' housing needs. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the March package was greeted with some ecstasy by the Housing Industry Association. Mr Kirkby-Jones, in a Press release for the Housing Industry Association on 18 March, stated that the housing policy initiatives would dramatically increase home ownership and be of immeasurable assistance to the industry. In the months that have elapsed some measurement has taken place. One finds in an August statement of Mr Kirkby-Jones on behalf of the Housing Industry Association a cry of pain, even taking into account the improved deposit assistance scheme and other measures undertaken in the March package. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> From a peak of 149,160 new dwelling commencements in 1980/81 it is estimated that home building activity slumped to below 130,000 commencements in 1981/82.</PARA>
<PARA>He expected 117,000 commencements in 1982-83. He concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> Thus, over a two year period-</PARA>
<PARA>Due to the policies of this Government, which is my interpolation, although that is the only context in which those remarks can be put-</PARA>
<PARA>new dwelling investment will have fallen by about $1.25 billion in real terms;</PARA>
<PARA>more than 40,000 jobs will have been lost. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, lost to the housing industry. The March package was condemned as a failure by the Housing Industry Association. The Budget strategy is non- operative in its key factor. The Labor Party listens to that cry of anguish from the Housing Industry Association. It listens to the despair of many millions of Australians, whether they be the homeless seeking basic shelter, the caravan dwellers in distressing situations-which will be outlined by my colleague Senator Jones-the public and private renters facing inadequate stocks of rental accommodation and escalating rents or the home buyers of Australia who are unable to finance the fulfilment of the very legitimate and, until the last five or six years of the Fraser Government, the very ordinary expectation that a home was within reach of a working life of repayments. </PARA>
<PARA> The incoming Federal Labor Government will be as vigorous as has been the Victorian State Labor Government in addressing these problems. But we will be even more effective because we will accept the national responsibility for meeting this basic social need and will generate employment with all the consequent good effects throughout the Australian economy. This will always be in co-operative consultation with other tiers of government and the housing industry. But it will be a leadership role which provide greater security for renters, restore confidence amongst home buyers, promote stability in the housing industry and fulfil our obligations as a national government to meet this social need in a fair and just way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a subject which is of undoubted importance to the Australian community and, I think, to the Australian Community's view of how it operates. The allegation in the matter of public importance brought forward by the Opposition is that there has been a failure of the Government to devise a national policy in order to provide adequate housing at a manageable cost for all Australians. I, of course, on behalf of the Government reject the accusation which is contained in those words. It is perhaps typical of the way we respond to events that the Senate should be debating a matter of public importance in those terms in the year in which, if one is concerned about the welfare housing situation, there has been a lift in Commonwealth expenditure of 27 per cent and a lift in total public expenditure on welfare housing-or public housing, to use Senator Tate's expression-of something like 38 per cent. In other words, there has been a very substantially increased commitment this year by all governments in recognition of the very real difficulties which some parts of the community face in the housing area. It is ironic that the matter should be brought before us in a year in which, for the first time, interest rate relief has been granted generally through the income tax system and a whole series of measures have been taken to meet the sorts of problems which suddenly seem to have impacted upon the Australian Labor Party and upon Senator Tate. It was interesting that the churches mentioned in the documents referred to by Senator Tate were so late in coming to the realisation that this was something which required public attention. They made their announcements about a year after the Government had turned its very intense intention to the matters that they are now so concerned about.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also get, by way of interjection and from Senator Tate's comments, concern about the fact that there is no longer a ministry which has the word 'housing' contained in it. The fact of the matter is that housing was part of the responsibilities of the Ministry of Housing and Construction. In the recent administrative re-arrangements, instead of having one non-Cabinet Minister concerned with housing matters, the elements of the housing administration have been put into either the Department of Social Security, which is my Department, or in the Department of Industry and Commerce, which is of course Mr Andrew Peacock's Department, formerly Sir Phillip Lynch's Department. There has been no doubt that the responsibilities which the Commonwealth Government recognises as being its responsibilities in this area are clearly represented in those departments. My Department is responsible for welfare housing activities and those programs which are meant to advance the ability of individual Australians to achieve home ownership. The responsibilities of the Commonwealth with respect to the economic conditions of the housing industry generally are now vested in the Department of Industry and Commerce, along with other equivalent industry matters. So in fact we now have a situation in which two of the Ministers in the Cabinet of the present Government have a direct interest and responsibility for elements of housing in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basic allegation made against the Government is that it has no national policy. I wish to refer very briefly to the fact that the Liberal Party federal platform reflects the policy which has been put forward by the Government over many years now as being its basic approach to housing. The Liberal Party platform, states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party is committed to the maximum possible level of home ownership as a means of private personal security, freedom of choice, economic benefit, and strengthening pride in the community, while also recognising the importance of rental accommodation. The Liberal Party places emphasis on the private sector having the central role in the supply of housing and housing finance within a competitive market. </PARA>
<PARA>And so on. There is no shortage of public indications of commitment by the Commonwealth Government to the maximum level of home ownership in Australia and, at the same time, there is a very proper appreciation of the fact that a significant proportion of Australians do not achieve home ownership and are dependent upon the rental market. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose that any policy has to be tested against results. It is an acknowledged fact that Australia has one of the highest levels of home ownership in the world. That is a situation which has been built up since the Second World War and which we have maintained. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is better, Senator Martyr, to ignore unpleasant facts which fly in the face of the proposition that one is trying to assert. Let us look at the figures for home ownership in Australia. In 1947 a little over 53 per cent of households owned their homes or were purchasing their own homes. That figure had risen to 63 per cent by 1954, a little over 70 per cent by 1961 and to 71.4 per cent in 1966. In 1971 it had fallen slightly to 68.8 per cent. In 1976 it was 68.4 per cent and in 1981 it had risen again to 70.1 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one looks at any sort of international comparison, it is immediately apparent that Australia has achieved and continues to maintain levels of home ownership which would be the envy of almost any country. In the United Kingdom, the comparable figure is about 50 per cent. In Canada, it is 62 per cent. In the United States, a country that we generally regard as having a great lead in most matters material, it is 65 per cent, and in West Germany, another country that is much admired by the Opposition, with its social democratic condition, we find a home ownership level of 33 per cent. Whilst acknowledging the difficulties which have been experienced by many Australians in the housing area over the last few years because of general economic conditions and in particular because of interest rates, I point to the achievements of successive Liberal governments in bringing about a level of home ownership in Australia which is and will remain very high. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the Government realised that there were problems emerging in the housing field. It was for that reason that we undertook a major review of our housing policies during 1981. That review identified four main problems which I think would be accepted around the chamber as having been real problems for many people in the community. The first was the availability of finance; the second was increasing mortgage repayments; the third was the deposit gap; and the fourth, for those who are renters, was increasing rent payments. The review involved our conducting extensive consultations with industry and with State governments and led to the very considerable changes in policy which were effected during 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to contrast the approach of the Government with the approach that was foreshadowed by Senator Tate on behalf of the Opposition. He made one promise that we can be quite sure will be delivered if Labor ever returns to government in this country, that is, that it will form some extra departments. We are told that Labor will have a new housing department, and whilst there may not be a lot more houses we can be quite sure that there will be lots more public servants employed to worry about the problem that we are concerned about. One firm promise made by Senator Tate was that we will have a housing department . He said also that a Labor government would control interest rates. He pointed out that government can control interest rates and ought to do so in this area. Yet one of the significant problems we have had in Australia over the last couple of years is the supply of housing finance. The only way that interest rates can be controlled successfully is either to provide taxpayer subsidies for those interest rates or to hold them down and to further limit the flow of funds into the housing area. It would be interesting to hear Senator Tate give a more detailed exposition of how the Labor Party's control of interest rates would achieve satisfactory housing policies. </PARA>
<PARA> The March housing package, which Senator Tate correctly predicted would be referred to in this debate, tackled a number of the problems which faced Australians seeking to buy and to maintain the ownership of their homes during this year. We sought and obtained an increased flow of money into the housing sector. We obtained an undertaking from the banks for an additional $400m for housing loans during the year to March 1983. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That flow is now under way. I had discussions with the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry just a few days ago. It is quite clear that there will be a satisfactory flow of funds over the coming months because of that undertaking of $400m made last March. At the same time, as part of the package, there was the replacement of the Homes Savings Grant Scheme with a Home Deposit Assistance Scheme. This meant that we were changing a scheme which had been available for some time and which provided a retrospective grant to people who had purchased their own homes with a scheme which would provide a grant which would assist people actually to overcome the deposit gap. The new scheme provides for a grant of $2,500 and a family bonus of up to $1,000 for families with two or more dependent children. Under that scheme the grant is paid within a month of application and is therefore available prior to settlement, which is of important assistance to those who wish to purchase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time in March we introduced a special tax rebate scheme for first home buyers. This meant that those who were within the first five years of purchase were assisted to get over those early years of high repayments. For those who are concerned about the non-home buying or owning section of the population, and the Government certainly is, we foreshadowed a mortgage and rent relief scheme which would operate from this financial year, with the Commonwealth offering $20m a year for over three years to be matched by the States. Those schemes are just currently getting under way. That was our response earlier this year to the acknowledged and real problems faced by sectors of the housing market. Having examined that aspect, we turned our attention to the real problems which also exist in the welfare housing field. That area had received recent attention. There had been a renegotiation of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement which involved very extensive consultations with the States and indeed with interest groups who made submissions in response to advertisements requesting submissions. The new Common- wealth-State Housing Agreement, which was concluded last year, introduced considerable flexibility for the States in regard to their expenditure of funds provided under the Agreement. For the first time it gave a base level of commitment on the part of the Commonwealth to a minimum of $200m a year and it set the scene for the consideration which we gave public or welfare housing during 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> I have previously drawn to the attention of the Senate the very significant changes in funding which were announced and introduced at the time of the Premiers Conference. Last year the Commonwealth's contribution under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement was $262m. This year it was increased to $ 332m-an increase of about 27 per cent. At the same time, we advised the States that if they chose to divert greater State resources to the housing area they could receive additional parts of their loan funds on a concessional basis. The success of those Commonwealth initiatives is evidenced in the announcements contained in State Budgets brought down over the last month or so. In Australia last year, in 1981-82 public expenditure on welfare housing by the Commonwealth and the States totalled $653m. This year the figure is $903m, on my calculation an increase of just under 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Those changes, those increased efforts by both the Commonwealth and the States, reflect an acknowledgement of the reality of the problems that Senator Tate raised. I do not deny their existence, nor does the Government. What I am saying is that the Government, in examining the problems over the last year and a half, has acknowledged the need to adjust policies and to increase effort in this area . Evidence is now before us that there will be a very significantly increased effort during this year. The State of Victoria was referred to by Senator Tate. He was pleased with the fact that there was a very substantial increase in housing expenditure in the recent Budget brought down by the Victorian Government. I simply point out by way of response that the Victorian Government was able to pick up the offer which we made at the Premiers Conference, which enabled the States to get access to funds at very concessional rates if they were prepared to put those funds into the housing area. So one can point to an increase of over $137m in expenditure as the States have sought to bring themselves within the new arrangement that the Commonwealth offered them at the Premiers Conference in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be of assistance to those who might read the record of this debate to have incorporated in Hansard a table showing the funds provided for welfare housing over the period 1973-74 to 1982-83. It has previously appeared in Hansard. It shows the variation in the contribution of the Commonwealth over a period, the increased responsibilities assumed by the States, the upturn in the expenditure undertaken by the Commonwealth this year and the very benign effect of the concessional interest provisions which have been made available to the States to encourage their greater effort in this area. I seek leave of the Senate to incorporate this table in Hansard. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The time that we have to debate this subject allows little opportunity to canvass the many measures which have been undertaken in an attempt to tackle the problems of those parts of the Australian community that are having difficulties in respect of housing. I think it would be well known now that the recent Budget provides all home buyers with an entitlement to seek the assistance of income tax rebates if they are paying interest rates in excess of 10 per cent on the purchase of their housing. There has been some criticism of that provision by members on the other side of the Senate. You, Mr Acting Deputy President, have drawn attention to the problems which many suburban home buyers are experiencing and to their need for the assistance given in the recent Budget. But you will have noticed that there is not uniform support for that on your side of the chamber. The Government has little doubt that in the broad reach of Australian society, with its real interest in maintaining home ownership, the changes made in the recent Budget are both necessary and widely welcomed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a whole series of other, lesser provisions which are of very great significance to those in the community who might be more needy. I quickly point to the doubling of expenditure on crisis accommodation for families, a new program started last year with expenditure going from $2m last year to $4m this year. Probably the most significant assistance given is that given to pensioners by way of supplementary assistance. That was increased from a maximum of $5 to $ 8 a week in February this year and was increased again in the current Budget, to take effect from November, to a maximum of $10 a week. That is a very significant expenditure item. A total of $165m worth of rental assistance will be provided to pensioners under that program during the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> Still other people in the community are dependent upon the forms of subsidised accommodation provided by the Commonwealth through the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act. Again, one can look at the figures and see very clearly a significant increase in the Commonwealth's commitment under that program during the current year. It is a recognition of need and a recognition of the more subdued conditions in the building industry. Homeless youth have received attention. That matter was debated in the Senate recently and I will not go over all that ground again. There has been an increased interest by the Commonwealth in the field of homeless youth and an increased provision of funds. Further steps have been taken under the Homeless Persons Assistance Act. Indeed, across the range of housing programs one can see a real attempt by the Government, within the broad framework of policy that I previously outlined, to respond to the needs which exist in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> This debate takes place at a time when there are some hopeful signs. The increased expenditure in the welfare housing area will be of assistance both to those who require public housing and to the building industry, which of course is such an important employer. We have early signs of a weakening in the pressures on interest rates. I do not wish to speculate on the future of interest rates; I think all of us, from the Treasurer (Mr Howard) down, are extremely wary of that. However, I think all of us would note with pleasure the reductions in prime lending rates and the reductions in interest rates on Australian savings bonds, which do suggest that there is an easing of interest rates generally in a way which may lead to assistance in the housing field. But, of course, the scope for reduction in home loan interest rates will depend on the flow of funds into the banks and building societies over the next few weeks and a further sustained decline in the longer term Government bond rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Tate and the Opposition have brought before the Senate a matter which is certainly of public importance. There can be no doubt that home ownership is a central part of what many Australians see as their normal lives. For others the availability of accommodation at a reasonable rate is critically important. The Government acknowledges that in the current economic conditions there have been real difficulties and pressure points. I hope that in the brief time I have had to speak on this matter today I have been able to indicate that the Government has tried to respond, and indeed has responded to those pressure points and has moved to assist the great mass of the Australian people to whom reasonable shelter is central to their welfare. </PARA>

The problem facing the people of Australia, the problem of housing people in Australia, is certainly very near to our hearts and is one of the matters that we wish to debate today. I was quite surprised to hear the Minister early in his remarks attack the churches for submitting a very late report. House and Home, the booklet produced by the church, contained some very good facts. I believe that it really draws attention to some of the problems that exist in this country. If the Minister is really interested in what is happening to the people in relation to housing, as he said he is, I think he, like some members of the Opposition and the Australian Democrats, should read House and Home and take some note of some of the points that that publication makes in relation to the problems facing this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a lot of facts and a lot of opinions. If the honourable senator reads this publication, he will find outlined very clearly some of the problems that we will face.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me deal for a moment with Government policy and the 1982-83 Budget. I believe that the Budget fails to provide the housing sector with the stability which it requires to enable it to meet the need for housing or, for that matter, the social need in Australia. The Budget attempts to cover only a small section of the community. It does not address itself to the real problems facing many low income earners or, for that matter, people in need of better or, in some cases, any form of real accommodation. I believe that the policy of the Government outlined in the Budget is very short term and selective. It does not really get to the heart of the problem. If one looks at the deposit assistance scheme which provides for grants of $2,500 to $3,000 and the new rebate which allows people to claim, in 1982-83, a concession of 30c in the dollar on the amount of interest that they pay on their housing loan, from any source, over and above a rate of 10 per cent on loans of up to $60,000 of mortgage and other loan arrangements, one would have to say that something is better than nothing. But I do not believe that these measures redress the problems that exist. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major problems relates to low income earners in the community-the pensioner, the single wife, the single parent, the unemployed, the youth with no home or who is running the streets. All of these people could be covered by some policy. All of these persons needed to be catered for in the Budget brought down by the Government. But, in fact, this Government has been very selective in terms of assistance. One knows that the Government will not face a great deal of expenditure in respect of the deposit assistance scheme. It is very difficult for young people in our community to raise somewhere in the vicinity of $25,000 which is the amount needed to put down a deposit on a house. The cost of a block of land in suburban Brisbane-I am talking about probably one of the better class of blocks-is $45,000. This is the asking price for land in that city. If we reduce the price of land to, say, $25,000 and add to that amount between $45,000 and $50,000 as the cost of a house, we are looking at an all up payment of some $70,000. I emphasise that $25,000 for a block of land seems to me rather conservative. But that illustration gives us some idea of the problems faced by young people in meeting the deposit requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> How many young couples in the community will be able to budget to save $25,000 to be eligible to receive a grant under the deposit assistance scheme? Two matters worry me in this respect. Firstly, I am worried about how they are going to save $25,000. Secondly, I do not know how they are going to save in a period of uncertainty of employment. They will be aware of the fact that part of the sum that they are saving to accumulate $25,000 may have to be used to meet their needs if they are unemployed. One has only to look at the employment figures to realise that this is a real problem which must be faced by people who are trying to save the required amount of money to qualify under this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security referred to the deposit assistance scheme. He talked about the rebate in relation to interest payments. As I said, one has to accept that something is better than nothing. But I draw the attention of the Senate to the IPA Review which is published by the Institute of Public Affairs. This organisation does not have too much to say in support of the Australian Labor Party. At page 63 of this publication, dated July-September 1982, the following comment is made:</PARA>
<PARA> The housing interest rebates are even more non-discriminatory. Those with high incomes, expensive houses and large mortgages will benefit the most. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what I am saying to the Minister. It seems to me that what the Government has done is to create something that looks good. As Senator Tate pointed out, the first Press statements that were released following the Budget showed that these proposals were received with some favourable comment from the community and those people involved in the building industry. However, people later started to realise what this Government had done to them, that it really had not produced anything in the Budget that would relieve the problems of the housing industry or provide some benefits in housing for the people of Australia . </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this Government's policy has been selective. It is short term and it does not consider the sorts of problems that we will face in the future. It does not take into consideration the low wage earners and those people on lower incomes. I draw the attention of the Senate to a report of the Indicative Planning Council. It seems to me to be somewhat of a pity that, because of time problems and the structure of dealing with business in this place, we were not able to discuss this report when it was presented. I believe that reports from this organisation have been brought down on about eight occasions. The report gives an outline of the industry and makes some forecasts in relation to what is happening to housing in Australia. It is a report that this Government should take some note of. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to read some of the points made in the report. The following comment is made in the executive summary under the heading 'Scope':</PARA>
<PARA> The report provides at the National and State/Territory levels forecasts of industry activity for 1982-83, estimates of industry capacity over the triennium 1982-83 to 1984-85 and estimates of housing demand over a variety of time frames . It also highlights issues affecting the industry which are relevant to activity levels, capacity or demand. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to outline some of its background. This is the eighth major report. It is not something new. It is not something the Government would not have before it. It is not something that the Government should not take some note of. It is prepared by the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry. Its membership include representatives from the industry and government organisations with an interest in housing. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the heading 'Major Findings', the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Housing activity is expected to decline substantially in 1981-82 and ease further in 1982-83-</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose one would have to comment that we were told in a newspaper report today that there had been an extension of the amount of money lent for housing approvals. I accept that and the report accepts it. The report points out that there might be some further activity at the end of 1982 and the beginning of 1983. But it then goes on to ask what will happen in the future if this Government pursues the same types of policies that it now has. The report states :</PARA>
<PARA> . . . dwelling commencements, after increasing strongly in 1980-81 to 149,160 are estimated to have fallen by almost 16 per cent to 126,000 in 1981-82 and are forecast to fall to 118,000 in 1982-83-</PARA>

<PARA>That sort of forecast has been put down by the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry in a report which is available to the Government. Without quoting too much of the report, I go on a little further to page 28, which states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Surely the honourable senator does not think that these people should not be housed. Surely he does not think that there should not be some requirement of government to have some responsibility for those people. Let us look at what the Government has done in relation to pensioners, single income families, the unemployed, young married people and people living in rental accommodation. Some pensioners in Queensland who live in rental accommodation are being charged in the vicinity of $100 to $120 a week by landlords. That places them in a difficult situation. To alleviate this problem two or three pensioners live in the same establishment. The Department of Social Security then puts pressure on them by claiming that a male is living with a female as man and wife and they are not entitled to the benefits which are paid by the Commonwealth. We have forced those people into a situation where they cannot pay the rent. Even the extra $5 or $8 a week which is to be paid to help them to pay the rent will not go anywhere near the amount which they are being charged within the metropolitan area of Brisbane. I believe the Government and the Minister need to have a very close look at what is happening within the Department of Social Security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to the situation at Gladstone where people are living in caravans. A non -political report-it was composed by members of the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party-which was brought down in the Senate pointed out very clearly the problems that exist in a fast developing area such as Gladstone and the problems facing people who cannot gain housing and have to live in caravans and in allotments. The report pointed out that there were no facilities for children and transport facilities were pushed to the limits and could not handle the number of people living in the area. I notice that Senator Haines has a copy of House and Home. A reference was made to caravans in House and Home. I will not read the article but I will draw the attention of the Senate to an advertisement which points out very clearly what is happening to housing in Australia. The advertisement states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might have been taken into consideration, but things have changed somewhat since then. In relation to the housing situation in this country, I believe things are now on the improve. With regard to what I might call ordinary housing, it seems that the low was reached in April and things are now beginning to improve. Just yesterday it was announced that the banks had approved housing loans totalling $328m during August. At the same time last year the amount was somewhat lower. In July the figure was $307m. My feeling is that every person should have a house in which to live and in which he has either a share or can contribute towards. All young persons, particularly those facing marriage, have the right to expect that at some stage in their lives-not too far down the track-they will be able to organise the owning of a house of some form in this country. When there are two wage earners in a family the prospect of owning a home, of buying a home, is not too bad at all. Some couples have a very large combined income. Provided they manage their money in a sensible way they can save significantly and purchase a home without too much trouble. I acknowledge that with the interest rates on housing loans being at their present levels the repayments can be quite high. I am pleased to see that so many people have such confidence in the future of this country that they are prepared, even with high interest rates, to plan and start building a home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a shortage of houses in some areas. I believe there always will be, particularly for people who are in serious need. Three groups which immediately come to mind are one-parent families, young people who for one reason or another cannot live with their parents, and older folk. As other speakers have said, this Government has done a great deal to help those in need. While there is an increase in population there will be a constant need for houses to be built. Any member or senator who leaves Canberra-I believe Canberra is well served with houses-and goes back to his or her State and finds no housing matter placed before him must live in a very lucky area indeed. I believe there will always be a shortage of housing. It is a problem which has been with us for a long time. The situation concerning the number of people who own their own homes is much better now than it was following the war. During a lot of that time a Liberal- Country Party Government has been in power in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> That is something which we have to remember. This Government wants people to own their own home. It wants the efforts and energies of people to be channelled into building, buying and investing in their own home. The Government regards housing as an important area. Those who heard the Minister for Social Security ( Senator Chaney) speak a little while ago will recognise that. I do not believe that is true of the Opposition. The Opposition would like to see the Government own and interfere to a great extent in the area of housing. The Opposition does not want little capitalists. I believe we would have a much worse housing situation if Labor ever gets control of the treasury bench. In relation to housing I worry only about those in need. Those people who want a very large house do not receive my sympathy at all. People who think that by changing the government they will magically get another house should remember what occurred when the previous Labor Government was in power. We must remember what it did to the housing industry as it tried to restructure society, as it used to call it. If those people remember that I know where their vote will go in the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has not been sitting still. It recognises that the provision of houses, particularly for the needy, has to be a real priority and it has provided many benefits for people, particularly those who are having to pay high interest rates. Many people will benefit from the new tax reductions which will come in soon. Just yesterday the Government lowered the interest rate on Australian Savings Bonds, which I believe will lead to the removal of an aberration, a distortion, in the flow of funds in the monetary system. It will allow more money to flow into the building societies and savings banks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think 11 December. As today's Australian says, the latest bond move is the kindest cut of all. It is kind because it will enable some people, as interest rates gradually come down, to obtain houses. According to the article, some of the banks have said that the drop of 1 per cent in the bond rate, to 13.75 per cent, is not quite enough to stop people investing in the bonds. That has yet to be seen. When there are worries about the economy people naturally tend to play it safe and Australian Savings Bonds are a very secure and good investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sure that all honourable senators support actively the concept of adequate housing being available for all people of all ages. I do not believe that there will be any argument about that, but one does not get more housing by having too much government interference, particularly in regard to what we might call ordinary housing. One does not assist the situation by artificially forcing interest rates down. If that happens the money supply for housing is reduced and fewer people can obtain money to build a home. </PARA>
<PARA> Some young people are so fortunate as to be in a position to be helped by their parents to build a house. Some older folk are so fortunate as to find accommodation with their children. Others are able to look after themselves in a unit or small house, but there is an ever-growing number of older people who, for a number of reasons, cannot live with their children or provide for themselves. Australians are tending to live a lot longer and we must continue to expand the facilities available to this group. In living their ordinary lives they have contributed greatly to the development of Australia and we have now a responsibility, one that is well recognised by this Government, to repay them in their twilight years. That is a time when the nation can show its gratitude and discharge its obligation. I believe that the Government is doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> Housing is a matter of importance, a fact that I believe all governments, be they Liberal or Labor, do recognise. I do not like to make political points about it but I must say that the Liberal policy of emphasising private housing, and making maximum finance available at sensible interest rates, is better than the Government trying to build houses and then rent them to people. I believe that in housing there are good signs for the future; that interest rates will come down just as those in the United States have come down. Lending is on the increase again and, after the low that was reached a few months ago, confidence is returning to the housing market. As I and others have stated before, the provision for welfare housing is continually being increased. </PARA>
<PARA> On the day on which the Australian Labor Party, which largely is backed by the unions, has placed before the Senate a motion that it is a matter of public importance that we discuss 'The failure of the Goverment to devise a national policy in order to provide adequate housing at a manageable cost for all Australians', on the front page of the Canberra Times appears the heading ' Building unions seek $40 rise'. That refers to a rise of $40 a week. That will affect 100,000 workers, including carpenters, joiners, bricklayers, stone-masons , plasterers and will add tremendously to the cost of a house. Such increases will affect people trying to obtain a house quite as much as will high interest rates, but interest rates can come down, wage costs never do. Perhaps the matter of public importance should have been worded:</PARA>
<PARA> The failure of the building unions to recognise that their greed in seeking large pay rises will lead to some people in Australia not being able to afford to build their own home. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me a great deal of pleasure to join in this debate today. My role is to support my colleagues in regard to this matter by looking at the current situation in the Northern Territory, where the Federal Government has had the responsibility for housing over the years. I will look at the special problems that exist in the Northern Territory and at what can be done to improve the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I move into that area I must respond to a couple of the comments which were made by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). He said that there had been increases in housing grants. I propose to cite the figures given in Budget Paper No. 7. The honourable senator mentioned welfare housing so I will mention pensioner housing grants in the Northern Territory. The amounts allotted have been: In 1979-80, $1.5m; 1980-81, $1.6m; 1981-82, $0.5m; and 1982- 83 also $0.5m. That certainly does not represent an increase at all. The amounts have not even kept up with inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> If we move from the Northern Territory to look at the scene overall we see that Commonwealth net advances, in constant prices, for housing in the States and the Territories in 1982-83 are less than one third the amount provided in 1974-75. The actual figures are: In 1974-75, $975m; 1975-76, $935m; 1976-77, $835m; 1977- 78, $674m; 1978-79, $460m; 1979-80, $330m; 1980-81, $299m; 1981-82, $237m; and 1982-83, $290m. In other words, in constant terms, the amount to be advanced in 1982-83 is one third of the amount advanced in 1974-75. Yet Senator Townley had the audacity to come into this place and say that the Australian Labor Party had not done the right thing by housing. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at those figures a little further. The cumulative real reduction in public housing funds over that eight-year period has been a staggering $3,740m. The maintenance of public housing funds at the 1974-75 level would have meant the provision of an additional 75,000 dwellings. Yet the Government has the cheek to say that Labor was not giving attention to housing. The Minister also spoke about home ownership. I think he was very game to do so. At present it is more difficult to get a job than it has ever been in our history. Equally, it is more difficult to get a house than it has ever been in our history. Before World War I, according to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, it took 18 months' pay of the average worker to buy a house. This year it takes four years of the average wage to buy a house. The CSIRO report made this comment:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the problem with the affordable home-which was once affordable by about 80 per cent of eligible Australians-is that most of us cannot now afford one!</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the term has no meaning. Senator Chaney said that the Government wants to keep the levels of home ownership high; that he believes the present Government will do that. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) does not agree with him. The Treasurer has stated: 'We need to accept a declining level in home ownership'. Senator Chaney then made a few more gratuitous remarks about Labor, which I think I have covered. He said also that the flow of funds to housing would continue-a view not shared by most of the economists. Senator Townley made the same sort of comment. I think such comments fall into the same region of pious hope into which most of the Government's propositions fall. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister referred to increases in assistance and mentioned the assistance given to pensioners. We must ask, when we use figures such as this, what is the base figure from which this wonderful increase has come? The Minister chose to talk about the generosity of the Government to pensioners. I am afraid his view is not shared by the Australian Council of Social Service or by any of the other major agencies. They indicate that under the present Government we have more aged pensioners and other pensioners living below the poverty line. Later Senator Chaney, by way of an interjection when Senator Jones was speaking, challenged the church's figures and said that they were rubbery. He smiled when the Opposition referred to the fact that they might be a little bit like the Budget figures. Let me assure the Minister that the figures given by the churches and the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry were valid at the time. The bases on which the figures were taken were valuable and could have been used by the Minister. It is the usual technique of the present Government to try to discourage any sort of criticism by attacking personalities . </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the situation which exists in the Northern Territory. I am drawing my facts from a report produced at the end of last year on Northern Territory housing needs. I have no doubt that the report will be challenged by the Minister in due course as containing some sort of rubbery figures. The figures have been produced by various departments in the Northern Territory and I am sure they will be valid and that we can make use of them. First, I turn to the situation of home ownership in the Northern Territory. The percentage of people living in their own homes in the six urban centres of the Northern Territory is 29.1 per cent. The national average is 72 per cent. That means that in excess of 70 per cent of the people in the the Northern Territory are living in rented homes, government homes or caravans. I should like to talk about caravans because they have already been mentioned in this debate. The number of people living in caravans in the Northern Territory is 12 per cent of the population. The national average is 0.5 per cent. The number living in caravans in the Northern Territory is 24 times the national average. I do not need to go into that socially undersirable situation. I refer to the fact that the situation that exists in the Northern Territory at the present time has resulted because of the Federal Government's lack of activity. In case the Government wants to talk about the situation that applied when the Labor Government was in office I remind it of the wonderful work done by that Government in 1975 following Cyclone Tracy. It instituted the greatest building program ever seen. It is not surprising that the people of the Northern Territory, after Cyclone Tracy, said: 'Thank God for a Labor government'. After a cyclone in Queensland this Government sent a telegram of condolence and nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to move from home ownership in the Northern Territory to the renting of houses. This becomes pretty much an academic exercise because there are virtually no rental houses in the Northern Territory. The Real Estate Institute of Australia suggests that we need a total of 3 per cent to 4 per cent unoccupied houses to give some sort of balance so that a reasonable number of houses are available for rental. This does not exist in the Northern Territory, and we have unrealistic rents. I should like to look quickly at the results of a survey of rents carried out by the Real Estate Institute of Australia. The survey showed that the weekly rental for a three bedroom home in Sydney was $80; in Melbourne, $70; in Brisbane, $80; in Adelaide, $60; in Perth, $40; in Canberra, $85; and in Darwin, $150. Again, I point out that very few houses are available for rental in the Northern Territory. Senator Jones made the point, of course, that people who live in these houses have very little or no chance to save the money for a deposit on a home. According to figures produced by the Australian Bureau of Statistics the cost of homes in the Northern Territory is 27 per cent above the national average. What is the reason for this? Why is it so expensive? First, freight costs are considerable because of the distance goods have to be transported. Secondly, sales tax is paid on freight. That is something which I have asked this Government to look at but it has refused point blank to do so. That means that people in the Northern Territory have to pay sales tax on freight. The freight cost is included on everything that is brought to the Northern Territory, and we have to pay sales tax on that freight. So much for a government that is trying to bring down the cost of housing! The Government is not fair dinkum, but we knew that of course because in the 1981 Budget it put a 2.5 per cent increase on the cost of building materials. It wanted to tax people on building materials. That would have pushed up the cost of housing. Fortunately, and rightly so, this proposition was knocked out in the Senate. What occurred in 1982? We saw a 7 per cent tax on hand tools and construction equipment. Again, that is an action of a government that is not dinkum about wanting to bring down the cost of housing. Also in the Northern Territory, of course, we have the problems of cyclone proofing. We must also consider that work can be carried out only in the dry season and that there are very few major businesses so there is not much competition. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Federal involvement in the housing situation in the Northern Territory. I ask honourable senators to remember that the housing position in the Northern Territory was inherited from the Commonwealth Government. The same situation applies to housing as education, about which the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) has often talked in this place . He has said that when he handed over responsibility for education to the Northern Territory Government in 1978 it was the best system in Australia. I do not have time to go into the comments that have been made in the Northern Territory since education was handed over in 1978 but certainly very few people have suggested that it is the best system in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to mention also the situation of the Commonwealth public servants who were working in the Northern Territory in 1977-78 prior to independence who wanted to buy their own homes. The Federal Government put a freeze on the purchase of government homes. Public servants had lived in these homes for 10 years and, in many cases, had spent thousands of dollars on improvements. What did the Federal Government do? It said: 'You cannot buy them'. In other words the Government reneged on the sort of contracts it had made with people when they had agreed to go to the Northern Territory. The Government broke the employment conditions which led to disgruntled public servants. This built up a feeling of low morale for years in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> This report on the Northern Territory deals with a number of areas. It claims that the Federal Government has relegated housing to a lower political, social and economic priority. This conscious decision of the Government has affected the Northern Territory. The Treasurer talks of the need to accept declining levels of home ownership. He thinks that home ownership is no longer the Australian dream, despite what Senator Chaney and Senator Townley have said. The Northern Territory people were told: 'It is one of those things you cannot have' . Funds under the housing agreements have declined in real terms. We have seen the dramatic figures which show that the funds are one-third of what they were in 1974-75. Despite what Senator Townley said there is very little prospect of relief from the current high interest rates on housing finance. In other words, a summary of the report is this: Home prices are rising, and housing finance is scarce and can be obtained only at a high cost. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Tate has indicated what an Australian Labor Party would do on the national scene. I should like to indicate what needs to be done on the Northern Territory scene. First, we should make sure that sufficient serviced land is available at a reasonable price. The price ought to be kept down to cost ; in other words, the amount of money that it costs the Government to service the land ought to be the price at which it is handed over to the buyer. We want to keep the Housing Commission involved. We do not want to involve it only in welfare housing, as the Minister wants, but in the whole area of cheaper housing , because that is the key. The key to the whole issue is the encouragement of cheaper housing. At this stage I should like to commend the Northern Territory Government for the work it has done in trying to get cheaper housing for the people of the Northern Territory. It has run competitions. It has established a small village where people can go to see a range of cheaper housing which they can perhaps build on their own block of land. In the same way, the Northern Territory Government has encouraged the building of a variety of houses. We do not need all houses to be three bedroom houses. We need townhouses, flats, two bedroom homes and houses of different sizes so that there can be movement between them. </PARA>
<PARA> An Australian Labor Party government would provide the advice that people in the Northern Territory need. It would conduct research, as has been indicated by Senator Tate. It would use the results of such research to assist the people in the Northern Territory to buy cheaper homes; in this way they can work towards having their own homes. An Australian Labor Party government would review the home loans scheme so that it generally assisted people on lower incomes to buy their own homes. That is not the sort of situation we have seen where a person who wanted to buy a $97,000 house was given a loan because he was able to raise that sort of money. The Opposition's policy is aimed not only at welfare housing but also at housing for the ordinary, average person. The Liberals used to talk about the dream home, but it has done nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> An Australian Labor Party government would make sure that the scheme served as a complement to funds available from financial institutions. It would also encourage the savings banks to provide more finance for housing. In the Northern Territory, only 22 per cent of deposits are available for housing. The national average is 51 per cent; it is 22 per cent in the Northern Territory. An Australian Labor Party government would ensure that that amount was increased so that money would come from the right place, the banks. The Opposition has outlined what needs to be done. It has briefly commented on Government activity and inactivity. It has clearly shown the failure of the Government to devise or implement a national policy on housing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week in the speech I made on the States (Works and Housing) Assistance Bill 1982 I accused the Government of being insufficiently committed to the provision of public housing. I noted then that the Government had failed to consider the increasing demand for public housing, a demand which I pointed out was increasing because of the damage being done by other government action, specifically its commitment to the deregulation of interest rates. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), in response last week and again in his speech today, made the point that the Government has allocated a total of $903m to welfare housing for the 1982-83 financial year, an increase of about 45 per cent. For that, of course, he is to be commended. Yet I suggest that this does not alter the fact that the amount of reasonably priced, adequate housing available in Australia at the moment is patently insufficient. The increasing unemployment situation will exacerbate that problem; a problem which is succinctly outlined in House and Home, the document I referred to last week which was put out by the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace. It is a document which, of course, has been referred to repeatedly, and with some justification, during the debate today. That document notes, amongst other things, that whilst the average number of rooms per dwelling in Australia is five and a half, 2 per cent of dwellings, some 80,000, have only one or two rooms and 5 per cent of dwellings, 200,000, do not have a kitchen or do not have a bathroom, or do not have either. The document goes on to make the point:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For those who do share in the available housing, the distribution is unequal.</PARA>
<PARA>It cites, for example, the 40,000 people who live alone in housing with four or more bedrooms and compares that with the 160,000 people who live in groups of eight or more in housing which has only one, two or three bedrooms. That is a situation which I suggest we tend to associate more with China or countries equally populated, such as India. </PARA>
<PARA> The Women's Information Switchboard in Adelaide receives a very large number of calls about accommodation problems. Most of these, naturally enough, are from women and, in the main, are from women with children. If women are on the widows pension or the supporting parents benefit the only way they can survive is to move in with somebody else in the same situation and to become part of that group mentioned in House and Home. It is not easy to live with another family, even if one is related to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it very likely is harder in some cases. I presume the honourable senator is speaking from experience. In many cases these women want desperately, as do most Australians, to live on their own, independently, with their children while they recover from whatever trauma it is that has put them into that situation, generally a marriage breakdown. Often the arrangements they are able to make are of very short duration and lead to a very unstable life- style, which is particularly traumatic for their children, many of whom already have a damaged sense of security caused by the breakdown of their parents' relationship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Women's Information Switchboard was kind enough this afternoon to provide me with a number of examples of the sorts of problems which are referred to it and which come from families on the South Australian Housing Trust priority listing. I interpolate at this point that the South Australian Housing Trust does a magnificent job with the limited resources available to it. One case the Switchboard cited to me was that of a woman who arrived from Portland-I am sorry , from Poland-last month. Portland may be, as far as some South Australians are concerned, just as much a foreign country or an element of a foreign country, as Poland, but this lady actually came from Poland. Her husband had sponsored her and her three children aged 18, 15 and 5 years, to come to this country. As soon as they arrived he put them in a rented house, took all her money and deserted her for another woman. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is, of course, exacerbated by the fact that no one in the family can speak English. They have no family here, no friends here and so far have the support of only a few members of the Polish community. Her rent is $55 a week and her landlord is now harassing her and saying that she should be paying $70 a week. To date, at least as far as the Women's Information Switchboard is concerned, the Department of Social Security has not decided what sort of pension, if any, she is eligible to receive. She has received only two payments of special benefits, one of $130 and one of $180. Of course, her 18-year-old daughter receives the unemployment benefit. It is people like this woman and her children who are forced to rely on those houses supplied by the South Australian Housing Trust. But if we are to believe an article which appeared in the Australian on 5 October this year, the State Housing Trust could face bankruptcy . The article stated in its opening paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> The South Australian Housing Trust could face bankruptcy within five years if it is forced increasingly to rely on semi-government loans charging market interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a rather absurd situation to force an organisation such as a State housing trust or a housing commission into liquidation when it is struggling desperately to provide as much low-cost or low-rental housing to people as it can. An article which appeared in the Adelaide Advertiser on 24 July-in the middle of winter, I point out-was entitled 'Homeless teenagers sleep in clothing bins'. It elaborated on that by saying, in relation to the Noarlunga area, an extremely southern and rather isolated area of suburban Adelaide:</PARA>
<PARA> Homeless teenagers are sleeping in St Vincent de Paul clothing bins, under bridges and on bus seats in Noarlunga, according to a local welfare worker. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA> She said Noarlunga's critical accommodation shortage meant hundreds of young people were homeless. </PARA>
<PARA> 'One-fifth of the 100 seeking refuge I've seen this year were sleeping rough.' Mrs Pichler said. </PARA>
<PARA> In one case, seven youths were sharing a two-bedroom house. </PARA>
<PARA> 'A 16-year old I saw had been arrested for illegally using a motor vehicle,' . . . </PARA>
<PARA> 'But it was his third night out and, after sleeping under a bridge-</PARA>
<PARA>I stress again that this is in July--</PARA>
<PARA>he couldn't resist the comfort of an unlocked car. </PARA>
<PARA>As I pointed out last week, these young people are particularly vulnerable when it comes to trying to find access to housing. Amongst the others who are vulnerable-the point is made again in House and Home-are social security beneficiaries whose weekly income is frequently below the poverty line; young families, especially those with children, who are at present renting, particularly in the private market; and, of course, Aborigines. Although, as I pointed out last week, the problem is worst in city areas, it is also spreading to country areas as people move there in the hope of finding more available accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Women's Information Switchboard in Adelaide is aware of a woman with two children-a boy aged 12 and a girl aged 10-living in a converted bus in the South Australian country area of Mt Barker. I understand the bus is primitive in many respects, having for instance only commode-type toilet facilities. All her attempts to find more suitable accommodation within her means-she is on a widows ' pension-have failed despite the fact that she has tried everything from emergency housing to direct approaches for private rental. Part of the problem comes from the fact that she is, quite understand- ably, concerned to maintain some stability for her children and therefore wants to remain in the Mt Barker area, where the little boy and girl are attending school. If she moves too far away from there and wants to maintain their educative stability she will be unable to afford their bus fees. The last the Women's Information Switchboard heard was that the owner of the bus had given her 11 days to vacate. These are not isolated examples. They concern merely a few of the growing number of people who are forced to turn to charitable organisations of one sort or another, to sleep out in the open, to share cramped accommodation with other people and in effect to live in totally inadequate forms of shelter-certainly for a country such as Australia, which prides itself on being civilised. While this sort of situation continues, I suggest that we can do nothing other than to argue that this Government has failed in the past seven years to devise a national policy to provide adequate housing at a manageable cost for all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA> The failure of the Government to devise a national policy in order to provide adequate housing at a manageable cost for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>All speakers from both sides of the House have agreed that the lack of housing is a matter of public importance. The fact that there is not adequate housing- that too many people are not in housing of a suitable standard-is not a situation that anybody on either side of the chamber approves. We do have, and have had, an overall policy; this was enunciated by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) when he spoke in this debate. It is a policy which works in conjunction with all the States. But I must say that housing is basically a State responsibility. Although plenty of people try to level accusations at the Federal Government, for what it is doing or what it should be doing in a whole host of matters, housing is basically a State responsibility. We channel our finances through the States. Despite that, there are two Ministers in the Federal Government who have a responsibility for housing. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not that housing has a low priority or, as has been suggested, a lower priority than it should have. I reiterate that it is basically a State responsibility. We provide funds and channel those funds through the States for their implementation in various ways. We recognise that there are problems. As I said at the outset, none of us is happy that there are people without adequate housing; we would be most inhuman if we were. We recognise the problems and, through the co-operation of Federal and State governments, since the war the percentage of people either owning or buying their own home has increased from 54 per cent-I think that figure was in 1947-to 70 per cent now, which is not a bad record. The Minister outlined some of the percentages in other countries. When we consider that in the United Kingdom 50 per cent of people are buying or own their own homes, in Canada the figure is 62 per cent, in the United States of America it is 65 per cent and in West Germany it is 33 per cent, Australia has a pretty good percentage. </PARA>
<PARA> In fairness to our country, before we rubbish it too much-which seems to be a pastime of Australians-we should look at the peculiar position of Australia. Considering the large land mass of Australia vis-a-vis its small population and the situation of the population, I think Australians should be continually reminded that they have not done too badly as a nation less than 200 years old. It is one of the harshest and driest continents on this earth. We have a land mass about the size of the continental United States and a population which is about one-fourteenth its size. So we have a tremendous demand on our resources for communications and transport. When one considers what we have achieved in the way of housing, this country has done very well. That does not mean to say that we need to rest on our laurels. We have consistently allocated special funding for the disadvantaged in our community, namely, the pensioners and the Aborigines. I do not think anybody would have any quarrel with that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party has a policy consisting mainly of pious platitudes. I guess a lot of political policies fall into that category, but it is the Australian Labor Party that is criticising us. It talks about continual assessment and monitoring of the situation, co-ordination of funding, encouraging participation of institutions, local governments and community groups, and about a Green Paper. All those pious platitudes are there. In fairness, it gets down to the nitty gritty of what it perceives should be done. I find that part of it a bit horrifying. It talks about an increase in public ownership and of introducing more bureaucratic controls, which ultimately lead to a distortion of the financial system. I remind honourable senators that that was the situation in which we found ourselves at the end of 1975. It is all right to say that so much money was put into housing-indeed, it was-but the country was left with a massive debt which accumulated over those three years and for which we are still paying. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates are a subject that always comes to people's minds when we are talking about housing-and quite rightly so. But I think it must be acknowledged that, in an uncontrolled atmosphere, interest rates reflect the value of the money on the day. Housing interests rates are controlled; there are no two ways about that. They are controlled mainly through the building societies and that is done by State governments. But they are controlled at a rate considerably lower than the market rate. One thing a lot of people find it hard to recognise is that, when there are low interest rates such as with the building societies, there is a small or a smaller amount of money available. This is the situation in which this country has found itself. Interest rates have been controlled for housing. They have been lower than market rates and, consequently, there has been less money available for housing, which is one of the problems. As I said, not many people realise that as a problem, but nonetheless it is. </PARA>
<PARA> I was discussing the problem of interest rates with a builder one day. He made the point that, even though interest rates are higher than they were two years ago, that is not the problem with new building. It is the lack of money. He indicated to me that his experience is that people building a new home cut their cloth to suit. In other words, they buy a home, the repayments on which they can meet out of their income. Many honourable senators in this place will be in the position of buying and paying off a home and having to meet the increased interest rates. It is a problem and it has created some hardship for many families. It was indicated by Senator Robertson, quite rightly, that pre-war one could buy a house more easily with so many weeks wages than is the case now. I submit that people's expectations in housing are considerably greater than they were pre-war. I dare say that, in those days, carpet, plush curtains, fittings, dishwashers, washing machines and all the rest-the list is almost endless-were unheard of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not saying that it is wrong. I am indicating that these days people's expectations are considerably higher than they were in those days. When I bought my first home, a wood copper sufficed-and I have no quarrel with that either. I am just making the point that those expectations are greater and, to meet those expectations, the cost is considerably higher. But people can withdraw from what might be considered basic needs to minimise their financial commitments. As the builder friend of mine indicated, that is happening with new buildings; people build to suit their financial capabilities. Another thing that is continually happening is that we are seeing new methods of construction and new materials. Someone once said that if a person built a better mousetrap the world would beat a path to his door. A fair amount of onus has been put on the building industry to change its methods of construction and to look at better materials. That has been done. We hear of pre-built houses and modular construction, and the list goes on. I think that will ultimately be to the advantage of everybody concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the problems is the cost. Senator Townley alluded to the fact that there was an application for wage increases recently. I dare say that nobody would be in disagreement with the fact that the shenanigans of the Builders Labourers Federation over the last few years are conducive to increasing building costs in this country. That is a cost that this nation will ulti- mately bear. Wage increases without a commensurate increase in productivity, take their toll on people who are trying to buy houses. One could put in that bracket the shorter working week. Once again I say that a shorter working week without a commensurate increase in productivity is also imposing a cost which is having its effect on the costs of the building industry and thus the ability of people to buy houses. </PARA>
<PARA> Just about every speaker has mentioned the fact that the churches bought into the argument in September. I have no quarrel with that. Churches see their role of social responsibility as looking after the disadvantaged in the community. That they have done although, by the way the matter was reported in some newspapers and the way some churches might have handled it, I think it was not so much just a look at the housing situation. Some of the churchmen see themselves as better politicians than theologians. The statement came out in rather more political terms than a theological dissertation on the necessity for social responsibility for the people of this country. But I guess we are getting used to that coming from some sections of the churches in this day and age. But they quite rightly drew the attention of the community to the problems. I think some of the proposals put by the churches were basically demands for more money. I guess that if we had adequate funding we could solve many problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The statements also mentioned tenancy laws. It is one thing to say that the tenant needs to be protected. The landlord also needs to be protected. I am a little conversant with the current situation in the United Kingdom where there are very strict tenancy laws which are having an adverse effect. Many houses are empty due merely to the fact that the landlords will not put people into them because the tenancy laws are so strict. The landlords really have no protection against errant tenants. So the laws have been counter-productive in that country . The landlords are very choosey about who they put into their houses. As a result many houses are staying empty for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is mindful of the problems in the housing industry. In March we brought in a housing package which provided a tax rebate for first home buyers; more money for housing -$400m; new and improved deposit assistance through the Home Deposit Assistance Scheme; and mortgage and rent relief. In the Budget we took that package a little further. There has been an increase of $71m in the amount allocated to welfare housing this year, which takes the allocation to $ 333m for 1982-83. That is an increase of 27 per cent. Additional funds for supplementary assistance and rent relief for pensioners have been made available . There is quite a good list of measures which show that the Government has tried to bite the bullet and do something for the housing industry. It is doing so more particularly for those who are seeking housing. </PARA>
<PARA> Many honourable senators have alluded to the recent signs that interest rates are coming down. That can only be an ultimate benefit. If one looks to those who are interested in housing-the Real Estate Institute-one can see that they have welcomed the Government's initiatives. Queensland is a little more fortunate in that the Queensland Minister for Works and Housing has brought in a supplementary scheme which will be of benefit to the people in that State. I would agree that housing is a matter of public importance but I would not agree with the claim that this Government has in any way failed to meet its responsibilities. I move:</PARA>

<PARA> That, in view of (a) the deterioration in employment expectations revealed by the Treasurer's statement of 14 October 1982, (b) the continuing drought, and (c ) delays in passing and changes to the Government's proposed tax legislation, the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations inquire into the effect of these factors on the Budget revenue estimates, and report to the Senate on 11 November 1982 and that, specifically, the Committee seek evidence from the Treasury on the likely revenue changes for 1982-83 in regard to:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The effect on PAYE receipts of a lower level of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) The effect of the continuing drought and lower farm incomes on provisional tax collections from farmers (due on 31 March 1983) caused by farmers exercising the option to vary provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) The effect on company tax collections of the apparent fall in business profits in the second half of fiscal year 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) The effect on sales and excise tax collections caused by the negative Gross Domestic Product growth implicit in lower employment levels and the drought. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) The current estimates of the revenue cost of the health insurance rebate.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The effect on tax recoupment receipts of the delay in enacting the recoupment legislation which the Treasurer predicted in July would pass both Houses of Parliament on or before 26 August 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> (7) The effect of reducing the interest payment from 30 to 20 per cent on overdue recoupment assessments. </PARA>
<PARA> (8) The effect on PAYE receipts of a reduction from 12 to 10 per cent of increases in average earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> (9) Any other revenue changes expected in view of more recent information. </PARA>
<PARA>In a few moments I shall seek leave of the Senate to amend that motion to change the date 11 November to 28 October. It is now quite clear that there will be a major blowout in the Government's published deficit, owing to both an expenditure overrun and a revenue shortfall. On the Government's own admission, the expenditure will overrun by at least $656m from two items. The first is the drought relief appropriation, which came in after the Budget, estimated at this stage at $356m. Information recently gained by the Opposition suggests that the actual figure could be closer to $600m. The second is the $300m addition to unemployment benefit payments to which the Treasurer (Mr Howard) admitted last Thursday. The latter, the increase in unemployment benefit payments, is a function of the deepening economic recession, of the economic collapse. That collapse will also affect revenue from various sources, we believe by at least as much as the expenditure overrun. I will supply more details of that later. </PARA>
<PARA> Revenue examination is the subject of this motion. The motion seeks an examination of the accuracy of the revenue estimates previously supplied. It has nothing to do with the Appropriation or any other Budget Bills, including the Drought Assistance (Primary Producers) Bill. That distinction may not be clear to all, especially when the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in conformity with his usual practice, seeks to misrepresent the facts. It is apparently and regrettably not clear to the Australian Democrats either. In a statement issued this afternoon, the Australian Democrats stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . they are not prepared to support the Labor Party in its proposals to recall Estimates committees and to embark on the fishing expedition proposed by Senator Walsh which would take several months to complete. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Without Supply drought sufferers, the unemployed and pensioners would immediately suffer. </PARA>
<PARA>This motion, I stress again, will not hold up Appropriation or other Bills, nor will the motions that Senator Button proposes to move later. It will, therefore, have no effect on payments to drought sufferers, the unemployed, pensioners or indeed payments to any other group. It is concerned entirely with revenue estimates, not expenditure. I hope that the newspapers which have been misled by that confusion will devote the same attention to correcting their errors that they have devoted to publishing the misunderstanding in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two errors in the statement by the Australian Democrats. On the first , it will not take several months to complete the investigation which I am proposing in this motion or the investigations which Senator Button will propose later. Indeed, this investigation which I am proposing could be completed in a one-day hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations if questions were submitted to the Treasury in writing tomorrow, which the Opposition proposes to do if the motion is carried. A sitting of the Finance and Government Operations Committee could then be arranged for next Monday, if so desired. The notice of motion itself is probably sufficient to give the Treasury the sort of warning that is required to prepare by next Monday answers to the specific questions detailed in the notice of motion. However, for those who continue to have trouble in distinguishing between an investigation of revenue estimates and the appropriation of moneys for expenditure, the Opposition is prepared to make a concession. I seek leave to amend the date included in my motion, 11 November, to 28 October. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also note in passing that there is an incorrect date on the official Notice Paper with reference to the year in which the relevant provisional tax assessments will fall due. The official Notice Paper said 1982. It should have been 1983, as indeed it was in the notice of motion submitted. The revenue estimates cannot, as has been suggested, be dealt with by the Committee of the Whole in examining the Appropriation Bills. Standing Order 263 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Committee of the Whole-</PARA>
<PARA>shall consider such matters only as shall have been referred to it by the Senate . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, in the instance of the Appropriation Bills, the Committee shall consider only the Appropriation Bills. Speakers are limited to appropriation items and can be directed by the Chair to confine their remarks to them. The Committee of the Whole, in dealing with the Appropriation Bills, offers no opportunity to examine the accuracy of revenue estimates. Moreover, in the Committee of the Whole, on any question at all, public servants cannot be directly questioned by senators as they can in Senate committee hearings, either Estimates or other standing committees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Finance and Government Operations Committee is the appropriate committee to examine the revenue estimates. The Chairman of that Committee, regrettably, is absent from Australia. But that is not an insurmountable problem. Standing Order 297A provides that a meeting of the Committee may be called by the secretary upon request by not less than three members of the Committee. I know that there are at least three members of that Committee who would call for such a meeting if this motion were passed. The combined result of both the expenditure overrun and the revenue shortfall is that the deficit, we believe, will blow out by something between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. As Senator Sir John Carrick said on 1 October 1975:</PARA>
<PARA> This is a simple situation. We need to know whether the deficit is to remain at $2,798m or whether it is on its way to doubling. </PARA>
<PARA>We believe the deficit is on its way to doubling and we seek confirmation of that belief in the proper way and in accordance with the procedures already laid down for the business of the Senate. That deficit, which with the blowout will total between $3.2 billion and $3.7 billion, can be financed in three ways. Printing money-or borrowing from the Reserve Bank, which is sometimes rather loosely referred to as printing money-and borrowing overseas are two of the ways . Both of these ways have the effect of increasing the money supply, unplanned increases which the Government assures us would be responsible. The third method of funding that deficit would be to borrow the required funds from the Australian public. Obviously that would require an increase of between $1 1/2 billion and $2 billion in the planned public sector borrowing requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> An increase in the public sector borrowing requirement has some implications for interest rates. It has implications particularly for home buyers, some of whom may have been seduced by the belief that interest rates are about to fall. A blowout in the public sector borrowing requirement of that magnitude, other things being equal, will not only put paid to those hopes but also would be very likely to induce further increases in interest rates paid by home buyers. I quote the Treasurer on this matter. He has said:</PARA>
<PARA> Either the public sector borrowing requirement has to be reduced, or there will be higher interest rates or higher inflation-or both. </PARA>
<PARA>It follows axiomatically, according to the Treasurer, that if the public sector borrowing requirement is increased, particularly if it is increased by that magnitude, there must be upward pressure on interest rates. According to the Government in general, up until very recently the public sector borrowing requirement was the cause of the record interest rates currently prevailing. The public is entitled to know the degree to which the deficit will blow out, and this motion seeks to clarify the degree to which shortfalls in revenue estimates will contribute to that blowout. The public is entitled to know and the Senate is obliged to find out. I am disappointed that only the Australian Labor Party, at least as of an hour ago, and with the possible exception of Senator Harradine , whose views I do not know, accepts that obligation. </PARA>
<PARA> There was-I stress the past tense-a fourth possibility for coping with the deficit blowout. There could have been a huge tax slug in a February mini-Budget , an exercise similar to that of 1977. That was the prime ministerial plan based on a prime ministerial delusion that the Government could pull and win a premature election before the economy collapsed, or at least before the public became aware of the collapse. The public is entitled to know the degree to which revenue estimate errors are excusable and the degree to which they may be attributed to rubbery estimates, rubbery being a euphemism for false estimates designed to produce what the Prime Minister would regard as a more respectable deficit-a Prime Minister, remember, who is manically obsessed with a premature election. In 1975, Senator Baume said:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems, as I have said, that already receipts in the Budget have been maximised, that expenditure has been minimised and that the Government has sought artificially to show the smallest possible deficit as a going in position for the beginning of the financial year. Our job is to examine just how far from reality this is likely to be. </PARA>
<PARA>I invite Senator Baume to stand by the beliefs he expressed then and vote for this motion. Our job, as he said then, is to examine just how far from reality this is likely to be. That is precisely what the motion seeks to do-to examine, in the light of more recent knowledge and perhaps a more objective assessment of knowledge previously available, just how far from reality it is.</PARA>

Our job-a job, regrettably, that it appears only the Labor Party will undertake-is to determine just that. I trust and sincerely hope that the views of other members of the Senate will change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How inaccurate are the estimates which have previously been supplied and by how much must they be adjusted? A crucial factor in answering that question is the admission by the Treasurer last Thursday that the number of unemployment benefit recipients would average through this financial year 460,000 instead of the 395, 000 previously estimated. The Government has acknowledged that, on average, 65, 000 more people will be unemployed this financial year than it earlier thought. The corollary of that increase in unemployment is that employment will fall by around one per cent and when employment falls pay-as-you-earn tax collections inevitably fall also, although probably by a slightly lesser proportion. A one per cent decrease in the number of people employed, which is the corollary of the increase in unemployment which the Treasurer gave last week, entails a revenue loss in the order of $200m. </PARA>
<PARA> The drought is significantly worse than when the Budget Estimates were prepared . The Bureau of Agricultural Economics released yesterday an estimate that the net farm produce will be down by more than $1,100m over the BAE's earlier estimate. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not blaming it on the Government, I just want to know the revenue implications of it. I invite the honourable senator to join me and the Labor Party in voting for this motion so we can determine with the best possible information, which only the Government and the bureaucracy has, just what the revenue implications of the downturn in farm income are likely to be. If net farm product is down by more than $1,100m, taxable income will come down by almost as much. On 31 March provisional tax payments based on income earned by farmers in 1981-82 are due to be paid. It follows, therefore, that the income upon which those provisional tax assessments was based-that is, the income for the previous financial year-will be somewhat more than $1 billion in excess of the actual income. That will be apparent by 31 March 1983. Because the effects of the drought have not been uniform, the aggregate effect on the taxable incomes of all the individual farmers might be more significant than the whole industry effect. The point is that on or before the end of March the farmers may vary their provisional tax assessment. They are not obliged to vary them upwards but they may vary them downwards. Since those assessments have been based on a level of farm income more than $1 billion in excess of what is now the likely level of farm income, most of those provisional tax assessments will be varied downwards. The likely revenue cost of that will be in the order of $200m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer now to company tax. A survey published in the Melbourne Age newspaper last week suggested that company tax collections could be nearly $600m lower than anticipated. That figure is almost certainly too high because it did not take account of time lags in the payment of provisional tax and large intra-year variations in company profits. Only the Australian Taxation Office could give accurate figures enabling those largely unknown variables to be quantified. But it is probable that, because of the very sharp fall in company profitability in the second half of the last fiscal year, company tax collections received this fiscal year will decline by around $300m. </PARA>
<PARA> The negative gross domestic product growth of between one per cent and 2 per cent which now clearly follows from the fall in employment levels and the drought will almost certainly lead to lower consumer spending and, therefore, lower collections of sales and excise taxes. A conservative estimate of the revenue effect of that is of the order of $50m. We have already had three different Government estimates for the health insurance rebate-an original estimate of $600m, followed some time later by an estimate of $470m and a Budget estimate of $506m. We believe that the original figure of $600m is the closest of the three. If that is so, the revenue cost this year of the health insurance rebate is underestimated by $100m. </PARA>
<PARA> Recovery of tax by the recoupment legislation is estimated in the Budget at $ 225m. I am not sure the precise basis on which that estimate was arrived at, but it certainly assumed that the legislation would have been enacted two months ago and that assessments would already have been issued. I quote from the early editions-it was not in the later edition in case someone goes to the trouble of checking in the Parliamentary Library-of the Sydney Sun of 26 July. An article in that paper stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Thousands of people in NSW who used the schemes and are now liable for tax could receive assessments as early as September. </PARA>
<PARA>This, of course, is in regard to the recoupment legislation. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Howard said he expected that special legislation aimed at acting retrospectively would be passed within a fortnight of Parliament resuming on August 17. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer said he expected the legislation to be passed within two weeks of 17 August. Presumably, that being the Treasurer's expectation, that estimate of $225m recovered pursuant to the legislation incorporated the belief that the legislation would be passed by 26 August, which was in the second sitting week. Well, of course, as we all know, the legislation has not been enacted yet and the doubts persist as to whether it will be enacted in anything like its original form. It has not been enacted but it has been watered down. The original proposal of a 30 per cent penalty interest charge for late payment of assessments issued pursuant to the recoupment legislation has been watered down to 20 per cent. It remains to be seen in how many other respects the legislation might be watered down before the Government can get it past its own party room. But of this we can be certain: More than two months of the time which the Government originally believed was available to it to collect that revenue is no longer available. The revenue consequences of that could be as high as $100m. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not an exhaustive list, but it is as far as I have gone in determining reductions in the original estimates of revenue: Pay-as-you-earn tax, $200m; provisional taxation from farmers alone, $200m; company tax, $300m; sales and excise taxes, $50m; health rebate, $100m; and recoupment legislation, $100m. This makes a total of $950m. It is true that it is likely that there will be some increases in the estimates of tax collections. The only notable one, I believe, is the crude oil levy. There are, however, other possible shortfalls not included in that list, the most spectacular of which would be the $450m additional revenue the Government estimated it would get from increasing from 10 per cent to 20 per cent the penalties for late payments on ordinary assessments. That estimate may not be realised. </PARA>
<PARA> I make no claim to the figures I have presented being precise because we do not have all the relevant data. But a shortfall in aggregate of a magnitude of $1, 000m is clearly indicated by the evidence. If the Government wishes to deny that , let it do so in a credible way by stating the official revised estimates from an impartial bureaucracy before the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations and allow honourable senators to do their duty and question and clarify those revised estimates. That can be done only if this motion is carried. I hope that those honourable senators who were previously either confused or nervous will now change their view and vote accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, lest this aspect be misunderstood yet again, this motion deals solely with the accuracy of previous revenue estimates. It is absolutely divorced from any expenditure items, from any expenditure legislation. It has absolutely nothing to do with the Appropriation Bills, other Budget Bills or any appropriation introduced into the Parliament subsequent to the Budget. It will not affect payments to those affected by drought, the unemployed, pensioners or anyone else. What this motion will do, if it is carried, is permit the Senate to discharge the responsibility which has been given to it to do its duty by the people of Australia, to determine with a might higher level of accuracy the likely shortfall in revenue in this financal year and, therefore, the consequential increase in the Budget deficit. </PARA>

<PARA> Fundamentally Senator Walsh's argument is that there will be a blow-out in expenditure; that there will be something terrible about this blow-out; that there will be a deficit of, on the basis of his calculations-I do not accept the figure-of the order of $3,300m, and that that would be very bad. He indulged in a lot of discussion and said that we would have difficulties with interest rates , borrowing, et cetera. Taking Senator Walsh's own figures, I have to say that his own leader, Mr Hayden, on 24 August said:</PARA>
<PARA> A domestic deficit of $1 billion to $1.5 billion-equivalent to much less than one per cent of gross domestic product-would have major multiplier effects throughout the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hayden commended it. Such a domestic deficit represents an overall deficit of about $3.3 billion, which is precisely the one that Senator Walsh is now berating today. One knows that Mr Hawke did better than that. He thought that there should be a larger deficit. Without at all accepting the magnitude of the matter let me say in the first place that the whole basis on which he places his argument is nonsense. I want to demonstrate this because it is of very great importance. Let us bear in mind that Mr Hawke said that the Australian Labor Party, in government, would try to adopt a more expansionary program. He was talking about Budget deficits of $3 billion to $4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> The matters that are being asked for in the motion include an estimate of how much drought relief will cost. The argument put forward is that somehow or other at the time of the Budget we should have known whether it was going to rain after 17 August and for how long it would have rained. The Opposition has made a great concession-after all, the original date of 11 November would have given us some more days-by insisting that by 28 October we will be able to predict whether it will rain in November, December, January or February, in other words when the drought will break. By some magic means, what could not have been known in July when the Budget was put together and what can never be known is supposed to be predictable now. How could these things be known? The Labor Party is berating us because, as it did not rain in August, September and October, we now seek to help the farming community. There is nothing that the Labor Party dislikes more than helping the farming community. The Government will be berated for doing that. The Government will be berated because in July and August it did not know that it was not going to rain in September, October or November. What is more, the Government will be asked to say on 28 October whether it will rain in November and December. That is demonstrably wrong. Underlying all this is the belief that what we have done is clumsy but what Labor would do would be better.</PARA>
<PARA> The second thrust of the motion is that payments for the unemployment benefit have been wrongly estimated and that that is some kind of a plot. I do not think that in 1974-75 the special Estimates committees were set up to look at the Crean Budget. We estimate an increase of 19 per cent in unemployment benefit recipients. In 1974-75, the number of unemployment recipients was 80 per cent higher than estimated at Budget time. The actual cost in revenue went up 68.9 per cent. We estimate that our increase will be 19.5 per cent. Let me demonstrate the Whitlam Government Budgets. Did the Whitlam Government say:'My goodness, the Budget is rubbery; the Budget is phoney'. Not one bit! Let us look at that aspect. In 1974-75, the number of unemployment recipients was 80 per cent higher than estimated at Budget time. That represented an increase of 68.9 per cent. In 1975-76-the Whitlam Government's next Budget-the number of recipients was 60 per cent higher than estimated at Budget time. Did that Government then say: 'Both our Budgets are in ruins'?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider this in terms of track records of Budgets into which the Opposition now says there ought to be special investigations. In 1972-73, expenditure on unemployment and sickness benefits was 34 per cent over the estimate. The following year, which was a Labor year, the figure was 39 per cent . The following year, which again was a Labor year, the figure was 68.9 per cent . The overlap for the next Labor year, 1975-76, was 40.5 per cent. Then the figure went to 28.2 per cent, 19.7 per cent, 11.3 per cent, minus 7.3 per cent, 3.9 per cent, 12.3 per cent and 19.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the pattern? The pattern is that in the Whitlam times clearly there were horrendous errors in judgment of estimate. Was there an investigation by that Government? Did it feel horror when placed in that situation? Just as in a drought situation where no one can safely say what will happen, it is not possible on 28 October to be able to say with any precision over the year whether disemployment will continue or whether there will be some re-employment. Factors can change. Let those who have this forethought in mind say so. Let us examine the position. The nonsense regarding the drought situation is demonstrable. The nonsense of the Opposition's claim that the Government is unskilled and it is skilful in relation to the unemployment benefit is cast out of the window. When one does the sums, one will see that they add up to a Budget deficit that Mr Hayden is advocating and Mr Hawke is advocating an even bigger one. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me take the steps one by one. Senator Walsh claimed that there would be a big fall-off in company taxation. Honourable senators heard that. One would have thought that he would have gone to the figures and would have been able to show us a fall-off. That is demonstrable. If he is going to ask the Government to take certain action, one would have thought that he knew that a fall-off occurred. Otherwise, why hold up the Senate and why get a Senate committee to inquire into the matter? We are told that nothing in company tax collections so far this year suggests the Budget estimate is too high. In the three months ending September, collections of company tax were $ 992m, that is, just $14m less than a quarter of the full year estimate. One can see the grave fall-off! Estimates of company tax collections are more practical in changing economic circumstances because the previous year is the relevant base year for the estimate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The figures do not support Senator Walsh at all. Yet he says that this Senate should be hung up in an inquiry on these factors: A drought that no one could predict and unemployment figures on which his own party was immensely more inaccurate in a similar situation. Senator Walsh drummed up a deficit, and tried to pin it on us, which his own party leader and his front bench say is not big enough. What is he aiming at in this regard? Senator Walsh says that we should inquire into pay-as-you-earn receipts. How can we, by 28 October, know with any certainty what the trends will be? My advice from the Department of the Treasury is that it is too early to judge, that at this stage no major change is expected . The information can always be received by asking questions. We can get the view of the Treasury by simply posing the question. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is thought that receipts from pay-as-you-earn taxpayers will be lower, because average weekly earnings will be lower, the offset must also be considered. What about the contra? If that were so, the costs of running the Government would be lower. We heard nothing about that from the Opposition. For example, the table cited is a very selective little one. Why did not the honourable senator note the very interesting fact that the significant fall in interest rates will have an effect upon the amount of debt repayment, of interest servicing and so on? Why were these aspects not mentioned? Who can say that sales and excise tax collections will be lower because of drought and lower employment? In fact, the Treasury advises that typically rural consumers maintain their level of consumption by drawing on savings rather than forgoing consumption. That has been the pattern over the years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will tell the rural people that the Government has been criticised with regard to drought support. We will be happy to tell the people of Tasmania, and everywhere else, of the Labor Party's attitudes in this regard and why it is trying to achieve delay. Why is it pressing the drought issue? It cannot be to ascertain the true cost, because nobody except the creator above knows that, it can only be because the Labor Party is opposed to the expenditure. That is the simple situation. It is now also being said that we will not obtain as much in revenue recoupment because we will start to collect a little later. But, as everyone knows, the Australian Taxation Office is at this moment preparing the assessments. If the legislation is passed, as it will be, the assessments will contain a time clause that will ensure collection will take place within the financial year. If not, penalties will be exacted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have an extraordinary situation in which it is said that an attempt is being made to obtain revenue estimates. Senator Walsh has stated clearly that the Opposition seeks estimates of the cost of drought relief. Demonstrably, such a proposition is absolute nonsense. The track record of all governments over the years, in terms of estimating the cost of unemployment benefit, has been demonstrably, specially in the case of Labor governments, worse than has been that of the Government on this occasion. So there has been no aberration in that regard. The actual size of the deficit that the Opposition is postulating and that it is attempting to pin on the Government-it is one that we do not accept- is, in fact, too low for the Labor Party itself. So what is the Opposition trying to do?</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator admitted that some extra revenue might be derived from oil levies, but honourable senators will notice that his figures did not take account of any of the pluses. The extra revenue from that source could be of the order of a couple of hundred million dollars. Quite clearly, if one takes the motion step by step it is demonstrably an absurd one to place before any committee. No committee can get a factual answer on these things because nobody can predict with any accuracy the future in regard to drought and such exigencies. Equally, a simple question in this place would suffice to obtain answers regarding those aspects that are predictable. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion is typical of the approach of the Labor Party, typical of its delaying tactics in this place. It spends its time in such pursuits. The amount of time that is being devoted to Government Business in the Senate is less than half of what it was when the Government had a majority. It is considerably less than half of what it was when the Labor Party was in office. We who were then in Opposition gave that Government the facilities to allow its business to proceed. But day by day-I can place the figures on record-the Labor Party is deliberately introducing such motions into the Senate simply to spin out time. This motion is typical of such devices; it cannot of itself achieve anything. The Labor Party has had the benefit of the many sitting hours of the Estimates committees. Fairly soon-later next week-it will have the opportunity to discuss the Appropriation Bills in detail. Also, it has the opportunity of asking questions at Question Time or on notice. The Government would be happy indeed to seek to obtain the information required. </PARA>

I come back to the basis of the argument put by Senator Walsh: He needs to know the revenue implications because the Parliament needs to know the size of the deficit; it needs to know that because of the economic consequences in terms of borrowing, the effect on interest rates and other matters. He implies that if the deficit were of such a magnitude that would be bad. I repeat: The figures he used are modest compared with those advocated by Mr Hayden and very modest compared with those advocated by Mr Hawke . Against that background, the motion is demonstrably nonsense and should be rejected. Accordingly, the Government will reject it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are sympathetic to the reasons advanced by Senator Walsh and Senator Button for moving certain motions. We are sympathetic to the view that more information needs to be supplied to the Senate concerning this Budget, the underestimates and the other inaccuracies that have already been found in it. However, because of a pledge we took, the Democrats hold one thing as paramount- that we will not block or delay Supply to this or any other government. We believe that the effect of these Labor Party initiatives would be to delay Supply, not necessarily because of wishes or actions of the Labor Party but possibly because of the actions of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I, for one, will not hand Mr Fraser on a platter a reason to go to Yarralumla and ask for a double dissolution because ostensibly he has not the money to govern. As far as we are concerned, the paramount thing about these Appropriation Bills is that they should be expedited and passed without delay. Notwithstanding the intentions of the Labor Party in this matter which, being charitable, we assume to be good, the Democrats believe that the net result of these motions, if passed, would be to delay the passage of the Supply Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Supply Bills are delayed, who will suffer? The drought affected, the pensioners and the unemployed will suffer. The Government will be able to say: ' We have not enough money because those nasty people in the Labor Party and those nasty Democrats have held up Supply'. That is a 3-card trick for which my colleagues and I will not fall. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say, without too much heat, that at the moment a game is being played in the national capital. It is a pretty disgusting game, given the state of crisis in which the country finds itself, one in which people are suffering in the ways that I have mentioned. But the game being played is prompted by the fact that the Prime Minister of this country, Mr Fraser, is obsessive about having an early election. He desperately wants one. Tony Eggleton does not, nor does Mr Anthony. Not one member of his Cabinet wants an early election, but Mr Fraser is obsessive. He has the trigger to go to Yarralumla tonight to get a double dissolution. The Senate has obliged him without fear or favour. Both the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats have said that the Sales Tax Bills would not pass, knowing full well that that gave the Prime Minister grounds for a double dissolution. He has the mechanical means by which to seek a double dissolution. The media is totally behind him. An example of that is the disgraceful statement which appeared in last night's Melbourne Herald. It stated : 'Senate could not be trusted'. The person who wrote that outdid anybody on Malcolm Fraser's public relations staff. What should have been said was: The Senate cannot be trusted to be a rubber stamp. That would have been an accurate statement. I am pleased to say that nowadays the Senate is not a rubber stamp. </PARA>
<PARA> The game at the moment is that Mr Fraser does not have a reason that he can sell to the public to ask for a double dissolution even though he has the mechanical means to acquire one. What better excuse could he have than the Senate delaying Supply? That would give him the best reason of all for a double dissolution. He could blame the Senate for the plight of those suffering from the drought and make the other claims that I have mentioned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I thank Senator Button for that interjection. In the scenario that Senator Button paints it should not delay Supply and I concede that. I also concede-I do not impugn the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Sir John Carrick-that if Senator Button were in his place he would use exactly the same tactics. If motions such as these were introduced and if Senator Button were requested by his leader to find an excuse for his leader to go to Yarralumla he would automatically say that the Senate would not contemplate the Supply Bills until the work proposed in the motions had been completed and until the committee had reported to the Senate. Even with the amended date of 28 October that Senator Walsh mentioned, in my reckoning that would still mean a two week delay before Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1982-83 could be debated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not an unduly suspicious person but I have a suspicion that the Government is running out of money faster than the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, hinted two or three days ago. I ask simply: Why is the Appropriation Bill (No. 1 ) 1982-83 to come into this chamber next Wednesday? Last week we were informed that it would come into this chamber on 9 November. Is there any great hurry? If there is a great hurry, what is the reason for it? Yesterday, at a meeting of the Whips, it was indicated that four Bills had to be passed before 31 October. Today, a fifth Bill was added to that list-a loan Bill. I regard that as highly significant. A government brings in a non-urgent loan Bill only if it is short of money. The Senate must forgive me if I am over-suspicious but I do not propose, nor does my party propose, to give to the Prime Minister this sort of shoddy excuse to call an early election. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Australian Democrats wanted to be self-centred and selfish there is nothing in political terms we would welcome more at this moment than an early election.

We would, currently running at a 13 per cent primary vote, return two senators, as we would in South Australia and Victoria. I imagine that we would have at least eight senators returned in place of our current five senators. From a selfish point of view, the Australian Democrats do not walk away from the prospect of a double dissolution. We have not walked away from such a prospect because we gave Mr Fraser the mechanical grounds to have a double dissolution many months ago when we voted against the imposition of the sales tax on the necessities of life. What effect would a double dissolution have on the country? A double dissolution now would mean another three to four months of instability. There would be normal instability leading up to an election campaign. Then there would be the Christmas period and the silly season of January. It would be February before any newly elected government-Labor or Liberal-could get down to the catastrophic problems facing this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the 22 years I have been in this place I have never witnessed more irresponsible behaviour from a leader of this country than is presently being exemplified by the Prime Minister not saying 'there will be no early election' or 'there will be an early election'. We should be told one way or another. The Prime Minister cannot say that the Australian Democrats will go back on our promise never, under any circumstances, to block or delay Supply. If anybody should claim in the future that our statement about Supply is equivocal or that we have ever implied that we might delay or block Supply, that person would be telling a blatant and wilful lie. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the purposes for which the Labor Party has moved this motion are proper. We believe that it would, because of the engineering of politicians, provide an excuse for Mr Fraser to plunge the country into an election campaign. We think that is not in the interests of the country. I remind Senator Walsh and Senator Button that the Appropriation Bills are dealt with by Senate Estimates committees. During the hearings of those committees I have counted as many as 30 , 40 or 50 public servants in the Senate chamber and outside the Senate chamber ready to answer, admittedly through a Minister, questions posed by senators. </PARA>

Finally, with the persistence of the Australian Democrats-we said we would not proceed until we got an answer-the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Messner, was forced to go to the public servants and say: 'What is the figure?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose to vote against this motion because I consider it is a waste of the Senate's time. One has to consider whether the interests of people in the community, such as the unemployed and the farmers, will be advanced by this measure. In my view they will not. Appropriate avenues are available for this Senate, within its Standing Orders and within its usual procedures, for obtaining the information desired by this motion, one of which has been adverted to by Senator Chipp. He mentioned that when the Appropriation Bills come before the Committee of the Whole the Senate can hold them up for as long as it likes and question the Ministers for as long as it likes in order to obtain the information that any honourable senator desires. All of this is possible by following the usual procedures available to honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my view this is a wasteful exercise. It is a bit of political stunting. I do not take the view that Senator Chipp does at all. I believe it is simply political stunting. The Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats could have held up the Sales Tax Amendment Bills. If they were dinkum about putting the Government to the test they would have, on that occasion, returned those Bills to the House of Representatives, as I suggested, and forced the Government to come clean on why it intended to increase the percentage in sales tax on items already subjected to sales tax and why it intended to extend sales tax to other items which included the necessities of life. Both the Democrats and the ALP less than a year ago were prepared, together with myself, to oppose the extension of sales tax to the necessities of life. Why on this occasion are they not prepared to stand the Government up? Actions speak louder than words. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion is simply a lot of words when what this country really needs is not words but action to overcome the problems it faces, particularly employment. What good is this motion to the unemployed? All it will do, if passed, is enable the continuation of political point scoring at a time when we have over half a million people unemployed in this land. It is time that political and community leaders came together to attack the problem single-mindedly. It is time that the type of-political point scoring that underlines this motion, which is carried by the Press throughout the length and breadth of Australia, is put aside. It is time that we, as members of parliament, realised that we have a duty to the unemployed and to Australia to give the lead in a combined effort to overcome the problems and not to stir the political pot all the time. </PARA>
<PARA> Unemployment is not solely caused by Government policy. Of course the Government's single-minded approach of attacking and bringing down inflation on economic terms has proven to be a failure. Its preoccupation with these economic solutions has not and will not overcome that problem. The problem has social as well as economic aspects. Unless we tackle those aspects, unless we understand that the problem of unemployment at present is simply that more people are seeking paid work than there are jobs available at the same time that automation and technological change are smashing new job opportunities and, indeed, existing jobs, we are failing the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> We should take every opportunity to urge the Government to take remedial economic measures to overcome the plight of the unemployed. Beyond that we should give the leadership to the calls that have been made for a national conference on employment, which could get down and examine our attitudes to employment. It is my view that the whole problem of the unemployed will not be overcome while we identify work with paid employment and leisure with idleness. We must, as a nation, bring together people and community leaders who will sit down and tackle these problems. Australia would then be able, in a joint way, to tackle unemployment with a plan which would identify the problems and the solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that I have ranged somewhat further than I should have. This matter will be the subject of a notice of motion that I intend to pursue next week. Nevertheless, I raise these points because of the introduction that has been made to this motion and because of the surrounding public arguments.

Indeed, it may be in the interests of the Opposition at times to allow through the Senate obnoxious legislation, when it could reject such legislation, in order to go to the people who have thus been affected and to say: 'Well, look, you elect us in the forthcoming election and we will remedy that for you'. In my view that is not a proper role for the Senate to adopt. That would turn the Senate into a party political House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like Senator Walsh, in his reply, to say why the Opposition did not hold up passage of the legislation imposing an increase of 2 1/2 per cent in sales tax right across the board on items that were already subject to sales tax . I would also like him to tell the Senate and the people of Australia why the Labor Party did not oppose the extension of sales tax to items which, on any construction, are necessities of life. Six months ago the Opposition was prepared to do so but now that we are close to a general election-it is election year next year-it is not prepared to do so. The only interpretation one can put on that is that the Labor Party will then go to the people who are affected and say: 'Right, elect us to government and we will remedy that when we become the government'. As I said, that is not a proper role for the Senate. Our role is one of audit and control. Certainly, in order to discharge our responsibilities, we need to have the figures available to us. We have a substantial number of those figures. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been quite definitely stated by the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick), who is at the table, that he is prepared to provide to the Senate such further figures as are available to his public servants. I for one am prepared to accept that undertaking. If in any way that undertaking is diminished within the next couple of weeks, I will be prepared to join with the Opposition and with the Australian Democrats in holding up legislation in order to ensure that that undertaking given by the Minister is honoured. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that it would be in the best interests of this nation for the Senate to give a lead in order to overcome the vital problem of unemployment that besets this country. I consider that the proposition put forward by Senator Walsh will not advance that one iota but that, in fact, it is wasting the time of the Senate and creating unnecessary, false expectations in the minds of the public and the Press that something is happening when in fact it is not. Even if this motion were passed, what would happen? It would be simply a political point scoring job and at the end of the day nothing would have happened. Let us not fool people and, far less, ourselves. I believe this motion should be rejected as wasteful and I suggest that the Senate get on with its business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; -In reply-The Senate is debating a motion to refer to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations the accuracy of the revenue estimates previously presented by the Government. For a number of reasons which were given by me when I moved the motion, it is quite apparent that there is a gross error in a number of the individual estimates of the likely revenue collections and also of the aggregate revenue collection. The size of that error is in the vicinity of $1 billion-that is, $1,000m. The Government has stated that it will not support the motion. The Australian Democrats have stated that they will not support the motion. Senator Harradine has stated that he will not support the motion. The attitude of the Government was predictable and predicted. I am disappointed that the Democrats and Senator Harradine have taken the attitude that they have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reasons put by the Democrats and Senator Harradine may have marginal relevance to the motions which Senator Button will move shortly but they have no relevance to the motion moved by me, with the possible exception of the point made by Senator Chipp-that is, that the facts have little, if any, influence on the things that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) actually says. The fact is that this motion would have no effect on the passage of the Appropriation Bills, nor would it have any effect on the passage of any other Bill which appropriates and provides for the expenditure of funds. The carrying of this motion would not interfere with Senate business because the proposition we put forward is that the Finance and Government Operations Committee would hold a special hearing next Monday. As I have said, the matter is completely divorced from the Appropriation Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> It was also argued by Senator Harradine and Senator Chipp that the same sorts of questions that we want answered can be asked in the Committee of the Whole when the Appropriation Bills are before the Senate. The simple answer to that argument is that questions about revenue cannot be asked or, if they are asked, the Chairman is perfectly entitled to rule them out of order. Equally importantly, nobody in the Senate can directly question public servants in a Committee of the Whole. That can be done only at Estimates committees and at meetings of other committees of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine specifically invited or challenged the Australian Labor Party to respond to his question about why we opposed Bills increasing sales taxes in 1981 and did not throw out similar Bills in 1982. There are two reasons: Firstly and most importantly, the 1981 Bills breached a specific undertaking which the Government had previously given. The second reason is that there are and were significant macro-economic differences between the 1981 situation and the 1982 situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick, who spoke on behalf of the Government, prevaricated and obfuscated, as is his custom. There was a fundamental contradiction in his argument. He said on the one hand that the information we sought was not available but that if we wanted it, we could get it from the Committee of the Whole by putting questions to the Committee of the Whole and by putting questions with and without notice. What was overlooked in that contradiction that the information is available but is not available is the fact that we cannot directly question public servants. Any figures we seek through the Committee or through questions with or without notice pass through somebody else 's hands. The plain fact is that Senator Carrick cannot be trusted with figures. We saw some excellent examples of that tonight. Either he doctors figures or he does not understand them. I will be charitable; I will accept, at least for the time being, that it is the latter. He is an arithmetic dyslexic. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, today he asserted that the Budget deficit estimated by Mr Hayden when he was Treasurer had doubled or trebled by the end of the financial year. He was invited to withdraw that comment, which he declined to do. That suggests that he has no shame either. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that the deficit did not double or treble. It increased by 50 per cent. The deficit which, on present indications, is almost certain to double is the deficit estimated by this Government in the 1982 Budget. Senator Carrick said that Mr Hayden, in his response to the Budget Speech, had advocated an additional deficit of $1 billion. That much was true. He said that that, added to the deficit estimated by the Government, made precisely $3.3 billion. In fact it makes something less than $2.7 billion. A deficit of, I think, $1,684 billion plus $1 billion makes $2.684 billion and not $3.3 billion, as Senator Carrick asserted. </PARA>
<PARA> He also asserted that a deficit of $3.3 billion was what I had forecast this Government would finish with on 30 June 1983. I, in fact, said that this Government, on present indications, would finish with a deficit somewhere between $3.2 billion and $4 billion, which again is far removed from $3.3 billion. Senator Carrick accused me of looking at only some of the figures and deliberately skating around the rest or, even worse, of overlooking the fact that there were other estimates of revenue which I had not mentioned. I explicitly stated that I made no such claim and that I made no claim to having exhaustively gone through the revenue estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> He then accused me of, I suppose, trying to fiddle the figures in a minor way by failing to mention that if interest rates fall-I stress the words 'if interest rates fall'-interest payments on Commonwealth borrowings by the Commonmwealth will be lower. If they fall, that is true. However, Senator Carrick, the man who wants to tell all the truth and let it all hang out, failed to mention that, if that happens, it will be partly offset by lower interest payments from the States on money the States owe the Commonwealth. So, in any reduction, the ratios will be of this order: For every dollar that the Commonwealth might save in interest payments on its borrowings because of a general fall in interest rates, it will lose $40 of revenue in interest payments otherwise due from the States on State borrowings from the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick said that, by the September quarter, company tax had not fallen , contrary to what I had asserted. Again, he could not have been listening to what I said or his mathematical dyslexia prevented him from understanding me. I had drawn attention to the fact that there was a substantial fall in company profits in the second half of the last fiscal year. I said that the Age newspaper had estimated that the effect of that on revenue collections this year would be $600m. I said that for a variety of reasons I believed that that estimate was too high. There are people in the Public Service who have access to information which is not available to the Opposition and which enables them to make a more accurate judgment about complex issues such as that than we are able to make. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion seeks to make those people available to the Finance and Government Operations Committee to give what information they have and to subject themselves to questioning by the members of that Committee or by any other honourable senator who chooses to attend. The figures that Senator Sir John Carrick quoted in his reply to my speech are about as reliable as his estimates of the economic viability of the Rundle project. That can be assessed by the capitalised market value of the shares in those partners at the time he was talking it up, which exceeded $1.200m. The last time I looked it had fallen below $400m. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to draw attention to one internal inconsistency in the Estimates as they were originally presented. Statement No. 2 forecast no economic growth, no non-farm gross domestic product growth. Given that people of the age strata to be in the work force increase in number by about 120,000 a year and given that productivity-the output per unit of labour and time- increases, even in bad years, by about one per cent a year, it follows inevitably that if the growth forecast was correct there would be a substantial increase in unemployment. Indeed, it could have been calculated that night, and it was calculated that night, that if the no growth forecast was correct 60,000 more people would qualify for unemployment benefit than the Government had estimated. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not a question of being able to make imperfect forecasts. Obviously, nobody's forecasts are precise or infallible. That was an internal inconsistency within the Government's calculations. The Government has now admitted that 65, 000 more people on average will qualify for unemployment benefit this year than it had previously estimated. That increase was implicit in the assumptions which the Government had presented in the Budget Papers but which it refused to acknowledge at that stage. It has partially come clean. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the problems of forecasting on another matter. I guess that Senator Sir John Carrick rarely gets outside Sydney and probably does not know the growing seasons for the Australian wheat crop, for example. He tried to ridicule the Labor Party for the comments that I had made about the effect of the drought on farmers' provisional tax payments in March next year. He attempted to ridicule the Labor Party because we were saying that one could not tell how serious the drought was in August but one could tell in November. This drought, for the information of Senator Sir John Carrick, who clearly knows little, if anything, about the subject, is primarily a drought in cereal growing areas. I will be more precise still, it is primarily a drought in winter cereal growing areas. In August nobody could tell for certain whether the cereal crop had failed, although there were strong indications that it would. In November we know that it has failed in a great part of Victoria, in the greater part of New South Wales, in a large part of Queensland and in a large part of South Australia. So we do have certain information which was not available, which could not have been available, to anyone in August. In this motion we are asking the Government to ask its own bureaucrats who have access to information to which we do not have access what will be the effects on Government revenue of what is now certain failure of the winter cereal crop in the greater part of Australia's grain growing areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to the recoupment legislation. Very conservatively, as we know, I suggested when I spoke that recoveries from the recoupment legislation would be $100m less than the Government had forecast. Since I said that, I have been told that after the legislation had been through the mangler of the joint party room of the Liberal and National parties for about the fourth time the Bill finally resurfaced in the House of Representatives-it came up from the bottom-of -the-harbour, so to speak-and has been amended in a very significant way. This tough Prime Minister who has cracked down on tax dodgers harder than anyone else has ever done, if we accept his assessment of the facts, has caved in to the tax dodgers. If any of them get their assessments this financial year they will be required to pay 25 per cent of the assessments. They will get 12 months to pay the balance. This is the emasculated legislation which will crack down on these receivers of stolen money, as the Prime Minister described them a couple of months ago. This is the emasculated legislation which finally came out of the mangler of the joint party room of the Liberal and National parties. The Prime Minister has caved in to the tax dodgers and the inevitable result-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly a partial fraud at this stage. I am willing to chance my arm and predict that in the highly unlikely event of there being an election at the end of this year which returned Malcolm Fraser and of the Liberal Party, dominated by tax cheats as it is, seeing three unimpeded years in power ahead of it, we can forget about getting any of the balance of that money from the tax dodgers. Irrespective of that, the one thing that we now know for certain, because they will pay only 25 per cent of what they are assessed for, if they are ever assessed, is that there will be a loss to revenue of $166m on what the Government had forecast for that item alone. I hope that the other non- government parties and people will change their attitudes, but I am very sad to note that only the Labor Party senators are willing to accept their responsibility as members of this House to perform, in a very meaningful way, their role as members of a House of review and to accept their responsibilities to inform the people of Australia by every means within their disposal as to just what the true position of government finances is now and is likely to be for the rest of this financial year. It is a pity that only the Labor Party is willing to support this motion. That being so, there seems to be no point in calling a division in the Senate on this matter and I do not propose to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>As the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) knows, we have been careful to ensure the progress of the Government's program in this October session and, as I told him yesterday, we will do everything to facilitate its program, and dealing with the motions together is a step in that direction. I explain at the beginning the reason for seeking leave to amend the date of report to the Senate. A lot of nervousness has been displayed in this place in the last couple of hours by both political parties and particular honourable senators when their prospective electoral fates have been discussed. I might say that that has involved members of both sides of the chamber. The first point I want to make about the reason for limiting the time in which Estimates committees would be required to report back to the Senate is that when this notice of motion was given yesterday it was the stated intention of the Government that Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) would not even be introduced into the Senate until the week commencing 9 November at the earliest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator McLaren points out with his customary acuteness, the Government has changed its mind on that issue and told us today that the Appropriation Bills would be introduced into the Senate next week, after a fairly dilatory path through the House of Representatives. Of course, if the Government seeks to have the Appropriation Bills passed at an earlier date than was originally intended by the Government, we will do what we can to facilitate that. For that reason, in part, we brought the return date, if I can call it that, forward from 11 November to 26 October.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having made that point, I say that it is not relevant because the Appropriation Bills could have been introduced in November, could have been debated and could have been passed notwithstanding the fact that certain items of Estimates were before the two Estimates committees to which these specific matters are referred . I state again, for the record, that it would have been quite in order for the Appropriation Bills to have been debated and dealt with by the Senate notwithstanding that those matters were before the Estimates committees. Unfortunately, there is often a lack of understanding of the procedures in the Senate and there is also a gross capacity to misrepresent the intentions of the Opposition in relation to matters of this kind. The intentions of the Opposition in relation to legislation in the Senate and Budget legislation have been expressed over and over again but are nonetheless continually misrepresented by Ministers in the present Government and particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), who is caught in a web of deception which threatens to engulf him. Accordingly, we did not intend to be misrepresented in respect of this matter, and the amendment to have the committees report at an earlier date has been sought for that purpose. I wanted to make that matter quite clear at the beginning because the Government, as I have said, continually misrepresents those issues. There are many naive young journalists around the place and sometimes they fall for the misrepresentations which are made. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to deal with the facts in relation to notice of motion No. 66. This motion seeks to refer to Estimates Committee H the Department of Primary Industry estimates. I say at the beginning that in making that referral to Estimates Committee H the Opposition envisaged a short hearing in which a number of matters, which have been largely dealt with by my colleague Senator Walsh, would be dealt with by that Committee. It is our estimate-it is an estimate shared by others-that the addition to the deficit as a result of the drought will probably be in the order of some $360m. I make the point, which is quite obvious and which was the subject of debate in the previous discussion, that a separate appropriation was passed in relation to the drought relief program and the consequences of the drought. It is proper that that appropriation should go to an Estimates committee. It is proper because of the effects on the Budget. The revised estimates of farm income will have a considerable bearing on the Budget as well. The money which will be available for drought relief was announced after the Budget. In our view it was a somewhat ad hoc, blank cheque type of decision. That will contribute significantly to the size of the deficit. The specific measures were announced on 31 August, two and a half weeks after the Budget. They provide for two main things-a subsidy on the payment of interest rates over 12 per cent, estimated to cost $36m in a full year, and a subsidy on fodder which is estimated to cost $320m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the matters which the Opposition wanted referred to the appropriate Estimates committee. It is a function of Estimates committees to examine those items, to determine in a responsible way how they are arrived at and to report to the Senate. That is the exercise in which we were concerned to involve the Senate committee system. We believe that it is a quite proper exercise of the functions of the Senate Estimates committees. For the benefit of honourable senators not prepared to support this motion, I quote from Mr Odgers's book, Australian Senate Practice. In discussing the functions of Estimates committees, he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The overriding principle involved is the Senate's-and the people's-right to know how public money is expended . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: 'The overriding principle involved is the Senate's-and the people's- right to know how public money is expended'. I understand the reluctance of Senator Sir John Carrick and the Government to know how public moneys are being expended. After all, they have not been particularly good about collecting public revenue which is owing. I understand, in view of their reluctance to collect revenue which is owing and their continuing reluctance to collect moneys owing from tax evaders, their reluctance to let the public and the Senate know how the people's money is being expended. So I understand the position adopted by the Government in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I have more difficulty, more concern, about understanding the position of the Australian Democrats in this matter. I thought that if one searched through the volkgeist, the raison d'etre of the Australian Democrats, its position could be found expressed in one slogan, the only slogan they have ever had. It is expressed in the slogan 'keep the bastards honest'. In the words of Mr Odgers, a more circumspect, gentlemanly person perhaps than the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Chipp, who coined that slogan, the Senate Estimates committees are concerned about ensuring the people's right to know how public money is expended. The Democrats have interpreted Mr Odgers's words in a somewhat different way. I would have thought, if I might not take too much licence with the slogan of the Australian Democrats, that that is how they interpret their function in this place. Today they have abdicated their function on the basis of a number of specious excuses which amount simply to their paranoid fear of an early election. That is all it amounts to. It is a tragedy to see this once great party committed to that slogan, united behind it as they are united behind nothing else, including what they should do about these motions which are before the Senate. It is a tragedy to see this once great party abandoning its role and its true function here of seeing how public money is being spent by the use of proper procedures of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> All sorts of reasons are given for that change of position by the Australian Democrats. Such a change is not entirely unusual but all sorts of reasons are given for it. Of course, the reason basic to their change was summed up by Senator Chipp on the PM program tonight when he described the Australian Labor Party as naive. He said the Opposition was naive for moving motions which would bring before the Senate Estimates committees and before the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations fundamental questions of public expenditure and the right of the Australian people to know how their taxes were being spent by this Government, the Australian people already knowing that their taxes are not being gathered in a fair and equitable way by this Government. But they are entitled to know that what is gathered is spent in a fair way. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chipp, of course, in describing the Labor Party as naive was displaying his own vast experience in this Parliament. He was giving us a friendly jibe, I suppose, by saying we were naive to do anything which might in some ways induce this crazy Prime Minister to call an early election. That, I suppose, is the basis of our naivete. Really, one can be pragmatic, but pragmatism sometimes slips into opportunism and the description of the Labor Party as naive, indeed, the Press release put out by Senator Chipp early today, really I think bears that description. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chipp has been saying today that he is very concerned, as we know he is concerned, about the plight of the drought sufferers, the unemployed and pensioners who might suffer, he says, if there is any delay in relation to the passing of the Budget in the Senate. I could not agree with him more. They would suffer and that is the last thing we would want to see happen. But, of course, last night the Senate passed, as asked to do yesterday by the Government, the social security legislation. The only way in which the social security legislation, which provides for rises in unemployment and social welfare benefits from 1 November this year, could not have effect is if this Government had in fact virtually gone broke. </PARA>
<PARA> One gets to the point where one can believe anything about this Government. Far from being credible it is incredible. It is time the Senate found out in the next week or two whether the Government is broke. If the Government is now broke , it did not know that was the case a week ago. It had no idea about it because at that stage it was putting the Appropriation Bills off until the middle of November. I just remind the Senate and journalists-it is important that they get the facts straight-that last year the Budget was passed in the Senate on 24 November. The year before it was passed on 17 November. The Opposition in this place has given an undertaking to the Leader of the Government in the Senate ( Sir John Carrick) that 11 Bills he sought to have passed by the end of October would be passed. A twelfth Bill was added to the list yesterday. There has been no delay in this Senate in respect of the passing of Government legislation. If the Prime Minister seeks to make the sort of capital out of this situation that Senator Chipp suggests he might, such action would not be in accordance with the facts and it would be naive of the Prime Minister to do so. Of course, Senator Chipp does not trust the Prime Minister-an extraordinary position for the leader of a responsible party like the Australian Democrats to be in. He does not trust him at all and he thinks he might misrepresent the position. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it quite clear that we want to know about items of government expenditure and about items of revenue because we believe it is the function of the Senate as a House of review to know these things. The Senate and the Australian public have the right to know how this Government is spending its money. These things, of course, are very important to the Government which does not want to let the Australian people have this information. They are very important to the Opposition, the alternative government, because if there were to be an election this year we would want to understand this Budget and the basis on which it is built, and I suspect it is built on sand. We want to understand this Budget because we will be in government next year if an election is held this year. We have to offer responsible alternatives and responsible means of managing the economy of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a matter which concerns the Democrats; it is not a matter which concerns Senator Harradine. The idyllic position in Australian politics enjoyed by the Democrats and Senator Harradine is the capacity to promise everything with the knowledge that they will never have to deliver; the capacity to create all sorts of criticism with the knowledge that they will never have to back them up. That is a very nice position to be in. Of course, it is very important to us as an Opposition-and that is why all Labor senators will be supporting this motion-to know what effect the drought and the drought relief program will have on government expenditure and what effect the drought and the drought relief program and the apparent declining incomes of farmers will have on revenue in 1983. We may have to deal with those problems if the Prime Minister is hell bent on the road to destruction and calls an election this year. We would have to deal with these problems and we ought to be entitled to know whether we are dealing with a government which is built on a foundation of sand or whether there is perhaps a little bit of stiffening in it, although I suspect there is not much. We have moved that the Primary Industry estimates be referred to Senate Estimates Committee H for further consideration so that these matters of fundamental importance which are relevant to the economic management of this country, relevant in terms of determining the issues of what can be done in the very tight and difficult situation, can be dealt with in accordance with the proper functions of the Senate as a House of review. The Committee would then report back to the Senate as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it has been suggested in the course of debate that all of these maters can be dealt with in the Committee of the Whole. Senators ought to be familiar with the Standing Orders. The facts of the matter are that in the Committee of the Whole one is allowed under the Standing Orders to ask question about items of appropriation. The Chair can ask to which specific items of appropriation an honourable senator is addressing his remarks. </PARA>

As Senator McLaren pointed out with his normal perspicacity, it is much more satisfactory and important to get direct answers from public servants, for whom the Opposition has a considerable degree of respect, both for their integrity and their ability, than it is to get the evasive, slippery and waffling sorts of answers one receives from Ministers in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one asks a question in here it is like somebody going through a revolving door behind one but coming out in front. Half the time one does not have an idea of what the real answer is and, of course, one is very suspicious that the Minister has no idea either. Senator Townley would understand that on the basis of his numerous questions about postal services, to which no answer is supplied. We would not be so amenable to the course of having these matters dealt with in the Committee of the Whole because we would like to ask public servants what advice they gave about these matters and what estimates they made. We would like to receive honest answers from people whose integrity and ability we respect. That is very important. Estimates committees were established so that public servants could provide such answers and the public could know of those answers. </PARA>
<PARA> Notice of Motion No. 67 deals with the referral of the estimates of the Department of Social Security to Senate Estimates Committee G. The subject matter of that referral has already been revealed to a certain extent. It is quite clear that the figures provided in the Budget in relation to the projected level of unemployment were not accurate and were known not to be accurate at the time. If the negative growth rate figure projected in the Budget were an accurate estimate inevitably the unemployment figures would have been much higher. By the time the Budget was brought down on 17 August the actual number of unemployed was already considerably higher than the Budget estimate. I appreciate that that may allow for the fact that the estimates were prepared a month or so before the presentation of the Budget. I do not make any point about that; I just draw attention to the fact that the addition to the deficit now as a result of the estimated cost of the unemployment benefit is of the order of $ 300m. </PARA>
<PARA> One could now say that the Budget of the Fraser Government, whose members were so good at lecturing us in years gone by about good housekeeping, about how we had to get in the revenue and be careful with the expenditure and so on, is a reliable estimate of the economic affairs of this country, give or take about $1 ,000m at this stage. That is not pocket money. It is not as much as has been lost to revenue by way of tax evasion but it is still not pocket money. The addition to the unemployment benefit deficit is of the order of $300m. The Budget estimates provided for the unemployment benefit for the financial year 1982-83 were approximately $1 1/2 billion. This estimate was based on an average number of unemployment beneficiaries of 395,000 for the whole of the financial year 1982-83. The number of unemployed in July this year, a month before the Budget, was already 405,000 and in August the figure was 422,000. The latest figure, that for September, is 504,000 unemployed. That represents 7.4 per cent of the work force. It is the highest figure since the Great Depression. More than half a million Australians are unemployed under Fraser Government economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer, Mr Howard, even admitted in the Budget that the level of unemployment could rise to 8 per cent next year if this Government is re-elected . According to most estimates that is a conservative figure. In answer to a question asked on Thursday, 14 October, the Treasurer admitted that the sudden deterioration in the job market could mean that unemployment benefit payments will be of the order of $300m above the Budget estimate. The Treasurer said:</PARA>
<PARA> It should be stressed that these forecasts are surrounded by considerable uncertainty and, hence, should be regarded as highly tentative. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a more circumspect way of using the expression which a former Treasurer , Sir Phillip Lynch, once used when he described the Budget figures as rubbery. The increase in the deficit due to both drought relief funding and the payment of the unemployment benefit are of fundamental concern to the alternative government of this country as the possible future economic managers of a country which is in dire economic straits. We will be the economic managers of this country if, in Senator Chipp's dramatic terms, an election is precipitated by the Prime Minister this year-precipitated, as Senator Chipp put it, against the wishes of the Prime Minister's party and ministerial colleagues, with the possible exception of one. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate is entitled to know how public money is being spent. The Senate is entitled to know how public money is being spent through the appropriate procedures for assessing that-that is, the Estimates committees of the Senate. For those reasons we seek to refer these two items to Estimates Committee G and Estimates Committee H. We expect that those committees could deal with the matters very promptly and that no delays would be involved. If that happens the Senate would be in a position of much greater awareness than it is now of the actual facts in relation to these matters. Those estimates and figures would be given to us by responsible public servants. The result would be that the Senate could have a much more responsible debate about the economic issues facing this country. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, it is sad that the Australian Democrats, for some reason of their own which was hinted at by their absent leader, Senator Chipp, would baulk at the public knowing what the true situation is. I regret that Senator Harradine has seen fit to see this matter in a similar sort of light, although he was a little more ebullient about it all in his call to the nation delivered from the back bench in the Senate, in which he counselled us all to get together and have fun around some of the issues which confront this country rather than discuss these practical matters as to what the Senate should do to obtain this information. </PARA>
<PARA> I fully understand the Government's opposition to this proposal. The Government will do anything it can to hide from the people of Australia and the Senate its own dastardly economic mismanagement which becomes more and more apparent every day. It is a logical position for the Fraser Government to take to try to ensure that the public does not have the right to know what the true situation of that economic mismanagement is. I am not in any sense surprised by the Government's attitude in relation to this matter. I commend the two motions to the Senate. </PARA>

The motions seek to reactivate two Estimates committees which have now reported to the Senate and to refer to them two matters-that is, drought relief and the unemployment benefit. The background to this issue must be understood. First of all, the Estimates committees have met. They met for extensive periods and all of this material was available to them. They have had extensive time in which to discuss these and other matters. Those committees have reported to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As if that were not enough, the Appropriation Bills will be before the Senate in the coming days and an opportunity will then be afforded honourable senators to address these questions. It is asserted that no attempt is being made to delay the passage of legislation. The Labor Party claims that it has done nothing to slow up the work of this chamber. In a moment, I propose to seek leave to table a simple little statement which will give a comparison of the time devoted to Government Business in each of three periods. Each relates to the first weeks of the Budget sittings and, to be fair, they include the first week of the Budget sitting in 1975 when the Liberal and National Parties were in Opposition and had the power to obstruct. They relate to the first 15 sitting days, which actually cover a considerable number of weeks. The figures were taken up to a few days ago. </PARA>

The second period studied is in 1980, when the Fraser Government had the numbers and could have enforced its will. The third comprises 15 sitting days in 1982. In 1975, 38.27 per cent of the time of the Senate was devoted to Government legislation. For 1980, the figure was 36.48 per cent. Thus, in 1975, when the Liberal Opposition had the power to obstruct, Government legislation occupied more time than it did in 1980 when the Liberal Party was in government. The figure for 1982 is 19.38 per cent, or half the time that was devoted to Government Business in 1975 and 1980. That takes us to the present.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Against that background, it is apparent that the Labor Party is employing every device possible to spin out the period in this chamber that is devoted to non-legislative business, solely for the purpose of achieving delay. There can be no other purpose than that vexatious purpose in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I invite honourable senators to consider the rhetoric. Tonight we have heard all sorts of rhetoric. Incidentally, Labor Party supporters took offence when I suggested that there was something between the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and the Labor Party, but tonight there went unchallenged a statement concerning the Liberal Party that was utterly wrong, that is, that it is dominated by tax evaders. That statement was completely and corruptly wrong. Apparently there is to be one kind of sensitivity for the Labor Party and another for everyone else. The Opposition does not like being reminded of its past affiliation with the Painters and Dockers Union, or that the residual owners of the bottom-of-the-harbour companies were painters and dockers, many of whom were, and no doubt still are, financial members of the Labor Party. The Opposition does not like to be reminded of that. The Labor Party has said that the Government is reluctant to collect back taxes. Ours is the Government that is bringing down measures for that purpose. Ours is the Government that set up the Costigan Royal Commission. Ours is the Government that, by its 1980 legislation, outlawed bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. During the term of office of the Whitlam Government, not a single legislative move was made to halt the Curran schemes that were then so rife, and of which the then Government was aware. Against that background we are invited to believe that the Opposition is Simon Pure. </PARA>
<PARA> It is asserting that because, since the Budget was presented, things have changed as revealed by the Treasurer (Mr Howard), a special inquiry should be conducted. What about a Treasurer named Hayden who, in October 1975, seven weeks after the Budget was brought down, revealed a little aberration of $786m. Let me repeat his words on that occasion because there was then no plea for a special examination of the circumstances. Seven weeks after his Budget was presented, he revealed an aberration of huge magnitude in these words:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . The rate of increase in average weekly earnings is falling back at this stage to a much lower level than we had projected when we prepared the Budget. We prepared the Budget on projections of a 22 per cent increase in average weekly earnings. In fact, they are now at a rate of 17 per cent a year . . . because the increase in AWE is falling, receipts too will be falling . . . if that . . . continues . . . the deficit will be larger than we anticipated when we put the Budget together. </PARA>
<PARA>How can the Labor Party say, with any accuracy at all, that it did not know, when it put the Budget together, how average weekly earnings were running? How could the Labor Party be guilty of an aberration which, in the end, amounted to $786m and, having done that, try to claim that it is pure, that it never does these kinds of things, and that if there are drifts at all special inquiries should be conducted. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important to keep these matters basically in mind. Two matters are presented for consideration by a committee. One relates to drought relief, the argument advanced being that the Government should have known of the extent of drought relief and that there ought to have been in the Budget important figures related thereto. </PARA>

The fact is that the main rains that determined the occurrence of the drought were denied this continent in August, September and October. I travel the length and breadth of this continent, in every capacity, far more than does Senator Walsh, and I need no lectures from him on agrarian matters. Had there been rain in those early months, much of the crop could have been saved. Certainly, the pastures could have been saved. I repeat: In the earlier months there could have been, given suitable rain, a great saving of crops. There could have been, and still can be, some saving of pastures, but nobody knows whether there will be rain during the remainder of this month, where it will occur on the continent, how it will affect pastures, or to what extent it will save flocks and stocks. No one knows the extent to which non- breeding flocks and stocks will have to be slaughtered, or how much compensation will be necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button, with a grin on his face, is asking that we waste the time of the Senate in order to call together a committee that will try to find out the true cost of the drought. There is not a soul in the whole of Australia who could predict its dimensions. The only question to be asked is as to whether the Opposition agrees with the policy of drought relief that are being proposed. I refer to the specific policies designed to reach out to and aid farmers. If Labor does so agree, over the months ahead it will support whatever is spent on drought relief. Of course, quite clearly, the Opposition does not know, nor does anybody else, how to estimate what the cost will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want the general public to understand what is being proposed here tonight. We are witnessing a completely phoney set-up-an attempt to waste the time of a committee. There is not a public servant on earth who could tell such a committee, with any accuracy at all, what quantum of money would be spent on drought relief. The only thing that matters is whether this Parliament agrees, with the Government on its drought-relief policies. In that regard, the Labor Party is significantly silent. Let it say whether it agrees with the Government' s policy. If it does, the implication is that drought relief legislation is being delayed through the intervention of this very debate, which has been initiated by the Opposition. It is a preposterous nonsense to ask that a committee should get public servants over here and waste their time in order to ask how much drought relief will cost when not a soul in the whole of Australia knows the answer. This is the party whose Treasurer, Mr Hayden, revealed an aberration of $786m in his own Budget estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> The second motion is an even more extravagant motion. The Opposition is saying that something is wrong with the blow-out in the figures for unemployment benefit and, using a nasty phrase, that the figures were known to be inaccurate at the time they were put in the Budget. That is a straight-out reflection on public servants because the fact of the matter is that those figures are provided by public servants. It is on record that that is so. Indeed, that has been made perfectly clear at Estimates committee hearings. To say that the figures were known to be inaccurate is to cast a total aspersion on the public servants. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me make it perfectly clear that the figures in the Budget were provided by the departments themselves. They are the figures which have been given already to Estimates committees. Estimates committees provide an opportunity-no doubt honourable senators availed themselves of that opportunity in previous weeks-for honourable senators to ask about figures in the Budget. The public servants would have told them, as has been quite clearly stated, that those figures are their estimates. Let me remind Senator Button of something of which I reminded Senator Walsh this afternoon. It is being argued that the Government knew or ought to have known that there was a gross inaccuracy-an inaccuracy which will mean a 19.1 per cent increment. How does this shape up with the fact that in 1974-75 under the Whitlam Government-in the Hayden era-the number of unemployment benefit recipients was 80 per cent higher than the estimate in the Budget? Did honourable senators opposite then say: 'Let us have an inquiry; stop the world, we want to have an inquiry'? It was 80 per cent higher. Were those figures inaccurate? Did the Whitlam Government and Senator Button know that they were inaccurate at the time? The figures at that time were out by 80 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are figures of the Department of the Treasury. They are quite accurate. I will go on because the figures get better. In 1975-76 -the next Budget put forward by the Whitlam Government-the number of unemployment benefit recipients was 60 per cent higher than estimated at Budget time. Was that a known inaccuracy by the Whitlam Government or an aberration?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the record of what happens under Labor governments and what happens under non-Labor governments in relation to expenditure on unemployment benefit because in almost every year there have been underestimates. In 1972-73 the expenditure on unemployment and sickness benefits was 34.5 per cent over the estimate. In the following year of 1973-74-a Whitlam Government year-it was 39 per cent. In 1974-75 it was 68.9 per cent. In 1975-76, the last of the Whitlam Budgets, it was 40.5 per cent. In the following years it was 28.2 per cent, 19.7 per cent, 11.3 per cent, minus 7.3 per cent, 3.9 per cent and 12.3 per cent. It is now 19.1 per cent. The Opposition now wants a special committee to inquire into a trend which is demonstrably smaller than it has been over the past decade . It is demonstrably smaller than what has occurred before. </PARA>
<PARA> Why does the Opposition want to hold such an inquiry? It wants to do so only because it wants to hold up things. The Senate has heard how the Opposition has engaged in delaying tactics every day and has adopted every kind of technique to try to delay proceedings. It has made all sorts of pious statements to the effect that it will not hold up the Budget. Let me make the situation clear: The moment the Appropriation Bills are passed by the House of Representatives they will be brought in here, which will mean that we will get on to those Bills either late this week or Tuesday of next week. Those Bills will come in here after they have been dealt with in the other place. We have had genuine entreaties by members of the Senate to get the Appropriation Bills in to the Senate. One should not growl about that as they will be here. I hope that considerable progress will be made on them within days of their being introduced in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that Senator Button has said rather coyly that there is nothing to stop the Senate committees meeting after the Appropriation Bills have been passed. The advice I have is that Standing Order 36 of the Senate does not imply that nor does any practice of the Senate imply that. It has always been a practice of the Senate to have the reports of the Estimates committees in the Senate before the Senate starts its discussion of the appropriations. It would be ludicrous if we passed Appropriation Bills and then had a negative or critical report on some aspect of the Appropriation Bills. To say it is to demonstrate the nonsense of it. In point of fact the Government hopes that within days the Senate will be getting on to the Appropriation Bills. I am delighted with the comments of the Labor Party and, indeed, of the Democrats that they will facilitate the passage of the Bills. In any case, as I said earlier, during the debate on the Appropriation Bills there is ample time for questions to be directed on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me simply draw these points together. We are debating two motions about whether we ought to reactivate two Estimates committees, those committees having met at length and had unlimited opportunities to have public servants before them to discuss this and any other matter. Those committees have done so and reported to the Senate. The situation is that when the Appropriation Bills are introduced into the Senate the opportunity will be available for further questioning. The situation is that the Government wants the Appropriation Bills passed at a reasonably early date. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to refer to the main points of these two motions. First, I refer to the motion which seeks to find out what the true cost of the drought will be. That is absolute nonsense. Not a single person can estimate what the drought costs will be because no one can tell how the season will progress in the months ahead. No one can tell how the pastures will progress, except Senator Walsh who thinks he is an authority on everything and who, equally, has been proven wrong on occasions. Indeed, he has been consistently wrong. </PARA>

<PARA> I repeat that these two motions are utterly ridiculous and time-wasting. I have shown how much the Labor Party has wasted the time of this Senate over the Budget. It is hollow nonsense and hollow rhetoric for the Labor Party to come forward and say that the Government ought to be collecting taxes as it did nothing when the Curran scheme was hanging like a dead albatross around its neck . Honourable senators opposite are laughing at my comments. The Labor Party knew of the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes and did nothing about them. Without doubt its branches are riddled by members of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union who, no doubt, are the residua of this scheme. Honourable senators opposite are laughing at my remark but, my goodness, if honourable senators opposite can pin a dead cat on any known Liberal they regard that as good fun indeed. Let them take it as well as give it. </PARA>
<PARA> These two motions ought to be rejected. The motion dealing with drought relief should not be referred to a committee because no one could know how much it will cost. I repeat: The only thing that matters is whether the Labor Party and the Democrats agree with the drought relief projects of this Government. There can be no way of calculating it. All that one can know is that if the season gets better the money will be less; if it gets worse there will be a necessity to support the farmers in their peril.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I reply briefly to some of the comments made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick). The purpose of the two motions which I moved to refer two matters to Estimates committees was simply, in Mr Odgers's words, to ensure that the public knew the truth about how public money was being expended. I moved that the Estimates committee deal with these two matters- basically of drought relief and the estimated cost of unemployment benefits- within a week so that there would be no delay or no capacity for the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to misrepresent the Opposition conduct as delay, which is a different thing, in the passing of the Budget in the Senate. I thought I made that quite clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The defence which the Government offers to this matter was given by Senator Sir John Carrick first of all in relation to drought relief, when he said that it is an impossible exercise to refer it to an Estimates committee because nobody can estimate the cost of drought relief. He said that, his Government having estimated the cost at $356m! In relation to unemployment and the expected increase in the deficit as a result of the payment of increased unemployment benefits, I simply made the point that by the time the Budget was brought down the figures were inaccurate. A month before the Budget was brought down the figures were inaccurate, a month after they were wildly inaccurate and a month later, with the September figures, they were out of control in terms of the estimated costs of unemployment benefits. </PARA>

On the basis of the information supplied to this Parliament to date it had no idea what the deficit would be, and that is what this is all about. There is a difference between budgeting for a higher deficit and just being incompetent, which is what this Government is. That is the point I am seeking to make.

In answer to this Senator Sir John Carrick goes on with his usual line in saying that in his view the Australian Labor Party Government of 1972 to 1975 was awful and absolutely dreadful. He said: 'You can compare us with them'. He said that in 1975 the deficit blew out by $786m. We are already talking about $1,000m here. Senator Sir John Carrick said: 'If the Fraser Government is a shocking government, our defence is that the Labor Government of 1972 to 1975 was nearly as bad'.</PARA></TALK.START>

This is its record of economic management after seven years. The Minister says: 'We were better'. What Senator Sir John Carrick does in relation to any one of these issues is to give the 'my daddy is a policeman' argument. That shows an absolutely puerile view of the world, if I might say so. I find it pathetic that a man of Senator Sir John Carrick's age and general esteem otherwise-a knight of the realm-says in answer to any criticism that the last Labor Government was as bad or, if he likes, worse. That is not an argument. That is just a childish excuse for an incompetent government, a childish excuse for having the economy of this country in the serious state it is in.

I think it is sad that we have these arguments about who is pure and who is less pure because that really has nothing to do with advancing the interests of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only other comment which Senator Sir John Carrick made was that the Opposition was trying to spin out legislation for its own purposes. I find that an extraordinary allegation coming from a Minister whose party has not even got the Appropriation Bills through the House of Representatives yet. On a piece of paper given to all honourable senators a few days ago he told us that the Government did not really want to deal with the Appropriation Bills until November; that we would deal with them later in November, together with a number of other miscellaneous Bills. This is the Government which until this point has shown no haste in bringing legislation into the chamber and the Government which knows that the normal course of events is for Appropriation Bills not to be passed until the end of the third week in November. All this stuff about the Opposition's spinning out legislation and the time of the Senate for its own purposes is bunkum. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, what Senator Sir John Carrick is concerned about-he expressed this concern in letters he wrote to people-is that after the Budget only 24 per cent of the Senate's time was devoted to Government Business. Of course it was, because we discovered-the whole of this country discovered-after the Budget that this Government had been miserably and abjectly remiss in collecting the revenue . Any Opposition which failed to draw attention to that fact-any Government senator who failed to be concerned about that fact-should not be here. The report of the Costigan Royal Commission into the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, the McCabe-Lafranchi report and others showed that the Government had been losing billions of dollars which it should have collected from the people whom the Prime Minister describes as thieves; the Government has not done so. That is why it lost Government Business at the time of the Budget. As Professor Russell Mathews put it in January:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if the same enthusiasm were to be shown by the Commonwealth for controlling revenue collections as for controlling government expenditures, higher rates of taxation would be unnecessary. . . . I have estimated conservatively that something like 20 per cent of personal income tax nominally payable is being lost to revenue through avoidance and evasion, usually by high- income taxpayers other than wage and salary earners. </PARA>
<PARA>He is one of the Government's economic advisers. He said that in January. That is what it is all about. That is why there was not too much Government Business after the Budget; the Government knows that. It is a ridiculous thing to say that in that period the Opposition was spinning out legislation; the legislation was not even here. The Government did not have it ready because it was so concerned at defending its back door against other people in the Liberal Party and outside it. I commend the motions to the Senate. There has been no argument of substance advanced against them. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Page 29, after clause 43, add the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA> Review of decisions</PARA>
<PARA> ''43A. section 107VC of the Principal Act is amended-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) by inserting ''or a Board'' after ''Commission'' (wherever occurring); and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) by inserting after paragraph (c) of sub-section (1) the following paragraphs:</PARA>
<PARA> '(d) a person claimed to be a member of the Forces is not a member of the Forces within the meaning of section 100; or</PARA>
<PARA> (e) a person was not employed by the Commonwealth on a special mission within the meaning of section 100,'.''. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment seeks to give effect to a change in the Repatriation Act to allow a review procedure to be included by clause 31 of the Repatriation Legislation Amendment Bill. Clause 31 in part seeks to change the definition of members of the forces to cover people who may have been employed on special missions inside and outside Australia which, in the opinion of the Repatriation Commission or board, was of special assistance to the Commonwealth in the prosecution of the war. A number of people could fall into that category, and the Australian Democrats certainly welcome that extension to those people. However, in doing that, some problem seems to have been created by not at the same time allowing the possibility of a review mechanism to the Repatriation Review Tribunal, particularly under section 107VC which would allow, as the principal Act states:</PARA>
<PARA> Where the Commission has made a decision refusing a claim by a person for a pension (other than a service pension) or other benefit under this Act arising out of the incapacity or death of a member of the forces on the ground that-</PARA>
<PARA>It then lists a number of items that enable one to take a claim before the Tribunal. Since this is a new item that has been inserted, I believe it would have been appropriate at that same time to make provision for a person who goes to a repatriation board or the Repatriation Commission with a claim that he was engaged on a special mission and that that special mission was of assistance to the Commonwealth in the prosecution of a war and the board or the Commission does not accept the claim. I believe that it is best to contain that review within the ambit of the Bill itself, although I understand there would be, as is normal, a general right of appeal under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. I believe it is not appropriate to move outside the Act when there could be simple mechanisms for remaining within the Act and going to the Repatriation Review Tribunal. As a consequence, I believe it would be useful at this time to put in that review mechanism that is in the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak in respect of the matter which I think is of a great deal of interest to many people in the defence forces. This matter has been raised by both Senator Macklin and Senator Missen. I have a couple of points to make in respect of it. I say at the outset that, as I announced some two months ago, the Government is undertaking a major review of the whole repatriation legislation which, as is acknowledged, is very complex and very difficult to understand and which is becoming increasingly difficult to administer. The problem which I think is in the forefront of our minds in regard to this matter is the problem associated with the repatriation entitlement determination process. I speak of it as a whole because there are numerous steps in the whole entitlement procedure which take a great deal of time to resolve and which, indeed, provide safeguards for veterans along the way. They are complex, time-consuming and very difficult procedures in their present format.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the second reading stage of this Repatriation Legislation Amendment Bill last night we discussed the difficulties in connection with those complexities and the difficulties the Government faces in seeking to reform them. It is not simply a matter of government decision; it is very much a matter of long and very considerable detailed consultation with the ex-service community in seeking a reformation of the whole determination process. The Government is undertaking that at present by way of discussions with the ex-service community and discussions have been quite fruitful. We are well down the track towards getting resolution of some very major questions. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I turn to the specifics of the points raised in the amendment and make just one point: To proceed with this amendment at the moment would add further complexities to an already complex situation. The passage of the amendment would further complicate discussions the Government is undertaking with the ex-service community and would make it more difficult to get a rationalisation of this very difficult and complex area. For that reason the Government, whilst having considerable sympathy in some respects for the propositions put forward by Senator Macklin, is unable to accept the amendment at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention my colleague Senator Missen in this respect as the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has brought forward this matter as well. I think it is a matter of some concern to us all that the Government is unable to see its way clear to accept the amendment at this point. But I leave honourable senators with a clear understanding that this matter is in the forefront of our minds. We will be discussing this matter with the ex-service community and within the Government in due course. I hope that that will occur sooner rather than later. </PARA>

As he has been able to give the Senate an assurance that the Government will undertake to look at this item within its general revenue considerations, I think it would be appropriate to seek leave to withdraw the amendment rather than to take it to a vote. Before I do so, however , I make the point that I was remiss in my speech. I had intended to acknowledge that the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills did raise the matter first. I believe that shows yet again that this Standing Committee of the Senate has probably now established itself as one of the most fruitful committees in terms of legislative function of this chamber.

<PARA>This request refers to an item which has been of concern to me and to many others for quite some time. I do not believe it will be necessary to debate this issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Drought Assistance (Primary Producers) Bill provides that farmers who are without cash or liquid assets, such as an income equalisation deposit, who are without reserves of fodder, who are resident in drought declared areas and who are predominantly dependent on farming for their income will be paid as a subsidy 50 per cent of the cost of fodder purchased to keep sheep and cattle alive, with a ceiling of the monthly payment of 80c for sheep and $8 for cattle. It also provides that all farmers who meet the three criteria I stated earlier will have all interest payments on debt on the farm above 12 per cent paid entirely by the Government. I note that there is no means test on the proposition. As the Deputy Secretary to the Department of Primary Industry told Estimates Committee H on 16 September, there is nothing to stop a farmer with net assets of $1m, $5m, $10m, or any figure at all, receiving any amount of money under the terms of the proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposal has been subject to some criticism-I believe a mounting degree of criticism-from farmers themselves for a variety of reasons, two of which are that farmers have recognised the innate stupidity which underpins it and the inequities within the farming sector. It is a product of what the newly returned prodigal son, Andrew Peacock, once referred to as the manic determination of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) to have an election this year before the impending economic collapse became self-evident. The Bill appropriates $356m. That appropriation is a major cause of the deficit blowout which we have been discussing for most of this day. It is also, according to information made available to the Opposition quite recently, a probable under-estimate of the ultimate cost. </PARA>
<PARA> I might say, with respect to Senator Sir John Carrick's recent assertions on Senator Button's motions, that matters such as this or indeed any other can be fully investigated in Estimates committees hearings. Estimate Committee H, of which I was a member, had responsibility for this appropriation and other primary industry appropriations. Estimates committees do not work the way that Senator Sir John Carrick suggested they do. For example, on 16 September, at the meeting of Estimates Committee H, a motion was moved that a letter be written to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) regarding two matters, both of which I think have considerable potential to embarrass the Government. That Committee carried a motion that a letter be written to the Minister for Primary Industry about those two matters. The motion was carried because one of the Government senators-and I will not embarrass him by naming him-was not present at the Committee at the time and, therefore, there were three non-government members who carried the motion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the Committee, Senator Archer, some 26 days later actually got around to writing the letter to the Minister. I regard that as a gross dereliction of duty on the part of Senator Archer and, moreover, I believe it was something that was done quite deliberately with the deliberate intent to help the Minister to avoid replying to those questions before the Appropriation Bills actually came before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the drought legislation, the scheme as proposed in the second reading speech of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) is riddled with inequities within the farming sector and between the farm and other sectors . It distorts the ground rules of sound farm management and for that reason has quite horrendous implications for the future if it is to be accepted as the norm . Those implications are horrendous on economic and ecological grounds. The provision of a liquidity test as a qualification instead of a means test rewards the improvident and penalises the provident. The Deputy Secretary to the Department of Primary Industry, who appeared before Estimates Committee H on 16 September, acknowledged this. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . is potentially subject to a wide variety of abuses. </PARA>
<PARA>For all those reasons, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At the end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a limit should be set on the sum that any individual may receive in any one year;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) eligibility should be determined by a ceiling on total assets instead of the proposed liquidity test; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) those persons who are predominantly dependent on their farm for their living should be objectively defined'. </PARA>
<PARA>Even in happier times, a drought of this magnitude would have had quite significant macroeconomic consequences. Under present conditions, the consequences are much more serious because the drought will compound the damage which has already been done by seven years of Frasernomics. The social loss caused by the drought is real and cannot be avoided. This measure, although statements by Government members sometimes imply otherwise, in no way reduces the social losses, the social cost, of this drought. What it does is affect wealth distribution within Australia. It does nothing to truncate the loss. </PARA>
<PARA> On a purely legislative basis, it has set a very bad precedent. The Bill appropriates $356m and enables or empowers the Minister for Primary Industry to make agreements with States; and it says almost nothing else. In effect, it appropriates $356m and allows the Minister to do whatever he likes with it, subject only to the constraints which-and this is subject ultimately to determination by the courts-the courts may rule the explanatory comments in the second reading speech impose on that freedom of action. I might add that of course Bills of this nature which empower Ministers to make agreements with the States for the expenditure of large amounts of money usually-indeed, on every occasion in the past that I can remember-have had appended to them a schedule which at least lays down at least the broad conditions under which the money may be spent. No such schedule is attached to this Bill. The reason for that, of course, is that the legislation was rushed in because the Prime Minister planned to have a premature election. </PARA>
<PARA> It was quite apparent at Estimates Committee H that the decision was made at the end of August and that when the legislation was actually in the House the Department of Primary Industry did not really know how it would administer the scheme. The way in which the $356m or the $600m, whichever it turns out to be, was to be administered at the time the Bill was injected was mostly a matter for wide-eyed conjecture. In a country where the media was doing a proper job of informing the public, it is unlikely that any government would have attempted a measure such as this. But I guess the Prime Minister is secure or feels secure in the expectation of continuing media abdication of responsibility to inform the public on matters such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarding the inequities within the agricultural sector, I believe that the primary one is that the qualification hinges on a liquidity test and not a means test. There is nothing to stop millionaires getting unlimited amounts of money under the terms of this legislation. Let us consider this anomaly. We have two wheat farmers who had good crops and very high incomes last year. One put $50, 000 into an income equalisation deposit, as the Government recommends he should, as a cash reserve for a bad year. The other mortgaged the farm to buy a luxury unit on the Gold Coast. The first farmer, the farmer who purchased the IED in preparation for the bad year which inevitably comes along sooner or later, will not get the interest or fodder subsidy, at least until he has spent all the IED and any other cash he may have. The second farmer, who mortgaged the farm to buy a unit on the Gold Coast, will qualify for the subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider this anomaly between the farm sector and one other, although related to farming. A farm employee is sacked because the crop has failed and he has no work to do at harvest time. He is most unlikely to get another job in the country town in which he resides. He will get from the Government $74 a week unemployment benefit-he will not necessarily get that either-and he might even be vilified by the National Party as a dole bludger. The former employer, who has a high probability of being a member of the National Party, let us assume owns a farm or a farm and non-farm property to the value of $5m. He has 20,000 sheep and a mortgage on the farm totalling $1m at 16 per cent interest. Each month he will get an interest subsidy of $3,332 and a $16,000 fodder subsidy a month. If the drought lasted for a whole year, he would collect $216,000. The Prime Minister has the chutzpah to talk about fairness in government!</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the question of efficiency. If this legislation is to be taken as establishing the ground rules for farm management in the future, the astute farmer will, firstly, do these things: He will make sure he never has any cash. He will never have a fodder reserve because a farmer can never produce fodder as cheaply as he can get it if the Government pays half the price. Above all, he must never have an income equalisation deposit put away in a year of high income for the next drought because the farmer who does that will not only pay more tax , because the Government rorted the tax laws back in 1977 with averaging and income equalisation deposits, but also disqualify himself from getting the subsidy. The second rule for the astute manager is to buy marginal farm land in drought prone areas because it is cheaper and the returns on capital will be excellent in good years and in bad years the Government will underwrite the loss . The third rule, having bought marginal farm land in drought prone areas, is to overstock it for the same reason-the Government will pick up the losses when the overstocking policy goes bad. </PARA>
<PARA> In the second reading speech the Minister said that the scheme was intended especially for breeding stock, to sustain the breeding herd and breeding flocks. However, closer investigation reveals that the payment of the subsidy is not restricted to breeding or potential breeding stock. The full subsidy is available for wethers; that is, sterile males. At current prices, the situation which the Government is sanctioning is very close to this: The Government will encourage farmers to feed $2 worth of readily salable, readily exportable, grain to a sterile male to produce $1 worth of wool. The farmer will be able to cover his expense because he is only paying for half the feed. It is no wonder the wheat price has already been jacked up by about $14 a tonne, as the Australian Financial Review observed today. </PARA>
<PARA> Similar pieces of legislation relative to other industries have come before the Senate in the past. One that I particularly remember is the film tax rort of May 1981. I and other members of the Australian Labor Party said at the time that that would destroy the production of quality films in Australia. It is now acknowledged by the film industry that that has happened. Schemes like this will endanger, if not destroy, the efficiency of Australian agriculture. It is a pity that it takes public perceptions a couple of years to catch up with common sense . As I mentioned earlier, the scheme was announced on 31 August more or less off the top of the Prime Minister's head, the source of an assortment of the most blatant economic idiocies that we have seen since this Government has been in power. </PARA>
<PARA> At the Estimates Committee meeting on 16 September it was clear that desperate attempts were being made by the Department of Primary Industry to put administrative procedures in place and to restrict abuses and impede the potential cash haemorrhage. The fodder subsidy allows for payment of 50 per cent of the standard price of wheat and for other fodders the subsidy is paid pro rata to their feed values. In the advertisements that have been published I noted one additional anomaly. There appears to be no distinction between cereal hay and lucerne hay, even though there are significant differences in the nutritive value of those two fodders, particularly as the quality of cereal hay is highly variable. The subsidy is not available for payment on straw and yet it is possible that the only difference between straw and hay is that straw does not have a head on it and hay does. The digestibility, the fibre content, the protein level, the digestible energy content and everything else can be almost identical. In fact, it is a continuum and there is no precise line where straw, nutritively speaking, becomes hay. </PARA>
<PARA> A ceiling of 80c a sheep and $8 a cattle beast a month has been imposed. It is clear from the Estimates Committee-indeed, it was explicitly stated by Mr Hussey -that nobody would count the sheep because it was not possible. Great reliance is to be placed on a statutory declaration. We had experience of this with a similar scheme in 1977-78-the incentives payments scheme for the beef industry. A couple of hundred fraudulent claims were submited-at least, that many were detected-including one from an officer of the Department of Primary Industry. He was subsequently prosecuted and convicted. </PARA>
<PARA> The question arises: What is a sheep? There is no answer. Supposing a farmer has 1,000 ewes which are four months pregnant and five weeks later they are no longer pregnant, they have had lambs. As I read the legislation, if they have a thousand lambs the $800 a month previously payable will become $1,600 a month because there are now, at least ostensibly, 2,000 head of sheep instead of 1,000 . Who is going to count the lambs? The farmers themselves do not know how many lambs they have until some time after birth. In some pastoral areas that time can be anything up to six months or even longer. We should not be surprised if there are some high lambing percentages-at least some very high lambing percentages recorded, whether the lambs are running around or not. Commercial feed lots are excluded but there is no clear definition of what is a commercial feed lot. It is, so officers of the DPI acknowledged at the Estimates committee, partly subjective. Again, great reliance is placed on the statutory declaration, which previous experience has shown is inadequate. It is payable to farmers in drought declared areas. Up to this stage there is no such thing in South Australia as a drought declared area because that has not been the policy followed in South Australia. That is another very fundamental anomaly that obviously was not considered at the very beginning because of the Prime Minister 's desperate haste to get this ill-considered, open-ended scheme out into the electorate because of his manic determination to have a premature election before the public realise that the economy has collapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> The fodder component of this legislation-by far the most expensive measure-is to be administered by the States. However, the States do not contribute to the subsidy. So we should not be surprised if the States are less than zealous in properly administering the scheme. We should not be surprised if they adopt a very permissive attitude. It is available, so the second reading speech says, to people predominantly dependent on farming for an income. There is no objective definition of 'predominantly dependent'. As an interesting sidelight, I asked at the Estimates Committee whether an inmate of Long Bay Gaol, H. M. Miller, would qualify for the subsidy. The answer is that, if his property is in a drought declared area and if he does not have too much income from some other source, he will. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) should be able to take the cheques along when he goes to visit him. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that the subsidy will not be available to Ministers. This shows a surprising degree of sensitivity in a Cabinet which includes the Deputy Prime Minister, who still has a 4 3/4 per cent loan from the Government for the second house that he owns in Canberra which he gave himself 18 years ago. Given a government that is insensitive enough to tolerate that and has chutzpah enough to talk about fairness, I am surprised that it felt obliged to say that Ministers would not qualify. Again at the Estimates committee it was revealed that there is actually no provision built into the legislation to ensure that Ministers do not apply for the subsidy and do not receive it. </PARA>
<PARA> What about wheat farmers? Usually wheat farming is conducted in conjunction with stock raising. But the relative importance of the two enterprises varies and occasionally farmers engage in only wheat farming or grain farming. The Australian Wheat Growers Federation said last week that it wanted a 75 per cent subsidy on the cost of seed wheat for next year. Why not? Why not the superphosphate as well? Why not the fuel? After all, they planted a crop which failed; they incurred all the expense of planting a crop which returned no income. Why should they be completely excluded from these provisions when some others within the agricultural sector have been treated so generously?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry, whose capacity to produce absurd schemes appears to have no limit, subsequently offered to pay the freight backwards and forwards from the eastern States to Western Australia on stock for agistment. The cost of that transport both ways is about $25 a head. If 10 million sheep were sent to Western Australia-5 million sheep would be a more realistic figure of the carrying capacity of the State for the next six months-that would add another $100m to $125m to the cost. Most absurd of all, he offered to pay a $3 slaughter bounty on animals destroyed on the farm. So we have this perfect contradiction-a government subsidising the fodder to keep stock alive and also subsidising the bullets to shoot them, to the extent of $3 a head. </PARA>
<PARA> But the implications of that go further. At any time a farmer must have a reasonable assurance that the saleyard price received for stock is at least equal to the cost of sending them to market or the cost of processing them in a meatworks if the farmer is paying for that. In one way or other, of course, that cost is taken out of the price. If the saleyard price is not high enough to cover that somehow or other the cocky gets rid of the stock. But enter Mr Nixon who says to the farmer: 'If you shoot it here I will give you $3 for it'. The price that he has to recover from the saleyard automatically goes up by $3. The consequence of that is that stock which could be profitably processed through a meatworks would be destroyed on farms and an already depressed industry would become marginally more depressed. There would be a social loss of income. By that I mean the whole community would lose income because stock which could be profitably processed would be destroyed on farms. Of course, the cost to the Government and to the taxpayer would also increase. With that sort of ineptitude in the upper echelons of the Fraser Government, that sort of comprehension of how a market economy actually works, it is no wonder the economy is in a state of collapse. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Scott is to speak in this debate. I guess we will get an apologia from him which will seek to convey the impression that a cash transfusion will perform some sort of magic trick that will wipe out the drought and cancel the losses accruing from it. That, of course, is nonsense. There is a macro-loss-a social loss-which cannot be avoided. What this legislation does is to shift the losses around between individuals. It will shift the losses from half the farmers, selected as I have already demonstrated on a rather capricious basis, on to the general community-including other farmers, many of whom may be in a worse financial position than the recipients of this largesse. It has reeking inequity built into it, it massively distorts the rules of sound farm management and it will foster inefficiency and irresponsibility in farm management. As the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Primary Industry said before the Estimates committee, it is subject to a wide variety of abuses. </PARA>
<PARA> I just repeat: What a tragedy that these things which everyone will acknowledge in a couple of years time are not recognised at the time they happen. I just want to make one final point on the question of a liquidity test or an assets test. There is absolutely no correlation between a farmer's indebtedness and his net worth. It is a myth that the farmers who owe money are poor farmers. Indeed, the reverse is more likely to be true. Those who actually have significant mortgages and debts actually also have considerable net assets for the very good reason that nobody lends a lot of money to someone who is broke or about to go broke. </PARA>
<PARA> For all those reasons, I urge the Senate to carry the second reading amendment which does not seek to reject the Bill but which just tries to get a bit of common sense through to this Government to set a ceiling on what an individual may receive, to impose an assets test instead of a liquidity test and to define objectively what 'predominantly dependent on farming for their income' means. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Drought Assistance (Primary Producers) Bill is welcomed I think by all senators as a measure which will at least combat in part the problems that are currently occurring within the rural sector of Australia. According to Government figures, an estimated 100,000 farms across Australia have been affected by the present drought. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics figures suggest that the net worth of rural production will be down almost 50 per cent. If this is the case primary production will certainly suffer its worst result for over 25 years. I think the extent of the problem is only now becoming evident to people generally in Australia. The massive disruption caused by the drought will be felt not only now but also in future years. This single problem is a national disaster as great as any we have seen for many years in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has moved in this Bill to give effect to two further subsidies on top of those which are normally in place in relation to drought. It has sought to place a subsidy on interest payments over 12 per cent made by eligible drought declared farmers. I certainly would reiterate the point raised by Senator Walsh about the problems faced in South Australia. I hope that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) in his reply will be able to set at rest the minds of South Australian farmers. I was in South Australia last weekend and certainly they expressed some concern about that point. According to figures from the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) about only 10,000 out of 100,000 farms will qualify initially for the interest rate subsidy. The Minister has also said that a further 17,000 farms are likely to qualify if the drought lasts for another 12 months. Certainly no one is denying the devastation of the present drought. Even if it continues for another 12 months we are looking at only about a quarter of the drought affected farms being eligible for an interest rate subsidy. This would hardly seem to be a generous proposition certainly in relation to the devastation which is currently affecting rural sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> I also raise the point to which Senator Walsh alluded-that is, the relative approach that is being made in relation to grain producers and livestock producers. The Bill has an estimated expenditure for the interest rate subsidy of $36m and an estimated expenditure on the fodder subsidy of $320m. According to statistics of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics the wheat industry is the hardest hit of all farm sectors. Yet the only additional assistance which is available to that sector-the grain grower-is the interest rate subsidy which the grain grower shares with all other primary producers, including the livestock producer. While the fodder subsidy will go only to the livestock producer the interest rate subsidy, or about a tenth of that which is available for the fodder subsidy, must be shared among all areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that the argument gains further weight if one looks at the gross national farm income. In this area the gross national farm income of crop and grain is about 41 per cent or 42 per cent of total income. The livestock slaughter industry and related products contribute about 58 per cent to the gross national farm income. If that be the case it would seem that the assistance currently being given to the grain grower is disproportionately low compared with the contribution that the industry makes to total farm income. I am certainly aware of the other items which exist in relation to grain growers. What we have operating here is the traditional means test operation, which has always been traditional in the grain growing area in terms of government subsidies, as opposed to the subsidy in terms of the livestock grower which has tended to concentrate on assisting that producer to move cattle, or some other subsidy such as we have here in relation to fodder. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hope that by 1982 we could very well have looked in a more close and searching way at those traditional allocations between sectors and possibly attempted to bring back more into focus the enormous contribution that the grain grower does make to the gross national farm income and possibly looked again at a better distribution of assistance across all farm sectors. While Senator Walsh suggested something in a rather disparaging way, it does seem to me that there may not be in the grain growing sector the rather high profile drama which exists in the livestock context. I have visited drought affected areas over the last week. Already the crops have heads on them and they are hardly out of the ground. One can see the enormous amounts of top soil being blown about and piled up across the roads. One cannot but be struck by the fact that those grain growers who, while they may be receiving their payment from the last pool at this point, by next year will be in a situation which will be desperate in the extreme. I believe the interest rate subsidy that has been suggested will not be sufficient to allow many of our grain growers and many of our most productive grain growers to recover. </PARA>
<PARA> I now point to a further danger that I see in the Bill. It is a danger about which I am very much concerned. In some ways this Bill may very well militate in the future against a prudent farm manager. I believe that is a matter of concern . It is of concern not only to honourable senators but also to many of the rural lobby groups with which I have spoken about this matter. They have expressed an identical worry about the lack of attention that is being paid in the overall scheme to drought. If one looks at this Bill one will not find a suggestion of the possibility-I do not believe it would be impossible in this Bill so it is not a criticism of the Government-of a farmer who has been prudent in his management being actually assisted in preference to somebody who has not been so prudent. I take the example of two farmers operating identical farms. One farmer had sought by way of investment to increase his fodder holdings, his fodder storage, and to undertake similar activities, whereas the other farmer sought to take his profits and put them into a holiday home. The first farmer would be penalised as against the second farmer. I believe that is not something that anybody would hold up as being needed in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that what we need to do when we get past this problem-this drought-is very rapidly and from this point onwards to make it very clear that the Government will put in place a national drought insurance scheme. The farmer must be encouraged to put something away for a dry day. I believe subsequent assistance for a dry day ought to be linked with that type of assistance, that type of operation, that the farmers themselves have undertaken. That proposition has been mooted by a number of primary producer organisations. I believe it is one which ought to be applauded by a government which is interested in free enterprise. The facts concerning the problem of drought are quite devastating. In the last century only 22 years have passed completely without drought in this country. In 40 of those years there have been major widespread drought problems. In other words, drought is an inevitability in Australia's primary production cycle. Yet we have no ongoing drought contingency insurance plan. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe such a plan ought to be established by seeking a scheme into which the farmer contributes a percentage of his income. Obviously this would take some time to implement. I believe it would take anywhere from seven years to 10 years. The percentage of income paid into a drought insurance scheme may be very low-it may be one per cent or 2 per cent of the farmer's income. That ought to be augmented in every Budget-not just in one Budget, which has caused this enormous economic disruption to the country. In every Budget an allocation ought to be made for drought assistance, whether there be a drought operating at the time or not. That ought to be paid in to support the farmer's contribution from his own income. One hopes that there could be a link to private insurance companies by way of some type of insurance scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The benefit derived would be the promotion of prudent economic management by the farmer. More than that, it would give the farmer complete confidence that when he was affected by drought he would know precisely what he would receive. In other words, the predictability of drought assistance would be of enormous advantage to any producer because it could be built into his overall farm management scheme. If, say, he were a wheat grower he would know precisely what would happen if during the following year, during the winter or late winter, his area was declared to be drought affected. He would know precisely what his income would be and how it could be built into his ongoing scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems an utter absurdity that in a country in which, given the facts that I have just mentioned, only 22 years of the past 100 have been drought free, we are still awaiting a comprehensive drought program. I suggest that such a scheme would be welcomed by every primary producer organisation. It would also be welcomed by those who have only a peripheral contact with the land. We would not have the type of economic problem that we currently face because the Government will have to find, out of one annual Budget, such an enormous amount for drought relief. </PARA>
<PARA> Primary production suffers from a range of problems, of which this drought relief measure addresses but one. In 1982-83 primary production will be affected by all of the major problems which beset that industry. It will be affected by extreme fluctuations in world markets. It will be affected by the inability of farmers to meet those fluctuations on the world scene. In every primary industry debate in this place people have pointed to the rogue behaviour of the European Economic Community in relation to most international agreements, the latest being in regard to the sugar industry. That merely joins a very long line of problems that primary producers have to face, in terms of international agreements and stability of world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Primary industry is also subject to those national disasters, such as drought, over which it has no control and from which it finds a great deal of difficulty in attempting to recover. If one considers the decreasing number of people on farms one cannot fail to be struck by the fact that unless we introduce a comprehensive policy for primary industry we will not have a viable base upon which to rebuild. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a policy must embrace a number of aspects. For example, there must be a national plan, a national commitment to the reintroduction and maintenance of full tax indexation, which is vital to the rural sector. There must be a continuing commitment on the part of all political parties to the existing tax averaging provisions which I believe, from various remarks that have been made in this place by the Labor Party, are currently under threat. Concessional interest rates must be made available on a needs basis. Drought relief such as we have been discussing here should be restructured so as to form part of an ongoing program. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also consider the possibility of waiving State expenditure thresholds when a drought extends over more than one financial year. We face a range of problems but a range of solutions is available. However, these are all predicated on one fundamental assumption, that primary production is a vital element in this country's economic future. We believe that the support of primary industry goes a lot further than the primary producer. It must embrace the rural sector in total. As a consequence, we must also consider picking up a number of other aspects, such as updating the zone allowance to a status that looks as though it belongs vaguely to the 1980s instead of the 1940s. It ought to be based on social grounds, at a local government level, rather than on the absurd lines that currently are drawn on a map. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should consider, as a matter of urgency, the removal of the sales tax on the freight component of goods. That proposal is currently before the Senate in the form of a private member's Bill introduced by the Australian Democrats. The Government ought to be attempting to do more than it has hitherto to ensure that the fuel equalisation scheme actually works in country areas. It seems to be working fairly well in the cities, but what use that is in terms of having a fuel equalisation scheme I do not know. Everyone knows that the differentials are way beyond those allowed under the legislation, yet very little effort seems to be exerted to bring the position back into line with the statutory obligation set down by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, I believe that the rural sector has a just claim to equity, when compared with the urban sector, in relation to the services that are offered by government. That is probably one of the most telling differences that one notes when one goes into the more remote areas of our States. One finds entire populations without access to the normal services that we expect in a city, as something to which we are all entitled. I refer here not only to high profile facilities such as colleges of advanced education and universities but to such ordinary matters as having a pharmacy, a dentist or doctor, having reasonable medical care and being able to send one's children to a local school that extends beyond the primary or grade 10 level. Such facilities are of vital concern to country dwellers. They are of vital importance to the towns in the rural sector and it is the towns that now are suffering more than ever the effects of drought. </PARA>
<PARA> The support that the Government has offered under this Bill will go a long way to assist not only primary producers but also, in turn, country towns. We must always remember that the majority of people in the rural sector of Australia are not primary producers but rather people who provide services for primary producers. Therefore, it is extremely important to bear in mind that when we are talking about the effects of drought we are talking about the economies of most of the small towns of this country. The small shopkeeper, the local bank, the local producer of farm machinery are now all feeling the pinch. We look around us and find company after company going bankrupt because they service the primary sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Before we come out of this drought the country will pay dearly. I believe that if we are to gain anything from this drought-and surely we ought to gain something from it-it will be a hard learned lesson. That lesson will cost this country dear. One lesson which should come out of this experience is that drought is an inevitable part of Australia's climatic conditions. Because of the inevitability of droughts, governments have a consequent obligation to plan and to allocate money every year to make sure that we are able to cushion the effects of droughts in future in a more effective and practical way. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Government for introducing this Bill and for taking further the drought measures which are available under other legislation. The Australian Democrats will support the Government in any further measures that it takes to ensure that we have a viable primary production sector when this drought is over . </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the amendment which has been moved by the Opposition. The Democrats see some merit in the points raised in the motion moved by Senator Walsh, particularly the second point. I have put forward the idea that we might be supporting or at least inclining towards bad primary production management if the Government's intentions were to continue like operations in the future. I hope that the Minister will be able to refer to that item and possibly make sure that no impression is created that it is a good idea in future not to engage in prudent farm management schemes. The Democrats will not support that part of the amendment. I do not think it adds anythings to the current debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point in the amendment seeks an imposition which, I believe, is far more arbitrary than anything that the Government has suggested. The Government's limitations relate to need. It seems to me that that is where the limitations ought be put. It seems to me rather absurd to put a limitation on an individual. For example, in relation to the fodder subsidy, surely the limitation ought to be where the Government has placed it, that is, on the number of cattle, sheep or whatever the item is. That seems to me to be the 'in need' limitation and not the limitation on an individual. It is not the intention of the Democrats to support the amendment that the Australian Labor Party has moved to the second reading. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to note that Senator Macklin has indicated that the Australian Democrats support the Drought Assistance (Primary Producers) Bill 1982. Senator Macklin indicated that he does not support the somewhat innocuous-perhaps in some ways it is insulting- amendment that has been moved by the Australian Labor Party. Senator Macklin spent a great deal of time talking about the problem of drought in this country. He emphasised the fact that Australia is a drought prone land and, of course, it is; it is the driest continent on earth. He spent some time also discussing the possibilities of establishing some sort of drought insurance. That, of course, has been a concern of producer organisations and, indeed, of the Government parties for many years. It is not the most simple proposal to establish.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that Senator Macklin referred to purdent economic management by the farmer. Senator Walsh in his usual fashion was intent on insulting the farming community on most standpoints. The inference by Senator Macklin was that prudent economic management was hard to find. Of course, the same was inferred in the remarks of Senator Walsh. I do not believe that the average Australian farmer lacks prudent economic management. When farmers have been confronted, as a great number of farmers in this country have been confronted, with droughts which have lasted three or four years and sometimes consecutively, they have little capacity to show a great deal of prudence. All that sort of inference shows is a complete lack of understanding of the drought circumstance that confronts Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight the Senate is discussing the Drought Assistance (Primary Producers) Bill 1982. In view of the remarks of Senator Walsh and, to a very much lesser degree, the remarks of Senator Macklin, I think it is important to understand why this circumstance is so extraordinarily serious. It has been implied that the problems facing farmers could have been avoided in some way by prudent management. The drought that confronts this country today is serious not only because of its severity wherever it occurs but also because of its physical extent. </PARA>
<PARA> The drought covers a very significant part of Queensland, probably 90 per cent of New South Wales, a significant part of Victoria and most of South Australia. The consequence of that alone is that there is no area of relief. There is no agistment. Very little conserved fodder is left. This drought is the culmination of three to four years of virtual drought in a very significant part of Australia. We are confronted, consequently, with circumstances that have never been experienced in this dry land before. I think that should be recognised by those who tend to say that people should be more prudent. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation before us seeks, first, to subsidise interest payments above 12 per cent when the liquid assets of the producer concerned have become so low that they represent no more than 12 per cent of his total farming debt. The second element of this legislation is to establish a fodder subsidy. Both of these proposals are funded totally by the Commonwealth Government. The interest subsidy, of course, is administered by the Commonwealth. The fodder subsidy is a 50 per cent subsidy on the purchase of fodder for drought affected sheep and cattle in drought declared areas of Australia. That is a very generous subsidy but, indeed, a very necessary subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA> The object of those two elements which are the basis of this legislation is, in the first place, simply to keep farmers on their properties, to keep operators on the land. Incidentally, they know the land quite well and can operate it effectively, given any sort of climatic advantage. In the second place, the object is to retain a significant number of breeding stock. The recovery-and recovery there will be from this drought-will be relevant in no small degree to the amount and quality of breeding stock that is able to survive the rigours of this period. </PARA>
<PARA> That reminds me of one other matter that was mentioned in passing by, I think, Senator Walsh. He referred somewhat disparagingly-of course, that is nothing to remark on-to the subsidy being available for wethers. Of course, perhaps in the long term they are not as significant to recovery; but I presume that Senator Walsh understands that the wethers in the Australian flock are extremely significant in establishing a price base for the whole of the Australian sheep industry. Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that the subsidy should be available for them also. It might be relevant to remind the Senate that the subsidy, which is spoken of as if it is some massive contribution per sheep, an enormous gift, in fact represents about five ounces of wheat per day per head of sheep. That is a minimum subsistence rate-in other words, a survival rate. So it is not enormously generous in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA> The statistical extent of this drought has been mentioned many times. I will move very quickly over it. It extends to practically two-thirds of the properties in rural Australia, and that is a mighty big percentage. It concerns a drop in cash flow, in income, to rural Australia of an estimated $1.3 billion at the moment. It could well be significantly more than that. The cash flow in extra-metropolitan New South Wales-the worst affected State-is likely to be in the vicinity of 70 per cent less than that of a year ago. That sort of circumstance extended to the whole community-the villages, the towns and provincial cities of this country-gives honourable senators some idea of the extreme severity of the circumstances about which this legislation is drawn. It is interesting also to remember that the cash flow in the rural community comes virtually once a year. If that cash flow dries up to that extraordinary extent of 70 per cent one can look to no further significant cash flow for 12 to 15 months. That, in itself, emphasises again the severity of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing that follows from that discussion is that this drought has highlighted, more than probably any other thing at any other time, the interdependence of the whole Australian community and in particular the community that lives in extra-metropolitan Australia, because today in talking about farmers as agriculturalists and graziers we are talking about a mere 6 per cent of the Australian population. It was more like 25 per cent 50 years ago. Today it is 6 per cent. But that 6 per cent produces far more per capita than any other rural, agricultural or pastoral community in the world. They are the most efficient producers per capita in the world today, in spite of the insults that are hurled upon them from time to time. They have reduced themselves to that number and increased their efficiency and productivity for a number of reasons, such as the introduction of chemical farming, fertilisers and massive machinery and as a result of research-very often research and understanding that finds its beginning in the farming community. These and a whole host of other reasons, such as new cultivation methods, a capacity to handle and maintain moisture in the soil, prove that point. Australians are the leaders in the world in dry land farming. They even go to the Middle East, to the deserts of the world, and teach the people there how to farm, how to conserve moisture, how to develop other plants and how to irrigate. These people are not really inefficient, messers or bad managers; they just live in an extraordinarily dry country which, in the last five-year period, has been significantly drier than it has ever been. </PARA>
<PARA> The figure of 6 per cent that I referred to is relevant in that something like 3,500,000 to 4 million Australians are virtually directly dependent upon those farmers and agriculturalists who make up that figure. I refer to a whole range of industrial and commercial activity. I refer to people who are involved in the transport industry, the chemical industry, the fertiliser industry and aerial agriculture. The advent of the drought in New South Wales will cost the New South Wales Government railways something like $100m to $120m this year in loss of revenue. The situation of those farmers is of relevance to the vast range of machinery producers of the service industry. I could continue right across the board. The point is sufficiently made by saying that, although only 6 per cent are directly concerned with this legislation and what it seeks to do, 3.5 million to 4 million Australians are in no small degree dependent on the success of the industry which is under threat today. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer in a small amount of detail to the interest and fodder subsidies. The difficulty with establishing an amount referable to the interest and fodder subsidies is quite obvious because no one knows what it will be. I was somewhat surprised when Senator Walsh, in his opening remarks, referred to the amount of $356m as a significant contribution to the alleged blowout of this year's Budget . Of course, it is a significant contribution. It is a contribution that cannot be estimated accurately. It could not be foreseen two, three or four months ago. In my view and in the Government's view it is a contribution that has to be made . Does Senator Walsh suggest that it is too expensive and it might be better to let the stock die or let the people leave the land? A government has to meet its responsibilities and some of those responsibilities are not easy to quantify, if they can be quantified at all, before some point of conclusion is reached. The point of conclusion in this area is very hard to judge indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer again to the interest payment subsidy. I make the point-it is an important matter-that we recognise the very strict eligibility criteria that apply to the interest subsidy over 12 per cent. As I explained earlier, when there are cash reserves equal to no more than 12 per cent of the total debt, then and only then will the subsidy apply. The cash reserves concern themselves with cash in the bank, term deposits, income equalisation deposits, stocks and shares, governments bonds and so on. The debt, of course, has to be for the purpose of primary production. I recall that in relation to this subsidy Senator Walsh insinuated that people make statutory declarations lightly, as though they do not mean very much and they are not much of a guideline. I do not believe that is the way statutory declarations are viewed either by individuals or by the nation as a whole. Statutory declarations are necessary in the case of the interest subsidy and in the case of seeking a subsidy for fodder. Another interesting view-this was also promoted by Senator Walsh-was that there was virtually little difference between the value of straw and of hay. It always amazes me that people strip their crops and do not keep the straw for fodder. They do not seem to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I must press on to the fodder subsidy which is based on 80c per sheep per month and $8 per head of cattle per month. I think I mentioned earlier in the course of my remarks that that 80c per sheep per month is an amount which will enable sheep to survive over a significant period-3 or 4 months-depending on whether there is anything else for them to eat besides the grain. If there is nothing else they will not survive for very long. But, indeed, it is a subsistence level of diet and has to be viewed as such. The manner of claiming subsidy on other forms of fodder has been clearly established. Wheat is taken as having the basic nutritive value and the other forms of fodder will represent a percentage of the value of wheat in a nutritive sense. Consequently, there is very little room for any significant abuse if people are bent on abusing the system. I believe that the great majority of people have no interest in abusing the system. They are keen to survive and to keep their assets, to keep their stock fit and alive. But if indeed they seek to abuse the system, the chances are mighty few. The guidelines and criteria are responsible and significant. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall that Senator Walsh made some fairly slighting remarks about the possibility of establishing a slaughter subsidy. An amount has not been determined, but just for the sake of argument, if it were $3, it would not be a total waste or a gift. The significant thing is that the establishment of that sort of slaughter subsidy would put a base in a market-place. That is what the subsidy would do. For instance, it would stop processors from moving into the market-place and buying stock at a give-away price of a few cents. At least with a $3 slaughter subsidy there will be a base in the market-place and a stop to any form of needless slaughter. That is the important thing to remember concerning any slaughter subsidy criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an amount of criticism on this legislation from some quarters, such as from the Australian Labor Party spokesman and a few others, that is seeks to provide shelter for the poor operator; that it will be chiefly a boon to the poor operator; that he should not really be the beneficiary; that the prudent operator-that lovely word-should be the beneficiary. Basically that is as it will be because one must look at the people who we describe somewhat glibly as poor operators and ask ourselves in truth: Are they in fact poor operators? I suggest that some of the people referred to may be relatively young in their industry. They could have just made a relatively recent advent into the industry. They would clearly carry very significant debt structures compared with people who had been in the industry for many years and consequently they would need a great deal of help. But the help would be needed not because they were poor operators but merely because they did not have the opportunity to develop from that point of entry into their industry where they carried very significant debt and where climatic circumstances could make that an extreme embarrassment. </PARA>
<PARA> Mention has to be made of the fact that some of the people involved would be subject to unfortunate circumstances. I have already mentioned one in another context. They could well be subject, as indeed hundreds and thousands are subject, to a circumstance in which they are not looking at one drought year or a droughty six months; they are looking at literally three or four years of drought. It is hardly a fair basis for condemnation to say that they are inefficient or imprudent when in fact they have suffered a continuing drought. They could be in a difficult situation for health reasons or, indeed, they could have been subjected to pests and disease in the progress of their industries. There are one or two further matters that concern me in this debate but at this point I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This is an omnibus Bill to amend the National Health Act, the Health Insurance Act and the Health Insurance Commission Act. </PARA>
<PARA> By the Bill the Government seeks to give effect to a number of measures foreshadowed by the Treasurer and the Minister for Social Security. These measures will further demonstrate the Government's concern for those persons and families in our community who are in special need. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would implement a major expansion of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The Government proposes to make available drugs and medicinal preparations on the pharmaceutical benefits schedule at 50% of the general contribution rate to a larger number of persons in need who presently pay the full contribution rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill would also make a number of amendments to pensioner health benefits entitlements to reflect the significant improvements to our welfare system that are included in the recent social security legislation amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity has been taken to make some important changes to the health insurance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now deal in detail with the changes to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The new patient contribution arrangements for pharmaceutical benefits will involve a three-tier system of contribution in place of the present two-tier system. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners (including supporting parent beneficiaries) who hold pensioner health benefit cards and sickness beneficiaries who hold health benefit cards, and their dependants, will continue to obtain pharmaceutical benefits without charge. </PARA>
<PARA> Health care card holders and those on social security pensions (including the supporting parent benefit) or service pensions who, because of income, are not entitled to a pensioner health benefit card will be classed as concessional beneficiaries. As honourable senators will recall, under arrangements introduced from September last year, low income persons, unemployment and special beneficiaries meeting the income test and all migrants during their first six months residence in Australia are entitled to a health care card. By virtue of clause 27 of the Bill such concessional beneficiaries and their dependants will be entitled to pharmaceutical benefits at the reduced contribution rate of $2 per benefit item. About one and a quarter million people-who under existing arrangements are required to pay the full patient contribution-will be assisted by this initiative. The rest of the community will pay a patient contribution of $4 per benefit item, an increase of 80 cents. </PARA>
<PARA> These new arrangements would come into operation on 1 January 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that the changes could result in a net increase in Government spending in 1982-83 of about $2.8m and about $7m in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision is made in clause 26 of the Bill for the patient or an agent to be responsible for the establishment of the appropriate entitlement-that is whether pharmaceutical benefits are to be supplied free of charge or for a $2 concessional patient contribution. At the present time medical practitioners and participating dental practitioners are the only persons allowed to endorse pensioner entitlement numbers on pharmaceutical benefit prescriptions. From 1 January 1983 this will no longer be the case. The patient or his agent will establish the relevant entitlement by completing a declaration that will be printed on the prescription form. </PARA>
<PARA> This new arrangement would ensure that patients receive their appropriate entitlements in respect of patient contribution concessions for their pharmaceutical benefits. In addition the new arrangement should overcome problems met by patients and chemists when entitlement numbers are omitted from their prescriptions by the prescriber. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I would like now to turn to the amendments proposed in this Bill to effect other changes already announced by the Minister for Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 of the Bill would amend the Health Insurance Act to assist invalid pensioners and persons in receipt of a sheltered employment allowance who want to re-enter the workforce. From 1 January 1983 any such person who loses entitlement to these social security payments because he or she commences open employment would be entitled to a heatlh care card for twelve months free of income test. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, it might be worthwhile if I take this opportunity to remind honourable senators of the more significant benefits that are available to persons who have a health care card. These are:</PARA>
<PARA> The provision, with the agreement of the medical practitioner, of scheduled medical service free of charge;</PARA>
<PARA> In other cases a Commonwealth medical benefit of 85 per cent of the schedule fee for medical services or the schedule fee less $5.00 whichever is the greater , without the need to insure;</PARA>
<PARA> Free outpatient treatment and free inpatient treatment as public patients in shared wards of public hospitals;</PARA>
<PARA> The provision of optometrical consultation services free of charge; and</PARA>
<PARA> From 1 January 1983, pharmaceutical benefits at the concessional rate. </PARA>
<PARA> It has always been of major concern to invalid pensioners that if they attempted to return to work they would lose their fringe benefit entitlement. The health care card entitlement will go a long way towards removing this concern and, it is hoped, encourage some invalid pensioners to re-enter the workforce. I am sure that all senators will welcome this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to draw honourable senators' attention to the extension of full fringe benefit entitlement, subject to an income test, to persons in receipt of the proposed rehabilitation allowance. This new form of income maintenance to be paid under the Social Security Act will be introduced from 1 March 1983 for people who undertake a rehabilitation program with the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. As honourable senators will be aware from the social security legislation amendments the allowance will be available at not less than the rate and under the same conditions as the invalid pension. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 4 and 14 of the Bill would extend the definition of eligible pensioner in the Health Insurance Act and the National Health Act to include persons receiving the rehabilitiation allowance. Such persons would thus receive a pensioner health benefit card, subject of course, to the fringe benefit income test. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps at this stage I can remind honourable senators of the benefits available from the Federal Government for persons who hold a pensioner health benefit card or health benefit card. These persons are entitled to:</PARA>
<PARA> The provision, with the agreement of the medical practitioner, of scheduled medical services free of charge;</PARA>
<PARA> in other cases a commonwealth medical benefit of 85 per cent of the scheduled free for medical services or the schedule fee less $5.00 whichever is the greater, without the need to insure;</PARA>
<PARA> fee outpatient treatment and free inpatient treatment as public patients in shared wards of public hospitals;</PARA>
<PARA> the provision of optometrical consultation services free of charge;</PARA>
<PARA> free pharmaceutical benefits;</PARA>
<PARA> free hearing aids and batteries;</PARA>
<PARA> telephone and postal concessions; and</PARA>
<PARA> travel concessions with Australian National Railways and for sea transport with the Australian National Line. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Bill would also provide that persons who receive the family income supplement or the mobility allowance introduced by the social security legislation amendments will not lose their eligibility for a health care card because of this additional income. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment to the Health Insurance Act will ensure that any family income supplement or mobility allowance that a person receives would not be taken into account when assessing eligibility for the health care card. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I now turn to some important changes relating to health insurance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> First, I draw the attention of the Senate to the measures in Clauses 23 and 43 of the Bill. These measures would preclude the application by any State or Territory of any special levies on registered health insurance organisations. I am sure that honourable senators will be aware of the legislation passed recently by the Victorian Parliament which imposes a levy on health insurance organisations in that State. The levy, at the rate of 80 cents per week per family contributor and 40 cents per week per single contributor for basic hospital tables, has been imposed since 1 August 1982. The levy is intended to finance outpatient services provided to insured persons in Victoria. Separate charges are not raised by the Victorian public hospitals for these persons. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Government introduced the levy because of alleged difficulties in collecting outpatient revenue. The levy arangement has a number of undesirable implications which, from the Federal Government's viewpoint, make it unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> Victoria has used a broad legislative provision to solve an administrative or management problem in its hospitals. The arrangement cuts across the Federal Government's ''user pays'' policy for health services. The levy is estimated to produce revenue in excess of that indicated by utilisation of outpatient facilities and thus contributors to Victorian health funds are paying more than they need for health insurance. The Bill would preclude the operation of the Victorian levy from the date of royal assent of this Bill and preclude the introduction of similar levies for inpatient and outpatient services in any State or Territory. The Bill would re-affirm the Federal Government's responsiblity in the area of health insurance, including its role to protect the insured public and the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments do not affect the basic responsibility of the States and the Northern Territory to determine charges in public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I would like to draw honourable senators' attention to provisions in the Bill relating to the scrutiny of any directions a Minister may give a registered organisation concerning its management practices. Earlier this year during debate in this chamber when the power for the Minister to give such directions was included in the National Health Act, the Government undertook that it would examine some form of scrutiny of these directions. Tabling in the Parliament was foreshadowed. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to point to the provisions at clause 19 of the Bill which require the Minister to table a copy of such directions in each House of the Parliament. The clause provides that either house may disallow a direction within 15 sitting days of it being tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity has been taken to include rights of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal against a number of administrative decisions to which presently there is no right of appeal. These are at clause 36. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill supplements further initiatives in health care arrangements for pensioners and beneficiaries announced by the Minister for Social Security that come within the provisions of the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Bill before the Senate is an important piece of legislation. It represents a major extension to health benefits while at the same time providing in some areas greater incentives for people to improve their positions and become less dependent on the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to make provision for the financing of part of the prospective 1982-83 Budget deficit. As is frequently the case, the prospective deficit gives rise to the probability that calls on the Consolidated Revenue Fund will exceed moneys legally available to that fund, even after use of various legislative provisions to charge certain expenditures to the Loan Fund rather than the Consolidated Revenue Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot validly exceed moneys available to that Fund. Thus, for many years, successive governments have introduced legislation in the form of a Loan Bill of the type I am now presenting, for the purpose of funding defence expenditure out of the Loan Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer announced in his Budget Speech for 1982-83 that the prospective overall budget deficit for this year was estimated to be $1674 million. At this stage of the financial year, there are two areas where the need for additional outlays has become apparent. One relates to expenditure on the new drought relief measures which, on the basis of present tentative estimates, could cost some $350 million in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> It has also become necessary to revise the Budget estimate of expenditure on unemployment benefits. While there is a good deal of uncertainty surrounding such estimates, present indications are that expenditure could be some $300 million greater than expected at Budget time. </PARA>
<PARA> Particularly given these sizeable additions to the budget estimates of outlays and hence of the deficit it will be necessary for some defence expenditures to be financed from the Loan Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will therefore authorise borrowings for defence purposes-both under the Department of Defence and the Department of Defence Support-to enable defence expenditure, which would normally be met from Consolidated Revenue Fund, to be met instead from the Loan Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> I should make it clear, however, that the Bill does not authorise any defence or other expenditures additional to those which have already been authorized by Parliament in Supply Act (No. 1) 1982-83 or which will subsequently be authorised in Appropriation Acts for this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard I draw the attention of honourable senators to clause 8 of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1982-83, which makes that Bill subject to the provisions of the proposed Loan Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes a specific limit to the amount of any borrowings that may be undertaken. That limit is $1500 million which amount the Government considers reasonable to meet the prospective deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to raise a matter which was the subject of a question I put to Senator Chaney earlier today. It concerns the jobs of 400 workers at the Kelvinator plant in South Australia which are under threat because of the massive increase in the imports of room air conditioners into Australia over the last three years. In August of this year the Temporary Assistance Authority was requested to investigate and report on whether it was necessary for urgent action to be taken to provide assistance to the air conditioning machine manufacturing industry in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Kelvinator Australia Ltd, the principal manufacturer of room air conditioners in Australia, was seeking a five per cent increase in the tariff level together with an additional five per cent penalty tariff for imports in excess of 90,000 units. In its application to the Temporary Assistance Authority it was supported by the United Trades and Labor Council in South Australia which has members of 12 of its affiliated unions employed in the manufacture of room air conditioners at the Kelvinator plant in Adelaide. The company and the unions have both argued that Kelvinator is facing a major threat from imports of room air conditioners. Figures I have seen certainly show this to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1978-79 and 1981-82 imports of room air conditioners increased from 72, 449 units to just over 187,000 units-an increase of 158 per cent. It's interesting to note that imports from Japan increased in that time from around 22,000 units to 87,000 units-an increase of a massive 400 per cent. Meanwhile total retail sales of room air conditioners have increased by only 58 per cent between 1978-79 and 1981-82. This has meant that potential local production has actually fallen from 64,500 units in 1978-79 to only 35,000 units last year. In other words the market share occupied by imports has risen from 53 per cent to 86 per cent in the last 3 years. </PARA>
<PARA> If imports increase in 1982-83 at the same rate as they have increased in previous years total imports this year could be as high as 268,000 units, well above the expected total sales figure of 193,000 units. Clearly this shows that local production would be whittled down to nothing. Even if imports stayed at last year's level the potential local production for 1982-83 would be down to 6, 000 units, one-fifth of what it was last year. From all this, it is quite clear that the jobs of workers involved in the manufacture of room air conditioners in South Australia are being jeopardised by cheap imports. Simply this means that 400 workers in South Australia are threatened with retrenchment unless something is done to stop the flood of imports. </PARA>
<PARA> Kelvinator has categorically stated that 400 jobs will go if some form of temporary assistance is not received from the Federal Government. These 400 workers would be in addition to the 279 workers retrenched by Kelvinator earlier this year and in addition to the 300 workers in another section of the plant who were told by the company last week either to accept a four day week or lose their jobs altogether. This is a very grave and serious matter indeed. I know the recommendations of the Temporary Assistance Authority are now before Cabinet and I want to urge all Government Ministers-particularly Senator Messner who is the only South Australian Minister in this place-to do their utmost to ensure that Kelvinator is given the temporary assistance it requires. </PARA>
<PARA> The last thing we need in South Australia at the moment is another 400 retrenchments, especially just before Christmas. South Australia already has the highest unemployment on the mainland and a youth unemployment rate of 29 per cent. We have seen something like 1,500 retrenchments in South Australia's manufacturing industries since January 1982 and there are rumours that General Motors-Holden's Ltd will put off more workers after the State election. </PARA>
<PARA> What worries me, as far as the Kelvinator situation is concerned, is the precedent set by the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd case. When that company recently asked for special temporary assistance the Government refused it and we will no doubt see the end result of that over the next few months. No doubt the decision was reached after pressure was applied to Cabinet from the so-called dries or free marketeers on the Government benches. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope for the sake of South Australia that history will not repeat itself. I hope the Government does not wait until after the State election because if it does we all know what that will mean. It certainly would not want to jeopardise 400 jobs before a State election. I will not keep the Senate much longer. I just want to say in conclusion that I hope common sense will prevail and that the Cabinet will put the jobs and livelihood of 400 workers and their families before the principles of the Liberal Party dries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is almost true, Senator McLaren. He is, in fact, the same Alan Carroll who has been involved not in the New Guinea elections but the Fiji elections. I will come to that in a second. On his past record Carroll's intervention in the South Australian campaign will be highly political and biased. As I mentioned to the Senate last November, Alan Carroll is a director of a company called Business International, a company whose area of responsibility is in South East Asia, the Pacific and the Australian region. It is a New York company. I refer the Senate to my speech of 25 November and the connections of that company. Business International Asia Pacific Ltd, the company to which Alan Carroll was connected, is a subsidiary of the giant New York based firm, Business International Corporation. That is a firm which, in 1977, the New York Times described as being intricately linked to the United States Central Intelligence Agency-the CIA. Business International Corporation has links in Sydney and in Melbourne. All of these links are related to overseas companies. The world's transnational corporations have a major inter-woven relationship with Business International. Companies based in Sydney include General Electric, Mitsubishi, International Business Machines and so on. Companies based in Melbourne include Australian Consolidated Industries, Beatrice Foods, the Chase Manhattan Bank, Conzinc Riotinto and whatever.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pilkington-ACI, I am sorry. As I said, this man represents not Australian interests but very much the interests of foreign multinationals. He has in fact, as Senator McLaren said, meddled in other politics in this region. He meddled in the downfall in 1981 of Rupert Hamer, who was then the Premier of Victoria. Recently he meddled in the politics of Fiji, where he drew up an election strategy for the Fijian Prime Minister, Ratu Mara. As part of that strategy, a former Australian Broadcasting Commission executive, Clive Speed, was appointed to the Government as a public relations officer. In fact he was working for the Ratu Mara Alliance Party. As part of that strategy also a Dr Geoffrey Race, a business associate of Alan Carroll, based in Bangkok, also involved himself in the campaign in Fiji.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have mentioned Alan Carroll's intervention in South Australian politics on a previous date. At that stage I mentioned Alan Carroll's involvement with the Roxby Downs project. He was quoted as saying that Roxby Downs was the biggest opportunity South Australia faced. In discussing his assessment there, I refer the Senate to the Adelaide News of 14 September 1980, in which the financial editor, Mr Frank Moore, said of Mr Alan Carroll:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and Alan should know-he is a consultant to both partners in the amazingly rich uranium, copper, gold prospect, those partners being Western Mining Corporation and BP. </PARA>
<PARA>Alan Carroll has a direct interest in the operations of these companies. His assessment of Roxby Downs was not adequate and unbiased then and is not now. After my speech in the Senate on that day I wrote to the Australian Broadcasting Commission which, for quite some time, had used Alan Carroll as a commentator. In response to my letter, I received the following letter from Keith Mackriell dated 17 March 1982. I quote part of that letter:</PARA>
<PARA> In the interests of balance and conscious of the need to use a range of commentators, we have been giving thought to the use of Mr Alan Carroll in ABC programs. When your representations were made, our Director of Public Affairs ( Television) had already asked that Mr Carroll be used sparingly in programs under his control, such as 'Nationwide'. </PARA>
<PARA> You will appreciate that only in quite exceptional circumstances would the ABC give a guarantee that any speaker should be excluded from invitations to appear on ABC Radio and Television. However, in view of the information contained in your speech to the Senate on 25 November 1981 and which has not to our knowledge been denied, particularly careful consideration will be given to the question of future invitations to Mr Carroll. If Mr Carroll does appear, consideration will also be given to the sort of balancing information that is presented from other speakers, who may have different opinions from his own. </PARA>
<PARA>The acknowledgement in this correspondence is that Alan Carroll is not unbiased. He is involved in a direct financial way with these corporations and if he were to be used balancing opinions would be used by the ABC. I take this opportunity to warn South Australians about the vested interests of this person who will portray himself as an independent political commentator. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I raise tonight relates to international flights to Adelaide, which will commence on 2 November. The first flight will arrive in Adelaide on that date. In fact it was to be a grand scenario for the South Australian Premier on that day. Premier Tonkin was to arrive from Singapore on the first flight and, as he would have calculated, make major political impact on the State. However, his plans have been thrown askew by the plans of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) because, after a quick visit to Canberra, it has been decided that the State election in South Australia will be held on 6 November, not on 27 November. Because of this change of plan, which I will come to later, we have had the Premier cancel his trip on the Qantas Airways Ltd flight to come into Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> However much Qantas flights will be appreciated by South Australians, I wish tonight to raise a number of points in respect of them and to have them followed up by Qantas. The flights will be of benefit to people travelling to and from the United Kingdom. However, for someone to leave Adelaide to go to any other port in Europe, he or she would have to leave Adelaide at 8 a.m. and reach Melbourne at 10 a.m. There is no direct flight to Europe from Adelaide. In Melbourne those people would have to connect with a Qantas flight leaving somewhere in the vicinity of 3 p.m. that day, so that they would have a five- hour delay in Melbourne. That applies on the days when, in fact, direct flights are not available in Singapore to connect with flights from Adelaide. A person coming from Europe to Adelaide-the so-called investor that our Government in South Australia has been extolling quite loudly in recent days-would have to arrive in Melbourne, on five out of seven days a week, at 5.40 a.m. and would not be allowed to connect with a domestic flight to Adelaide but would have to wait for the next Qantas flight which leaves Melbourne at 1.30 p.m. on the same day. So he or she would have a seven or eight-hour delay in Melbourne before leaving for Adelaide. It is an inconvenience which in some ways detracts from the attraction of international flights to Adelaide and these two problems, especially the fact that people cannot switch to domestic flights to facilitate their journey to and from Adelaide, ought to be considered by Qantas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to make a few remarks about the Community Youth Support Scheme as it operates at Maryborough in Queensland. I was saddened to hear today that the CYSS program in Maryborough is to terminate. I understand that there has been much activity in Maryborough in an effort to have the program continued. We all know the valuable work that the CYSS program does for unemployed youth. It provides them with many opportunities to brush up on some skills and to do something worth while in the time they are looking for work. I understand that the honourable member for Wide Bay, Mr Millar, has been involved in discussions about the CYSS program at Maryborough. I have no doubt that he and all those who were involved in trying to keep the CYSS program operating in that city genuinely wanted to see the program continue .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not sure whether the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) will be able to respond to my questions tonight, but if he cannot I ask whether the information can be provided at a later time. I would ask him whether the decision to terminate the CYSS program in Maryborough is an irrevocable decision . If it is, can the Senate or can I be given a detailed account of the reasons for its collapse and its subsequent termination? I ask also whether officers of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations will be able to monitor the situation in Maryborough to see how the unemployed youth in that city can be assisted if the CYSS program does terminate early next month, as I believe it is scheduled to do. Finally, I ask whether the people of Maryborough can be advised how soon they can expect the CYSS program to be available once again for the youth in their city. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak briefly on the adjournment tonight to answer the many queries which have been directed to me in the course of the day as to my reason for wearing a tie today. At this time of the year the annual gathering of the MacLaren clan takes place in Edinburgh, Scotland. This time three years ago I had the pleasure of being there in the good company of many of my fellow clansmen. What I am going to say about the MacLaren clan tonight also has something to do with the forthcoming election in South Australia. For Senator Chaney's benefit, I give some of the background of the MacLaren clan. The MacLarens are recorded as being in possession of lands in Balquidder in the twelfth century, so we go back a long way. They also possessed the Isle of Tiree. They fought at the battles of Sauchieburn, Flodden and Pinkie and were loyal to the Royal Stuarts. They are recorded as being a war-like clan which engaged in feuds with other clans. The brother of the founder of the Stewarts of Appin was a MacLaren. The clan participated at the Jacobite rising of 1745 and many of them were at the battle of Culloden. John McLaren, Lord Dreghorn, descended from the MacLarens of Tiree and in 1781 was recognised as chief of the clan. Of course I have one dispute with the MacLaren clan. One of them saw fit to accept the title of a lord. Had I been about at that time, so many years ago, I am sure that I could have persuaded him that accepting titles was not in the best interests of the MacLaren clan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to say to the Senate that we are a warlike clan and I wear this tie not only in memory of the MacLarens, my forebears, and in recognition of the fact that the annual gathering of the clan will be held in Edinburgh at about this time, but also to signify to the Liberal Party that I am doing battle with it in South Australia for the next three weeks. I am sure that, as MacLarens have done in the past, we will win that battle and the party that I support will be in government after 6 November. I am sure that will not be a very happy day for Senator Chaney but it will be a very happy day for me and most of the MacLarens.</PARA>
<PARA> I am sad to say that some of them are not supporters of the Labor Party but most of the MacLarens whom I know are very loyal to the clan. We fight for the right of the underprivileged. That is what we will be doing in South Australia right up until the close of the polls on 6 November. I am quite happy and sure in my knowledge that, after that date, the underprivileged in South Australia will be looked after by a Premier, in the person of John Bannon, who will do justice to their cause and we will get back on the steady road to recovery in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I wind up by saying that I have suffered very greatly today by being attired in this tie. It has been a great encumbrance to me. I have made my point. Tomorrow when we assemble I will be in my usual attire and the tie will rest in its place in the wardrobe until I have to bring it out again for the celebration of the MacLaren clan meeting about this time next year in Edinburgh. Who knows, I might even be there to enjoy again the vintage from McLaren Vale, which they purchase and have on the shelf in Edinburgh to drink the health of all the MacLarens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have to say that the discomfort Senator McLaren suffered today from wearing that tie is as nothing to the discomfort he will suffer if I get my hands on him. I now understand why Senator McLaren does not wear a tie. Anyone with his habit of speaking so often in this place must know that it would be extremely dangerous to wear anything that would assist in strangling him. Having listened to Senator McLaren about his warlike clan, I venture to guess that, if Senator McLaren is a genuine example of that clan, members of the clan have talked their way into more trouble than they have ever fought their way out of. I also suggest that the current gathering taking place in Scotland will last for a very long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Three other matters were raised in the adjournment debate. Senator Foreman raised the matter of Kelvinator Australia Ltd and the concerns which he gave vent to in Question Time this morning about the possibility of loss of employment in that firm due to competition from imported air conditioners. That matter has been reported on by the Temporary Assistance Authority. The matter is being considered by the Government and his fellow South Australian, Senator Messner, has also been taking an active interest in the pursuit of that particular matter. I will ensure that the remarks of Senator Foreman are drawn to the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr Peacock).</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Bolkus raised a number of matters which showed a certain amount of concern about a Mr Alan Carroll. The main drift that I could get from the honourable senator was that he did not regard Mr Alan Carroll as a totally objective observer. I can only say, as he is concerned about people who appear on the Australian Broadcasting Commission as commentators, that I thought that in general people were selected to comment for the ABC because they had a point of view. One evening program seems particularly to use, for example, Marxist commentators on a regular basis. I note that Cooke, the man who provides letters from America, consistently provides comment which I would have thought showed a strong conservative bias. I note that in the Coming Out Ready or Not Show there seems to be a consistently feminist viewpoint and I have heard occasionally people like Professor Wheelwright who, I would not have thought, would speak without a strong doctrinal line. What Mr Carroll's views are I do not know. Quite frankly, I do not care. But I would have thought that it was a feature of the people who comment that they have a strong point of view. If, occasionally, that point of view is one which is biased in favour of private enterprise, I for one will not complain. </PARA>
<PARA> As to his connection with Roxby Downs, I have no knowledge of that but I would have thought that one would not need to be either biased or informed in detail to understand that Roxby Downs is the largest single opportunity that South Australia has for substantial economic development and I would have thought the considerable emphasis placed on that project by the present Government simply reflected the reality that, if a project of that size could be got off the ground, it would be of very substantial advantage to the State of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter of substance was raised by Senator Colston. I very quickly sought some information on the Maryborough Community Youth Support Scheme. He is quite right in saying that it is a matter which has received a lot of attention. The local member has been very involved in representation over a period of some months. I can advise that the project was recommended for closure by the Queensland CYSS committee in June of this year. It was recommended for closure on the ground that it was failing to meet the criteria for a basic CYSS project as set out under the guidelines and in particular there was inadequate participation and poor management. Honourable senators who remember the controversy over CYSS when it was proposed that it should be discontinued as a project generally will recall that there were significant complaints about ineffective CYSS projects. When it was decided that CYSS would be continued it was determined that there should be an effort to ensure that the projects were in fact effective. Apparently the Maryborough project, in the view of the CYSS State committee, was not effective; there was inadequate participation and poor management. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the representation received at that time by the relevant Minister, which was that the project could improve itself and become a viable project, a decision was taken by the Minister to give a further grant to the project. That started on 1 July 1982. The grant was made on the basis that the project would improve but that, if the State committee felt that the project was not improving and that the further grant was doing nothing to improve the situation, it should not hesitate to come back to him with a further recommendation. Soon after that, an officer of the Department visited Queensland to discuss the matter with the local committee and the local member. At any time during the course of any project's grant, the State committee can make a recommendation to the Minister that the project be closed providing that it believes that the pro- ject is not operating adequately. Apparently the State committee in this case was convinced that nothing was being done to improve the project and it felt obliged to come back with a further recommendation for closure. The project has already been given a period of grace but apparently that has not been used to good effect-hence the further recommendation for closure which has been accepted by the Minister. I am advised that the local member and the project itself have been informed. </PARA>
<PARA> I think at the heart of the matter raised by Senator Colston was his inquiry towards the end of his comments as to whether that was an irrevocable decision. I think history shows that every effort has been made to maintain this project. As to whether a further project would be entertained in the future, I would have to refer that question to the Minister. I am not sure whether current guidelines permit projects to be started up again. But I would say with some confidence that, if that possibility is open, it would be likely to be entertained only if there were such local support as would give a pretty clear indication that the deficiencies which apparently have dogged the project would not be a feature of any reopening. So, if there is concern about the failure of the CYSS project in Maryborough and the representations which have been made indicate that there is interest in having an effective project, clearly there will have to be adequate involvement in Maryborough itself to ensure that the guidelines for CYSS can be met and that the Commonwealth funds which are expended are used to good effect for the youth of that area. </PARA>

<PARA> On 7 September 1982 eleven Pakistani crew members disembarked from the vessel, sat on the wharf and refused to return to the vessel.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 12 October 1982 (Hansard, page 1294) Senator Martin asked the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is he aware of allegations that the development of tourist facilities on Heron Island could disturb the island's turtle rookery? Also, is he aware of the contents of environmental impact statement and management plan for the island? If so, will the contents of the EIS and the management plan be made available to the meeting of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority on Heron Island on 5 November? If the Minister does not know the contents of the EIS and the management plan would it be possible for the Government to obtain this information from P and O Australia Ltd, the developers of the Heron Island tourist complex?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Heron Island is a Queensland owned island. Heron Island Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of P and O Australia, leases a portion of the island on which the resort is located.</PARA>
<PARA> The development of a tourist resort on Heron Island is the responsibility of the Queensland Government. Consequently, the need or otherwise for an environmental impact statement (EIS) in relation to the resort would also be a matter for the Queensland Government. I understand that no EIS was prepared for the State authorities prior to the commencement of recent extensions to the resort.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the management plan, I draw the honourable senator's attention to the fifth communique of the Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council, which was tabled in the House of Representatives on 14 September 1982 by the Minister for Science and Technology on my behalf. It stated that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council agreed to the desirability of adopting complementary management regimes for this Section (of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park), and agreed that the matter should be reviewed further in the light of a pilot study in relation to Heron Island.</PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service is currently preparing a management plan which focuses on the land aspects of Heron Island, including the protection and conservation of the island's turtle rookery. I am advised that the plan will be considered by the Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council at a meeting next month and that the plan will be finalised after consultation with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority.</PARA>
