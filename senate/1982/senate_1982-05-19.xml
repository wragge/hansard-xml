<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>That it is clearly apparent that Australian society is becoming more polarised- that the rich at home and abroad are becoming richer, profiting from Australia's mineral wealth, whilst pensioners and the disadvantaged, some three million people, are becoming a race apart.</PARA>
<PARA>That, of necessity, the Federal Government take action that all Australians share the wealth of their country by the transfer of resources to income security, health care and housing. Therefore, your petitioners urge that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. All pension and benefits be raised to at least 30 per cent of the National Average Male Earnings seasonally adjusted.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Removal of the means/income test on the Pensioner Health Benefit imposed by Federal legislation 1973.</PARA>
<PARA> Reintroduction of Medibank; in so doing restore all Australians to equality of citizenship.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes. This is seen as a matter of national food security.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognise that plant breeding is a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection , storage, and research has been publicly funded.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognise that any system giving ' property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Recognise that legislation establishing plant patenting schemes overseas has had serious adverse effects, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) subordination and/or curtailment of public breeding programs,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) farmer unrest at seed prices,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) monopoly control of seed production and sales has passed into the hands of giant petrochemical and drug corporations also marketing crop chemicals,</PARA>

<PARA> That the plan by the Australian Telecommunications Commission to close the manual assistance telephone exchange at Moree will place in jeopardy the existing services to telephone subscribers in the district by:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The loss of a local emergency '000' service being given to non-metropolitan telephone users in emergency conditions;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two things ought to be said at the outset. First, the fact is that the Prime Minister went overseas at the specific invitation of the President of the United States of America. That invitation was conveyed to the Prime Minister by the American Vice-President, Mr George Bush. The opportunity for a representative of this country to talk to the President of the United States is apparently regarded as something wrong by the Australian Labor Party. That ought to be kept very much in mind. There is no question at all of the Prime Minister initiating something for his own interest; it is a question of the Prime Minister responding to an invitation. But secondly, when looking at the quality of this plan, how can it be that the Leader of the Opposition failed to note that President Reagan's comments on this plan were that it is very interesting and very constructive? I will have more to say about this matter soon. I do not believe that in any other parliament operating under the Westminster system would any opposition do what this Opposition is seeking to do today, both in Question Time and by way of a matter of public importance.

Let the Labor Party take it fairly and squarely: No other political party in a country operating under the Westminster system would be so mean minded, so miserable or so destructive as to attempt to destroy the efforts of that country's elected national leader to do good in this world- in this case the efforts of a leader that are supported by commerce and industry in Australia and by the President of the United States of America. All that the members of the Labor Party can do in response to this is to scream and yell.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. I refer the Minister to the reported comments of Mr Justice Keely in the contempt of court case involving the National Secretary of the Builders Labourers Federation, Mr Norm Gallagher.

<PARA>Mr Gallagher and the Builders Labourers Federation have been found by the court to be clearly in breach of that principle.

Mr Steve Black indicated that the union will engage in a guerrilla industrial campaign against its employers at whose door the union lays the blame for Mr Gallagher's present predicament. Can the Minister indicate whether the employers are to blame for Mr Gallagher's conviction for contempt of court? If they are not, I further ask: What action does the Government intend to take to protect the employers from the proposed industrial action of the BLF? Does the present Conciliation and Arbitration Act provide immediate and adequate relief to the employers presently threatened, intimidated and adversely affected by the tactics of the BLF in retaliation for the gaoling of its National Secretary who has been found to be in contempt of the laws of this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is fairly well known to honourable senators that yesterday Mr Justice Keely imposed a fine of $15,000 on the BLF for contempt and sentenced Mr Gallagher to two months' gaol. Another official of the union was found guilty and fined $500, in default 14 days' gaol. It is my understanding that at the moment there has been a stay until next Monday with respect to those matters. The matters are, therefore, potentially still before the court and I do not propose to canvass them before the Senate. It is a fact which I think would be accepted by all honourable senators that all individuals in Australia of whatever rank or station are subject to the same laws. Those laws are administered by the courts. Where there are allegations of breach, those breaches are to be dealt with by the police or other appropriate enforcement authorities. I think we would all support those proper processes of law with respect to any necessary police or court action. I understand that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations takes the view that it is not appropriate to make comments on the matter which may still receive court consideration at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator in his question, however, raised the matter of the industrial position within the building industry. I understand that at the moment the Australian Council of Trade Unions is convening a meeting of the various unions concerned with the building and construction industries and that discussions are planned between the ACTU and the Confederation of Australian Industry in respect of those industries. At this stage I think the involvement of Mr Macphee has been invited. That is a matter to which Mr Macphee has agreed with some qualifications. He has made it clear that it is a matter for the parties to determine but that if both parties believe that a meeting chaired by him would contribute to better industrial relations in the industry, he will be prepared to convene a meeting. If the parties can agree on recommendations which might involve government action he will be pleased to receive those recommendations and act on them in the way which seems most appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> The matters raised by Senator Crichton-Browne are of great interest and concern to the community. I think they are best dealt with by repeating what I said earlier in my answer, that all Australians, whether they be trade unionists, employers, members of a government or simply private citizens, are subject to the law and the jurisdiction of the courts. Illegal activity, where it occurs, should be dealt with by the proper processes of law.</PARA>

I ask the Minister: Is it true that, in framing the 1977 Budget, figures of revenue, later described by Sir Phillip Lynch as rubbery, were adopted by the Fraser Cabinet? Is it true that these rubbery figures were compiled by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and vigorously disputed by the Department of the Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office?

Nothing could be more divergent than what Mr Hayden said in his Budget Speech and what in fact was the result. Mr Hayden said in his Budget Speech that his Government had to reduce a deficit which was running at about $4,000m. So that there would not be unemployment and inflation he had to get the figure down. He said that it is wrong to believe that one can spend up big and create employment and he said one must reduce a deficit in order to stop unemployment. All these things were said. They are a thesis which is rejected today by the Australian Labor Party. They were rejected by the results of the Hayden Budget. It ill becomes any Labor party to raise its head to talk about promise and performance in a Budget. The 1975 Budget stands as the then Treasurer Mr Hayden stating a correct premise and performing a completely incorrect performance which resulted in huge deficits, huge unemployment and huge inflation which ran at about 17 1/2 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to Senator Teague for the support he has given to the Government's decision to extend to one group of tertiary students the same capacity to attract benefits as is available to other tertiary students. I am not able, at this stage, to say the number of courses or the number of students who will benefit but I can advise the honourable senator that we are at the present time examining each course to see whether it will qualify for the benefits. The Government's policy will be to approve for TEAS those courses at the universities and colleges which lead to a formal qualification at the institution, which are not sponsored by some outside organisation and which qualify for Commonwealth funding under the appropriate Commonwealth-State grants legislation. A number of courses are at the margin. It is a question of carrying out an examination course by course to ensure that those who do qualify are appropriately brought in. This course of action was held up for some time because of a case before the High Court last year-one about which Senator Teague will have some knowledge-based on a challenge as to the meaning of section 116 of the Constitution. Now that that is out of the way the new policy can be put into place. Senator Teague also asked me when the benefits will apply.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. I preface my question by congratulating the Government on its appointment of Mr Macphee to the Employment and Industrial Relations portfolio. It was my privilege to join Mr Macphee on the Council of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures at the time he was appointed as director of that body. I can assure the Senate that his knowledge of the workings of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act is second to none in this country. I draw the Minister's attention to an article in the Canberra Times this morning which indicated that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations is considering a fundamental re-write of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, a task long overdue. I ask: Firstly, what input will the Parliament have to this re-write?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will pass on to Mr Macphee and to the Prime Minister the sentiments expressed by the honourable senator in respect of Mr Macphee and his holding of this portfolio. I have not seen the report in the Canberra Times about the desire of the present Minister fundamentally to re-write the Act. While understanding that viewpoint I have a sense of deja vu about it; he is not the first person to express that laudable ambition. I certainly wish my friend and colleague well in that exercise. I think that reflects a view which the previous Minister, Mr Viner, had and the Minister before him, Mr Peacock, had. Undoubtedly it is something which must have a great deal of merit because it has received support from a succession of Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the input of Parliament is concerned I would like to assure the Senate and the honourable senator who asked the question that we are all strict constitutionalists. Any re-write of the Act will be submitted to the Parliament before it has any effect. In other words, there will be an opportunity for full and fair debate of any proposal which the Government wishes to put forward in respect of the re-writing of this Act. Indeed there is no way that one can avoid that. The fate of the recent legislation which has gone before a Senate committee is an indication that the extent to which Parliament wishes to contribute to that process in a detailed way is in its hands.

At present I know of no formal arrangement within the Parliament which would bring together the quite diverse views existing within the Parliament as to the most appropriate form of this legislation. The difficulties faced in re- writing the legislation are exemplified by our recent debate. Even though there was an almost unanimous view within the Parliament that we should move to industry-based unions, there were sharp differences about the efficacy or otherwise of the particular means proposed in the legislation which has now been referred to a committee and which I will not canvass in this answer. I suggest that if there are individual members of Parliament who have particular views on how the legislation should be reshaped they have the opportunity to use the forms of this place, such as matters of public importance and the adjournment debate, to place those views on public record. I have little doubt that Mr Macphee would welcome constructive suggestions from any member of the Parliament if less formal approaches are desired. I think it is up to honourable senators who feel that they have something to contribute to any such re-writing of the Act to come forward and to make their views known to the Government and to the Minister concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor Party can laugh if it wants to at a stated intention of the alternative government in Australia to nationalise shopping centres and, indeed, to offer threats to would-be purchasers that they will lose the value of their purchases. The facts are as Senator Reid says. On 14 May the Minister for the Capital Territory announced that the Belconnen Mall would be offered for sale by world-wide tender. Mr Hodgman said that the Government had agreed to a strategy for marketing the Mall and that current Foreign Investment Review Board guidelines would apply to the sale. Richard Ellis (New South Wales) Pty Ltd will be engaged to assist in the arrangement for the offer for sale of the Mall. The company will also give advice on purchase proposals when they are received and provide a recommendation on the preferred purchaser, price and terms and conditions. It is expected that the invitation to tender will be released within the next few weeks. An important condition of the sale will be that the new owner should continue to provide the Belconnen Community Service with rent-free floor space and a subsidy which compares to its present level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the first part of Senator Reid's question, the Government intends to sell the Mall. The Government does not believe that it is the duty of governments to own shopping centres or to operate shopping centres as such. Therefore, it notes with considerable concern the resurrection of the nationalisation tendencies of the Opposition. It notes also the threat implicit in this-that any purchaser of the Mall will have it appropriated at the price paid for it. In other words, here is a threat, a blackmail, a duress aiming at a purchaser saying: 'Do this but you will be under threat to lose in the future'. This is an utterly discreditable performance on the part of any political party that pretends to provide an alternative government. It, in fact, shows that once again the Labor Party is continuing its nationalisation efforts as it is, of course, in the oil industry as it has quite clearly shown in recent days.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was the ambition of the Government to have the legislation on the statute book by now but that was not the will of the Senate which has sent the legislation to a committee. The committee is to consider the legislation and report by September which I think was the date set in the resolution. The Government has accepted in the past an obligation to respond to parliamentary committee reports. I do not intend to be contemptuous of the Senate in this regard. Clearly, we will be having a committee inquiry. It will be encumbent on the Government to look at that inquiry before declaring its further intention with respect to legislation. I do not want that to be heard as being some qualification of the Government's view with respect to the legislation. But I think that the Senate having made that decision over the objections of the Government, there is no point in pretending that it has not been made. We shall await the outcome of that inquiry to see what fresh light, if any, is cast upon the problems which the legislation purported to deal with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At risk of appearing overly cautious, I ask the Senate to treat that answer as a quite neutral one. As I said, if the Government had had its way, its wish, the legislation would now be through the Parliament and, subject to the completion of the third element, namely, obtaining the approval of the Crown, the legislation would be in force. We are now in a position where the Senate, exercising its powers and responsibilities, has added another stage, and I would not seek to prejudge the outcome of that. There is nothing before the Government at this stage which would suggest that it would resile from this legislation, but we will wait to see what the Senate committee comes up with.</PARA>

The article claimed that 95 per cent of people who have the severe arterial disease which can lead to amputation of both legs are smokers, that almost three times as many Australians die prematurely from smoking as die from road accidents, that nearly half the smoking related deaths are from coronary heart disease, that only 5 per cent to 10 per cent of lung cancer sufferers survive five years of treatment and even that smokers are more wrinkled because of the effect of smoking on the blood supply. Can the Minister substantiate these statements? If so, can he reconcile with them the fact that we are giving an average of more than $20,000 a year each to tobacco growers to produce this dangerous drug-a rate of subsidy which is much higher than that for any other form of primary industry?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read the article in the National Times of last week. It is apparent from Senator Hamer's question that what Senate committees have failed to do with their impassioned writings the National Times was able to communicate in its pages last week. It apparently has got a message through on some facts which have been known and articulated for some time. The claims are generally true. I will not go over them one by one. There is in fact a major public health risk connected with smoking and it is because of this that the Government has a national goal, which it has enunciated here, to reduce smoking. Having said that, I point out that the question of subsidies to tobacco growers does not of itself go to the level of smoking in Australia. While there is a capacity to import tobacco leaf, the subsidies go to the question of what leaf is used by those who choose to smoke. The whole question of support for the tobacco industry is at present, I believe, before the Industries Assistance Commission. Numbers of submissions have been received from interested groups, including those that are concerned about the health effects of smoking. The IAC in due course will make its report and the Government, at that time, will consider the issues, which will include issues related to the support for tobacco growers. I finish by saying that it will not be the Government's objective to try to scapegoat any person, any section of the community or any industry in pursuing its other policy goals.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for National Development and Energy. On 10 March this year I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether any signatory to the Treaty on Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is able to accumulate and enrich nuclear material to weapons grade under accepted international safeguards and then withdraw from the Treaty at any time of its choosing. In reply the Minister for Foreign Affairs pointed out that under Article X of the Treaty any state party has the right to withdraw from the Treaty if it, meaning the state party, itself decides that ' extraordinary events related to the subject matter of the Treaty have jeopardised its supreme interests' and if that country simply gives three months notice of intent. I ask: Does the Minister consider that in the light of that answer it is alarmingly obvious that the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty is little more than an elaborate source of empty rhetoric and that it is totally ineffective in preventing, or even limiting, the spread of nuclear weapons? However, since it is worth the safeguard and is regarded as the central plank in the Government's uranium export policy, will the Minister guarantee that no more Australian uranium will be exported until an effective system is discovered?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, there is a total misunderstanding, which was evidenced yesterday in the debate on the matter of public importance, regarding the availability of uranium in the world and the link between nuclear power stations and nuclear weapons. Any country on earth is able to get hold of uranium without needing to buy it from any other country. Uranium is very well distributed on this earth's surface and in the oceans. As such, it is true that in some countries, such as Australia, it is in cheap, highly concentrated form; but the availability of uranium itself is not a bar in weapons making. That is the first point that needs to be made. Therefore, secondly, whether or not the world has nuclear power stations is irrelevant to the question of whether nations will seek to make atomic weapons. The knowledge of how to make atomic weapons is in people's minds, and people will strive to do so and strive to beat the system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the light of that, there is an International Atomic Energy Agency, an Australian Safeguards Office and a Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In that real world what is striven to be done is the very best that can be done to ensure the limitation of people's ability to use the ordinary processes to make arms. I do not regard the International Atomic Energy Agency as an ineffective body. It may well be that history will prove that it will need to strengthen itself. I said yesterday that I shall be having discussions with that Agency in the next week or two on many of these matters.</PARA>
<PARA> But let me deal with the question of the enrichment of uranium to weapons standard. That is not something that can be done overnight. I have repeated in this Senate that enriching uranium-that is, converting it to the hexafluoride and then separating the isotopes-is a chemical process capable of being inspected thoroughly, and the grade of enrichment is capable of identification from day to day. The ordinary enrichment for peacetime purposes is much lower than for weapons grade. Therefore, the inspecting agencies are competent to determine very quickly whether an enrichment plant is moving away from peacetime to wartime purposes. Of course, it can then act very quickly indeed to cut off any supplies of uranium or enriched uranium to the countries concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat: Nothing in the world can stop a country from getting uranium if it wants to do so, because it is distributed throughout the whole world. It does no one any good to get away from the real facts. They are that nuclear energy, the ability to produce fission in this world for peaceful or for destructive purposes, is here to stay. The fissile materials are distributed over the earth' s surface. What we need to do is to keep on strengthening our policing systems to limit the number of nuclear arms, and to this Australia is dedicated.</PARA>

I pointed out that the restriction of the movement of Australian uranium around the world would in no way stop countries, if they so wanted, from making weapons. They can make them from the sources they have. For example, the Argentine has its own natural sources of uranium. Everybody has them. If they want access to uranium, they can get it. So stopping the movement of uranium around the world will not stop the making of weapons. The policing of uranium by the International Atomic Energy Agency and by the Australian Safeguards Office can go a very long way towards achieving that goal, and we are working towards that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia's one resource that is severely limited, and the one that will be the most limiting if we do not take the correct steps in our development, is water. We are the most arid continent on earth. The average rainfall over the Australian continent is 16 inches a year, compared with a world average of 26 inches. We must start off with that. We have no real river systems. The Murray-Darling is our largest. Therefore, it is true that water is of pre-eminent significance to us. It is true that the Government recently arranged for an overview of water resources to be undertaken and managed by a committee in conjunction with the States. That committee is now very active in its work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware of the Bradfield scheme which aimed to divert rivers of northern Queensland inland to Lake Eyre. The scheme was based on the theory that this diversion would change the rainfall pattern of inland Australia. There are a number of problems with that suggestion, of course. Some people unkindly have noticed that the great expanse of water that lies around the Great Australian Bight is alongside the driest part of the world-that is, the Nullarbor Plain-and that evaporation from a surface of water does not necessarily produce rain that will fall on nearby country; it may help, in fact, countries of Asia. Unkind people have also pointed out that if we were to divert those rivers down to Lake Eyre we would divert them first of all into a lake the water of which is highly saline. Therefore, if the water got there it would be salt water. Of course, they pointed out the obvious thing, that on the way evaporation would be great and the diversion would not necessarily result in any rain in the area. My Department has not evaluated the scheme. It was evaluated in some detail by several experts, including Dr Nimmo. These analyses showed that the proposal had overestimated the quantities of water which would be finally available for diversion to Lake Eyre and had underestimated the engineering difficulties involved and the cost of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Water Resources Commission has recently completed the updating of a number of proposals formulated in 1968 for diverting water from coastal rivers into the Upper Darling. Subsequently, a consultant reviewed 40 of these proposals and identified five coastal river basin systems in respect of which a total of eight proposals warranted investigation. These figures indicated that all eight proposals were more expensive in terms of unit cost of supply on a year to year basis than proposals for storage which could be constructed west of the Divide. A considerable amount of study is still going on in that regard. As to the latter part of the question, the Commonwealth is well aware that industry itself has a conjoint responsibility in helping to provide the resource. The Government, when it has its overview in mind, will be looking towards its implementation on a Commonwealth-State basis in conjunction with industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no inconsistency at all in what the Prime Minister has been trying to do. Two great problems confront the world today. One is the major threat of war resulting from the enormous overarmament of the USSR and the weaker position of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. There has been a huge expansion of nuclear and conventional armament by the USSR in contrast with what has occurred in the free world. Therefore, there is a major threat of war with aggression being taken by the USSR in a number of countries around the world. That is demonstrable. The Prime Minister was directing himself , very properly, towards the need to establish and maintain world peace, to try to achieve nuclear disarmament and to try to get a balance of peace. If the imposition of sanctions is necessary to achieve peace, it will be a small price to pay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister also noted that the world is in a major recession, that Western Europe and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development will be confronted with an unemployment level of 30 million people. Arising out of their depression of recent years there has been a tendency for countries, naturally enough, to put up defensive barriers of more protection, which have reduced the flow of trade and, therefore, reduced the capacity for employment. The Prime Minister put forward what I believe is a valid premise-that is, if the whole of the free world were to put down its barriers, trade would flow more freely and there would be more employment.

Indeed, I have had discussions with some of their numbers. The Government has clearly in mind the need for orderly planning. It has not believed it necessary to set up a department of planning. For example, at this moment the water resources sector is busy endeavouring to achieve co-ordination throughout Australia so that co-operative planning will be possible. Co-operation is being sought through the various ministerial councils. As a federation, Australia I hope will always need to work through such councils. The Cabinet itself, as a committee, is essentially a national planning committee, and all Cabinet Ministers have a responsibility in that regard.

Senator Mason has to acknowledge that the Government is moving to make it inappropriate for doctors to use fraud or overservicing in the future and that the Government system of detecting fraud and overservicing, on which parties in the Parliament have been briefed, will help us to pick up those people. I am very wary of anecdotal reports in papers about matters such as hysterectomies. I am very ready to acknowledge that if we can obtain community evidence that on a systematic basis any particular procedure is being overused, that requires the closest attention. If in fact it is out of line with experience in other parts of the world, either there has to be some local medical explanation or we have to assume that there is some element of inappropriate delivery of services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Mason has referred particularly to massive rip-offs by doctors and has linked that to pathology services. I am concerned by that. Some years ago there was a period when it was necessary to alter the structure by which payments from the public purse were made to those delivering pathology services. New procedures were instituted and as a result I think most of the inappropriate activities have been contained. The fact is that there is a wide call for pathology services to be delivered in the community. They are delivered both through the Government system-I mention to Senator Mason that the large earners of income among doctors who attract salaries plus fees for service in hospitals are the pathologists-that is, through the public hospital system and through private services. The reason that large incomes are involved is twofold. First of all, the services are in demand and are required in modern medical practice. Secondly, with a view to economies of scale, pathologists tend to work together in large units because of the capital equipment involved. The new legislation will go a long way to limiting the activities of the pathologists, as well as other doctors. I cannot say that self-regulation has failed. What I can say is that what is required is a set of co-operative actions involving the profession, the health funds and government. The Government is moving now to change the procedures in a very major way. I suggest to the Senate and to the honourable senator that what we should do now is see what effect these new legislative provisions have.</PARA>

Can the Minister give me any undertaking that the Government is, in fact, considering legislation which will, in some way, look at that situation even if it were legislation which merely required or put forward the hope of some kind of self-regulation or some kind of action to limit those costs by the profession in that area?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again I say that the legislation presently before the Senate will pick up fraud and over-servicing by doctors. Among doctors are pathologists. Pathologists will not be immune from any provisions of the new legislation. It will impact upon them as it impacts upon other members of the profession. There is an emerging recognition from within the profession-I draw the honourable senator's attention to the statements by Dr Wilson, President of the Australian Medical Association, in which he has brought this to the fore-of the role which the profession has to play in controlling some of these practices . I think to that extent we would be on common ground. Again I urge Senator Mason to let the new legislation come in. It will be effective.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be around to haunt you for a long time yet, Senator Chaney . Is it the case that the Chief Censor, Mrs Janet Strickland, as has been reported in the Press recently, has demanded the submission to the Film Censorship Board of four overseas films scheduled for showing at the Melbourne Film Festival? Is it further the case that in an agreement drawn up with the Attorney-General's Department in 1975 it was accepted that every festival film would be registered, without prior showing, for festival screening except in cases of films which had been rejected previously for commercial use? Does the Government approve the Film Censorship Board's departure in the present case from what appears to be the letter, and is certainly the spirit, of that 1975 agreement-a departure, in fact, foreshadowed by a number of actions and speeches by Mrs Strickland over the last 12 months? If the Government does approve, does this signal an imminent major crackdown by the Commonwealth on the censorship front and a return to the bad old days we grew out of more than a decade ago?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2101" SPEAKER="Durack Sen The Hon P.D." NAMEID="8G4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="ATTORNEY GENERAL" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the matters that Senator Evans has raised. An agreement in 1975 related to film festivals. It gave a number of concessions to the promoters of film festivals. Conditions were set out in that agreement. By and large those conditions do, on the face of it, provide that registration of films be made without screening. The agreement actually referred to film festivals held in 1975 although I understand that it has been accepted as current despite the fact that it does seem to be limited to the specific festivals in that year. However, the Chief Censor, Mrs Strickland, has taken the view that under the regulations and under the responsibilities imposed upon her by law that agreement is subject to the overriding requirements of the regulations and the responsibilities that she has under them. The stand she has taken does not modify, to any further extent, the benefits that film festivals have under that agreement. She requires the films to be brought in for screening only under exceptional circumstances. She has made that policy quite clear for some time. This is not the first occasion that this has occurred. Indeed, in my recollection, the first occasion on which she took that stance was at a film festival in Adelaide about a year or more ago in respect of a film that did cause a great deal of controversy in South Australia at that time. She has made that policy quite clear. I believe that she is entirely justified in taking this stand. Indeed I think she probably has a legal obligation to take this stand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter was raised about this time last year by Senator Hamer in relation to , I think, a film festival at that time. I said that I would take up the matter for consideration by the meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers responsible for censorship with a view to seeing whether there was any concern by them about the policy being followed by the Chief Censor and also whether there ought to be in the laws some special provisions relating to film festivals. I did so, and at the meeting held in August last year the Ministers supported the view of the Chief Censor and did not feel that any special provisions ought to be made in relation to film festivals. Some reservations were expressed by the Minister representing Victoria at that meeting, but overwhelmingly that was the view of the meeting. That is how the matter stands.</PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Strickland has my full support and indeed the support of most of the State Ministers in Australia in regard to the stand she is taking. This does not mean that there is any crackdown in censorship. As I have said, considerable relaxations of the ordinary rules are made for film festivals. It is only in exceptional cases, in my experience, that she has taken this view. This time she has done it in respect of four films, which is more than has been the case on any other occasion. I have discussed it with her and she has expressed concern about what she has heard and read about these films and she believes that she is acting entirely within her rights, as I am sure she is, in taking this stand.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to raise a point of order in respect of the way Question Time has been dealt with today by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick). My point of order is this: It is quite obvious that Question Time was grossly abused today by honourable senators opposite giving prepared questions to the Leader of the Government in the Senate . I sought to have two documents tabled. I have now had a look at them. One relates to a question asked by Senator Reid, and the answer given by Senator Carrick is headed 'suggested response'. He then took up a long time of the Senate dealing with the Belconnen Mall. The further abuse was the question asked by Senator Jessop. The document which I had tabled begins, 'Yes, I am aware of the Bradfield scheme'. Of course neither of those documents could be typed if the questions were truly without notice. It is quite obvious that Government back benchers are giving prepared questions to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and probably to other Ministers, whilst people on this side of the chamber are being denied the opportunity to ask questions on behalf of their constituents because the Leader of the Government in the Senate goes into a long diatribe, especially when there are interjections, and it takes him nearly five minutes to answer each of these prepared questions. I ask you, Mr President, to have a look at these documents which were tabled today and to see whether a remedy can be obtained.</PARA></TALK.START>

Mr President, I ask you to consider whether you may not accede to that request today. For three consecutive days some of us in this chamber have risen trying to ask a question but have not received the call. Today the Leader of the Government in the Senate deliberately and provocatively filibustered throughout the whole of Question Time and took a great deal of the time that should have been taken by the asking of questions. In looking at the Standing Orders, I see that there is nothing which indicates that the Leader of the Government may request that further questions be placed on notice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will now respond to the points of orders which have been raised by honourable senators today. Firstly, with regard to Senator McLaren's statement, I say that many honourable senators give notice of a question to a Minister. This is a long-established practice in this place and it has been used by honourable senators from both sides of the chamber. There are differences in the types of questions. An honourable senator who wants to play politics-if I can use that term and put some colour into it-can drop a question quickly on to the lap of a Minister. On the other hand, an honourable senator may wish to obtain information and be genuinely seeking information. This matter has been looked at by the Senate Standing Orders Committee. In the past the Standing Orders Committee has not, to my knowledge, raised any objection to this practice .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to the Leader of the Government asking that further questions be placed on notice, this also is a long-standing practice of this chamber. Whilst I take on board the point Senator Colston has made, I think this matter should be referred to the Standing Orders Committee if honourable senators wish to do that. It is the responsible Committee of the Senate. If honourable senators want to change practice I think this is something which should go before the Standing Orders Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> Other comments were passed. Criticism was expressed about the length of answers given today. I agree with honourable senators that too many answers were too long but I also say that too many questions were also too long. Some questions do require a long answer. I am asking, as I have asked in this chamber before, that all of us co-operate, and that honourable senators keep their questions short so that Ministers can respond in a much shorter time. I suggest that if honourable senators have a long question they should seriously consider putting it on the Notice Paper. Question Time today, in terms of the number of questions dealt with, was the poorest we have had for the session. I keep a record. I sincerely hope Question Time will improve tomorrow when the Senate sits again.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a matter of grave concern to many Australian people, even to Senator Lewis, who attempted to interject and say that the political posturing of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) overseas is typical. I illustrate the point that I seek to make in raising this matter of public importance simply by reminding the Senate that in 1974 Idi Amin offered to the British Government his services as a mediator in its attempts to solve the problems in Ireland. That was received with universal derision. The reason was that Idi Amin was black, he was fat and his own country was in a dreadful mess. The analogy is not perfect. The present Prime Minister is not black, he is not fat but Australia is in a dreadful mess at a time when he is making his third trip during which he is telling the world how to fix its problems and is ignoring problems at home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has one good thing going for him: He believes that fantasy should be separated from reality. The fantasy is overseas; the reality is here in Australia. This is an embarrassment, I believe, to all Australians. The Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Sir John Carrick, sought to excuse that embarrassment at Question Time this morning by saying that the Prime Minister had been invited by President Reagan to go to the United States of America and by suggesting, in the course of answering the same question, that people who criticised this or asked questions about it were somehow disloyal Australians. He should have a look at the opinion polls. Some 58 per cent of the Australian people question the credibility of the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser. Are they disloyal Australians too? Is that what Senator Sir John Carrick is saying to the people of Australia? Is he saying that we can no longer criticise the stunting of a Prime Minister who struts around the world like a bird of paradise on heat while problems in this country get worse and worse? Is that the attitude of this Government to any criticisms of that situation?</PARA>
<PARA> Every time this Prime Minister goes overseas he develops a theme which is faithfully, some would say blindly, recorded by the media representatives who share the luxury of the Boeing 707. Each trip becomes a topic trip. A list of topics is prepared by the Prime Minister's office and is stored away for use when he goes overseas. The latest topic, the so-called world plan for economic recovery, has been greeted in the United States of America with almost a massive silence. The response is almost in theatrical terms: 'Don't call us, Mr Fraser; we'll call you-next time'. Is it any wonder that that sort of response has been given? Last year it was the North-South dialogue that the Prime Minister was proposing as a most important matter for consideration by world statesmen. Of course it is. This year it is the world economy. Earlier still-three trips ago- it was Malcolm Fraser as hero of the Third World, the saviour of Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> What people in Australia want to know is not so much where the world is going in respect of these issues, although, of course, that is a legitimate question; what people are increasingly wanting to know is where Australia is going. People listening to the proceedings of the Senate, be they people driving their cars, at work or doing the ironing in an inner suburb of Melbourne, want answers to some very important questions about Australia. Is the unemployment level, the highest since the Great Depression, to continue indefinitely or has the Prime Minister, with a world plan which he describes as bold and imaginative, some solution to that question for Australia? Has he some solution to that question for thousands upon thousands of young people who have no prospect of getting a job? Is there now any prospect around the corner, as was being offered by Prime Minister Fraser in 1976 and 1977 when elections were being held? Is there any prospect now of a reversal of the almost negative growth and the incredible increase in poverty in this country? Is there any prospect now that tax avoidance, the ultimate extreme of private enterprise which flourishes in Australia, will be dealt with by the Fraser Government? Is there any propect now of any of these questions being tackled? Is there any vision in this Government for Australia, apart from the phoney visions of the resources boom at the last election, the export led recovery at the election before and so on? Is it any wonder when the Prime Minister talked in New York last night about the weakness of willingness to resist aggression that that is happening in societies such as ours where these sorts of issues prevail?</PARA>
<PARA> These public relations exercises of the Prime Minister of Australia do not come on the cheap. Between them the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) have spent $1m in the last year on overseas travel. That is the official figure. It does not include all the extra bits that are added on. It is important, of course, that the Prime Minister should see that the taxpayer is getting his money's worth so there has to be a major topic for every trip. As I said, last year the topic was the North-South dialogue. The tragedy of that exercise by the Prime Minister well illustrates the words of Cardinal Newman who once said that the worst thing that can happen to a good cause is that certain people should embrace it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Martyr, I was not using the phrase as a quotation. I said that that was what Cardinal Newman said. I am not saying that the Prime Minister is evil. I am saying he is a joke. The point I want to make is quite clear. These pedantic interjections from a Minister who turns Question Time into a sort of school of the air are really ridiculous in the context of this debate. The point I was trying to make is that the effort of the North-South dialogue trip was to project Mr Fraser as a person with genuine concern for the people of the underdeveloped world. It was a very simple invention of his advisers and promoters to soften his image and divert the attention of the Australian voters so that he could set the scene for the multi-million dollar extravaganza of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne. It is all summed up in the words of the music hall song of the 1960s. The North-South dialogue in Mr Fraser's hands could be described as:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Oh, what a mouth, what a north and south. Blimey what a mouth he's got. </PARA>
<PARA>What has happened now to the North-South dialogue in terms of Australian policy? Let us look at the position. How genuine is the Prime Minister about the plight of the Third World? When the Whitlam Government left office the proportion of our gross domestic product devoted to foreign aid was 0.56 per cent. Today it is 0.45 per cent, an increase of 0.03 per cent having been made on the eve of the CHOGM extravaganza in Melbourne to improve the figure. The real level of Australian aid to underdeveloped countries has fallen faster than the level of any other developed country in the Western world. A number of European countries -mostly with democratic socialist governments such as Sweden, the Netherlands, Denmark, France and Norway-have exceeded the figure set by the Brandt Commission and others of 0.7 per cent. Is it any wonder that the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr John Stone, in talking about the Prime Minister's last extravaganza overseas in a letter to Professor Owen Harries said:</PARA>
<PARA> ''At some stage . . . developing countries are going to be so impolite as to ask Australia to put its policies where its mouth is . . . unless we can show more 'political will' than has been evident until now (for example, in regard to the dismantling of our high-protection regime) the Australian emperor is going to appear remarkably unclothed. </PARA>
<PARA>They were the words of the Secretary to the Treasury about the last trip of the Prime Minister. If we look at the performance in relation to the North-South issues-the trip being over-it will be seen that in relation to the issues raised by the Brandt report Australia has an abysmal record. The record of Australia shows vitually no response and sometimes a negative response in dealing with the six main points of the Brandt report. It is a shoddy record. It demonstrates how cynically the Prime Minister has used a tragic situation in Third World countries for short term political purposes. The fact is that we need an honest, energetic promotion of North-South issues. The Australian Labor Party would support that. But that promotion does not come into this Parliament from this Government. This Parliament is a vehicle for personal aggrandisement, a funkhole for dealing with domestic issues. The North-South dialogue was dropped like a hot potato when the last head of state departed from the CHOGM conference in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest gimmick, of course, is the Prime Minister's world-plan. I hope that it goes better than the world car plan. Of course, the Prime Minister has said that his initiative is 'bold, realistic and specific' and 'unexpected, bold and imaginative'. These are the words that he has used about his plan. Nowhere else can one find words which are so favourably couched as a critique of the proposition. It is a plan which is breathtaking in its cynicism. It is a plan which involves a reduction in the levels of protection and the freezing of export incentives followed by the gradual breaking down of trade barriers. The Sydney Morning Herald has rightly called it 'economic motherhood'. Unkindly, it has said that the plan described by Mr Fraser as imaginative is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . imaginative only in the sense that Mr Fraser has been the first person to feel that the obvious is worth stating. </PARA>
<PARA>More unkindly that same paper in the same editorial rather querulously suggested that Mr Fraser was the last person to lecture the world powers on this issue. Here is another example with this Prime Minister of conspicuous failure having gone to his head. Overseas he can trumpet about some of these magical formulas to save the world, to save the human race, designed to persuade the seven major powers to change their ways at the forthcoming Versailles conference and so on. The record at home is abysmal. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that the Prime Minister and his advisers knew when he unveiled this plan in Washington that the decisions about the Versailles summit had alredy been taken. It has been confirmed that the top officials from the seven major powers have completed their final meeting. The communique has already been drafted. All that remains is for the seven heads of State to assemble for a day or two and then release the communique. There has been no undertaking, even from President Reagan, even to mention the so-called Fraser plan at Versailles. As I said before, the response is: 'Don't call us, we'll call you'. </PARA>
<PARA> Fraser, of course, will then come back to Australia and say: 'Look, I have tried to get tariffs freed up around the world. I introduced my world plan but they did not appreciate it. But I have no recourse back here in Australia but to cling to present tariff structures'. Any plan by Fraser for world economic development in this context is no more than a sham. The Prime Minister of Singapore has pointed out on repeated occasions as the Secretary to the Treasury has pointed out that it is time to put the money and the policies where the mouth is. Under this Prime Minister and the parade of Ministers since 1975, Australia's economic performance has been much worse than that of most other industrial countries in respect of which our Prime Minister has taken upon himself to tell them that they must put their houses in order. </PARA>
<PARA> Our rate of economic growth per head averaged a mere 1.3 per cent a year from 1975 to 1980. The average per capita growth rate for all Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, including countries like Ireland, was 2.5 per cent-nearly twice as fast as Australia. This Prime Minister has nothing to teach other countries about economic management. The last figures placed Australia fifteenth out of 24 countries in terms of gross domestic product. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And it is going down. In 1976, when the Fraser Government came to office, Australia was eighth on the list. It has dropped from being eighth on the list in 1976 to being fifteenth on the list in 1981 and it is going down quite steadily. It is going down the hit parade all the time. For this Prime Minister to ask for a general lowering of protection is simply to demonstrate his renowned inconsistency. He claims while he is overseas to reduce protection but he is a firm protectionist at home. We are not having a debate on the protection issue in this Parliament. It is probably about time that we did; it is an issue which is studiously avoided in debates in this place. But one cannot posture throughout the world on this issue and have a totally different position at home. One cannot go to countries such as Japan and Korea, which this Prime Minister proposes to do-the unemployment level in Japan is 2 per cent and in Korea it is about 5.2 per cent-countries which have a relatively high rate of economic growth and talk about economic management in terms of the performance we have seen in Australia since this Government came to power. The Prime Minister has said that the message should be taken to Versailles. We have only to look at some of the countries which will be attending that Versailles summit. Of course, the reason why those countries will be represented there and we will not is probably that they have had a much better economic performance in the last five years than has Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that this Prime Minister, because he is trapped in his own rhetoric about propriety, about Australia's not having a tourist for Prime Minister, about his justification for the Boeing 707, feels a need to have a justification for another stunt overseas. The justification this time was whipped up, as happened the last time in the last few days before he went. The Australian Parliament has not even been informed about his plans and is still not being informed about it. But people overseas will get the benefit of the vast wisdom of a Prime Minister of a country with an abysmal record. That is an embarrassment to all Australians. Australians do not believe in people whose conduct is totally inconsistent with their words, whose performance in relation to the problems of this country is neither bold nor imaginative, and who, when overseas,use such rhetoric to justify their own conspicuous consumption and expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> We find in the Senate at Question Time, it is sad to say, a great many honourable senators who are suffering from sheep blast. They cheer on the Leader of the Government in the Senate as he gives absurd answers about the capacity of people to debate and question critically these issues. We can have no base for the restoration of a viable and vigorous economy in Australia and no base for a more equitable society under the continuation of the policies of this Government . The situation in terms of unemployment and social inequity is more and more apparent every day to every Australian who is concerned about where this country is going. While Australians confront this question in their hearts and minds, the Prime Minister is overseas stunting with a world plan, a North-South dialogue plan or a plan to save Africa-any plan but one that deals with the problems which confront him at home. Of course, he is not alone. There will be hardly any Ministers in Australia next week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First, my interjection that Senator Button would be overseas arose from information that came both from his office and from a conversation between him and me. If he has changed his mind, he has not informed me of that. Therefore, let me put the record straight for those who want to listen. That was the information that came directly from him to me. Secondly, I repeat what I said at Question Time today. I believe that nowhere in the whole of the Western world, and nowhere under the Westminster system, would occur what has occurred here today-a deliberate attempt by an Opposition to damage, to denigrate and to destroy the goals of an elected Prime Minister of a nation who is seeking to achieve good for this country and for the world at large.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put that in no sense of platitude. Of course there can be honest criticism. But let the world judge the situation when the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Button, has sought to form a parallel between a murderous, barbarian dictator, Idi Amin, and the Prime Minister of Australia. Does any Australian think it does any credit at all to Senator Button or to the Labor Party that the honourable senator should want to say to the world at large that the offer of ideas to the world by the Prime Minister of Australia is to be regarded in parallel with the offers of a murderous dictator, Idi Amin? That is what we are being offered today in this rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me put the matter in perspective. The fact is that one would judge from the actions of the Labor Party at Question Time and now, that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), on his own spontaneous initiative has suddenly run around the world wanting to preach to the world. Of course the contrary is true. The fact is that the President of the United States of America issued an invitation to the Prime Minister to come on a specific day, and that invitation was delivered orally and in writing, and in my presence, by the Vice-President of the United States of America, George Bush. It was an invitation to come to America and to have discussions on the great issues before the two summits. Should the Prime Minister not have gone? Should he have said, 'No, I will not go'? Is it not in the interests of the Australian people that he accepted the invitation and went? Should he not have had views on the international scene, both on the question of world peace and on the question of world prosperity? Of course he accepted the invitation, quite rightly, and went. </PARA>
<PARA> Where, then, is this posturing? Where, then, is what the Labor Party is saying? The fact is that there are to be two summits in the immediate future, one at Versailles and one at Bonn. It is regarded by the free world that the discussions and the subjects to be raised at those summits will be of pre- eminent significance, of a degree of significance greater than issues that have been faced since World War II, and indeed, on the economic level, greater than issues faced since the 1930s Depression. The world is facing these international problems. The Prime Minister must walk on the world scene and discuss ideas. He knows that the Soviet Union is building up its nuclear weaponry enormously ahead of the United States of America. It is building up its conventional weaponry to something like four times the extent of the free world buildup. The aggression by the Soviet Union around the world is a major threat to peace. It is a threat to peace that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation recognises, that every country of the free world recognises and one that must therefore be dealt with by the putting forward of ideas. If the Prime Minister of Australia did not put forward his ideas, if he did not represent Australia's hunger to achieve a just peace, a hunger to get disarmament in this world, there would be grave disabilities in what he is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> On the world scene at this moment western Europe-member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop- ment-is facing an unemployment rate that is double the rate that Australia knows. It is estimated that 30 million people will be unemployed. There is an absolute need for Australia to recognise, both in the true sense of altruism in that we must do something to help and in a fundamental understanding of the situation, that unless there is a restoration of employment in western Europe and the world at large there will be no trading with Australia, there will be a diminution and a recession in Australia. Under these circumstances, is it wrong for the Prime Minister of Australia to respond to the invitation of the American President? Should the Prime Minister have stayed at home? Look at all the emotive wordings used such as the suggestions that he went in a 'luxury 707' and the Press went in a 'luxury 707'. I am not allowed to mention the past activities of Mr Whitlam whose penchant, as we know, was to charter luxury 707s and to look at ancient ruins in Egypt. (Quorum formed). </PARA>
<PARA> I want to explain to the people of Australia the device of drawing attention to the state of the House. During Senator Button's speech there was a handful of people in this chamber. Bearing in mind the poor quality of the subject matter, I do not blame people for not attending but it did not occur to the Opposition that he should have an audience. I can understand that, but the members of the public should understand that the purpose of the use of the device of calling a quorum is to try to deny to the speaker on his feet time to put his point, particularly when a salient point is being put. Lest anyone should fail to understand the point I was putting prior to the calling of attention to the state of the House I will repeat my point. Perhaps Senator Colston would again like the embarrassment of having to do the counting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have now had another demonstration of the use of the device to attempt to force a wasting of time. I now repeat the point that I was making. It was all right for Senator Button to talk, without any grounds at all, of luxury 707s. Does anyone remember at the time of the 1974-75 economic crises in Australia what Mr Whitlam, the Labor leader, in a chartered 707 was doing? He was not giving to the people of the world the benefit of Australia's views; he was studying ancient ruins in Greece. This is the kind of nonsense he went in for. It was wrong grandeur of the type indulged in by the dictators that Senator Button referred to before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button talked of the North-South dialogue and the fact that there has not been considerable progress on it. I believe the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Australia was accepted by all the nations that attended it as one of the most progressive meetings that has been held by the Commonwealth and indeed one of the most unifying meetings that has taken place in the Commonwealth of Nations. If that is not an achievement, let us hear what is. People should keep in mind when talking about the developing countries, the underprivileged countries, that if living standards in the Western world fall further and further the people who will really suffer, the people who will really be destabilised, will be those in the developing world; that is, the South, the Third World itself. So the dialogue-Senator Button acknowledges this- at the summits which are being held today is vital to the North-South dialogue, vital to the stability of the less privileged of this world. </PARA>
<PARA> We are asked to say that Australia itself is worse off than overseas regions. Let us have a look at what is happening in the world. The world economy is in a poor state. Economic growths in industrial countries have slowed since 1973 and have now come to a halt. The OECD projection is 0.3 per cent growth in gross domestic product in 1982. Growth in Australia is still continuing, and still continuing at a very significant rate. Indeed, the latest of the Australian Statistician's figures show that and the latest OECD figures show that. Where then is this comparison? Negative growth in industrial production in the last recorded quarter has been shown in six of the seven major countries-Germany, Japan, Canada, France et cetera. They are countries that Senator Button has said are doing better than we are. He said that we ought to look at them. They have negative growth; we have positive growth. The depth of the recession overseas is illustrated by the experience of the United States. Dwelling commencement in the United States are only 35 per cent to 40 per cent of the level a short period ago and the producing of automobiles is at an annual rate of only 7.5 million compared with 15 million previously. That is the present picture. Our GDP grew at nearly three times the OECD average rate in the last two years, 1980 and 1981 , but we cannot of course be isolated from international standards and trends. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Pollard of Macquarie University, a renowned actuary, has looked at what has been happening in Australia and living standards in Australia. He has analysed the statement by the Labor Party as to whether living standards are rising or declining. He has rejected Mr Hayden's statement and has said that all the indicators are that our living standards are in fact improving while overseas they are in fact worsening. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to defence, the world is in the most perilous period that it has seen since World War II. The one great potential aggressor in the world-the Opposition is never willing to tackle this-is the Soviet Union. That is the one nation against whose integrity there is no threat at all. Who offers a threat to the integrity of the USSR in this world today? Nobody offers a threat against the integrity of the USSR. Nobody is the aggressor against it. Yet the Soviet Union is increasing its nuclear arms massively above those of the United States of America. It is increasing its orthodox defences against other countries. Does the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation offer a threat to the USSR? On the contrary; what has happened is that NATO has been weakening in its defence and its will to constitute defence. </PARA>
<PARA> Is our Prime Minister wrong to be saying to the world at large that this poses a great danger? I do not take any comfort from the grins on the faces of members of the Australian Labor Party when we talk about these matters. They are always grinning with smug self-satisfaction in relation to this matter. The fact of the matter is that there is only one threat to the peace of the world today and that is the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union could resolve that tomorrow by putting down its arms, by bringing about an equality with the West and by implementing parallel disarmament. But it is not doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is right for the Prime Minister on behalf of Australia to go overseas, to talk about peace and about how to achieve peace, how much more right is it to say that we believe the recession that has come to the Western world must be lifted, that we must work together to get a better psychology in this world towards creating more employment throughout the world so that we can lift up the living standards of the people of the developed and developing countries, and so that we can really have a proper North-South dialogue? How right is it for Australia, which is one of the great trading nations of the world, to put its views? Why should it not put its views? Senator Button was so selective in his editorial reading today that he failed to read the Age newspaper. The newspaper must have been thinking of him because its editorial heading stated: 'Fraser is talking sense'. The editorial went on to describe Senator Button and his party. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fraser's overseas trip has already triggered the usual manifestations of our national inferiority complex that surface whenever our leaders meet with those of other countries to discuss world problems. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial went on to suggest that a psychologist was needed to test the reasons for this. How is it that the Leader of the Opposition can selectively pick one newspaper editorial when right around Australia the industrialists and the leaders of commerce have praised what Malcolm Fraser is doing? The President of the United States of America has said that this represents a very constructive series of ideas. Here we are now-knock, knock, knock! It is a disgraceful situation of trying to destroy the presentation of Australia's view and of trying to denigrate Australia. The Prime Minister is going to Japan, which is our largest trading partner, essentially to free up the trade of Japan around the world so that there can be a greater flow of trade and a greater creation of jobs. Is it being said that our Prime Minister has no right to talk trade when we are one of the great trading nations on earth? We are the greatest of all in terms of bauxite, alumina, iron ore and food and farming commodities. What has been said by the Opposition constitutes one of the most dastardly presentations in an attempt to destroy a Prime Minister, who was nationally elected, when he responded to a--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An ancient political tradition followed by incompetent or corrupt governments entailed diverting public attention. Decadent emperors staged circuses in Rome but with modern technology the circuses can be staged overseas in places such a Washington. A more recent Australian tradition combines self-indulgent ego tripping with the ancient diversion objective. In 1930 Mr Scullin went abroad to be flattered, feted and manipulated by the London money lenders. In 1956 Mr Menzies went up the Nile to deliver to Nasser the ultimatum of the British Empire which was promptly countermanded from Washington. In 1974, as Senator Button said, Idi Amin offered to arbitrate on the dispute in Northern Ireland. In reply to the claim of the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Sir John Carrick, that Senator Button had equated the Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, with Idi Amin, I must say that Senator Button did no such thing. He did, however, point out that they shared common attributes such as self-aggrandisement and self-delusion . At least every year Malcolm Fraser goes abroad and stages a circus to divert Australian attention from the wretched failures of his policies in Australia and , of course, to provide a forum in which he can pose as the global statesman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The latest instalment of that saga, which is soon to be terminated completely, is the blueprint for world recovery which the Prime Minister modestly described as unexpected, bold and imaginative. It has been suggested in newspaper editorials that self-praise invites ridicule-it received it-and that it is presumptuous for the Prime Minister of a minor nation to hector and harangue major economic powers. However that may be, it is certainly presumptuous for a leader with as dismal a record as an economic manager as has Malcolm Fraser to pontificate to his betters. In the class of the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development Malcolm Fraser is a dunce. Well, the dunce has now promoted himself to lecturer. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the record since the Australian economy has been under the control of Malcolm Fraser, we will find that on vital economic indicators, such as unemployment rates, in the four calendar years from 1977 to 1980 inclusive unemployment in Australia averaged 6 per cent. In the OECD as a whole it averaged 5.3 per cent. Incidentally, when Malcolm Fraser gained control of the Australian economy the unemployment rate was lower in Australia than in the OECD as a whole. It was 4.7 per cent and 4.8 per cent in 1975 and 1976. In the OECD as a whole it was 5.1 per cent and 5.2 per cent. The Prime Minister took our unemployment rate from below that of the OECD average and maintained it at above the OECD average. Individual countries in the OECD, such as Japan, to which Malcolm Fraser now has the presumption to lecture, have maintained an unemployment rate through those four years-1977 to 1980-at an average of 2.1 per cent. Malcolm Fraser's Government has achieved 6 per cent, yet he is now lecturing the Japanese on economic management. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to economic growth, we have precisely the same story; although the details vary, the story and the conclusions do not. I cite the comparative positions of Japan and Australia. In those five years Australia's real growth in gross domestic product averaged 2.3 per cent. In Japan it averaged 5.1 per cent, yet Malcolm Fraser has the audacity, the effrontery to lecture the Japanese on economic management. It is correct, as Senator Sir John Carrick has said- although he did not bother to add the qualification-that in the last 12 months or possibly even 18 months Australia, compared to the performance of the OECD as a whole, has done relatively well. It has still not done well compared to the leaders among OECD countries, but in the last 12 months it has done relatively well because of the passing phenomenon of a half-baked resources boom which, as even this Government now recognises, is about to lose its influence on investment and economic growth. That short term advantage, which Australia has enjoyed for reasons exogenous to it, is about to be terminated. The strident rhetoric and extravagant self-praise of Malcolm Fraser cannot disguise the fact that, as he would put it in a different context, the runs are on the board and his score is low. </PARA>
<PARA> We are told that this blueprint for economic recovery is only 10 days old. Those who are familiar with the Fraser style of policy making are not likely to be surprised by that. Those who looked at the contradictions in the 18 May statement were probably surprised that it spent as long as 10 days in the incubator. They would not be surprised if it had come straight off the top of the Prime Minister's head, or straight from a Channel 7 cosmetician, as have other Fraser bold and imaginative economic initiatives. Our Prime Minister has the presumption to lecture people who have managed the economies of Japan, Austria, The Netherlands, West Germany, Norway and Sweden-all of which are democratic countries-on how they should manage their economies. He has the presumption to lecture the OECD as a whole. Certainly it is presumptuous to do that. It may not be presumptuous to lecture the American President or the British Prime Minister who, arguably, are the only two non-banana republic leaders in the world who are more ignorant of economic questions than is Malcolm Fraser. It leads to some fascinating speculation. Will Mr Fraser be explaining to President Reagan that a national budget is just like a household budget; that if in one year you run a deficit it has to be paid back? Will he be telling Mr Reagan that the $100 billion deficit which the Reagan Administration plans to run up this year will have to come out of Nancy's housekeeping allowance in future? Of course, the United States Press is not as ignorant as is the incumbent of the White House on these questions. As was reported today in the Australian Financial Review, it showed excellent judgment in its response to Mr Fraser's bold, unexpected and imaginative blueprint for world economic recovery.</PARA>
<PARA> We are told that an Australian journalist asked Mr Reagan a question at a photography session and that that incident rated a box story on page 10 of the Washington Post, which otherwise ignored Mr Fraser's visit. Not only was it not on the front page of the Washington Post; it was not in the Washington Post at all. That newspaper ignored the visit and our Prime Minister's blueprint for economic recovery. In that regard at least, the Washington Post certainly showed good judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's statement raises contradictions and leaves unanswered certain questions. For example, it includes the following proposal:</PARA>

<PARA>I repeat, 'reductions in all forms of protection'. How does the Prime Minister propose to reconcile that bold, imaginative initiative with the unconditional promise given to the textiles, clothing and footwear industry of Australia, that its level of protection would not be reduced for seven years? If he expects anybody to take the statement seriously-and I am not sure whether anybody does, although Senator Carrick feels obliged to purport to do so-that is one of the questions that he will be obliged to answer. If that proposal is to be taken seriously, the Government is contemplating reducing the protection for that industry, reducing the protection for the motor vehicle industry, even reducing protection for tobacco growers-I repeat, if the statement is to be taken seriously. Just what does it mean? What is the Government's policy? Is it contemplating reducing protection for those industries and repudiating yet another promise?</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Prime Minister's world overview is not restricted to economic questions. He is also a guru on international conflict, defence and foreign policy. He has denounced the 'short-sighted competitive scramble to provide one' s adversary with the means to continue investing in war', which is Fraser-speak for trading with the Russians. Does that mean that Nareen wool will no longer be shipped to the Soviet Union as it has been, as it was last year or the year before, and probably the year before that? Does it mean that Nareen wool will no longer be helping the Red Army to fight the Afghan chill? The Australian Wheat Board, in its 'Wheat Australia' publication of February of this year, proudly announced on the front page: 'The USSR buys another million tons of Australian wheat, the second million ton sale in this year'. That wheat, I might add, was for the first time ever sold on terms, on time payment, not for cash. Does the Prime Minister's denunciation of those who trade with the Russians mean that the Australian Government is about to terminate that trade or interfere with it in any meaningful way? Of course, the Government's policy towards trade with the Soviet Union has not been quite clear since January 1980. Contradictory statements by various Ministers are on the record, but what was supposed to be the definitive statement on the Government's attitude concerning trade with the Soviet Union was put to me in a letter from Mr Anthony of 23 September last year , in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Government's policy has been, and remains, that normal trade and commercial dealings between Australia and the Soviet Union may continue. </PARA>
<PARA>Has the Government signalled an intention in the Prime Minister's statement that that policy is about to be drastically changed? If he has not signalled such an intention, what has he signalled? What is he saying? Why is he travelling abroad and making a series of silly statements unless it is to divert public attention from the mess he has made of the Australian economy and of our social institutions?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to this matter of public importance. I remind the Senate that we are discussing what is called the ' political posturing by the Prime Minister overseas which is calculated to deceive the Australian people'. In Senator Button and Senator Walsh, Opposition senators have today again continued their tirade against the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and their general denigration of the leadership which he and other leaders in this country have given in an international area. I am one who takes the view that Australia has every right to be heard, as a relatively small or middle power but one with a reasonable economic past and future and as one of the rare democracies in the world which, therefore, has every right to speak on questions of human liberty. It has every right, through its leaders, to go to the United States of America and other nations and to express its views on the economic problems which face the West, questions of disarmament and the important matters which the Prime Minister is pursuing today in the United States. It ill becomes the leaders and members of the Australian Labor Party here today to try to denigrate the actions of the Prime Minister by calling them political posturings. We know that what the Prime Minister is saying represents the feelings of the great majority of Australian people. What he is doing is not a matter of posturing but of expanding the policies which he has expressed over a number of years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that Senator Button had the temerity to criticise the Prime Minister's policies and actions in regard to Africa and in regard to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. The CHOGM conference will remain one of the most significant actions of the Prime Minister. The people who came to it as leaders of their nations expressed their considerable support and appreciation of Australia's initiatives in the world, particularly in regard to racial matters. There is no doubt that Malcolm Fraser has led in that area. There is no doubt that in recent years he has taken very considerable political risks in the world. I refer particularly to the agreement at Lusaka and the very strong high profile which he took which led ultimately to a solution, to democratic elections and to the installation of the Mugabe Government in Zimbabwe. Of course, there were critics in Australia and elsewhere. There were people who said that we should play safe and not be involved. But we were involved and it is to our credit. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Senate knows, in recent weeks I have been in Africa. I spent a month there. I had the opportunity to look at Nigeria, Kenya, Zimbabwe and South Africa. I came back with a number of conclusions, many of which I will explain in articles which I am presently writing. Today I want to speak particularly about this area because if there is one thing that can be said, it is that the Prime Minister was not posturing and has not been posturing in the strong views he has taken on racial matters and on matters of concern to Africa generally. His policies there have been an undoubted success; I had the opportunity to see the results in my recent visit. In Zimbabwe, the results of the compromises reached and the elections are that, after two years, the Mugabe Government is doing very well. There is a very considerable recovery in economic affairs in that country. There is a great deal more confidence in the country. The considerable outflow of some people who could not face up to black rule has now dwindled to a very small number. </PARA>
<PARA> While I was there I had the opportunity of talking to many of the Ministers of the Mugabe Government and to people who are friendly critics of that Government. They pointed out that there are some difficulties which will always be experienced with a government in which the Ministers may talk too much of socialism when they mean something quite different from what the Americans might think socialism means. Some people believe there is a danger that Zimbabwe will not attract back sufficient capital for the restoration of economic health in that country. But even with those criticisms, there was overwhelming support for the initiatives which the present Government in Zimbabwe is undertaking. From our point of view, what is even more important is that the initiatives which the Australian Government has expressed, not only in its support of the country at the time of independence but also in its practical assistance, are the very opposite of posturing. It is that assistance which is helping to make Zimbabwe's economy successful. </PARA>
<PARA> I will detail three things which were said to me time and again by people in Zimbabwe in relation to our assistance to them. In the first place, I refer to our assistance in the provision of considerable quantities of tents and other equipment when the armies were being integrated. It was very important that that help was given at the time that it was needed and it was greatly appreciated by the Zimbabwe Government. Altogether, some $20m in aid is being given by Australia to the Zimbabwe Government. The most important part of that aid is in the form of assistance by specialists and experts from Australia. For example, we have sent many teachers who were in active operation in Australia and who are now working in the education system of Zimbabwe. Not only Ministers, but also ordinary people in the street and headmasters of schools that I met, spoke glowingly of the work being done by young Australian teachers in Zimbabwe who are great ambassadors for this country. Of course, Zimbabwe would like more teachers. Our teachers are very valuable in helping to train the half-trained teachers who at the moment have to cope with the growing school population in Zimbabwe. That factor came up time and again as one of the best ways in which we can help. Likewise in the field of agriculture, we have sponsored veterinary scientists to go and work in that country. I returned with suggestions that were made to me of practical further ways in which we can assist the recovery of the economy of Zimbabwe. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the opportunity of being, I think, the first foreign politician to enter Harare, the new name for Salisbury, and to be at the celebrations of the second anniversary of independence and of the change of name to Harare. At the celebrations in that beautiful city I had the opportunity to meet a great number of the country's leaders, including white leaders in the community and some who have joined the Government recently as white members of parliament. In fact, the Government has been very sensible in the expansion of its ranks to include members of Mr Nkomo's party and white men who do not hold the same views as Mr Smith. Those people are collaborating very successfully with the Government. The situation in Zimbabwe results from an initiative in which the Prime Minister can take a great deal of personal pride; it is one which is continuing to this day. I hope that any Australian who visits Zimbabwe-I think many more will if Qantas Airways Ltd takes its planes to Zimbabwe later this year-will enjoy the beauty of Zimbabwe and help it on its road to recovery. As Australians, we can be proud of a real record in that area. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator, I am turning to South Africa. I spent a fortnight in South Africa and I can detail a few things about that visit. I will be saying a lot more in the writings which I intend to do. South Africa is another area where the Prime Minister has for many years, despite criticisms- sometimes from the Government side-made absolutely clear his loathing of apartheid and all it stands for, of his objection to the terrible injustices which I was able to observe in South Africa. I can assure the Senate that I returned from South Africa reinforced in the views that I left here with and with many facts which indicate the basic inhumanity of life in South Africa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> South Africa is a very successful, powerful country. Its success is based very largely on the backs of black, coloured and Indian labour. Even the present attempt to change the political situation slightly by giving the coloureds and Indians a form of voting right is not confusing them because they are fearful that they will be seen as the frontline fighters for white South Africa. I asked the Vice President of South Africa and other Nationalist Party members at a luncheon whether they wanted to hand on to their successors, their children, a country based upon a strong hold on defence-'us against the rest of Africa'-or whether they would become the dynamo of the economy of Africa and be seen openly to be helping the rest of Africa. They tended to agree that the latter was what they must do. But I think that, if we, with other countries, do not bring pressures to bear on South Africa, we will not see it advance along that line. </PARA>
<PARA> Some small advances are being made. There are advances in the labour laws which now enable black labour to be heard. But at the same time, in the last year, 22 black leaders were either imprisoned or banned, more than ever before. In other words, while they are getting greater powers and greater economic strength they are being victimised even more by the security forces. As I say, we must, I think, continue with the policies which Malcolm Fraser has expounded and espoused for years. I had the opportunity of lunching with Chief Gatsha Buthelezi and his Cabinet in Ulundi. They, of course, are the leaders of 5 1/2 million Zulus. His main advice to me was that the Australian Government should continue to put pressure on the South African Government. Chief Buthelezi is putting pressure on it. He is not prepared to sell his South African birthright. He is not prepared to set up a homeland consisting of 42 separate pieces of land around Durban and elsewhere. He and courageous white South Africans are not prepared to accept the fact that they will need passports and so forth to go to those areas. Chief Buthelezi is not prepared to abandon South African citizenship. He and many other black leaders, coloured leaders and Asian leaders are forthright critics of the Government. I hope that we will soon see him in Australia because he is a man of considerable world prestige and one to whom it will be very helpful for Australians to speak. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is very well represented in South Africa, as in Zimbabwe, by our ambassadors-Jeremy Hearder the Ambassador in Zimbabwe, and Ambassador Malcolm Lyon and John Graves, the trade commissioner, in Johannesburg. I believe that they are doing an excellent job for Australia. We are making some contribution to libraries in South Africa from small funds which are available to the Ambassador. We are making it clear where our sympathies lie and what we say South Africa ought to do to recover its place in the world as a decent democracy . There are great South Africans such as Helen Suzman whom I met and the Mayor of Durban, Chief Buthelezi, Dr Motlana and many others, who are fighting a great battle. We have helped with that. The Prime Minister has been in the forthright position of standing full square to ensure that South Africa is told time and time again what it does not want to believe, that the West will not come to its rescue, that we are not entirely interested in its point of view and the preservation of the white race in South Africa. South Africans must realise the danger of their position if they are going to change. </PARA>
<PARA> My general thought in regard to South Africa is that the Prime Minister has therefore been a leader in this world and not, in any way, a posturer. Because we have heard such nonsense today and because we do not want the embarrassment of the Opposition going any further with it, I move:</PARA>

Consequently, the Committee has been concentrating its efforts on this aspect of the reference. At the time I informed the Senate that the Committee intended to report by 30 June 1982. However, due to the volume of material before the Committee that needs to be thoroughly assessed, and also because the Committee believes that the report should be tabled while the Senate is sitting, it is now intended that the report relating to the possible effects on Vietnam veterans of exposure to herbicides will be tabled early in the Budget session.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981 [No. 2] (1982), the Australian National University Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1981 [No. 2] (1982) and the Canberra College of Advanced Education Amendment Bill 1981 [No. 2] (1982) seek to reimpose upon a small minority of tertiary students a fee which would be a proportion of the cost of their recurrent study; that is, less than one-fifth of the recurrent cost of taking a second degree or a post-graduate degree. In no way would first degree students and first diploma students in universities and colleges be affected by this legislation but post-graduate students who do not gain a Commonwealth post-graduate award, which is awarded on the basis of academic competition and academic merit, a university research grant or an industry or other private benefaction scholarship would be required to make a part contribution towards the recurrent cost of the studies they undertake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I said yesterday in this debate that the Opposition's case in opposing these three Bills was based almost entirely on the argument that they would restrict access to tertiary study in Australia. I seek to refute that argument on the basis that any matriculating student in Australia may, without any impediment, enrol in a university or a college without having to pay any fees for that academic tuition. No first degree student will be affected in any way by these Bills. Someone who wants to take on a second degree at the taxpayers' expense or who wants, after competing for the scholarships that are available in Australia, to continue with their own interests in post-graduate study, would, as proposed by these three Bills, be required to make a part contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore believe that the argument that these Bills will restrict students with academic ability from taking up their courses of study to be not substantial at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The other argument, that the Bills will restrict students from low income families from taking up their studies, also falls flat because there are Commonwealth-provided scholarships and living allowances for post-graduate study . I happen to think that the allowances have slipped away with inflation and that the Government should, in the Budget context, give very real consideration- in fact top priority consideration-to the Commonwealth post-graduate basic living allowance being raised from its present level of about $4,500 a year. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my top priority in my own submissions to the Government and, if I may say so, as chairman of the back bench committee of Government members on education and the arts. The Commonwealth post-graduate award is intended to be an adequate living allowance to help a post-graduate student undertake a course of study, in the most part leading to a doctor of philosophy degree. The university research grants and other scholarships available are of a like nature. There is one other aspect to which I draw attention and it is that the Commonwealth post-graduate award is taxable. One third of the part time earnings of a CPGA holder is taken in tax, but holders of other scholarships- university grants, for example-are not subject to tax. I believe that that invidious difference should be resolved so that all post-graduate students are treated alike.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My argument at the moment is with regard to access to post-graduate study. Talented students can gain post-graduate awards and other scholarships. If we are not producing enough post-graduate students with, say, degrees in engineering, applied sciences, education or humanities, the argument should be that we increase the number of post-graduate awards. Under this Government the number of new awards a year was increased from 700 to 800. I believe the Government should consider increasing that number. In passing, I refer to the particular problem of engineering post-graduate students. At the moment only 17 of the 800 new CPGA awardees are undertaking post-graduate engineering research. Some years ago more than 100 of the 800 awardees were doing so. There is a critical need in Australia for engineers with post-graduate research experience.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin referred yesterday to developments in the aluminium industry in Queensland. I interjected and asked him for an example of how we are not sufficiently equipping young people in Australia with the skills we require. I think his own example is only partly relevant here. The increasing level of real grants that the Australian Government has made to technical and further education and apprenticeships, including technical engineering, indicates its resolve to make resources available to meet the need. But we have a particular problem with regard to university engineering and technology graduates going on to post-graduate study. Here the problem is that there is such a need for their skills in the work place that merely as graduates they can earn salaries of $18, 000 to $20,000 in their first year of employment. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Right now. That means that they are enormously tempted, even if they are academically able, to take up employment on graduation rather than, even with their first class degree, go on to post-graduate study of very real value to them and to the nation. The problem is that, while the Commonwealth post-graduate award is only $4,500 and they can gain, in any event, some research experience in their places of employment in one of the growing industries in Australia, the manpower needs of Australia are taking those graduates away. I believe that this problem will be partly met by increasing to a much more realistic and rewarding amount the living allowance to which all post-graduate students are entitled. I believe that we ought to give special consideration to areas of research need that are not being fully met at the moment. Perhaps some special provision for, say, engineering students would help to meet the need but I do not want to deny in any way the very real increases in resources being made available to apprenticeships and other areas of TAFE. In fact at the moment there are more apprentices in training than ever before in Australia's history. I think that achievement is evidence of the Government's real recognition of the need for skilled tradespersons and skilled technicians to meet our manpower requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Coming back to the question of access, these fees will be applied to students of lesser academic merit than those who have gained scholarships competitively with them. To a large extent they will be applied to middle aged spouses who have every right to have an interest in some area of academic study and to help themselves, Australia and that area of discipline by the research that they do. But these programs do not have the same urgency or the same priority as those research programs which are funded by scholarships and awards. When we compare the access that all members of the Australian community have to technical and further education, we see that there is a real anomaly in the present situation.</PARA>
<PARA> If my wife, for example, wants to study Chinese language or Chinese studies or Japanese language or Japanese studies and she enrols in a course at a TAFE institution she will have to pay a fee. It is a requirement of the State Government-based TAFE institutions, even though they receive very substantial Commonwealth support, that fees are payable with regard to not only elective study but also serious study at a TAFE institution. But if my wife, for example, wants to take those same studies but in more full time capacity she can presently enrol at a university as a graduate and she does not have to pay any fees at all. Sometimes she will have a better language laboratory made available to her. She will have an array of staff made available to her. Of course, according to the enrolments, there is an expectation of the university applying staff to an area. Without any cost, useful but somewhat elective research studies and second degree studies can be undertaken by Australians. They will not have to pay any fees if they are enrolled in a university or a college but if they are enrolled in a TAFE institution a fee is payable. </PARA>
<PARA> The burden of the Government's argument in response to the findings of the Review of Commonwealth Functions which is embodied in these three Bills, is that it is appropriate that persons who already have a degree which the taxpayer has funded, who are going on to do a second degree or who already have a degree and who have competed for a research post-graduate award and failed, but go on with that study, should make some contribution to the recurrent cost of the course they are undertaking. The contribution is up to $1,000 a year for a full time, enrolled, second degree or post-graduate student. The recurrent cost of a course of study in a university or college these days is between $5,000 and $6,000 a year. A person would be required to pay less than a fifth of the recurrent cost. That is not taking into account the part value of the capital that has been put into the universities and colleges over the last century or so. </PARA>
<PARA> So the question is not one of access. It is not a matter of denying access to students of talent nor is it denying members of families at any income level, including those at low income level, access to tertiary education. If it were it would be thrown out entirely at a very early stage in the Government's formulations. That is to say: What should the taxpayer bear? Should the taxpayer entirely fund these more marginal and lesser priority activities of adult Australians in taking second degrees and some research studies largely part time and largely not leading to a Ph.D. or a serious research degree? The question of access, which is the whole thrust of the Opposition's attack on these Bills, I believe, falls flat. </PARA>
<PARA> In any event, when fees in universities and colleges were abolished in 1973 it was the expectation of many in this chamber-certainly it was my expectation and my hope-that in the years following 1973 there would be a much broader spectrum of Australians entering tertiary study. It was certainly my hope that increasing numbers of students from low income families would enrol in our universities and colleges. But what is the evidence? What is the finding? The finding by Dr Anderson of the Australian National University and also by a direct study of this matter done by the Australian Vice-Chancellor's Committee is that there has not been any significant change in the profile of students enrolling in our universities and colleges. I do not like that finding. I do not like the conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> But that conclusion will not be addressed by opposing these Bills. It will be met by looking at 14 year-old, 15 year-old and 16 year-old students in high schools and making sure that they have put before them encouragements to consider going on to do tertiary study and that they are not dissuaded by family , peer group or their own lack of full momentum from considering the option of a professional course of study for a degree or the awards given in our colleges of advanced education. The matter of access will not be met by trumpetings against these Bills from the Opposition which fall flat in this debate. The question of access which should be addressed by honourable senators on all sides concerns students in their teens being given encouragement to be prepared to go on to complete their matriculation and other requisites for a course of tertiary study . It is my hope that by these sorts of encouragement being given in our high schools we may see a change in the profile of enrolments and the giving of much broader access to students. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that nothing in these Bills applies a fee to any first course of study. In essence the question raised in these Bills is this: Should the taxpayers of Australia not only pay the $2 billion for tertiary study that the Commonwealth provides and the $1 billion which is provided through the Schools Commission supplementing the billions of dollars applied from the States, but also in addition bear the full cost of recurrent study by, in the main, adult Australians who are taking on a second course of study or after missing out on a post-graduate degree, going on with some area of post-graduate study anyway? The finding of the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee prior to April last year was that in the light of restraint on government spending and on liberally spending taxpayers' money this is an area of attention in which the user pays principle has some bearing and in which about a fifth of the recurrent cost could be borne by the students involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation as it applies to universities generally in the States or to the ANU and the Canberra College of Advanced Education seeks to apply fees to that small proportion of students. There is a limit on the fees of $1,000 in any one year. There is a limit in that the fees can never be applied to a first degree student and the fees cannot be applied to overseas students who are already required to make a contribution by way of a visa fee. There are also indications in the Bills that the Minister for Education will prescribe approved combined courses for which students will not be liable to pay fees. It is well known that some Bachelor of Arts students take on a second degree in law and that this is a combined course of study. Arts students and science students may also take a diploma in education and this is an approved combined course. There is no way in which this legislation will levy fees on that second aspect of the combined degree. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to a number of specialised courses in which I have had a special interest, I have been very glad to see, from the Minister's circulated indication of the approved combined courses for these purposes, that there are such things as special education diplomas. Teachers who already have a degree and a diploma in education will be able to take on a course of study in special education, for which there is a real community need, without any such penalty to themselves. I believe there is not sufficient awareness in the Opposition that the Government's intention of serving the taxpayers of Australia is at the crux of these Bills. Whenever governments are reviewing programs, such as in the Review of Commonwealth Functions, they ought to have foremost in mind that the money that is being applied to programs is not their own money; it is money being used on behalf of taxpayers. That is the matter that is at issue in these Bills. Senator Macklin at one stage in his speech implied that some Government senators might argue that this part payment of fees would give some moral uplift to the payers of the fees. That is not an argument I have ever entertained. It is not an argument that the Government puts forward. It is a hypothesis that perhaps Senator Macklin has raised. It has no home on the Government benches. No Government senator would be so patronising as to argue that these Bills have anything to do with moral uplift. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the fuller account of the arguments in favour of this legislation was very clearly put forward by Ministers and other Government senators during the October debate on these issues. I hope that the brief summary of them that I have been able to give in this debate will commend the Bills to honourable senators and that after this second consideration of the Bills they will be approved by the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest to Senator Georges that he does not want me to go through the entire argument again. The three Bills have been discussed in this place and the other place on three previous occasions. This is the fourth time the debate has occurred. The arguments have been well rehearsed, are well understood and are well known. It is not necessary for me to review the arguments in detail. I thank Senator Teague for the way he has set out the Government's position with the clarity which he brought to his contribution. Anyone listening to the debate might have been excused for thinking that the Government is about to bring in some draconian measure. It has been made quite clear that this is not the case. It is not true that this is the first step towards the introduction of fees for all tertiary students. The Government has no such intention. We have no intention that there should be fees for students who are taking first degrees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation before the Senate makes it clear that what is proposed excludes undergraduates or first degree students. I regret that the Australian Labor Party, in particular, has chosen to muddy the waters rather than concentrate on the effects of the Bills, which have been set out by my colleague. The Bills are a result of the considerations of the Committee on Review of Commonwealth Functions. They do provide for a very limited reintroduction of fees for the kinds of students mentioned and elucidated by Senator Teague. The Bills will have no retrospective effect. They will not pick up people who are already enrolled. It would be the intention of the Government to introduce additional legislation to exempt students already enrolled for courses in 1982 from paying fees. Therefore there is no question of those who are already enrolled being picked up. The fees proposed are not large. They are modest and they are modest as a proportion of the cost actually incurred on behalf of the students. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of these Bills will not be to deny students access to education. Those who are undertaking subsequent degrees or studies will be asked to make some small contribution to the costs which are involved in the study they are doing. The Government is committed to increasing and improving access to education for all people, not just the wealthy. We are also committed to a belief that education is the key to our future national prosperity. Our programs are designed to these ends. We are committed to quality of education and we are committed to good educational outcomes. It is the question of educational outcomes which particularly attracts me. These principles are not at stake in the legislation and it is wrong for anyone to suggest that they are or to paint the legislation in those terms. We intend to monitor the effects of the legislation and to correct any negative consequences which might emerge. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been much made of possible effects upon research as a result of this legislation. That is based upon a most unusual reading of the place of research or the structure of research in our tertiary institutions, or the contribution to that research made by way of students not having to pay tuition fees. It is a very tortuous argument. It does not apply to most students doing research. It does not apply to those in receipt of Commonwealth post-graduate awards. It does not apply to those who are in receipt of university research grants or private industry awards of any significant amount. Those who do receive those awards would not be denied access to an opportunity to do their research. Nor would the capacity of those who are presently tenured in universities, colleges or other institutions be affected because they are already able to do research as part of their normal daily activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to furthering research generally in tertiary institutions. We believe the money spent on research-I pick up a point which, I think, Senator Macklin made in his contribution last night-will be returned to us many times over. It will be returned to a wider community in a large number of benefits as a result of that research. We understand that and we do support it. I make the point that in the last nine or 10 years-most of it during the term of this Government-the number of identified research workers in universities has increased from about 14,500 to about 18,500. The amount of research support has been significant. It has been increasing and it has been possible to increase the number of people undertaking this activity. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate throughout on these Bills has tended to range widely. Many people have concentrated on matters which are not at issue in the legislation proposed today. There have been attempts to exaggerate the supposed negative aspects of this package of Bills. However those contributions which have addressed themselves to issues of access, quality and outcomes-wherever those contributions have come from-have been extremely welcome. I mention again my two colleagues, Senator Teague and Senator Macklin. The extent to which their contributions have addressed themselves to issues in education will be examined. I will do my best to determine whether it is possible to respond on merit to those proposals because I believe they were put forward in good faith. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, the issue before the Senate is quite clear. The Bills have been discussed many times. The Senate is quite clear on what the issues are. I understand the intentions which have been indicated by the Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Independent as to how they will vote. I understand the reality of numbers. I think it will be a pity if this legislation is rejected but at this stage I think it proper to put it to the test. Therefore I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Loan Bill currently before the Senate authorises the Government to borrow moneys technically for defence purposes. Normally all expenditure is funded from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or from Loan Council Funds. The additional avenue of funding government expenditure available-that is, the Loan Bill before the Senate-is the third source of government funding. If revenue available from the general loan fund and from the Consolidated Revenue Fund is inadequate the Government may resort to a loan Bill of this type, borrowing moneys, as I said, to fund expenditure technically for defence purposes. I think it is fair to say that the reason the Government is introducing this Bill now is that the Budget deficit will be substantially greater-I do not know whether I should say than was anticipated or was admitted to-than when the Budget was brought down in August last year. This is so because revenue is lower than had been projected and expenditure is higher and as a result the likely total overall budget deficit is likely to rise from the projected $146m to something over $1,000m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that that has happened is indicative either of unforeseen or unforeseeable circumstances or perhaps, I suppose, given the precedent of 1977, some people may say it is due to rubbery figures-to a falsification such as we witnessed in 1977-of estimates for political purposes. Whether or not that is so , there is nothing sinister about the procedure itself being adopted by the Government of the passage of loan Bills through the Parliament to fund government expenditure if the conventional sources-that is, the Consolidated Revenue Fund and the general loan fund-are inadequate for government needs. That was not the view expressed by Senator Carrick on behalf of the then Opposition in 1975 when he spoke on an identical Bill. This speech is found on page 879 of the Hansard of 1 October 1975. Senator Carrick said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Senate is debating the Loan Bill 1975. It is not, as the Government would like to have us believe, a minor machinery matter. It is a vital part of the overall strategy of the Federal Budget, and the testing of this Bill is a primary testing of the authenticity or the validity of the Budget itself. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is palpable nonsense. It was palpable nonsense at the time it was stated. It still would be palpable nonsense to state it. The Opposition, of course, takes a rational view of the reason for this Bill being introduced. Given that it is required to fund inaccurate projections of revenue and expenditure in the Budget, the procedure itself is neither sinister nor improper . The Government will ultimately be called to account for its overall fiscal and monetary management, but there is no reason to oppose this legislation. The Opposition will not do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Loan Bills are a technical device which Treasurers of governments of political parties represented on both sides of the House have used to perform a pea and shell trick designed to bypass the Australian Loan Council. By presenting a loan Bill, allegedly for defence purposes, the Government can circumvent the Loan Council since the money is for a specific purpose and that does not fall within the ambit of the Loan Council. By paying for defence expenditure with moneys from the Loan Bill other revenue can be diverted for non-defence purposes. Basically, the Bill is a short term measure to stop the Government going broke at a time when tax revenue is not coming in at a sufficiently fast rate. Since we are not in the business of bringing down governments we will not oppose this Bill. The Bill is, as the Treasurer (Mr Howard) noted in another place, a loan Bill requesting an unusually small amount-a ceiling of $300m. As the honourable member noted, it is brought forward unusually late in the financial year. I can only speculate on the reasons for both, but taken together they suggest that the Government is not as strapped for cash as it has been pretending it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will take the opportunity to make a few remarks about this Government's financial management. The first and most salutary lesson for the Government was that its provisions in the Budget for salary increases were clearly inadequate. The Government has claimed that salaries and wages rose faster than it predicted . If this is true the predicators of the Budget must be severely castigated. We believe that it was quite obvious, even on Budget night, that the provision of only $100m for salary increases for members of the defence forces was inadequate and that the figure should have been $240m based on the consumer price index and the work value rises related to trade awards. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer and the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) again blamed the revenue shortfall on two things-a drop in crude oil excise caused by industrial disputes and the rejection of the proposed sales tax legislation. Interestingly, the Minister ascribed this rejection to 'another place'. I do not know whether this was a Freudian slip and whether she would, in fact, prefer to be in another place but it is the Senate that she now graces and it was the Senate that rejected the outrageous proposed imposition of sales tax on the necessities of life. I remind the Minister that if the Government had agreed to split the sales tax Bills, as we proposed, the cost of the Senate's action would have been only $37m and not the $53m that the Minister herself is on record as saying was involved-a difference of $16m. We nevertheless sympathise with the Government to some degree, even though much of the dilemma that it now finds itself in is of its own making. In recent months the Government has, in fact, had to make a number of tough decisions on expensive defence equipment. Although we do not necessarily agree with some of these decisions, we recognise that the Government has had to face very difficult choices. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of all, we call on the Government to bite the bullet in devising some new method of wage fixation. It could well be that with a little imagination the Government could come up with a proposal for wage fixation which would be a very considerable advance on anything that we have seen before. Whatever comes up, there has to be recognition of direct bargaining since there is no way that the unions will forgo this right. This surely has to be related to some sort of written agreement with the unions for industrial peace for a fixed period. This will require varying the role of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission so that some sort of social compact can be arrived at. Such a compact should include effective price control. It should include also some degree of wage indexation and flexibility for productivity-related increases. But the unions must agree to play ball. At the present time the unions get the benefit of advocacy before the Commission and irrespective of whether they are successful, they can immediately seek over-award payments on a plant by plant basis or a company by company basis. The unions cannot continue to have it both ways. If they are given a fair deal, in return surely they should be prepared to accept some restrictions on their bargaining power. The sooner the Government addresses itself to these very difficult but basic issues in economic management the sooner this country will pull out of its tail-spin as far as the economy is concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senators who have spoken for their support of the Loan Bill. Both Senator Walsh and Senator Siddons described the technical requirements for the Bill. It was introduced rather late because it was thought that such a Bill would not be necessary, but the sorts of factors which were mentioned by Senator Siddons-the additional expenditure which has been incurred unexpectedly, the shortfall of revenue occasioned in part by industrial action reducing oil revenue receipts and the rejection of certain legislation in this place by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats-have given rise to the need for the buffer which this Bill provides. As was pointed out in the second reading speech of the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick), funding from the Loan Fund to the maximum extent could, if there were no untoward developments, avoid the prospect of a deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. In other words, there may be no need to utilise the provisions of this legislation. But the Government, of course, cannot be certain that contingencies will not arise. The unexpected can always be upon us. We have already seen this year the loss of revenue due to union action. For that reason the buffer is seen as being necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only other thing that I would say with respect to the debate which has occurred on this Bill is that I acknowledge the interest which Senator Siddons has shown in terms of a better wage fixing method. I think his comments may be taken as encouraging in respect of the greater dependence upon negotiation which was evident, I think, in the Government's approach over the last year. Indeed, some recent agreements have contained provisions for no strike action, for further review and for no further claims over a defined period. The Government's own moves in the wage fixation area indicate a desire to see that aspect of the economic system functioning in a more satisfactory way. I doubt that the Government would wish to embrace some of the additions which Senator Siddons suggested. The idea of some form of price control with all of the bureaucratic inefficiencies which are inherent in such systems is unlikely to appeal to the Government. I would therefore not wish to sound in my response as though I am encouraging the whole of the package which Senator Siddons has suggested we should consider. As I said, there is no opposition to the passage of this Bill. I commend it to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I present Supply Bill (No. 1) 1982-83. This Bill, together with its companion Bill, Supply Bill (No. 2) 1982-83, seeks interim appropriations for the services of the Government for the period 1 July 1982 to 30 November 1982, by which date it is expected that the Appropriation Bills (Nos. 1 and 2) and the Appropriation Bill for Parliament, forming part of the Budget for 1982-83, will have been enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> Supply Bill (No. 1) seeks appropriations totalling some $4,827m for the ordinary annual services of the Government. This is $464m, or about 10 per cent greater than the amounts provided in the Supply Act (No. 1) 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes $125m for the advance to the Minister for Finance, which is the same amount as has been included in Appropriation Act (No. 1) for the past several years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are four Bills before the Senate. Supply Bill (No. 1) 1982-83 authorises current expenditure in the next financial year up to about the end of November, Supply Bill (No. 2) 1982-83 authorises capital expenditure for the same period and Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1981-82 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1981-82 appropriate additional items of expenditure required for this financial year, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) covering current expenditure and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) covering capital expenditure. On behalf of the Opposition I give notice of my intention to move, to the motion that Appropriation Bill (No. 3) be now read a second time, the following amendment:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Current economic policies have utterly failed to achieve the Government's stated objectives;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) This Bill maintains these disastrous policies, which have depressed economic activity and living standards, increased unemployment, inflation, taxation and interest rates, and accentuated inequity and division in society; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) A completely new economic strategy is required to prevent the Australian economy sliding into deeper recession, and to provide any hope of sustained economic recovery'. </PARA>
<PARA>There are, of course, especially in Appropriation Bill (No. 3), many points regarding specific items of government expenditure which justify some comment and questions, but I will not comment on them now. That will be reserved for the Committee stage of the debate on that Bill. Indeed, I do not intend to speak at great length in this cognate debate because we have already today had a debate essentially about the state of the Australian economy and the overseas visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), in which debate I participated. To speak at great length in this debate would entail repeating much of what I said this morning. I do not intend to do that, and anyway half a dozen other senators want to speak in the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, however, inescapably true that the effects of the Government's economic management in the last seven years are accurately stated in the foreshadowed amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 3). Economic activity is depressed. In only one calendar year since the Fraser Government came to office over six years ago has that Government recorded a growth rate sufficiently high to reduce unemployment. In all other years the real non-farm gross domestic product growth rate has been inadequate to sustain the prevailing rate of unemployment. In only one year has it been high enough to reduce the rate of unemployment, given that we require to reduce unemployment a real non-farm GDP growth rate around or in excess of 4 per cent a year. Inflation has been on a rising trend ever since 1978. That, again, is unarguable. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxation is at record levels. That is unarguable. It was at record levels even before the present Budget, which increased income taxes for wage and salary earners by an astonishing 22 per cent. Not only is the aggregate level of taxation as a proportion of GDP higher than it has ever been before but also the burden of taxation has been shifted during the lifetime of this Government, unjustly and inequitably, on to wage and salary earners, in particular those at the lower end of the employment spectrum. This has, as the foreshadowed amendment states, 'accentuated inequity and division in society'. In addition, interest rates, as everyone knows, are not just at record levels but are above any level previously recorded by the order of 3 per cent, 4 per cent or, in some cases, 5 per cent or 6 per cent, depending on what type of interest we are talking about. Interest rates are higher by up to 6 per cent than they have ever been. Everyone who is paying off a housing loan, for example, is well aware of the consequences of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The third clause of the amendment which I shall be moving states that a completely new economic strategy is required. That strategy, if it is to succeed , must incorporate a social consensus, an agreement, about prices and incomes. Senator Siddons said recently that the unions will not forgo their right to bargain collectively as individual unions. I do not believe that that is entirely true. Certainly they will not forgo that right under the present Government; and, given the record of this Government, there is no reason that they should. But there are, to say the least, encouraging signs that Australia's largest union, and one of its strongest unions, the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union, is willing to accept a prices and incomes policy which entails forgoing the right to bargaining on an individual union basis provided that it is part of the sort of package which will be offered by a Labor government. Such a package, of course, will not be offered by the Fraser Government, for purely doctrinal reasons and, even if it were offered, it would not be accepted by the union movement or by the public in general for the very good reason that the Fraser Government is not trusted-and nor should it be trusted. </PARA>
<PARA> In those countries of the world which have performed very well since the mid- 1970s, in contrast with Australia-those countries which have maintained consistently lower rates of inflation, consistently higher rates of economic growth and consistently lower rates of unemployment-the common denominator is an effective prices and incomes policy, whether it is called that or not. Those countries-and there are not just one or two of them-include, among others, Japan , West Germany, major industrial powers, and smaller countries, comparable roughly with Australia, such as Austria, Sweden, the Netherlands and Norway. All of those countries have out-performed Australia since the mid-1970s, and of course the other countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as a whole, on average, have out-performed Australia since the mid- 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> The leaders, the bright pupils in the OECD class, as opposed to the class dunce who has now promoted himself to lecturer, all have effective prices and incomes policies. It would be surprising, to say the least, if there were not a lesson in that empirical fact which is worth heeding. I do not believe, and the Labor Party does not believe, that Australia can emulate and match the performance of those bright pupils in the OECD class such as Austria, West Germany, the northern European democracies and Japan unless we have an effective prices and incomes policy. Given the very limited coercive power in this area of a national government, apart from anything else, it is unlikely, to say the least, that a consensus will be achieved about a prices and incomes policy unless the Government has a considerable amount of moral authority-and of moral authority this Government is bereft, and justifiably so. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one other rather more technical point. It is correct that for reasons that are quite beyond the control of an Australian government-the major reason in question being the geological fact that in Australia there are large and accessible deposits of high grade coal and of many other minerals-Australia has been very well placed in the last couple of years to supply what was the then growing demand from overseas, particularly for an energy alternative to oil. For that reason, Australia's rate of economic growth in 1981 appears to have been higher than the OECD average for the first time since 1975, for the first time since the Fraser Government came to office and for the first time since the last Labor Government went out of office. </PARA>
<PARA> The point there is that, when the Labor Government was last in office in 1975, Australia's real gross domestic product growth rate was above the OECD average. It appears again to have been above the OECD average in 1981-althought the figures are tentative. I think that it was also above that average in 1979, but I do not have all the figures before me. Because of this, the Fraser Government, with its customary modesty-exhibited again by the Prime Minister when he describes his blueprint for economic recovery as unexpected, bold and imaginative-sticking to that sort of modesty for which it has become noted, has been claiming kudos for what was, by its standards, an apparent high rate of growth in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to refer to figures that came out in the quarterly estimates of national income and expenditure for the December quarter of 1981. In case anyone wants to look them up, the Australian Bureau of Statistics catalogue number is 52060. They came out last week or the week before. As the document itself states : Some care should be taken in interpreting the recorded non-farm gross domestic product growth rate in calendar year 1981, firstly because all such measurements are subject to sometimes quite large statistical revisions, but, more importantly in this case, because, conventionally, the estimates of growth are derived from income-based data. National income may be measured by summing income or by summing expenditure, or by summing expenditure plus savings. Conceptually those two things are identical; but, because of inadequacies in the data which is available, those two conceptually identical measurements are in fact never quite identical. The convention is that the difference between the two, which statisticians' jargon dubs the statistical discrepancy, is recorded on the expenditure side of those conceptually identical totals rather than on the income side. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of all this to the interpretation of these quarterly estimates of national income and expenditure is that the growth rate shown on the income- based data, which is the one that is usually looked at-I stress that that is for purely arbitrary reasons, and that is not intended as a criticism, because one must make a choice whether to use one or the other-shows a non-farm growth rate of 4 per cent, whereas on the expenditure-based data the growth rate is only 2.5 per cent. It is probable that the actual figure, as ultimately revised, will fall somewhere between those two figures but at this stage it would be reckless, to say the least, to assert unequivocally, dogmatically, that the 4 per cent figure shown for non-farm gross domestic product in the income based figures is accurate. It would be almost as reckless to assert that as it was for Senator Carrick to assert in the run-up to the 1980 Federal election that Rundle would be producing 200,000 barrels of oil a day by 1990, which everyone now knows to be arrant nonsense. I guess that nobody would be more aware of the fact that it was arrant nonsense than those people who bought all those Rundle shares at prices four times their current value. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating cognately, at the request of the Government, Appropriation Bills (Nos 3 and 4) and Supply Bills ( Nos 1 and 2). Although these Bills are routine pieces of legislation they are very important.

These Bills are essential to that happening. But clearly, as my colleague Senator Evans has recently stated, these Bills are survival Bills. Their passage is undeniably crucial to the Government continuing to govern and thus, like the Loan Bill which prevents Consolidated Revenue from going into the red, they must be passed without delay.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8R7">Senator SIDDONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our foreshadowed amendment seeks to point out the deficiencies in the Government's economic management and underlines our attitudes as to what should happen if the economy is to be revived. We believe that there are four key areas of economic management which the Government urgently needs to address. They are: Firstly, that the economy should be selectively stimulated; secondly, that a fair and just prices and incomes policy has to be introduced; thirdly, that we must institute a process of national indicative planning; and fourthly, that we need to encourage industrial democracy so that our industries can be built on a sound foundation and industrial relations can become an economic tool rather than the blunt instrument it is at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before turning to this theme and our foreshadowed amendment, I would like to make a few observations about the contents of the Bills and their purposes. Appropriation Bills (Nos 3 and 4) are parallel Bills to Appropriation Bills (Nos 1 and 2) which were passed last year and implemented with the Budget. Essentially, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) appropriates money for the ordinary annual services of the Government and thus, under the terms of the 1965 compact, can only be rejected or passed by the Senate but not amended. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) could be amended but under section 53 of the Constitution it may not be amended to increase the burden on the people. Supply Bills (Nos 1 and 2) are similarly arranged. The Appropriation Bills are needed, in the words of the Treasurer, Mr Howard, 'to meet essential and unavoidable expenditure for which provision was not made in the earlier Appropriation Acts'. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed additional expenditure in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) totals $740. 4m. It includes $409m for wage and salary costs, money for the Australian Broadcasting Commission, initial payments on the Invincible and the funding of the Community Youth Support Scheme. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) includes funds payable to former lessees of two Northern Territory pastoral leases which were compulsorily acquired by the Government, money for several capital works projects and a $25m increase in the subscribed capital of Qantas Airways Ltd. Supply Bills (Nos 1 and 2) seek interim appropriations for the services of the Government for the period 1 July 1982 to 30 November 1982, by which date it is expected that Appropriation Bills (Nos 1 and 2) 1982-83 and the Appropriation Bill for the Parliament, forming part of the 1982-83 Budget, will have been enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most significant elements in the appropriations sought under these Bills is that for the wage and salary increases which the Government claims were not foreseen. As I have said previously when I have spoken on this matter, the Government, at the time the Budget was framed, could reasonably be expected to have foreseen these sorts of increases. The Democrats are alarmed by aspects of the Coldham report into Defence Force pay and particularly the lack of a formula by which future rises can be calculated. The members of the Defence Force deserve to be appropriately paid for their services and, most importantly, they also deserve better living conditions. But the Parliament must have some idea of what personnel costs are likely to be in the future. The Democrats do not have any confidence at this stage that the Government is able to foresee those costs.</PARA>
<PARA> I would now like to make a few brief remarks about the state of the economy which this Government quite obviously has failed to manage properly for the last six years. The Australian economy is in the worst state it has been in since the Great Depression. To be charitable, international circumstances have not made economic management easy and the slide towards a depression in the United States has not helped. Despite this the Government has not seen fit to change its policies. Even Professor Milton Friedman, the father of monetarism and a modern advocator of small government and generally conservative economic management, only recently stated that deficits, so long as they are not excessive, are okay. They are satisfactory and are a reasonable approach to economic management. In spite of Professor Friedman's making this recent claim, this Government has persisted with an ultraconservative approach to monetary control and monetary management. Sadly, the results of the Government's exessses are very obvious. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first time in a generation we have a government which is not committed to full employment and which has repeatedly shown itself to be uninterested and unconcerned at hardships that the lack of full employment are causing in the community. A great British economist more than 50 years ago said that conservatives are to be condemned by their ideology to inflict misery on people. This Government and its ideological brethren in the United States, Great Britain and other countries have shown the truth of this. Recently Senator Button referred to the fact that the standard of living of Australians has fallen in the last few years in comparison with most other advanced countries and that we are now only fifteenth on the list and are well behind other countries such as Sweden, Switzerland, West Germany and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, the Australian Democrats believe that there are four basic key areas to economic renewal. Let me briefly outline the sorts of policies that we would like to see the Government adopt. Firstly, we believe that the Government must selectively stimulate the economy. There are so many unused resources, both human and material, but particularly human, that unless we change our approach and utilise the unused resources we will never solve the problem of inflation. At the moment the economy is operating very inefficiently. Unemployment ensures that. The fact that our industries are operating in many cases at half their planned capacity again adds a great cost burden to the economy as a whole. Unemployment must be eliminated if the economy is to operate efficiently and if that cost factor is to be eliminated from the cost push inflation which is the case at the moment. If we did have full employment the multiplier effect would have a most positive reaction on the community. This selective stimulation of the economy, as we see it, would be the first priority of government economic management. Housing-to name just one area-cries out for stimulation. Recently the Treasurer said that Australians are overhoused. We believe that Australians are entitled to housing and the assurances that they have reasonable dignity and comfort. During the life of this Government expenditure on housing has fallen from 3.9 per cent of the Budget to less than one per cent. Real expenditure fell 70 per cent between 1974-75 and 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA> The second key area, as we see it, is national indicative planning. I have spoken in this chamber many times on the importance of this. I am delighted to see that the Australian Jaycees, which is a totally non-political organisation, has recently sponsored a book entitled Challenge to Australia which looks to the need for planning. Three of Australia's most distinguished sons, Sir Barton Pope , Sir Macfarlane Burnet and Sir Mark Oliphant, agree with me and with the Democrats on the vital need for long term planning. This is very heartwarming to us. I hope that the Government will take note of what the community and the Democrats are saying and have repeatedly said. I was most disappointed, nevertheless, that the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Sir John Carrick, made clear recently that the Government does not see the necessity for the establishment of any basic long term planning agency. Apparently the Minister is content to continue with the laissez faire approach to economic management which, I am afraid, has been symptomatic of the Government's approach since it came to power six years ago.</PARA>
<PARA> The third basic key area to economic recovery is the need for an effective and just prices and incomes policy. I did comment on that to some degree earlier so I will not elaborate except to make the point that Bob Hawke, some two years ago , I think at the Australian Labor Party's national convention, made it clear that he considered the Government and the Labor Party should again attempt to change our Constitution, by way of a referendum, which would allow the Government to fix prices and incomes for a period. That would allow the Federal Government to move into this area. As we see it this is still vitally important. The problems of changing the constitution are not minimised as far as the Democrats are concerned. But that is no excuse for not trying. I believe that there has to be a concerted effort to get the States and all political parties to agree that the Federal Government does need this vital power if it is to effectively control the economy. In the meantime, urgent steps should be taken to get a social compact-call it what you will-or some agreement that, for a short period at least, will place a freeze on prices and incomes. We need a circuit breaker to stop this great spiral of inflation and the expectation of ever increasing prices and costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, and I believe most importantly, the fourth key area to economic management would be the introduction of industrial democracy in this country. It is vital that we use industrial relations as a tool to economic management. We will not solve unemployment until we can see a revitalisation of our manufacturing industries. It is vital that this rebuilding of our manufacturing industries be based on a firm foundation. That foundation has to be based on a partnership, a genuine collaboration, between the interests of labour and capital. This can only be done by embracing the principles of industrial democracy. This Senate has already debated and passed an industrial democracy Bill which clearly sets out how this can be done. We put it to the Government that the passing of this Bill in the lower House is now urgent if we are to build our industries on a firm foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to say what I said earlier-that is, how welcome it is that Mr Macphee has entered the troubled area of the industrial relations portfolio. We are hopeful that he will recognise that industrial relations can be used as a tool to economic management and that he will prevail upon the Government to adopt this approach. Just as the marriage laws cannot force spouses to sleep together, our industrial relations laws cannot force people to work together. That is basic and fundamental. In this country we must develop an environment in which people will work happily together, in which there is a partnership between the essential factors of production, labour and capital.This happens in other countries. For the Government to smile and to suggest that what we propose is pie in the sky, or mere dreaming, is to ignore the reality in so many enlightened countries. The sooner that the Government realises that people are free agents, that their co-operation must be sought, the sooner we will have a better Australia, the sooner we will have made a start towards solving our critical problems in economic management. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I compliment my friend and Australian Democrat colleague, Senator Siddons, on his thoughtful contribution to the debate. The Senate is debating a series of measures-Supply Bill (No. 1), Supply Bill (No. 2), Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). These Bills, which the Parliament is asked to pass, provide funds as a part of the Government's economic strategy. Therefore, at this stage it is proper to examine the Government's appalling economic results. Of course, these Bills will be passed because the Democrats are pledged never to block Supply Bills, which these are, as distinct from Bills which raise revenue or impose taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I propose to comment briefly on one or two aspects of the economy that will be affected by the additional money that today this Senate will vote to the Government. Unemployment presents a worrying scene. It is now admitted as representing 6.3 per cent of the work force, or some 435,000 people, but according to the latest reports of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, another 619,000 unemployed are hidden, or not registered as such. This pushes the total number of people who are available and willing to work, but who do not have a job, close to 15 per cent of the notional work force. Thus, one in every six who are prepared to work are not, for one reason or another, working. One could well say that that is the severest indictment of the Government's economic policies and, as Senator Siddons has said, an appalling waste of our human resources. Sometimes I find it difficult to realise I have been in this Parliament, in one House or another, for some 22 years. When I first came to it, an unbreakable rule, one accepted by members of all political parties, was that if unemployment ever exceeded 1.5 per cent or 2 per cent it would mean the immediate destruction of the government. That was a sort of rule of law, such as that night follows day. If unemployment ever exceeded 2 per cent the government of the day, whether Labor or Liberal, was doomed. Now unemployment is officially admitted to stand at 6.3 per cent and, as I have said, it is really 15 per cent, yet out there in the electorate it hardly seems to be a political question. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party conducted at least one of the last two election campaigns on the basis that unemployment was a big issue. It did so following very expert, and no doubt very expensive, research by the expensive consultants that it, in common with all political parties except the Democrats who cannot afford it, hires to obtain such valuable information. Those surveys that the Labor Party, and I believe also the Liberal Party, conducted indicated that unemployment was the biggest issue in the electorate. The Labor Party quite properly, and if I might say so quite humanely, followed a policy directed at curing unemployment. In the event, unemployment was not the big issue that the pollsters, the expensive consultants, had predicted it was. They were told by people on whose doors they knocked that the biggest issue was unemployment, but quite often people who answer the questions of pollsters at their front doors tell fibs. The sooner political parties and others-whether they are selling a political doctrine, toothpaste or anything else-realise that the fewer will be the mistakes that are made. Clearly a person answering the question 'What do you think is the most important issue in the country's economy today?' being human, will want to impress the pollster. If the pollster presents to that person a series of options-unemployment, interest rates, social service benefits, housing loans and so on-he or she is bound to say 'unemployment' because he or she wants to appear unselfish, caring, altruistic, Christian and so on; but in the secrecy of the ballot box the real self comes out. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an unhappy comment to make of Australians, but I believe that a great number will say to a pollster at the door, 'I care for the unemployed', but in the secrecy of the ballot box will register the view: 'I do not give a damn about people who are unemployed as long as I have a job. If the present Government'-which happened at the time of the survey to be a Liberal Government- 'is pursuing policies whereby I can get a wage, whereby I can get provision to feed and clothe my family, that will do me. I might say an odd prayer for the unemployed next Sunday if I go to church, but my personal vote will go to the Government that is presently giving me a job'. That illustrates how political feeling has changed in this country since I first came to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember that Les Haylen, a much loved and revered Labor politician, said that anything up to 5 per cent unemployment was inevitable in a capitalistic society. That virtually destroyed for six to nine years the Labor Party's chances of being elected. It was used ruthlessly and very successfully by the Liberal Party of the time under Sir Robert Menzies. People were terrified of unemployment. It was not just unemployment that was a political factor, it was the fear of unemployment. It proved to be a very effective political weapon. Unhappily, today it no longer remains a weapon. Why it does not I leave to people wiser than I am to answer. The fact is that today in this country one in six of those who are prepared, able and willing to work are not working, yet it is not the political dynamite or death knell for the Liberal-National Country Party that it would have been to any party 10 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The same can be said of interest rates, which now are at an all-time high, with most moving rapidly towards 20 per cent. Again, if five years ago any government had presided over an economy in which interest rates were approaching 20 per cent it would have suffered instant dismissal at the ballot box. </PARA>

Ten years ago no government, be it Labor or Liberal, could possibly have survived in such circumstances. In speaking on these Supply Bills I am posing the queston of what has happened to our society. Have we got used to a situation in which we do not care about the other chap? Do we not care about the one in six people who does not have a job and who wants a job? Do we not fear any more? Have we become so fatalistic about the future that we believe that all political parties are the same, that things will not be any better under Labor or whatever? Have the people given politicians away? I do not know the answers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am just pointing to what I believe to be two rather extraordinary political phenomena. As a direct result of high interest rates, the number of people able to commit themselves to the major undertaking of buying a home is diminishing rapidly. Ten years ago the one common denominator in all young Australians, which was pumped into them by their parents, was 'you will have your own precious piece of dirt and you will put your own precious brick veneer dwelling on it'. That was the Australian dream. Every young Australian accepted and embraced that as an ideal. We have seen a change. I do not know that it is necessarily a bad change but a change it is. That dream is now becoming an impossible dream as interest rates continue to soar. This year housing commencements are expected to be no higher than 130,000. That does not mean anything in itself but when I say that that figure is 30,000 short of the level needed to maintain Australia's housing stock, it does mean something. The queues for welfare housing are growing. More than 100,000 families are on the waiting lists nation-wide for welfare housing while the housing industry is underutilised by as much as 20 per cent, in some areas adding significantly to those people unemployed and losing valuable trade skills. </PARA>
<PARA> I have never boasted of being a very bright or very intelligent person. I have an economics and commerce degree but I still cannot understand a situation in which a politician or a group of politicians tells me, as I am being told today, that Australia-wide there are 100,000 families who desperately want cheap homes, that unemployment in the housing industry is something like 20 per cent and that the two cannot be matched and brought together. In other words, we are to have 20 per cent undercapacity in the housing industry and 100,000 families living God knows where under God knows what sorts of conditions. That is another thing that continues to bewilder me. An indication of the worsening situation for self -employed tradesmen and small business people is provided by the 24.7 per cent increase in personal bankruptcies in 1980-81 compared with the previous year. I have heard Government Ministers dispute those figures. I am not a politician who normally cites a lot of figures. An old Jewish friend of mine, a very wise man, used to say to me: 'Chippy, do not quote too many figures because although figures do not lie, liars can figure and everybody realises that'. I very seldom cite figures. But the stark figures are there; among small businesses bankruptcies increased by 25 per cent last year compared with the previous year. I hope I do not malign the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Messner, but he is or was an accountant, a man used to this sort of subject, and I would be obliged if he could explain to me why that phenomenon is taking place and why the Government-allegedly a government that champions free and private enterprise -is not concerned about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has identified rapidly rising wages as one of the factors fuelling cost push inflation, and with some justification. I agree with the Government that a few greedy trade unions sometimes unnecessarily push for abnormal and unfair wage hikes at the expense of the community. There is a saying, which has some truth, that a wage increase for one worker costs the job of another. But, while we concede that increases in wages above productivity do add to inflation-and the Government always seems to blame wage increases for inflation, which sometimes is justified-I never hear a Government Minister or the head of the Treasury, John Stone, a man of remarkable intellect, make a point about interest rates and what they do to inflation. What are interest rates? They are not just something that appears in a savings bank account in June of every year showing how much interest one has earned on one's savings. Interest rates represent the cost of money at any particular time. I ask those people listening to me-I am not talking about honourable senators in the chamber because one could hardly describe the Senate chamber as overflowing at the moment--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The quality is here though, Senator; I will admit to that in a flash. I ask those people listening at home-some 300,000 Australians listen to us at any given time-to look at an object in front of them. I do not mean for them to look at a husband or a wife; I mean some inanimate object like a table or a chair. I ask those people to ask themselves what is the real cost of that table, or this desk in front of me that I have just thumped. The real cost of an item can be measured in several components. Of course, wages are a component of the cost of that item. I do not go to the Marxian extreme and say that wages are the only real cost in that article. If Senator Button, a non-cricketer, will forgive me for a moment and let me pad that away to slips, let us forget the Marxian argument for the moment. While wages do represent part of the cost of the desk, the table or the chair in front of us at the moment, in this day of automation, wages represent only a fraction of the cost of that object, whether it be a desk, a table, a can of beans in the refrigerator or whatever. If I understand my reading correctly, wages represent something like 22 per cent of a product on a national average. So an increase of 10 per cent in wages does not mean that inflation rises automatically by 10 per cent. It means that inflation rises by 10 per cent of 22 per cent. I would have thought that was fairly simple economics. But when we look at the object in front of us, the table or the chair , it has to be financed. The money has to be obtained from a bank or from some other source in order to pay the wages to make it, to buy the raw materials for it, to pay for the power to produce it, the packing to pack it, the transport to take it from the factory to the shop, et cetera. Money is needed to finance the manufacture, distribution and exchange of the object. This is a difficult economic exercise to conclude.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been told by a very distinguished civil servant, an expert in economics, who naturally must remain nameless, this rather startling fact: Every one per cent increase in the rate of interest equals a 25 per cent increase in the level of wages across the board. I repeat that: A one per cent increase in interest rates contributes to inflation in the same way as does a 25 per cent increase in wage rates. What would have happened in this Parliament if this week the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, instead of awarding no increase in wages, had said: 'We will award a 25 per cent increase in wages across the board to all the workers involved'? There would have been a near riot in this Parliament. I suspect that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) would have been sorely tempted to cancel his trip overseas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my judgment he would have resisted the temptation, but only after a severe internal battle with his conscience. A 25 per cent increase in wages awarded by a commission would be regarded by a government as a near catastrophe. How many times have we heard from government sources announcements of an increase of one per cent in interest rates? That is the same thing. Those increases are announced with an air of gay nonchalance and reckless abandon. I ask: Where is the consistency, where is the logic?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not hold to that figure. I was told that figure by a senior civil servant of international standing. I asked the Parliamentary Library to check on the figure. I got a rather disappointing reply. The Library advised that such a comparison was near impossible to calculate because of the massive presumptions one would have to make. It said that, in any case, if it were calculated, because of the presumptions it would be a worthless figure. That was written by a true librarian, I suppose, or a true economist. The Government has great resources at its command. I am not trying to make a political point, but it would be very interesting for those of us who are interested in the economic debate taking place in this country to find out what a one per cent increase in the interest rate represents in terms of the inflation rate and in particular what it represents in terms of an increase in wages. I ask the Minister, if he believes that there is some substance in what I am saying-that is, that an increase in interest rates does contribute to inflation-whether it would be a useful exercise for him to ask Mr John Stone and the Department of the Treasury to provide the Parliament with that figure.</PARA>
<PARA> I, and the Democrats, acknowledge that some trade unions use their muscle to obtain what are euphemistically called 'pace-setting pay increases'. A disgusting exhibition appears on the front pages of this morning's newspapers, about which I cannot comment because of court proceedings. But I say on behalf of the Democrats, people who have respect for law and order in this country, that we all were disgusted by statements made by certain leading union officials today about 'letting gorillas out of cages'. I make no more comment about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats have enormous sympathy for the vast majority of workers who are asking for wage increases and who are simply struggling to catch up with the diminishing real value of their wages. The Government, in its recent industrial relations legislation, did not choose to attack this problem by attempting to reduce living costs. It decided instead to attempt to push through some of the most draconian, unintelligent, stupid industrial relations measures we have ever seen in this country. It seemed to want to contain by brute force what it is could not achieve by economic policy. In doing so it is misusing the industrial relations option. I believe that Senator John Siddons made a significant contribution to economic debate in this country. I join with him in saying that we are thankful that a man of the integrity, compassion, tolerance, intelligence and understanding of Ian Macphee is now Minister for Industrial Relations. He had not been in the job for five minutes before he declared that he wanted to talk with unions and with employers before introducing new measures. He will do that instead of coming into the Parliament with draconian measures to score cheap, nasty political points. </PARA>
<PARA> I was taken with the phrase used by Senator Siddons when he said that industrial relations in this country should be used by Governments as a tool of economic policy rather than as a brutal political weapon. I thought that was a well-chosen phrase. Let us face it, that is one of the few shots left in the Government's locker to try to bring this economy to some sort of order. That is not necessarily a criticism of the Fraser Government because governments throughout the Western world are facing problems. They have tried monetarism, that insane, obsessive product of Freidman and others. It has failed and has been seen to fail. There are few weapons left. One of the weapons which we have not tried is the industrial relations one of consensus, which the Democrats have talked about since we were first elected to this Senate five years ago. The only way to achieve industrial peace and to have some breakthrough in this area is through consultation between the workers, management and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by giving just one example. I pose this because I think it is good to have it on record for listeners to this debate to determine the bona fides of this Government in these difficult times. The recent industrial relations legislation did, among other things, two things: It had regard to what are known as stand-downs and to giving preference to trade unions. I will deal very briefly with each in turn. The Australian Democrats support private enterprise, particularly the small business person. I have been one myself. We know the difficulties that a small business person, whom we admire intensely, suffers when that person employs, say, ten people and, for reasons totally out of his or her control, cannot employ those 10 people usefully because industrial action or a strike somewhere has meant that he or she cannot get raw materials into the factory, shop, or whatever. It is unthinkable that that person who has risked his or her capital, health and family to start a business of his or her own should be forced to keep those workers on if that person cannot get them to do anything useful. So, a stand-down provision is essential. That has been admitted by the Australian Labor Party and by all the trade unions. After many years a solution appeared; namely that unions could apply to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for stand-down provisions to be put into their awards. Many unions have done that. It has worked like a charm. There were some instances of applicants for stand-downs not being heard as expeditiously as possible, so the word 'expeditiously' was written into the legislation in 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> I defy any Government Minister-we have already done this-to produce the name of one employer who can say: 'These stand-down provisions are not working. I, a small business person, cannot stand down my people and have not been able to stand down my people'. There has not been one such employer. Yet into this Parliament, without any explanation, comes a Bill to allow employees to be stood down automatically. It is a return to the infamous days when workers were stood down capriciously by unscrupulous employers. Why did such a provision get through the intelligent people of Cabinet? Why did the Government go against the advice of the Department of Industrial Relations? One wonders sometimes why, with an intelligent Prime Minister such as Mr Fraser and intelligent people in the Cabinet, such stupid legislation gets through. Is it merely for the purposes of provocation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, two amendments are to be moved. The first has been circulated in the name of the Opposition. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the end of the motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) current economic policies have utterly failed to achieve the Government's stated objectives;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) this Bill maintains these disastrous policies, which have depressed economic activity and living standards, increased unemployment, inflation, taxation and interest rates, and accentuated inequity and division in society; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a completely new economic strategy is required to prevent the Australian economy sliding into deeper recession, and to provide any hope of sustained economic recovery'. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak very briefly to the amendment. I say 'briefly' because the issues it covers have been debated in the Senate quite frequently-indeed they were debated this morning. I suppose I have been stimulated to say anything at all only by Senator Chipp's simple speech this afternoon. I hasten to qualify the use of the word 'simple'. I do not mean simple minded, conceptually simple or anything like that. His speech was a very simple statement of some of the issues, which I think is welcome in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall refer to the terms of the amendment to Appropriation Bill (No. 3). I do not think there is any point in reiterating the clear view of the majority of honourable senators that the Government's current economic policies have failed to achieve the Government's stated objectives. It is very difficult to discern what this Government's stated objectives are in regard to the future of this country. It is pretty clear to see what they are when the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is overseas fixing other problems, but in Australia, the stated objectives are sometimes difficult to achieve. One can divine a thread in the last three elections which ran through the stated objectives prior to each one. Prior to each election the stated objectives were put in terms of reducing inflation. In the last three elections which the Fraser Government has fought the reduction of inflation has always been put as the top priority. The objective of reducing unemployment, after the election policies were followed, involved putting inflation first, we agree, but the consequence of those policies has been higher unemployment. Policies relating to improving the growth rate and the economic situation of the average Australian were also enunciated in the last three elections. It is in relation to those sorts of matters that one can, by an exercise of the imagination, put together a grab bag of what one thinks are this Government's stated objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> We say that the stated objectives, insofar as they can be divined, have not been achieved and that the present Bill maintains disastrous policies which have depressed economic activity and living standards and increased unemployment, inflation, taxation and interest rates. I again remind the Senate that Australian living standards have been declining steadily in terms of per capita income sine 1976. Australia has moved from No. 8 to No. 15 in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development hit parade of per capita income since this Government came to power. There has been an enormous increase in the taxation burden on lower paid people in Australia, that is those who have jobs. That increase in taxation on lower paid people has been accompanied by a significant growth in real poverty in Australia stemming from unemployment and a variety of other factors which affect the wellbeing of the average member of this community. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a very real depression of living standards under this Government . From time to time one has been led to believe that that is all necessary in order to deal with inflation. The fact of the matter is that the level of inflation is now higher than it has ever been since this Government came to power; it is, of course, in double figures yet again. Similarly, at the same time there has been increased unemployment. The rate of unemployment in Australia is now higher than it has ever been since the Great Depression. Probably, if the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures of last week are to be believed, nearly one million people in Australia are looking for work or are anxious to have work if it becomes available. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates are the highest that they have ever been. Of course, it has been a Government-stated objective to reduce interest rates. I think it was in the 1977 election campaign when the Prime Minister said that interest rates would fall by 2 per cent. One is able to guess that the lowering of interest rates has been a stated objective of the present Government. Those policies have failed. As I indicated before in connection with taxation, there was a 22 per cent increase in the last Budget on the level of taxation paid by pay-as-you-earn income earners. Those various factors have all accentuated inequity and division in society. Of course, the greatest inequity in the taxation system is this Government's continuing tolerance of tax avoidance. I will digress in a Chipp- like manner. Last week in Melbourne I had lunch with the president of a professional association who told me--</PARA>

That is the circle of friends he keeps and he said: 'I do not know anybody who pays tax'. I will tell Senator Messner, who is trying to interject, afterwards if he likes, who it was and what his profession is. That is the sort of inequity which exists in Australian society where professional people can make remarks like that with some degree of pride although, in his case, with disapproval about that sort of thing. We can have a situation in which only last week the Australian Taxpayers Association said that $7,000m a year is being lost to revenue by having that sort of person in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know. I do not think that would have been dissected. ' Avoision' is the expression being used now. It is a dreadful word. The Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, a royal commission set up to crack a few nuts in the trade union movement , has ended up revealing an enormous industry in this area with billions of dollars flowing through bodgie companies as a result of efforts being made to avoid taxation. That is the sort of society in which we live and that is why we refer to these policies as disastrous. We make the comment that a completely new economic strategy is required to prevent deeper recession and to bring about sustained economic recovery. That is what most Australians, of course, are concerned about now. They are concerned about where this society is going in terms of all those issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> People want to know whether unemployment, which we were told five years ago would disappear as a result of this Government's policies, will disappear or whether it will be here until the year 2000 and beyond. They want to know whether tax avoidance will go on until the end of this century. They want to know whether it will be impossible for Australians to buy houses in the remaining 20 years of this century. They want to know what will happen to interest rates. That, of course, is an associated matter. They want to know about the levels of taxation which this society can expect in the next 10 years or 20 years. They do not want to be promised, as they were promised in 1977, bribes at the next Budget. These are the fundamental issues which concern people and which suggest that this Government has no strategy for sustained economic recovery and no strategy related to the fundamental questions which concern the majority of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats will be moving an amendment to the amendment which I have moved on behalf of the Opposition relating to many of these issues. If I might indulge in commentary on the proposed amendment, I say that I think it is very rarely that the Australian Democrats and the Labor Party agree. Senator Chipp and his Party are always attacking us in this chamber. But on this issue I am moved to observe that the fine minds of the Australian Democrats or the fine mind of the Australian Democrats-I do not want to make people think that they are all like that-and the fine mind of the Opposition, not mine but Senator Walsh's, are in fundamental agreement about some of the issues about which we ought to be concerned. The Democrats' amendment refers again to the importance of having policies for long term economic recovery. Those policies involve an effective and just prices and incomes policy, national indicative planning, selective stimulation of the economy, the encouragement of industrial relations and a recognition that industrial relations is an essential creature of a healthy, viable democracy and an improving economy. All these concepts are, in a sense, wrapped up in the Democrats' proposal. We will be happy to accept and support their amendment because these are the sorts of issues to which this Parliament should be addressing its mind. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we will turn to these events in the course of my remarks. Firstly, we heard from Senator Walsh, at a very early stage in this debate, who referred to other countries doing much better than Australia in terms of economic performance since 1975. I think he specified countries such as West Germany, Austria, some northern European countries and also Japan. It is fairly clear that some of those countries indeed have done surprisingly well over the last six or eight years. There are also many other countries that have done extremely worse than Australia has in the job creation area in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting that Senator Walsh failed to mention countries such as France , the United States of America, the United Kingdom and many other countries of Europe whose affairs have fallen into great states of disrepair over that same period. Why were those countries not mentioned? They were not mentioned because they indulged in the kinds of policies that led to high rates of inflation and to high rates of unemployment. It is clear that Senator Walsh refuses to acknowledge the basic premise which is the essential element of this Government' s policy and which, through the control of inflation, has brought about a turn- around in growth factors in the Australian economy in the last six years. In particular I refer to an item which, I think, is very close to Senator Chipp's heart and that is the job creation role of the Australian economy. I think he would acknowledge that since 1978 there has been an annual rate of growth in jobs in this economy in the order of 2 per cent. I think that during 1979 it hit over 200,000. That kind of growth rate has been produced by the kinds of policies which have been employed by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to some of the specifics which were raised by Senator Siddons in his proposed amendment to the motion for the second reading. He spoke, firstly, of an effective and just prices and incomes policy. Ever since I have been a member of this Parliament and taken an interest in economic affairs people have been talking about prices and incomes policies. No one has come up with any policy that seems capable of working. I was sorry that Senator Siddons was unable to present us today with a formula. The results of the so-called 1974 social compact in the United Kingdom certainly did not demonstrate a great deal of faith on the part of the trade unions in any kind of prices and incomes policy that was employed in that country. I do not know whether Senator Siddons is suggesting that we apply the same kinds of policies that were employed with such disastrous results by the then Labour Government in the United Kingdom or whether he is suggesting some alternative. However that alternative was not forthcoming today. I would appreciate it if, in future, we could deal with some more specific points about that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> National indicative planning was the second item mentioned by Senator Siddons. He assumes it is possible to be able to predict with great certainty the future trends of events not only in this country but also internationally. We know that those kinds of trends are virtually impossible to predict when it comes to assessing long term plans over periods of, I suggest, five to 10 years. Again I presume that Senator Siddons was referring to that kind of time frame. Obviously this is an area of great concern. It is an area in which all nations, all economies, would be seeking to do the best they can in determining the best use of the resources that are at hand, whether they be land, mineral resources, or how people work within an economy to produce goods and services. Those things are all factors associated with production in an economy. It is impossible to plan with any great certainty how those things may be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the third point in Senator Siddons's proposed amendment, selective stimulation of the economy. Again we heard a number of general propositions in this regard but nothing very much in the way of specifics. We heard of one suggestion, stimulation of the housing industry. I think that the Government can take credit for the recent package of housing support announced by it some six or eight weeks ago. Those policies are designed to provide the Australian housing industry with another $400m towards the development and improvement of housing in this country. I think it is also very important to note that currently some 72 per cent of home ownership in this country is in private hands . That is a very significant factor. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has dropped, I believe, very slightly but compared with the longer run figures it is still very significant compared with, say, the 45 per cent rate in the early 1940s. Clearly, the development of private ownership of housing is one of this Government's prime objectives and it will continue to be so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fourth point mentioned by Senator Siddons was 'encouragement of industrial democracy and a recognition that industrial relations should be used as a valuable tool of economic management, rather than a blunt political weapon.' I think all of us would acknowledge that as a very clear statement of the sort of relationship that we all believe should exist between unions and management. It is the kind of relationship which this Government is seeking to foster. I note in particular the Australian Democrats laudatory remarks about the current Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) in this area. However the words 'industrial democracy' do stand out. Again this is one of those expressions which can mean anything to anybody who so--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to acknowledge the honourable senator's point. It is one of those expressions that mean anything to anyone who claims a particular meaning. Senator Siddons has given us the benefit of seeing his Industrial Democracy Bill which is before the Senate. We have a clear idea of what he means by that phrase. However the general proposition in relation to unions and management and the general question of leadership within the industrial economy in this country certainly is one which this Government not only supports but also does, in its own way, employ on a day-to-day basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chipp was very concerned with unemployment. He was particularly concerned about the lack of job growth in this economy and made the point that there could be as many as 15 per cent of the community unemployed. He made the point that people somehow had become switched off to the unemployment issue. I can assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that that is certainly not the position of this Government. This Government is not switched off to the concerns of the unemployed, nor to the essential job of creating more employment in this country. Our commitment to the development of this nation's resources, both human and mineral, is well known to all Australians. For that reason we can believe that people will continue to support the Government in the way that they have in the last six years. They perceive this job making and creating capacity as one of the first intentions and first policies and priorities of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chipp also referred to high interest rates. He sought explanations as to how higher interest rates would lead to beneficial effects in the economy. I think that sums up the honourable senator's expression. It is difficult to debate issues of money supply and rates of growth in the economy in a very short period because the subjects are fairly complex. However, I think I can make one or two points. Although interest does feed into the overall cost structure of business, and consequently in due course, given time lags, reflects itself in the rate of inflation in any economy, the point is that more direct control over inflation can be exercised by a government through control of the money supply. One of the factors that do flow from that kind of control, which has been very tightly exercised by this Government since 1976, is problems with interest rates . By controlling the supply of money, by ensuring that that rate is kept to a minimum, we can ensure that the rate of inflation is kept at the lowest level possible within the circumstances applicable. This subject would demand a longer argument than we can devote at this time but that essentially is the point in relation to inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the next point of equal importance and certainly very significant, was not mentioned by any speaker during this debate. That point concerns the external effect upon our interest rate structure in this country over the last few years. We have a situation where if we pay no regard to the competitive international money market scene and allow our interest rates to be significantly below those of overseas countries we will find ourselves in a situation of capital outflow to other countries in such a way as to lead to a depletion of the availability of capital for housing, small business, resource development, or whatever, within the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that has significant ramifications for the value of the dollar. Such a situation would be detrimental in the longer term effects on the fundamental issue of inflation. Of course, the point is that if a currency decreases in value the effects of that in due course are inflationary. That has been well understood by economists for a great number of years. For those reasons the maintenance of a healthy balance of payments situation overseas depends on the kind of interest rate structure that we have in this country being competitive with those of other nations. I will turn quickly to the Opposition's amendment in relation to the second reading of the Bills. Firstly, the Opposition seeks to add to the motion the statement that:</PARA>
<PARA> Current economic policies have utterly failed to achieve the Government's stated objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>It is clear to me-I hope that in their most objective moments it would be clear to Senator Button and to Senator Walsh-that during the last six years there has been a significant growth in the number of jobs in this country. Employment has grown very substantially over that time and in general terms inflation has been significantly reduced since 1975. There has been an overall approach which has determined, and is still continuing to contribute to, the development of this nation in the longer run. The kinds of conditions being set by this Government in relation to the inflation rate of this country and in relation to employment growth are setting the climate for future development. It is that which we seek to do. The second point raised in the amendment is that the Bill in some way maintains the disastrous policies-as the Opposition calls them-and claims that these have depressed economic activity and living standards, increased unemployment, inflation, taxation and interest rates, and so on. Of course, the point is that the very reverse is true in many cases. In fact economic activity has grown over the last six years. In fact more jobs have been created in that period. Even in this last financial year there has been a growth rate in gross domestic product of over 5 per cent in real terms. That demonstrates a fairly clear commitment on the part of this Government to improvement of the living standards of Australians. It would be appreciated, even by members of the Opposition, that in fact the growth in economic rates in this country are the only ways by which living standards of all Australians will be improved. It is that productivity which will lead to a wealthier and more prosperous Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point raised by the Opposition touched on the need for a new economic strategy to prevent the Australian economy sliding into deeper recession. It was quite clear that neither Senator Walsh nor Senator Button was able to produce evidence that demonstrated that in fact this economy was sliding into deeper recession. In fact they have been unable to do so in the light of the most recently published statistics. Clearly, the statistic I just cited of 5 per cent growth rate for the year ended December 1981 demonstrates that. In fact we are still seeing a rate of job creation in this country as well. As to the forlorn and hopeless statement included in the last part of the amendment in which the Opposition stated that we will never have any hope of sustained economic recovery unless we have a new economic strategy that, of course, is totally unsupported by any arguments it has put forward during the debate. For all those reasons the Government rejects the amendments put forward by the Opposition and by the Democrats. I wish the Bills a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak very briefly in response to a couple of things which the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Senator Messner) said and did not say in responding to the second reading debate. I will speak briefly to the amendments to which I have not spoken before and to the Minister's statement on the amendments. The Minister rather deprecated the advocacy of Senator Siddons on an effective and just prices and incomes policy. That was the first prong of a four-pronged amendment moved by Senator Siddons on behalf of the Australian Democrats. The Minister said that since he became a member of parliament he had heard this idea bandied about. In fact, in response to an interjection by Senator Peter Rae that was not worthy of Senator Rae or worthy of the Minister- incidentially, I thank the Minister for his thoughtful response-Senator Peter Rae said that a prices and incomes policy was like motherhood. The Minister was not deprecating motherhood but was using a cynical expression that politicians use to denigrate something that is so obvious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are quite serious that without a prices and incomes policy in this country we are just going down the tube in economic terms. I am not saying it is necessarily the Government's fault but it now has no wages policy whatsoever. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission last week virtually demonstrated that with devastating clarity. The Minister said: 'Okay, a prices and incomes policy might well be a good thing in theory but it does not work.' I just remind the Minister of something that embittered me in the House of Representatives in 1977. I did not know that the Minister was a member of parliament then. In that year Prime Minister Fraser had very cleverly conceived the idea of a prices and incomes policy, if the Minister remembers. He had persuaded the employers to accept a prices policy. That was an incredibly difficult task in itself. I do not know how the Prime Minister did it but he did. He got the employers to agree on restraining prices. Prime Minister Fraser achieved an even greater miracle in 1977. He got every one of the six State Governments to agree to a prices and wages policy. These governments were both Labor and Liberal. Knowing how they regarded their precious State rights they said: 'We will co-operate.' I was sitting on the cross benches at the time. I had resigned from the Liberal Party. I was looking at Prime Minister Fraser with some sense of approbation. I do not do that too often as the Minister would appreciate in a flash. That is what the Prime Minister achieved. All he had to do to wrap up the package was to get the unions into the deal. He had the employers, the States and the Commonwealth. All he needed to do was to get the employees, the trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time Mr Bob Hawke, then President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, had come to Canberra especially for the big conference which was to be held on a certain afternoon. Mr Hawke had been making conciliatory, helpful, hopeful noises about the conference and about the concept of an incomes and prices policy and a wages policy. Unless I am mistaken Mr Hawke still holds very strongly the view that this is the only way in which we can get a sensible economic policy in this country. That day in the House of Representatives when Mr Hawke was sitting in the gallery Prime Minister Fraser engineered a Dorothy Dixer. I will never forget it as long as I live. By denigration, by personal abuse-which included saying that Mr Hawke was not a man to be trusted, that his word could not be relied upon, that he was a coward-Mr Fraser in answer to a Dorothy Dixer in the Parliament there and then on the floor of the House totally destroyed any chance of a rapprochement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My friend Senator Mulvihill remembers the occasion. I think anyone with any sensitivity who talks about prices and incomes will remember that. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Messner, might well say that this is pie in the sky. But it is not. In 1977 we were so close to achieving a prices and incomes policy and a wages policy in this country. It was devastating to see the chance just flushed down the plughole for cheap political purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister mentioned the matter of industrial relations. I do not want to tread unnecessarily on a matter that I know the Australian Labor Party finds delicate. Senator Crichton-Browne asked the Minister for Social Security ( Senator Chaney), who represents the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, a question this morning about the Builders Labourers Federation. Senator Chaney's answer-a most responsible answer in difficult, delicate circumstances-I believe cleverly yet clearly spelt out the disgust that the Government felt about certain statements of union officials which were printed in the newspaper this morning. We have not heard a statement from the Country Party. I, as Leader of the Australian Democrats, made a statement in my speech a few moments ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We may come to a stage-you will have to watch me here, Mr Acting Deputy President, because I know that there is an appeal before a court; I will steer well clear of that-where a court of this land brings down a duly considered decision on a certain matter and in response to that union officials outside that court action, so I am safe in my remarks not being sub judice at the moment , but of the same union say: 'That is it. We will bring chaos to this country now. We will employ the guerrilla tactics that we are very good at using. We will let a gorilla out of the cage that can cause absolute havoc throughout this country'. If that sort of attitude at these crossroads that we are facing now is allowed to persevere the decent people in the trade union movement, some of whom we heard on AM this morning-people like Cliff Dolan of the ACTU-will be submerged into oblivion and anarchy and chaos will take over in this country. Representatives of two political parties made that sort of statement. I know the difficulties in which the Labor Party finds itself now. I would have thought that if the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Button, could find his way clear to make a careful statement setting out the attitude of the Labor Party to this disgraceful episode reported in this morning's Press for once we could have a bipartisan attitude towards a certain situation in this country which could only help the forces of moderation to prevail. This could only help to assist the legitimate trade union movement in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Minister mentioned that the Government is interested in the control of inflation through the money supply. Some say that if we want to control inflation we should control the money supply according to Friedman and his colleague Paul Samuelson-probably two of the most overrated economists ever to have been mentioned in any sort of history book. Their policies, I would have thought, are now totally discredited. But this Government, together with the Thatcher Government and the Reagan Government, continues to espouse and embrace their policies. I remind the Minister that even those economists are now abrogating their stand. According to both Milton Friedman and Paul Samuelson deficit funding is losing its dirty tag. We find them moving away from their purist line. In all seriousness I asked the Minister to consult his advisers and to inform the Senate of ways to equate a one per cent rise in interest rates with a rise in wages. I would not have thought that that is an impossible--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the report be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA>I speak very briefly to outline the report. The history is that last year the Government's Review of Commonwealth Functions decided, amongst a great number of other things, that there should be a 50 per cent recovery of inspection charges for a variety of export industries where those inspection charges were to be made to recover the estimate of the cost of provision of those services. The areas to be covered-it was decided earlier to include the meat industry and others-were to include dairy products, edible oils, eggs and honey. Considerable concern was expressed in the honey industry, which is a very small export industry, which led to the Senate referring this Bill, which would have put the charges into effect, to the Senate Standing Committee. It was a very interesting example of the way in which a Senate Committee can operate. </PARA>
<PARA> We found as we received submissions from the industry the unanimous view that it would very seriously and detrimentally affect the profitability and future viability of that industry. We also found as we examined the matter further that in fact the export inspection service was not required; that whereas there had been a period when it was necessary for the purposes of international trade to provide a certification of the unadulterated, true to label nature of the Australian honey, this was no longer required within the existing trade. Some countries had required special certificates and we found as we investigated further that that was no longer required either. It boiled down to the fact that a whole inspection service has been providing a certification at a substantial cost to the taxpayer. It was proposed that half of that cost be paid by the industry itself. It was found that certification was not required by the industry nor by the importers in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason that, having discussed the matter with a wide cross- section of the industry and with the Department of Primary Industry, the Committee has now recommended to the Senate, in the report that I have just tabled, that this inspection scheme should be abandoned, that the Honey (Export Inspection Charge) Bill should not be proceeded with and that in substitution there be a system whereby a would-be exporter, for the purposes of developing or expanding his trade with any country that requires certification by the Australian Government of an analysis of an export having been made, can have a sample of the exports inspected by a registered laboratory in Australia. The Department of Primary Industry, on receiving the analysis from that registered laboratory, would then issue the export certificate in the event that it was needed. That would mean that the exporter would pay the cost that resulted directly from that inspection, that no overall apparatus and system would be necessary to provide an unnecessary service-</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator PETER RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a matter which honourable senators may wish to pursue , but we are reporting on the Committee's findings. The further points we make are that if it is desired to have some random sampling system to ensure that Australia's reputation as an exporter is preserved, it would be possible to do that by an occasional random sampling from the small number of exporters involved. I emphasise that only a very small number of exporters in Australia are involved in the industry anyway. This is an industry which ought to be able to be controlled reasonably effectively. Honey is not really like meat. It is a bit hard to use kangaroos instead of bees for honey, as it were. We believe that the whole system does not need to be as it is at present, that this will suit the industry, that it will save the industry money, that it will suit the taxpayer because it will save him a considerable amount of money and that it will ensure that Australia's overseas trade is not adversely affected in any way . We therefore make the recommendation that the Bill be not proceeded with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also the Committee's suggestion that when the Honey (Export Inspection Charge) Bill 1982 is restored to the Notice Paper for the convenience of the Senate, the second reading debate on the Bill and the motion for the adoption of the Committee's report should take place at the same time. While the debate would be a cognate debate, the questions for the adoption of the Committee's report and the second reading of the Bill would, of course, be put separately. The report has been presented at the time that it had to be presented, which is today. It is for the Government to determine when it wishes, in the conduct of Government business, to restore the Bill to the Notice Paper. My suggestion and the Committee's suggestion is that that be not before tomorrow, so that honourable senators will have a chance to read the Committee's report before the matters are debated in this chamber. To enable that procedure to take place, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

I congratulate the Chairman and his Committee, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, on the work they have done. What is incomprehensible, however, is that the Government could have introduced into this chamber a Bill to increase a levy when in fact, in a short period, a Senate committee was able to discover not only that the increase was not necessary but also that the entire Bill was not necessary. I think that when we again debate this issue, the Government must report to the Senate on how such an extraordinary situation could ever have occurred; that this chamber could have been presented with a Bill to impose on an industry a charge that was not even needed. The Government has an enormous amount to answer for in terms of the departmental advice that it has been given on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent such senators as are members of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts attending meetings of such Committee during the current sittings of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I move the motion with some hesitation, because the Senate is strongly of the opinion that committees should not meet while the Senate is meeting. However, the extended sittings of the Senate have seriously disrupted the work of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and its program. Since there are very important references before the Committee I believe that, in this instance and for these limited reasons, the motion should be supported. I reiterate the concern of the honourable senators who are members of the Public Accounts Committee that the Committee finds it necessary to intrude upon their program within the Senate. Three senators are members of the Public Accounts Committee- Senator Lajovic, Senator Watson and me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a number of matters to which I want to direct attention. The first relates to the former Department of Business and Consumer Affairs which, as I interpret the situation, was responsible for controlling imports and exports of wildlife. I refer to a recent and pending prosecution in Sydney of people who endeavoured to export Australian birds. Following the publication of an article in one major Sydney newspaper the presiding judge decided that the article might prejudice the defendants being given a fair trial. I do not quarrel with his decision which was almost on a parallel with the Harry Miller trial but on a different basis. I would like some assurance from the responsible Minister that the prosecutions involving Messrs Volkman, Stein, Opperman and Lowe, who were charged with illegally seeking to export Australian birds, will be restarted so that these people will not get off the hook.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter I want to deal with relates to Australian Government policy on the legitimate export of Australian wildlife. In respect of this matter I am indebted to Marjorie Wilson of the Kangaroo Protection Co-operative Ltd for her advice. The Committee will be aware that a number of overseas zoos are permitted to import our wildlife. I have received a list of the zoos to which we have permitted wildlife exports. I do not object to the domicile countries but there is a contradiction to which the Kangaroo Protection Co-operative has drawn my attention. I refer to an article in the World Wildlife Fund Australia ' Newsletter' stating that a grant of $23,000 had been made for a project known as 'Yellow-footed rock wallaby-a population survey in South Australia'. I wonder how we can reconcile the need to protect a rare species with a letter by the previous Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Moore, which stated that we had permitted the export of some rock wallabies. I have not previously objected when the species involved has been in abundance but there does seem to be some contradiction in terms of policy. China has always been conservative in its decisions when it comes to foreign governments which seek to import some of that country's pandas. I would like information on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to deal with another matter in anticipation of a response from the responsible Minister. This matter was dealt with at the Estimates committee level. A sharp distinction was drawn on the responsibility for the certificate issued by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service as to the condition of an animal or bird that is being exported. I feel that the question of the chain of command merits specific answers on the matters that I have raised. Mr Chairman, I am in your hands as to whether you want me to confine my remarks to that section of the Estimates relating to the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs or whether you are quite happy for me to raise matter relating to the Department of Industrial Relations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, the latter reference gives me the green light to proceed. I again refer the Committee to a discussion at the Estimates committee level in relation to the Department of Industrial Relations. I raised the issue of the role of the Commonwealth Government, through the Industrial Relations portfolio, on crane operations safety. I raised this matter previously when Mr Street and Mr Viner occupied this portfolio. I want to make my position perfectly clear on the matter of industrial safety. I know that all the various State governments have their basic responsibilities in this area. The position is further complicated on the waterfront because with the advent of larger container equipment the Ministry of Transport plays a role. Notwithstanding that , the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association of Australasia in its journal Engine Driver raised well over 12 months ago the question of some initiative being taken by the Commonwealth Government through its Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer to a letter to me from the Assistant General Secretary of the Association, Mr Vic Fitzgerald. He quoted the comment of Mr Maher of the Department of Industrial Relations who said that the Department ' aimed at co-ordinating those activities for the Commonwealth and encouraging the development and improvement of safety health and welfare at the workplace'. They are very laudable objectives. But they are somewhat blunted by the words in a further paragraph of Mr Fitzgerald's letter which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Hopefully Senator, the new Ministry will heed your pursuance on the question of industrial safe working practices . . . </PARA>
<PARA> . . . although I have received numerous letters from your office keeping this Association informed . . . I have yet to receive one item of correspondence from any Government Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>I simply say this: I have always had a high regard for the new Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, the Honourable Ian Macphee. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the letter from the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen' s Association of Australasia because I think it will be a valuable prompter although I am confident that Mr Macphee will initiate some action in regard to Federal direction on safe working practices for crane operations generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-  E.D.F.A. or other Trade Unions that cover crane drivers, or do you intend having them'? Mr Maher's reply again in part. 'It is something we would certainly take notice of and bring to attention.'</PARA>
<PARA> Hopefully Senator, the reconstructed Ministry will heed your pursuance on the question of industrial safe working practices and have the National Labour Consultative Council take up expeditiously this important issue. </PARA>

In this instance, the Committee found that the Government had, by a secret measure, given an unprecedented benefit to a former member of the Government who had for some time held the highest judicial office in this country, a person to whom, quite coincidentally, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Government owe a great political debt. Of course, that person is former Chief Justice Barwick.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say 'secret' because I think that was precisely the situation. In saying that , I refer to page 218 of the Hansard report of the hearings this session by Estimates Committee A. I asked the question:</PARA>
<PARA> Was there no provision made for this in the initial estimates?</PARA>
<PARA>In that respect I referred to the allocation made for the car charges. Mr Glare, from the Attorney-General's Department, replied:</PARA>
<PARA> At the time we made the original estimate we thought that the car hire would probably be occasional access to the car pool. As it transpired, it has been considerably more than that. When we were part of the way through the year we realised that expenditure was much higher than we anticipated. If it had been a matter of a few thousand dollars we would have absorbed it within the general vote . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That to me is evidence that initially the Government's intention was to conceal the allocation and the benefit given to Sir Garfield Barwick. It was a decision made which was not publicised. It was not announced in any way. The decision was not subject to public scrutiny and it was not gazetted. It is a decision made at that time, we are told, by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequent to that, we have been formally advised by the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, that the decision made was transmitted to Sir Garfield Barwick by the Prime Minister on 6 March 1981, but it was a decision made by Cabinet on 10 February 1981. However, that does not satisfy me at this stage because, to date, only a portion of the facts has been revealed. A letter from the Attorney- General dated 5 May 1982 lists the benefits to which Sir Garfield Barwick would be entitled pursuant to the decision of Cabinet. The benefits are as follows: The use of a car and driver in the home city with access to car pools elsewhere; an office and a telephone; the services of a secretary on a part time basis; and the retention of the services of his tipstaff for a period of six months. That was the decision made by Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> What is curious from the Attorney-General's correspondence is that he went on to say that, subsequent to that decision, Sir Garfield Barwick had been allocated further entitlements. He had been provided with a full time secretary in lieu of a part time secretary for the period immediately following his retirement until 30 June 1981. He was allocated his former tipstaff for a further period of eight days to assist with the relocation of his office. So, what we had initially was a decision of Cabinet which was transmitted to the former Chief Justice. We now have a series of further decisions made with or without the knowledge of Cabinet but definitely without the knowledge of the Australian public to the date of the Estimates Committee hearing and to date. So , there has been a continuing allocation of benefits. As I mentioned earlier, they are benefits of an unprecedented nature. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same correspondence, the Attorney-General quite apologetically went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It has also now been ascertained that Sir Owen Dixon was provided with a car with driver on retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>A previous Chief Justice, on retirement, was provided with a car with a driver but ex-Chief Justice Barwick has had this massive list of public benefits allocated to him. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, ex-Chief Justice Barwick is not a person who is not well known in this place. Not for the least of reasons, his notoriety relates to his activities on 11 November 1975. We can remember that the day preceding 11 November 1975-the day preceding the sacking of the Whitlam Government-it was the advice of Chief Justice Barwick which was quite instrumental towards the sacking of that Government. He saw Sir John Kerr, the then Governor-General, at nine o' clock that morning. He saw him again at lunch time. At four o'clock that afternoon, he advised him what he should do; not what he was able to do, but what he should do. Once again the approach taken by the Chief Justice at the time was of an unprecedented nature and was contrary to the principles of operation of the High Court of Australia and its justices. A former Liberal Minister, who was appointed to the High Court, advised the Governor-General of this country how to sack a government of another political colour. For that, he receives the continuation of an allocation of benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not speak for much longer but, in summing up, I refer to page 4 of our report and the principles that Estimates Committee A has sought to uphold. We maintain that the financial arrangements between the Government and the judiciary of the country should be sanctioned by the Parliament and be totally known and made known within that country to avoid the possibility of a government influencing a judiciary by offering private terms and benefits. What I am saying is that in this instance there was an intention to conceal. One could say that the ex-Chief Justice was caught with his fingers in the till. As a consequence this matter has come out because the Attorney-General's Department had to reveal the facts. It had not intended to do so in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter to which I shall refer quite briefly concerns the supply of information from the Attorney-General's Department but is related to another part of the hearings of Estimates Commitee A. Since being elected as a member of the Senate I have had a running correspondence with the Attorney-General with respect to the provision of information pursuant to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act and pursuant to the power of the Attorney-General under that Act to make the payment of legal aid to persons involved in proceedings under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Initially I wrote to the Attorney-General on 24 August 1981 in respect of one set of procedures. In that correspondence, I asked the Attorney-General to advise me whether any person concerned with a particular proceeding had obtained financial assistance pursuant to section 141A and section 141B of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> On 3 September 1981, I received a very short one paragraph acknowledgement promising a reply in due course. On 1 October, I telegraphed the Attorney- General asking for the information. There was no answer. On 4 December, I did the same thing again and there was no reply. Some time later-in fact, on 22 January this year, almost six months after my request-I received a letter from the Attorney-General. He raised the aspect of confidentiality. He went on to say :</PARA>
<PARA> I am disposed to refuse your request for information-</PARA>
<PARA>this was in relation to a particular case. </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on, quite curiously, to suggest that I would be aware that last year-that is, 1981-for parliamentary purposes he provided an answer to Senate Question on Notice No. 255A, Senate Hansard, 12 June 1981, containing details of successful applications for assistance under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Being quite new in this place and not wanting to break precedent, I looked for that question. I noted that it was asked by Senator Evans. I rephrased the question to accommodate the period with which I was concerned. As a consequence of the hearings, we have received a chart which details the number of applications made for financial assistance and those which were authorised. Since then, even though the chart is purported to represent an interim reply, I have had advice to the effect that it is expected that I should be happy with the extent of it. I am concerned about this. There is a major difference between legal aid that is provided as a matter of course under aid schemes in respect of which publicly known guidelines are implemented and legal aid which the Minister has absolute discretion to provide, or not provide, under section 141A of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. An amount of more than $150,000 was spent, at the will of the Attorney-General, during the period with which I am concerned. The situation becomes much more sinister when one considers the activities of the Government in the industrial relations field, in which it has a dismal record. In the last full financial year, as is proven by its own statistics, those of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, it has not settled one industrial dispute. I believe sincerely that the Government is involved in dividing the trade union movement and festering sores within it. I suspect that its payment of legal aid in this way-payment which it seeks to keep hidden from the public- is one example of its activity in this area. I would like to know why we cannot have this information. Why has there been a change of policy? What has the Government to hide here as well? What concerns me in respect of the two items that I have raised this afternoon is that the Minister involved in both is also responsible for the implementation of the Freedom of Information legislation. No wonder the implementation of that legislation has been deferred time and time again. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Bolkus has raised two items in connection with the Estimates of the Department of the Attorney-General. The position of retired judges, which he mentioned, was referred to by the Committee in its report. As he has stated, the Committee recommended that legislation cover the provision of all services and monetary considerations to judges and retired justices of Commonwealth courts and tribunals. In that connection I would simply say that, of course, the matter will receive the attention of the Government. It will be understood that the question whether services are to be made available to retired members of the judiciary is one for Government consideration and decision. It will be for the Government to determine whether, in line with the recommendation in the report of Estimates Committe A, that should be embodied in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) the matter of his discretion to grant legal aid with a view to obtaining any further information that he may wish to give Senator Bolkus as a result of the correspondence that they have exchanged. If further information is available I am sure that the Attorney-General will ensure that Senator Bolkus is advised accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join my colleague Senator Bolkus in lodging a complaint about the way in which this Government has seen fit to make certain services avialable to the ex-Chief Justice at a cost of $32,000, a sum which, as he pointed out, could well be regarded as a pay-out for services rendered, quite apart from those rendered in his job on the High Court. I refer to services rendered in conjunction with those rendered by the former Governor- General in the course of sacking the Whitlam Government. Senator Bolkus was able to indicate from the report of Estimates Committee A that during the Committee's hearings on the Attorney-General's Department it was revealed that it was costing Australian taxpayers an additional $32,000 a year to provide for the ex- Chief Justice-I do not use titles, so I will merely refer to him as 'Mr Barwick' -over and above what he would receive by way of superannuation. What is not in the report but was revealed in an answer given to me only yesterday is that the ex-Chief Justice's partner in the sacking of the Whitlam Government is also receiving a very great amount of money from the Government. The question concerning this matter was on notice for quite some time. If it had been answered sooner and I had had it when the Estimates Committee was inquiring into another department we might have had a similiar report being presented to the Parliament later. The provision of car transport, telephone, office accommodation and clerical staff to keep the ex-Governor-General in London, cost $32,909 in 1978-79, $55,379 in 1979-80 and $51,670 in 1980-81. If we add that sum to what the ex-Chief Justice is being given we find that the Government has been prepared to pay those two main people involved in the downfall, the sacking , of the Whitlam Government of the order of $87,000 in one year, $65,000 in another and $83,000 in yet another. It is a very costly exercise for the Australian taxpayers. They have to find the money that the Fraser Government pays for services rendered by these people in 1975 to bring about the sacking of the Whitlam Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been pursuing this matter in the Parliament for quite a long time and am very pleased that Estimates Committee A was able to incorporate in its report the figure to which reference has been made. I am also pleased to be able to report to the Senate the figure that was given to me yesterday concerning what this Government is paying to keep the ex-Governor-General in London. Of course, we do not know what other costs the Government has incurred in keeping him in other places. It is a very costly exercise and the taxpayers will be very unhappy to learn, in these times of Government-imposed financial restrictions- down to the lowest paid in the community, the pensioners and the unskilled work force, with the result that many have to live on a mere pittance-that the two men to whom I have referred are receiving, in addition to their superannuation, between $80,000 and $90,000 a year to keep them in a measure of luxury which, in my view, neither deserves. I compliment Senator Bolkus on the speech that he made this afternoon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps the Minister for Finance ( Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) will take two other matters on board. One concerns industrial relations and relates to Question on Notice No. 2126 of which I gave notice on 25 March. It refers to what may be correctly deemed sexual harassment in the work force at Roth Industries, at Liverpool, New South Wales. The female work force of the firm is mainly of Spanish origin. I am concerned that in this supposedly modern age of 1982, with the Industrial Relations Bureau apparatus available, although we are two-thirds of the way through May I have not yet been given a full decision. I use the word full, advisedly because I recollect that an acknowledgment was given that the matter was being probed. However I am a little suspicious because last year I had a very unsettling experience when I brought up a similar case of harassment of women, in that instance in the New South Wales transport industry. Perhaps at the time I was a little harsh on Commissioner Walker. I found out later that the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Viner, did not pass on messages to me because I had the stigma of being an Opposition senator. I know all that has gone with the advent of the new Minister, the Honourable Ian Macphee, but be that as it may I want it recorded that I believe that it is time that I had a full report from the Industrial Relations Bureau about the victimisation of Spanish women in our work force at Roth Industries at Liverpool.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter is a smaller one. I have referred already to the role of the Business and Consumer Affairs ministry in the checking of illegal import or export of wildlife. Apart from what I asked earlier about whether there would be a deferment of the matter in regard to the four people I named, I ask simply whether I could have a score card giving me the names of the people and the fines involved in this nefarious traffic in the last 12 months and whether all the fines have been paid.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question relates to the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department and to legal aid. I am sure that honourable senators will agree that this Parliament, in conjunction with other Australian parliaments, not only has responsibility to make laws which are just and fair but also needs to ensure access to the courts for all those who seek the aid of the courts, whatever their financial situation may be. In order to help discharge that responsibility, the Australian Legal Aid Office was established with flair and with sufficient financial backing by the Whitlam Government in order to ensure that that terrible slogan 'guilty until proved wealthy' should have no place in our Australian society. It is very important that all those who need to appear before a court should be able to have access to our legal system without regard to their disposable income. I am not making a second reading speech although it may sound as though I am trespassing that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I am concerned about is a matter raised for discussion by the Tasmanian Pensioners' Union. It was pointed out that in recent times-this is what I want the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) to confirm for me, if she will be so kind-restrictive criteria have been introduced into the guidelines put into operation by the Australian Legal Aid Office in such a way that with divorce proceedings where no property settlement is involved, there seems to be an absolute rule that no legal aid is available. What I want to have confirmed or rebutted by the Minister is whether indeed there is such an absolute rule rather than some discretionary or rule of thumb system so that those people seeking the aid of the Family Court of Australia and seeking to appear before it can be aided by the legal aid system having proper regard to their actual disposable income. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of pensioners this is particularly important because, in cases where no property settlement is involved, those seeking a divorce nevertheless have to incur certain expenses relating to the lodging of the necessary documents. Perhaps they have to put in an appearance either personally, by counsel or with the aid of counsel which involves an expenditure of money which for pensioners is beyond their meagre means-certainly beyond the small savings which they may be able to put away from time to time. My question is whether for pensioners either some reduction in the fees charged by the Family Court could be negotiated for the lodging of documents and so on or, whether legal aid could be made available to these people, having regard to their actual disposable income, rather than some absolute rule which prevents their access to the legal aid system in such instances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter on the parliamentary appropriations. I am led to understand that the Presiding Officers are currently in the process of ordering parliamentary badges for honourable members and senators. No item appears in the supplementary appropriations but I understand that the order is imminent. I wish to speak very briefly to the Committee today to raise a matter of concern that I have in relation to those badges. Some honourable senators may recall that this issue goes back some years. On 2 May 1978 Senator Young, then a senator and not the President, asked the then President whether it would be possible to have honourable members and senators issued with parliamentary lapel badges as a method of recognition, as is the practice in some parliaments overseas. Any member of parliament who has been to Japan is well aware that the badges worn by members of the Diet as they go about their business identify them as members of the Diet wherever they go in that country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That idea has been raised by other honourable senators from time to time. The matter has been discussed by the Joint House Committee for quite some period; for most of that time I have been a serving member on the Joint House Committee. My very clear recollection of early discussion on this subject in 1978 was that the Committee was to strive to achieve a design for the badges which could be used as a symbol of the Parliament. Quite a lot of time elapsed in consideration of different designs and of what would be appropriate for those badges. In 1981 the Committee was informed, following debate with various people, discussions with Whips and having shown the design to honourable senators and members, that an order was imminent. That was in February 1981. In a casual conversation with an honourable senator on this matter, I showed him the design and gave to a group of honourable senators who were then present the reason for the great delay in getting these badges as being that the Committee was attempting to get a design which would represent the Parliament and which might be of use for other reasons. When I showed one of the honourable senators the design, he pointed out that it could never be used as a symbol of the Australian Parliament . The design was simply a small circular badge with a duco background. It was intended that the background colour be red to symbolise the Senate and green to symbolise the House of Representatives, but with a common design on it which was to be a background of the Southern Cross in gold with the Black Rod and the Mace crossed in front of the Southern Cross. That was to symbolise the two Houses of Parliament, taking the Southern Cross as symbolising Australia. The honourable senator with whom I had this conversation and who said that this could not be used as a symbol of the Australian Parliament, pointed out to me that under the Constitution the law of the land is the business of the House of Representatives , the Senate and the Crown and that we could not have something symbolising the authority of the Parliament if the Crown were not included. I passed on this opinion to the President and, as I understand it, as a result of that the ordering process was halted. An attempt was then made to see whether it was possible to have an alternative design which would achieve the original purpose of the Committee-a purpose that I think had been accepted by honourable members, and certainly by honourable senators with whom I discussed the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore, with some dismay that I learn that it is possible that two quite different badges are about to be ordered-one with the Crown on it, which will be the badge with the red background and one without the Crown on it, which will be the badge with the green background. Some actions have been taken--</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not passing any value judgment on that. People can giggle and laugh but the point is that this Parliament does not have a symbol. There is no design or symbol that represents this Parliament. A large number of other parliaments do have symbols representing them. The badge of the Japanese Diet I referred to is a stylised chrysanthemum which is also the symbol of the Japanese Diet. It is worn with great pride by members of the Diet as a symbol of the institution in which they serve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst individual members might have a view on the value of a constitutional monarchy versus a republic, the fact is the constitutional monarchy is our system of government. A design that does not include that fact and has only symbols of the Senate and the House of Representatives does not represent this Parliament. I do not think for one minute that there is any overwhelming republican sentiment in the House of Representatives. Indeed, I strongly suspect that members of the House of Representatives are sweetly oblivious to the whole thing, that they are unaware that there will be two different badges, so the badges cannot symbolise the Houses of Parliament, and for some reason the House of Representatives does not recognise the Crown as part of the parliamentary process. It disturbs me even more that it could come to this point and that the Houses of Parliament would choose symbols that are so different in their intent as well as in their design. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this matter because, as I said, I understand that orders are about to be placed for these badges. I suspect that in the long run, particularly when many members of the House of Representatives realise what the design on their badge means, there would be a demand for the same design as the design that is to be on the Senate badge. The sad thing is that there is a Senate design and a House of Representatives design. I would have thought that it would be possible for adult men and women to agree on the purposes of the design and to get a common design for both Houses of Parliament. As I have said, I believe the order is about to go in. The badges are to be in 9 carat gold. They will not be inexpensive items. I make a plea that no money be spent on these items-expensive as they will be-until it is quite clear that there is no chance that there will be a demand from members of the House of Representatives for a different badge, one that symbolises what the badges were meant for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter that arose out of Estimates Committee C that is relevant to the Attorney-General's Department. On two occasions I asked why the Queen's Counsel appointed in charge of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union received the salary that he did. We were informed last September that the salary was in the order of $289,200. I questioned, at the time, why it was so high. I was informed that the Department of Administrative Services merely agreed to a suggestion from the Attorney-General's Department. So, probing in that Committee , it was impossible to find out why Mr Costigan was paid that salary. So it is obvious that at this stage of the Estimates debate one has to probe the Attorney -General's Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not content with being paid $289,200, this year Mr Costigan has received an $87 ,900 pay increase for the year, bringing his total salary to $377,100. I think anyone would agree that that is a rather monumental sum for any individual to receive, especially when the Attorney-General's Department recommends it whilst the Government's case to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission was to deny to workers who have had no rise in the last eight months a $25 a week or $1,250 a year increase in income. Yet the Government can give a royal commissioner 50 times that amount. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that Mr Costigan is doing a job that requires a deal of physical courage. I have known him, inside the Australian Labor Party, for many years as a person of integrity. I realise also that one of the reasons that he would seek a pay increase, unlike many of his other legal brethren, is that he uses no tax dodges whatsoever. He pays his full income tax without using any scheme to minimise his tax. One would think that that would be obvious given his comments about tax avoidance in the last report that came out. I want to know from the Attorney-General's Department on what basis one individual was paid $87,000 over and above a salary of $289,000 a year. We could not get that information in Estimates Committee C because the Department of Administrative Services just acts on recommendations of the Attorney-General's Department. Several other QCs have been paid in the vicinity of $240,000 a year for assisting in various inquiries-the meat inquiry and others. I find it amazing that that amount of money is paid to one individual for a year's work. I hope that the Minister can give some indication of on what basis the Attorney-General's Department made that decision. </PARA>

I had come to the happy conclusion that his whole business of badges had died a natural death. I have, at all stages, been opposed to the idea that we go around labelled like members of the Japanese Diet. I have seen them and I realise that they do that and apparently require identification. I think that we are easily identified in this building. Generally speaking, I do not care much for the idea of the carrying of labels and badges and so forth, particularly if they are divisive in any way. It appears that this proposal is divisive. That is the second point that I will come to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the first place I want to assure the Committee that there are members of this chamber-I am one of them-who do not think that it is necessary or desirable for us to waste money on these badges so that we can identify ourselves here and perhaps in the community. Apparently these badges will give us some special privileges. I do not see why we should receive those special privileges. Frankly , I do not think the badges will be identifiable by the Australian people. I do not think that they are given to recognising these sorts of things anyway. They recognise the Returned Services League badge because it is very commonly known, but I do not think that other things that people wear are recognisable by people . </PARA>

Apparently the monarchists in the House of Representatives will have to put up with the Southern Cross on their badge instead. I think that there will probably have to be four badges so that we can identify ourselves as monarchists and republicans-and be more divisive than ever . I urge that this matter be taken back to the drawing board to be looked at again.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My remarks will be brief. One of the points I wish to raise was mentioned by Senator Colston who drew the attention of the Committee to the fact that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) was not in the chamber. In some ways that is disappointing to honourable senators, particularly when we are discussing the additional appropriation of the Attorney-General's Department. I felt it was only fair that the Attorney-General should be present in the chamber. The question I wish to raise is one I would have liked to address to the Attorney-General to try to obtain some answer. It concerns Kenneth Derley, the drug trafficker, who was gaoled for 8 1/2 years and was recently released by the Attorney-General after serving 3 1/2 years in gaol. That seems to me to be rather unfortunate, particularly when we consider that currently we have the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking and certainly a great deal of discussion about a crime commission being set up. People in Australia certainly want to know what is happening, particularly in relation to drug activities. Derley was released after 3 1/2 years. A question about this was posed to the Attorney-General by a newspaper. He reportedly said that he could not give any reason why he was released or why his parole came about at this stage of his gaol sentence because it was a private matter. Whilst I will accept the privacy of the matter, I believe that it is unfortunate for the people of Australia and for this chamber that more detail has not been given .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to the point I raised before concerning the Stewart Royal Commission. Is it aware that he was to be released? Was it notified by the Attorney-General? If so, were his whereabouts given to the Commission? Is it possible for the Commission to have Derley appear before it so that he can talk about his association with Murray Riley and the importation of drugs into Australia? I make an important point which was also made be Senator Colston. It is unreal to discuss these matters when the Minister is not in the chamber. I would be pleased if the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), acting on behalf of the Attorney-General, could give a reasonable explanation as to why he is not here and provide some answer to the questions I raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of the presence in the chamber of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has been raised. At present, the Attorney-General is involved in a telephone hook-up with State ministerial colleagues. There is, as honourable senators know , a National Companies and Securities Commission Ministerial Council, and at present its members are having pre-arranged discussions on the telephone. I think it would be rather difficult for the Attorney-General to leave that discussion at this time. That is the explanation as to why he is not here to deal with questions on this occasion. If the matter raised by Senator Jones is one on which he seeks information, there are other opportunities for him to raise it with the Attorney-General. Perhaps he could seek one of those opportunities at an appropriate time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter raised by Senator Colston, I think, related to the attendance of the Attorney-General. I hope that the explanation I have given is a satisfactory one because whilst we have a program for dealing with this legislation on this day I do not think it is easy to assume that at a certain hour we will deal with the Attorney-General's Department. His pre-arranged discussion with the other Ministers is the reason why he is not able to be here. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other question that was raised concerns the payment made to Mr Costigan, the Royal Commissioner. I am advised that the Crown Solicitor determines the fees paid. I understand that this matter was not raised during the Estimates Committee hearing in respect of the Attorney-General's Department but in respect of the Department of Administrative Services. I have sought information from officers with regard to the $87,000 in question and as soon as there is some information on that matter I will see that the honourable senator is advised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise two matters. The first is the matter raised by Senator Martin in respect of the parliamentary badges. She said in the course of her remarks that quite a few members of the House of Representatives may not be aware of what is taking place. I say again that a lot of members of parliament are not aware of what takes place in regard to decisions taken by the Joint House Committee because no records of the proceedings of that Committee are distributed to members of parliament. Many of them are in the dark. That is why there are many complaints about the Joint House Committee. I have suggested many times in this Parliament that the record of the meetings of the Joint House Committee should be circulated to all honourable senators and honourable members after every meeting.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are distributed to members of the Committee but I am more concerned about all the other people in this Parliament who are not members of the Committee. As I was saying, I have made this plea on many occasions. Every member of parliament should be provided with a transcript of the proceedings of the Joint House Committee so that they are aware of what is taking place. I will not enter into any argument about the wearing of badges. I have no room on my lapel to wear a parliamentary badge because I proudly wear my Australian Labor Party badge wherever I go. I cannot wear two badges but I am happy to wear this one at all times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter to which the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) referred concerns the absence of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack ). My comments are prompted by my colleagues who posed this question. I see no reason why consideration of the Attorney-General's Department could not be postponed until a later hour this day when the Attorney can be present in the chamber to answer those questions which have been posed to him. Although the Minister for Finance said that other means are available to the two honourable senators who posed these questions, there are no means for them to put a follow- up question arising out of the answer the Attorney-General may give, such as happens in Committee of the Whole. </PARA>
<PARA> Often when an honourable senator asks a question of a Minister or of the departmental officers the answer is not satisfactory and opens the way to many more questions. We saw that happen when we were dealing with the appropriations for the cheap housing loans. We had to pursue and pursue and have the matter postponed until after dinner one night when we got the answer we were seeking. I make the suggestion that if the Attorney is held up-of course we know that all Ministers have other duties-the vote to be taken shortly on the Attorney-General 's Department, which involves the amount of $7,179,000, should be postponed until the Attorney is able to attend in the chamber and answer the questions asked by Senator Robert Ray and Senator Jones. I put that question to you, Mr Temporary Chairman, and hope that it can be resolved. </PARA>

The Advance to the Minister for Finance dated March 1982 had, among other things, a special appropriation for Parliament of $ 557,000 which was listed under Appropriation Act (No. 2). I expected to find in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) provision for the appropriation of that amount but it is not there. I have not yet been able-I did not realise this matter would come up so quickly-to look at Appropriation Act (No. 2). The specific item may be in Appropriation Act (No. 2) which of course was passed six months ago.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I now wish to raise with the Attorney-General ( Senator Durack) the matter I raised earlier. It relates to the release of Kenneth Derley, who was serving an 8 1/2-year sentence and was released on parole. I refer to the Attorney-General's statement to the Press that it was a private matter and he could not discuss it. Whilst I accept that statement to some degree because of the matter of privacy, I think it is a pity that some information was not made available in relation to the release of this person, particularly because it is a fairly well known fact that he is an associate of Murray Riley and has had some association with the importation into Australia of a large amount of drugs. The other fact is that we have the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking. The questions I pose are: Was the Commission notified that this person was going to be released; is it aware of where he is; and can he be called as a witness because of his known association with drug pedlars throughout Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

I think the Anoa might have been the name of the vessel on which they brought in drugs. What sort of attempts have been made, or has any advice come from the Attorney-General's office, to notify those people concerned with the investigation into drugs and drug trafficking in Australia to make them aware that this person was released, his whereabouts et cetera, so that if he is required he may be called as a witness?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to an issue raised in the report of Estimates Committee B and to point out to the Senate that there is a recommendation from the Committee that it send a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations relative to the adequacy of the present legislation, administrative authority and procedures as they relate to the territories of Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The Committee also recommended that the Finance and Government Operations Committee be asked to report to the Senate on action necessary to bring financial accountability for Commonwealth funds into conformity with the practices in other Commonwealth departments and semi-government authorities. I am aware that I have to move a motion. When I receive the wording of that motion I shall move it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not intend to canvass all the issues on this subject that arose during the hearings of Estimates Committee B. They are outlined on pages 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the report of Estimates Committee B under the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. I would like to give briefly to the Senate the background of the issue. The Estimates Committee had before it the March 1982 report of the Auditor-General which said a number of very critical things relating to the administration of Christmas Island and to certain weaknesses in internal controls on the accounts and records of the postal and philatelic service for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The criticisms were very lengthy and detailed. The Estimates Committee B report lists the more significant matters referred to by the Auditor-General. The words 'more significant matters' relate to the matters referred to by the Auditor-General in his report on Christmas Island. The Estimates Committee B report also makes a brief summary of criticisms in relation to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. I think it would be accepted that when witnesses come to Estimates committees they are aware that senators take a lively interest in what the Auditor-General has had to say about their departments, particularly if he has been critical. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked questions in the Committee relative to the Auditor-General's criticisms to attempt to ascertain what action, if any, had been taken on those criticisms. I will give a very brief, but I hope, fair summary of what we were told. We were effectively told by witnesses that the administration of these territories was the responsibility of the Minister and that the Department of Home Affairs and Environment could not provide us with information regarding what action might have been taken on the Auditor-General's recommendations because it was not the responsibility of officers of that Department. That seemed to us not terribly satisfactory. It certainly seemed unsatisfactory for the purposes of Estimates committees in attempting to determine what is happening with public funds and how public officials are keeping records of certain matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was concerned at its inability to examine properly the administration of Commonwealth responsibility in these territories. Of particular concern to the Committee was the lack of clear responsibility and authority within the Department of Home Affairs and Environment to supervise effectively the administration of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. Since the Committee reported there have been a number of conversations, some of which I have been involved in, relating to this matter which indicate that it is possible that information in the Hansard record of Estimates Committee B may not be the most reliable basis for the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations to proceed on but undoubtedly that will be brought to the attention of the Committee at the time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might be an appropriate moment to comment on some of the matters raised by Senator Martin . I was present during that Estimates examination and was aware of some of the concerns that she had. I am advised by officers of the Department of Home Affairs and Environment that they accept some of the criticisms and are concerned that the situation should not happen again. Some of the comments made by the Auditor-General were on matters on which they would wish to have had more information. However, there is a history of some subsequent events which the Committee may wish to hear when it comes to consider whether this is a matter which properly should be sent to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. I am perfectly easy about how the Committee determines the matter. Following that Estimates examination, the former Minister for Home Affairs and Environment put the matter under study to determine the significance of the issues which were raised. Officers had answered questions to the best of their ability but it was quite clear that more action would be needed. Letters were subsequently sent by the Minister to the administrators of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands advising them of their responsibilities for the management of financial and administrative operations and trying to set out the proper relationship for the passage of information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Auditor-General has subsequently decided to send a team to the Islands to carry out some further investigations. I understand that the team is either in transit or has arrived today. At this moment something is under way in that area . I am suggesting that this is a considerable advance on the situation that existed at the time the Estimates were considered. It was intended that the Department would send part of its internal audit team-I think along the lines that the Committee may have expected-to carry out similar investigations. But it now seems that that action would be better delayed until the Auditor-General's team has made its investigation and study and has given an appropriate response.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has a capacity to refer this matter as and when it wishes. The Department will not stand in its way and it will not resist such action. However , the question is whether the matter is of sufficient importance, in view of subsequent events and the fact that the Department has taken the Committee criticisms-both at the time of questioning and in the Committee's report- sufficiently seriously to put action in train. It is a question of whether the Committee wishes to proceed to make the reference and whether the Committee on Finance and Government Operations would want to take the reference now. As I say , it is a matter about which we are quite relaxed. We want to see the issues dealt with properly; the Department wants to see the issues dealt with properly. It has taken on board the points made by the Committee and we believe it is now responding in an appropriate fashion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations has far more to do than it is likely to cope with without a great work load on the senators involved and whilst it is in no way seeking any further references, I think I had better indicate that, pending any restructuring of the Senate committee system and to overcome one of the shortcomings in the procedure of the Estimates committees which, because of their periodic nature, do not have a follow-up capacity, the arrangement has been that they should have been able to recommend to the Senate that there be some follow-up procedure. Therefore matters arising which are appropriate to be referred to the Finance and Government Operations Committee are referred for follow-up. It would therefore seem appropriate for the Senate to pass this motion this afternoon bearing in mind what the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) has said. Certainly, the Committee will be only too glad if it turns out that the audit procedures which have been undertaken by the Auditor- General and the departmental steps which have been taken make it unnecessary for the Committee to do more than eventually report to the Senate that steps have been taken with certain results. But if the motion were carried it would seem to me to be not inappropriate, bearing in mind the follow-up system which has been adopted. I hope it will not involve the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations in any great amount of work. Certainly I hope it will not involve members of the Committee in a visit to Cocos (Keeling) Islands.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chairman, I wish to say a few words on the motion. Whatever action is taken, whether the matter goes to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations or whether the action that the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) has said is to be taken is taken, I think there should be some analysis of the method of appointing the administrators. There has been quite a lot of Press publicity recently concerning one of the administrators appointed, I think, to Christmas Island. He is an ex-Government member from the other place who lost his seat at the last election.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point I raise concerns the Department of Education and in particular the Curriculum Development Centre. In April 1981, the Lynch Review of Commonwealth Functions committee recommended that, if State governments were not willing to meet half of CDC's operation costs, the Centre would be abolished. Obviously, the Government undertook consultations with the States during 1981 and the State governments either refused to or were unable to meet the additional costs. On 30 November 1981, the then Federal Minister for Education (Mr Fife) announced that CDC would be replaced by a unit of the Commonwealth Department of Education. In the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette of 11 March 1982, one finds in the 'Orders in Council, Positions created and abolished' section under the heading 'Department of Education, Central Office' a whole range of positions is created from 'Deputy Director' to 'Third Division- Assistant Director' down to 'Typists Grade 1' and 'Attendant (one)'. The offices abolished in the Curriculum Development Centre were almost identical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that the difficulty which arises is in relation to the precise nature of what is happening with the amount of money which may or may not be held by the Curriculum Development Centre in relationship to the Commonwealth of Australia Estimates 1981-82. Here we discover that, as a consequence of the Review of Commonwealth Functions and preparatory to the final determination of the future of the Centre, the CDC estimates for 1981-82 were framed on existing commitments. There seems to be a variation of some $441,000 which represents the difference between the actual expenditure of $2,477,000 and a proposed expenditure of $2,036,000. Of course, at the time the Government maintained that this amount was part of the savings the Centre had managed to acquire. I refer now to the Hansard report of Estimates Committees B, C and D of Monday, 19 April in which a very interesting exchange is reported taking place which, rather than clarifying what actually happened, seeems to make the matter even more confusing . I presume that, when Senator Martin speaks of an amount of $33,000 and everyone else talks about an amount of $333,000, a mistake has been made in the printing. Accounts of money seem to have been bandied around. My concern is with what is precisely the situation. On page 29 of the Hansard report, Mr Morrison said:</PARA>
<PARA> Technically the money is under the control of the council of the Centre and its director. </PARA>
<PARA>That would seem to be correct. In looking at the Curriculum Development Centre Act of 1975, the particular point made in section 37 (1) (a) and (b) would seem to be that it is set down how moneys for that Centre shall be applied. The section states it shall 'only' be:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) in payment or discharge of costs, expenses and other obligations of the Centre under this Act; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) in payment of any remuneration and allowances payable under this Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The point is that the Government, obviously in pursuit of a particular policy decision, has dismantled internally the Curriculum Development Centre. I do not think there is anything to the contrary contained anywhere else. In other words, the Executive has constructed a shell called the Curriculum Development Centre which remains. Of course, the reason why there is a shell left is that the Government knows full well that it would be unable to repeal the Curriculum Development Centre Act of 1975 and presumably, unlike the exercise in relation to fees, has chosen not to waste the Committee's time in debating that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me to be an extraordinary situation when this Parliament creates in a separate Act a particular statutory authority to carry out a range of tasks as set out in that Act and the Executive, by means of operating perfectly legally administratively, is able to circumvent the desires of the Parliament in relation to that. To my way of thinking, it would have been a much more correct and honourable course for the Government to seek to bring before the Parliament a repeal of the Curriculum Development Centre Act. The Parliament would then have pronounced upon that and the Curriculum Development Centre would have continued because the Parliament would not have decreed otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have an extraordinary situation whereby presumably we will have some shell of an operation called a Curriculum Development Centre which in terms of finances will still receive some considerable finances from its extremely successful publications. Of course, this adds irony to the whole rather sorry business because the Curriculum Development Centre has been extraordinarily successful in a whole range of activities for which it has become internationally well known. But now the Curriculum Development Centre has been pronounced by the Government as disfunctional in some way, without any excuse or by-your-leave. That matter apart, the irony of the situation for the Government is that the Curriculum Development Centre in terms of its development and propagation of various curriculum materials throughout Australia and other parts of the world is that it has been able to generate an income for itself. Presumably this income will go into the Curriculum Development Centre which, according to the Act, must be used for the purposes of the Curriculum Development Centre. </PARA>
<PARA> I am seeking information on two things from the Minister. On Tuesday in Question Time, I sought an answer-I am sure the Minister would have the material -as to the precise legal situation in relation to the finances of the Curriculum Development Centre and what the Government proposes to do in terms of these finances going into the Curriculum Development Centre. Is it the intention of the Government to continue with the Curriculum Development Centre Council? Under the terms of the Act there will at least have to be a director and a Curriculum Development Centre because the Act states there 'shall' be. Presumably, according to the Act, that Council will expend the moneys in some way. If that is not the case I would be very interested to hear what precisely the whole setup will turn out to be in this rather sorry exercise of dismantling a very worthwhile innovation of a previous government which, indeed, in educational terms has been lauded internationally. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pity that the Curriculum Development Centre is to be wound down but the decision arose out of the refusal of the States to have any financial role in its support . Because the significance of curriculum development extends into the State systems the Commonwealth asked the States to contribute on a 50 per cent basis to the operations of the Centre. They declined any interest in doing this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think Senator Macklin's analysis, as he set things out, is fairly correct. I will not bore the Committee by going over these things again. Senator Macklin's question really concerns how the shell which he describes will continue to use finances. The Centre has a continuing function, as I advised in Question Time the other day. Materials which it has developed, which it is producing and which are being sold will continue to generate some income. That income can be used to reprint and regenerate that material. That material has a continuing attraction to purchasers. There will be a continuing revolving function for that amount of the money. The Curriculum Development Centre Council can continue to perform that function. I expect that it will continue to produce and sell materials as it is doing now. I think Senator Macklin referred to that activity. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we can divide the money that is to be disposed of: First of all, there is that money which is part of that revolving activity-I have already explained how that will be used-and secondly, I think it is fair to say that once money is appropriated under an appropriation Bill it has to go to the Council and can be used for the purposes of the CDC. I think Senator Macklin is quite correct in drawing that conclusion. No attempt will be made to withdraw that money or to take it back. There may be an argument as to how it is applied. There will have to be an examination at the time the Budget is constructed. That examination, of course, is proceeding. It has not been completed. How the Commonwealth will move to provide moneys for curriculum development activities will be announced on Budget night. The honourable senator is correct that if the CDC remains then it is necessary that it have a legal entity. That would involve having a structure and having a council. I think the honourable senator is quite correct in asserting that. Appropriate steps are being taken to secure that position, to ensure that the Centre does not go by default. During the Budget process the question of the appropriate use of its remaining finances will be considered in the kind of context that Senator Macklin has set out. The decisions will be taken then. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a matter of which I was unaware when the Estimates committees were sitting. If I had been aware of it I would have raised it at that time. I think it is of sufficient importance to raise it in the chamber. It concerns the telephone link between Weipa and the Aboriginal community of Aurukun and how the privacy of telephone conversations on that link is being breached. Most honourable senators would be aware that Weipa and Aurukun are on the western side of Cape York Peninsula. They look westwards to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Weipa is a fairly large town. It has an effective telephone system for intratown communication and for communication with the world beyond. From Weipa to Aurukun there is a radio telephone link. I understand that there is one line only so delays are inevitable. Still, the situation is far better than it was a few years ago when no telephone link was available between those two centres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have now been advised that no scrambling device was incorporated in the Weipa to Aurukun link. I do not fully understand the technical reasons for incorporating a scrambler but I have been advised that without it conversation on this link may be received by commercially available frequency modulation radios. It may be that with a scrambling device a signal may still be received on an FM radio but the signal will be unintelligible. My advice is that extensive eavesdropping of telephone conversations between these two centres is occurring by persons using FM radios. This means that no person conversing with any person at Aurukun can be confident that he or she is having a private conversation; nor can any caller at Aurukun assume that a confidential conversation is taking place. In fact, the reverse is the case. It seems it is most likely that conversations will be listened to by some people with nothing better to do or alternatively by some people who have a vested interest in monitoring conversations on this link. </PARA>
<PARA> There are quite a few subscribers at Aurukun. There is a public telephone. The subscribers include the shire office, the police station, the school, the hospital, the Queensland Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement Department and the federal Department of Aboriginal Affairs. No conversation between any of these locations and places beyond Aurukun can be considered secure. I do not know whether the link lends itself to a scrambling device but in the interests of security of conversations every effort should be made to rectify the situation. I ask the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) to have this matter investigated with some urgency and to advise what will be done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are in a slight difficulty here. The matter does not involve the Department of Communications; it involves Telecom Australia, one of the commissions. The matter which Senator Colston has raised is both serious and technical. We will have to refer the matter for advice. We will do that. If I understand the honourable senator correctly he is saying that eavesdropping is occurring by people using frequency modulation radios. I am advised that on technical grounds that probably means the equipment involves radio concentrators which are being used in rural Queensland to open up communications systems. It operates in the very high frequency bands. I am advised that for this kind of interception to occur a deliberate effort to tune in would be required. Because the system is a directional system tuning in would involve placing a receiving system somewhere within the beam in a quite deliberate fashion. Since Senator Colston is concerned and is asserting, I think, that eavesdropping is occurring on the link between Aurukun and Weipa-I would regard it as a very serious matter if people cannot have any privacy in the communications that they are trying to make-I think the most appropriate action for us now to take would be to ask Telecom to look at the matter, to get a report and to try to make a response to Senator Colston on the outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise three matters. First of all I refer to Question No. 2119 that I asked the former Minister for Communications, Mr Sinclair, on 24 March. In that question I sought financial analysis of the operations of the Black Mountain Tower, with particular reference to the restaurant. I did so because about seven years ago my illustrious Queensland colleague Senator Keeffe and I disputed the idea of the restaurant being imposed on the tower column. We did not object to better television reception for the residents of the Australian Capital Territory but we knew-we were proven right- that the expanded foundation would encroach on dedicated park land. Leaving that aside, I have been seeking, like a sort of environmental Diogenes, to find out the relativity between the operating costs of the restaurant and the security service and what rent the Department of Home Affairs and Environment and the Department of the Capital Territory get. I mention in this instance the two Ministries. This project developed originally through those two Ministries. What annoys me is that I asked for these figures on 24 March. Here we are in May and there has been no response. I am sure that the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) will take note of the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think I am correct in saying that the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) is responsible for sports grants. Prior to Senator Baume coming into the chamber I showed the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) correspondence from the Australian Clay Target Association in which the Association expressed concern about the future Budget and the Association's rating in the sports firmament. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard this letter addressed to me from the Executive Director of this organisation. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle has approved this incorporation. </PARA>

<PARA>Commonwealth Parliament Offices,</PARA>
<PARA>Chifley Square,</PARA>
<PARA>Sydney, N.S.W. 2000</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Mulvihill,</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Sporting Community requires an increased allocation from the 1982-83 Federal Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of real concern that the needs of this country's six million registered sports participants are not being provided for in the current Federal Government allocations, particularly in respect to the Sports Development Programme. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this heading, financial assistance is provided to national sporting associations for such essential activities as international competition (either in Australia or overseas), the appointment of full time Executive Directors and Coaching Directors, research projects, general administration projects and improved coaching and communications techniques. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that all of these activities are vital to the growth of sport at a time when sport is making a continually increasing contribution to the health, fitness and morale of our nation and is becoming more and more effective as an avenue towards greater international understanding and co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Allocations for the Sports Development Programme has remained stagnant at $2. 885m for the past two years despite inflation, soaring costs of travel and the fact that this only represents a sum of less than 20c per head of population. </PARA>
<PARA> In each of the past three years, the Commonwealth Government has had a financial commitment to the 1982 Commonwealth Games project. </PARA>
<PARA> As this does not recur in the 1982-83 Budget, sport strongly urges you to support the proposition that $2.5m of the money previously directed to the Games (3.305m was the Games allocation in 1981-82) be redirected into the Sports Development Programme. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a move would certainly be reflected in greater development activity by national sporting associations, as their individual grants would become more realistic and useful. </PARA>
<PARA> Little imagination is needed to recognise that the present Budget provision is grossly inadequate when one considers that the amount of $2.885m in the Sports Development Programme must be divided amongst about one hundred applicant national sporting associations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also vital that other areas of the overall Youth, Sport and Recreation provisions be increased. The Australia Games project and the Australian Institute of Sport are two initiatives that must be supported through realistic grant provisions. The potential benefits to Australia from these developments are enormous and they must not be retarded by lack of Government funding. </PARA>
<PARA> These projects are at vital stages of their development and it is important that annual allocations also reflect increases due to general inflationary trends. </PARA>
<PARA> We recognise that current economic conditions make the provision of additional funds difficult. In this instance, however, such a situation does not apply because Australian sport is seeking more a redirection of grants already established in the sports area, than any substantial increase in the overall allocations to Youth, Sport and Recreation. </PARA>
<PARA> We seek your support of the proposal and ask that you be persuasive on behalf of the Australian sporting community whenever the opportunity presents itself. An indication of such an intention will be very greatly appreciated. </PARA>

<PARA> I turn to the major matter that I want to raise. I think it is fitting that Senator Peter Baume should be at the table. There has been considerable confusion among conservation groups. If on the one hand certain parts of Australia have had a bountiful season with an increase in the kangaroo population are there moves afoot in relation to the culling figures? When were the last figures established? Senator Peter Baume will well recall some months ago giving me an interim report which I think was based on an impending meeting of the various State Ministers for wildlife and conservation under the chairmanship of the Commonwealth Minister for Home Affairs and Environment who, in turn, is responsible for the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Since that date a number of conservation groups-the Kangaroo Protection Co-operative Ltd, the Australian Wildlife Protection Council and, most prominent of all, the Australian Conservation Foundation-have expressed a little apprehension because they believe that the ultimate decision of the various State Ministers in conjunction with the Commonwealth Government, is linked with the attitude of the United States of America as to the importation of kangaroo meat and kangaroo products. I think it has some relationship to some countries in Western Europe. I wonder whether the Minister could, in a very short time, get me information as to if and when the conference of State Ministers took place. Were any revisions made of the existing culling quotas? What is the position in relation to the United States and West Germany regarding the importation of kangaroo meat?</PARA>

We have checked with departmental representatives who are here today. It is not a matter over which the Department of Communications has the operative control or upon which it can give the answer. It is not a matter over which the Department of Home Affairs and Environment has control. We will try to have the answer to that question produced for Senator Mulvihill as quickly as we can. In relation to the Australian Clay Target Association matter, I take it that it will be adequate for us to examine the letter which Senator Mulvihill has had incorporated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the question of the culling figures for kangaroos, some information has just been placed in front of me. I understand that in accordance with the established procedures the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service seeks advice from State and Territory wildlife authorities on the proposed annual quotas for the harvesting of kangaroos and wallabies and on the number which may be exported. The commercial utilisation of kangaroos is regarded by State authorities as a management tool for controlling the numbers of kangaroos on private lands. Those State wildlife authorities which permit commercial harvesting of kangaroos and wallabies submit commercial quotas for the consideration and approval of the Minister. Upon receipt of ministerial approval the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service advises what was formerly the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs accordingly in order that export permits may be granted and exports monitored. That is the procedure. The relevant authorities in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia and Victoria have submitted proposed harvesting quotas for the year 1982. The quotas are set out in a table which I have in front of me. </PARA>

A campaign about this matter was spearheaded by an Australian athlete that both Senator Peter Baume and I admire, Gael Mulhall.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise in the Committee of the Whole a matter that I raised during the hearings of two Estimates committees. It was to do with the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-Time Training Scheme, the non-payment of tax for employers who took on apprentices under the supposedly non-taxable amount of money-I think it was about $1,500-offered. As I have said, I raised this matter with two departments. A reply has been given in one of the reports to the Senate and from the other department I received a personal reply from Mr W. J. O'Reilly, the Commissioner of Taxation. I will not quote all of that letter because the name of the person involved is embodied in it and would need to remain confidential. I will read just two or three lines of the Commissioner's letter. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might add that the matter you raised is at present under consideration by the Government but I am not, of course, in a position to say what action, if any, might be taken regarding it. </PARA>
<PARA>I now ask the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) whether that action is in train and whether it is envisaged that the Income Tax Assessment Act will be amended in the near future so that employers who take on apprentices under the CRAFT scheme will, as has been very widely advertised by one of the other government departments, receive tax free the amount of money offered. </PARA>

I spoke to Mr Brown, who was the then Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, and he was going to take up the matter with the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to see whether there was some way that the Government could overcome the problem that exists. I am not blaming the Government in any way. I think that it is a problem that has crept in and of which the Government was not aware until some person in a loss situation was faced with it. All that I am asking now is whether the Minister can advise me as to whether the Government is taking any action to amend that Act and, if so, when we can expect the legislation to come before the Parliament . </PARA>

Until the Government has taken a policy decision we are not really in a position to give Senator McLaren the definitive answer he requires.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a few matters in relation to the Department of Administrative Services. The first concerns the Government Information Unit. I have noticed, through perusing previous Estimates committees reports, that there have been many inquires as to the cost of this particular Unit and the purpose to which it was being put. During the Estimates committee hearings recently we finally asked whether the Department could put together a total costing of the Unit. It has provided that in the additional papers submitted to Estimates Committee C. We find that in 1978-79 the total cost of the Unit was $86,159. In 1979-80 the cost rose to $155,861. In 1980-81 it rose to $168,000. In the last financial year, it rose to $565,850. It is becoming a very expensive Government unit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Looking at the way in which the costs have risen in that area, we see that salaries and overtime over four years have risen by 400 per cent. I am sure that any wage earner would like a 400 per cent rise. Obviously, the reason for it is that there has been increased staffing and increased overtime. Looking at postage and telephone costs, one finds that over four years they have risen by 500 per cent. Over four years, the cost of incidentals has risen by 2,500 per cent. The plant and equipment item makes its first appearance this year at $109, 500. </PARA>
<PARA> I well remember the pledge of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in 1975 when he said that the so-called support staff for the Labor Government was far too large and that he would be responsible for reducing such staff and that Ministers would not be entitled to Press secretaries. At the same time, he promised that there would be no jobs for the boys. We are already up to at least 13 jobs for the boys-unless the Government has redefined their sex! The reality of the Government Information Unit is that it is a Liberal Party propaganda machine. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept the fact that Press officers working for a government will work in that government's interest, that they will propagate government policies and will from time to time also propagate the interests of the parties that are in government. We have had two major instances, though, in which the Unit has probably gone beyond what could reasonably be regarded as fair. In 1980 there was monitoring of the Derryn Hinch program and trying to sabotage it. As recently as last March we had a representative from the Government Information Unit attending Mr Peacock's Press conference and reporting back to the Government. I think that that even takes it beyond members working for this Unit supporting a government; indeed, they are supporting a faction within the Government. I think that that is a misuse of Government funds. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I accept the political reality that Press secretaries or a government information unit will work in support of a government. What really annoys me is the hypocrisy of the Prime Minister in allowing this sort of growth following his promise in 1975 that it would never occur. He has gone to a situation in which outlays for the Government Information Unit have risen by 500 per cent to 600 per cent in four years. I should like some explanation from the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume), who is at the table, as to why it has grown to such a large extent. I might follow up some of these questions, depending on the answers given. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have turned to page 59 of the additional information given to Estimates Committee C. I note that the figures quoted by Senator Robert Ray are, indeed, the figures given there, and these are the figures which the Government has identified as being the costs of the Government Information Unit. There is nothing secret about these costs; they are being given out. I recall that on a number of occasions at Question Time Ministers-I think that Senator Sir John Carrick has done so on a number of occasions-have set out the functions of the Unit in relation to quite a number of questions and supplementary questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sorry to hear discussion about jobs for the boys. During our term in government we have tried to make good appointments to a whole range of jobs. Where these appointments require someone with an experience in public administration we have tried to choose someone who has that experience. Some of the people have been former members of this Parliament and I think that they have generally been acknowledged to be distinguished people in the jobs they do. People should understand that we have looked for quality, and we have not hesitated to appoint a former Deputy Prime Minister of the Labor Government where it appeared that he was an appropriate person to appoint. We are as prepared to appoint Lance Barnard, if he is an appropriate person, as we are to appoint other people. We are looking for people who will do jobs well. I am not sure that I can answer in a global sense the question that Senator Robert Ray asked. I have had no part in the ministerial control of the Government Information Unit. I would have to get briefing on what its functions are. I have had almost no contact with it. However, Senator Ray may have a number of specific questions. I suggest that he put them to me. We shall find the ones that I can answer and those on which I shall have to seek further information for him. </PARA>

<PARA> The specific points I would ask are: How large has the staff increase been for the Government Information Unit? The vote for salaries and overtime has, as I have already pointed out, risen from $48,000 four years ago to $217,000, which at a rough guess is just over a 400 per cent increase. Does the Unit have more staff? If so, why were more staff required? Why has expenditure on postage and telephones gone up by 500 per cent in four years? Virtually no other section has had an expenditure increase to that extent. We normally look at a 20 per cent increase each year and sometimes less. I would like to know what is comprised under the incidentals item, expenditure for which amounted to $5,000 in 1978-79, only $591 the next year, $1,700 the next year and suddenly leaping to $124,600. I would like to know what plant and equipment has been purchased for $109,500. Those are the specific matters that will probably give us an indication of why those items have gone up by so much. </PARA>

I am advised that is for the purchase of equipment for a text communication network for the Government Information Unit. That covers that particular item.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I deal with the matter I want to refer to in detail I just want to support my colleague, Senator Robert Ray, and Senator Evans by his interjection, in saying that we on this side of the chamber would not have been complaining about jobs for the boys if it had not been first made an issue during the 1975 election and during the term of office of the Whitlam Government. Prior to the Whitlam Government coming into being in 1972 we had 23 years of Liberal Country Party coalition government when many appointments were made. To my recollection there was no adverse criticism from the Opposition about those appointments being made. Of course during our term of office we had to make some appointments but it was made a political issue and as a matter of fact campaigns were fought on it both in 1974 when we were returned to office and in 1975 when we were defeated. One of the big issues was that the Whitlam Government was abusing its position as the Federal Government by giving plenty of jobs to the boys and also that the Prime Minister was touring at large around the world and wasting taxpayers' money. What we object to, of course, as has been pointed out on many occasions, is the hypocrisy of the persons who made these statements that they would not indulge in this sort of thing although in fact it has escalated enormously in the last six years. That should be noted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The subject I want to refer to under the votes for the Department of Administrative Services is one which I spoke about in this chamber on 25 March in the adjournment debate. I spoke about the low interest home loans which were made available to some Ministers of this Government when they were Ministers of a previous government. During my remarks, as recorded on page 1249 of the Senate Hansard for 25 March, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> That is the way the Prime Minister has tried to duck out of the issue, to try to explain away why he sanctioned these cheap loans. He did not give them to these two chaps--</PARA>
<PARA>The two chaps I was referring to were the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, and the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon-</PARA>
<PARA>Because they gave them to themselves when they were the then Minister for the Interior. That Department has now been changed; It is now the Department of Administrative Services. </PARA>
<PARA>On 14 May Mr Newman, the Minister for Administrative Services, wrote to me in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator McLaren,</PARA>
<PARA> From comments made in your speech during the adjournment debate on 25 March 1982 (Hansard, page 1249) it could be understood that my Department is responsible for housing loans in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought you would wish to be aware that housing loans in the ACT are administered by the Department of the Capital Territory and not by my Department . </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely, Kevin Newman</PARA>
<PARA>I would just like now to advise Mr Newman that I am well aware of that because it was in 1974 under the reign of the Whitlam Government that these cheap home loans were done away with. People getting loans after that had to pay the ruling rate of interest. But when these loans to which Mr Newman referred were granted in fact the old Department of the Interior was the Department responsible for granting those loans and both Mr Anthony and Mr Nixon were the respective Ministers of that department at the time they granted the loans to themselves. I was not labouring under any misapprehension or saying something I was not aware of because what I was actually saying was that when those loans were granted the department which is now the Department of Administrative Services was known as the Department of the Interior. I am well aware that the Department of the Capital Territory now administers those loans, and I will be having quite a bit to say about that later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I will be having quite a bit to say about that when we are dealing with the additional appropriations for the Department of the Capital Territory. I will be speaking at some length on that. The other matter I wish to refer to under the vote for the Department of Administrative Services concerns hire cars which come under the jurisdiction of this Department. As recorded at page 47 of the written replies to questions asked during Estimates Committee C, as tabled in the Parliament some weeks ago, I ask:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . for the number of hire car companies engaged in Canberra and whether any of the companies are reallocating Government bookings to persons who do not have a hire car plate. If so, are the passengers travelling in the vehicles fully covered by insurance?</PARA>
<PARA>The reply that is put out in this document lists the names of companies which I will not refer to now because they are already on record, but the final part reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Enquiries have revealed that no bookings made through the Department's car pool have been allocated or re-allocated to persons who do not have a 'Hire Car' plate. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the queer part of the answer. It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> If any bookings were re-allocated to such persons the passengers would be fully covered by insurance. </PARA>
<PARA>So I am at a loss to understand that answer in its two parts. First I am told that no bookings made through the Department's car pool have been allocated or re-allocated to persons who do not have a hire car plate and then the answer goes on to state that if any bookings were re-allocated to such persons the passengers would be fully covered by insurance. That is very hard to understand. Perhaps the Minister will be able to give me a fuller explanation. I want to know how a passenger would be covered and would not there be a breach of the law if passengers were in fact carried for a fee if a vehicle was not licensed to carry passengers? It may well be that the Department is not aware that some of these hire car companies, or one in particular, did at one time re-allocate bookings. I have it on good authority that a passenger was seen getting out of one of these cars at the Department of Defence and that it was driven by a person who used to have a hire car licence but no longer had it. Yet he was carrying a passenger who under normal circumstances would have been travelling in a car which would have been booked by the Department of Administrative Services. I will have to follow this up further and get some additional information about these cars. I want to know how such passengers would be covered by insurance in view of the answer which was given, if they were carried in a car which was not licensed to carry passengers and particularly if it involved a government booking given over to one of these persons who is not licensed to carry passengers. I would like to know whether these people would in fact be breaking the law if they were in fact carrying a passenger for a fee. I have some more questions to ask on cars but I will wait until I get answers to that matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senate Estimates Committee C was given the task of looking at the estimates for the Department of Administrative Services. The Committee was surprised to find that in a great majority of cases there had been increases in expenditure in respect of any of the functions that were formerly carried out by the Department of Administrative Services but had been transferred to the private sector on the recommendation of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, which we were told in a fanfare in 1981 was designed to form part of a government policy of reducing Commonwealth expenditure. When we sought information from the Department of Administrative Services we were suprised to find that no cost-benefit analysis had been involved in the decisions flowing from the Review of Commonwealth Functions. In fact, there was no evidence available to show whether funds had been saved as a result of the drastic alteration to the Department's operations during 1981-82.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The consequence of this was that the Parliament was asked to allocate additional funds over and above what would normally have been provided for services under the jurisdiction of the Department of Administrative Services. It mattered not whether the changes involved the Commonwealth car fleet, cleaning services, food and public facilities or other services which normally come under the purview of the Department of Administrative Services. It was rather surprising, as well as alarming, to find that evidence placed before the committee suggested that the Government decisions taken in respect of the Review of Commonwealth Functions were made for ideological reasons and not for economic reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has made an announcement in the last few days that the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee is to become a permanent part of the Government 's operations. It is virtually operating now as an overview committee of the Government. All that was said last year by Sir Phillip Lynch about the objectives of that committee-that is, that its aim was to save public funds-has been put aside because the evidence placed before the committee shows that ideological reasons and not economic reasons were behind the decisions. There has been a major transfer to the private sector of functions that were carried out by the Department of Administrative Services. This has been done in such a fashion as to cost the taxpayers more money. This is not a cost cutting exercise . The Senate is being asked to approve this appropriation. We must do so in the knowledge that the taxpayers are paying more for the provision of services than they were paying when the functions were carried out by the Commonwealth. It is costing more money. It does not matter whether the changes have occurred to the Commonwealth car fleet, the catering service, the watchman services, the guard duty operations of the Commonwealth or the cleaning operations. These functions were previously carried out by the Commonwealth employees. </PARA>
<PARA> We heard today that the Government is still proceeding with its proposal to sell off Government properties here in Canberra. One property which has been suggested should be sold off is Havelock House. It has been suggested, I think quite properly, that Havelock House could well be used for the activities of the Australian Federal Police in its training programs, rather than the Government having to meet a very heavy capital construction cost in Western Australia, as one of my colleagues from South Australia and other honourable senators suggested-in fact, the Government has suggested-will be the case in Western Australia. That exercise will cost millions of dollars. We have properties here in Canberra which the Government has placed on auctioneers' tables to sell off to the lowest bidder. No evidence was put before the Committee that to transfer the cleaning function of the Department of Administrative Services results in greater efficiency. In fact, I think there is abundant evidence to show that this will not necessarily follow. Those of us who had to talk with the employees who had been sold over the head, as it were, to the private sector heard about the great deal of dislocation and suffering caused by those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite surprising, therefore, to find that it will not be until the end of the next year, when we deal with the estimates in 1983, that we will be in a position to know whether the Government's objectives have been realised and whether, as is shown clearly in these estimates, the cost factor will place some additional burden on the taxpayers of this country. One could express a great deal of dissatisfaction about the way in which the Department is being administered by the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman. Let us look , for example, at the dissatisfaction that exists in relation to the Commonwealth car fleet, to which my colleagues have referred. There has been a grave deterioration in the service provided by the Commonwealth cars. The statement that the Government made in respect of the Review of Commonwealth Functions indicated that, in hiring of cars and taxis to supplement the work of the Commonwealth fleet, preference would be given to cars which were made in Australia. I ask honourable senators on both sides of the chamber how many times they have been driven to and from their homes and to Parliament House in cars that are of an imported nature in the last year or so, since the Review of Commonwealth Functions recommendations were put into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's professed intention to give preference to cars made in Australia when hiring cars from the private sector has not been put into effect. The Commonwealth fleet has hundreds of cars lying in the Commonwealth depot, not being used. At the same time hire cars from the private sector are used to drive VIPs about. I am talking about VIPs because I have been informed that occasionally even judges have had to use taxis and hire cars. That is a practice which I find difficult to accept, having regard to what some judges have been subjected to in terms of threats against their security and even their lives because of their roles in some jurisdictions. One would have thought that they in particular would have been given complete security by having the service of a Commonwealth car driver on all the occasions they required it, but that is not the case. Similarly, we find that is not the case in respect of members of parliament and other authorised personnel. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true. One can look at the economics of having such a large number of cars in the depot which are not being used. One third of the Commonwealth cars in Canberra are lying in the depots even at a time of maximum demand. On average, more than half the cars of the Commonwealth fleet in Canberra are in the depot undriven, unused. Yet cars are being hired from the private sector. The process, which was begun by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Sir Phillip Lynch, as part of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, was supposedly designed to make Government more efficient, more economical and more acceptable to the Australian people. The evidence, as produced by the work of the Estimates Committee, shows that that is not the case at all; that in fact a very unsatisfactory state of affairs exists. Whether we examine the provision of cleaning services, food, vehicles, or any of the substantive areas of responsibility of the Department of Administrative Services, the service provided is seen to be unsatisfactory. We are not obliged to refuse to approve the appropriation for the Department but if ever there were a case for refusal to approve an appropriation it is provided by this Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One could perhaps say a little more about the organisations which come within the jurisdiction of the Minister for Administrative Services. I refer in particular to the Australian Federal Police, about which I will have more to say in the course of another debate. Suffice it to say now that the morale of the Australian Federal Police has never been lower than it is at the moment. The ability of that organisation to meet its responsibilities is deplorable. Despite the efforts of the commissioner and the heads of his various divisions-I understand that they met today to consider the work of the organisation-the fact remains that its work is probably at the lowest point in its history in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and its capacity to carry out the functions that the Parliament laid down several years ago when it agreed to the relevant legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Even within the Australian Capital Territory the establishment of the force is down. The effectiveness of the police force in the national capital has been reduced to an alarming degree compared with what it was prior to the amalgamation. Dissatisfaction among members of the force is very high. Little has been done by the Government to try to put into effect the objectives set by the Parliament when it agreed to the legislation merging the Commonwealth Police and the Australian Capital Territory Police. Mr Newman can talk very eloquently about the problems of other police forces and one sees many melodramatic endeavours by some sections of the leadership of the Australian Federal Police to try to indicate that it is an effective organisation. However, I am sure that Mr Newman must know how bad is the morale in the organisation-as indeed it is now in all of the activities covered by the Department of Administrative Services. It is the case with not only the Australian Federal Police but also the Commonwealth driving pool and those sections that are still in the process of being transferred to the private sector. One might have expected, on the basis of the evidence that was supposedly placed before the Parliament following the Review of Commonwealth Functions, that a much more efficient and economical process would operate in this Department. The facts show that that is not the case. </PARA>

I wrote to the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman, on 4 December asking for a copy of the Marks report, which contained many of the recommendations to which my colleague, Senator Gietzelt, has just been referring . The report was the subject of lengthy questioning during the hearings on the Estimates. On 2 February, referring to the Marks report, Mr Newman said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With regard to your request for a copy of the Marks report I regret to inform you that I am unable to comply as the report is a confidential document. </PARA>
<PARA>I claimed in the Estimates Committee hearings, I have claimed in this place and I claim it again now that that document was compiled at the taxpayers' expense. When we are examining the expenditure in these Bills we ought to be told the cost of that report. Members of the Parliament ought to be able to look at it. During the Estimates hearings we were able to ascertain that Mr Marks recommended that a further consultant be employed. On 19 April, Mr Mills, of the Department of Adminstrative Services, said in answer to a question from me that that would involve a cost of the order of $50,000. From a more detailed reply later the Committee learned that the cost would be between $48,000 and $50,000 to employ another consultant to conduct another inquiry into the Commonwealth car fleet. Where are we going in relation to these matters? I have been reliably informed that these consultants have never consulted the people who operate the cars, who have to manipulate them and who have to arrange the programs. They never get into the cars at six o'clock in the morning and go out with the drivers, or get them in at 10 o'clock, or midnight, to see the adverse conditions under which drivers and transport operators have to work. Their work is all done from behind the desk-in theory not practice-yet we are expending taxpayers' money on it. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that the Government proposes to spend between $48,000 and $50,000 of taxpayers' money on the new consultant, whoever he may be. We may have been told his name, although I think it was with some hesitancy on the part of the Government. I believe it was said that he may not wish to have his name or his fee, divulged, but we do not know what the Marks report cost or what its recommendations were. It may well be that the Senate will have to use the procedures available to it to see that the report is made available. We have to go through the whole of the trauma associated with Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd. In that case an interdepartmental report was not made available to the Parliament. A Senate Standing Committee spent a considerable amount of time delving into the recommendations in that report. We may well have to do the same in respect of the Marks report. It appears that the longer this Government remains in office the greater is the number of inquiries carried out at the taxpayers' expense and then locked away in the secrecy cabinet so that no one can see what has been recommended or whether the Government is carrying out the recommendations of the consultants. </PARA>
<PARA> That is another gripe of mine, and I repeat it now. When we are examining appropriation Bills we ought to be told what consultants have cost. That applies particularly to the employment of Mr Marks who, I understand, is now Chairman of Commissioners of the Australian National Railways Commission. One of the recommendations made by a firm of consultants at a cost to the taxpayers of $409 ,000, was to drop the word 'Railways' from the title 'Australian National Railways'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting, I had posed quite a few questions relating to the Department of Administrative Services. I wind up by referring to another matter which I also raised during the hearings of the Estimates committees and which relates to orders that are given to Commonwealth drivers. At page 132 of Senate Estimates Hansard of 19 April I asked the question whether car drivers who exceeded the speed limit upon an order from a member of parliament or a Minister and who were apprehended by the police were liable to pay the fine or whether it was the responsibility of the Government. The answer which is provided in the document containing the answers to questions which were not answered during the Estimates hearings is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All Commonwealth drivers are required to obey the relevant State or Territory motor traffic rules. If a driver disobeys the rules he is responsible for any action that may be taken against him. </PARA>
<PARA>That puts the driver in a very awkward situation. Who is to be the boss? Probably the department which employs the driver tells him that he has to obey the rules of the road. He may be driving a Minister or a member of parliament who is running late for an appointment or to catch an aircraft. I have been told of a case where a Minister insisted that the driver exceed the speed limit so that he could be on time for his appointment. The driver was apprehended by the police, subsequently fined and had a demerit point put on his licence. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That may be. This is a place of free speech and where these matters have to be raised. I raised it at the Estimates committee hearings and I am now referring to the answer given to me after those hearings. I am putting a case in support of drivers who are directed by Ministers to break the law. If Senator Rae agrees with what the Government does, I do not. I do not think it right that a driver who is ordered by a Minister to exceed a speed limit should then incur a fine and have a demerit point placed on his licence. I support the drivers in their view that that should not happen. If the honourable senator supports the other view, he can be held responsible for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that the Department of Administrative Services should take some action to protect drivers who are ordered by Ministers, members or even departmental heads to break the law by exceeding the speed limit. If they are apprehended, the onus of responsibility should be on the person who directs that driver to break the law. I have heard of another case some years ago when a judge ordered a driver to exceed the speed limit in order to be on time to appear in court in Sydney. When the driver was apprehended, the judge immediately put his hand into his pocket-it was an on-the-spot fine-and paid the driver's fine because he felt responsible. The judge did so out of his desire to see that the driver would not be penalised as a result of action requested by the judge. </PARA>
<PARA> From the answer that I am given, it appears that the Government or the Department of Administrative Services has to do something. It can issue an instruction to a driver that he very definitely must not obey an order from a Minister, a member or a departmental head to break the law. If that driver is reported by the person who asks him to break the law and he refused to do it, it is the person who asked who should be responsible. There should be no penalty against the driver. The driver should not be taken from his car and put into the car depot to do menial work. He should not have to do that because he failed to obey an order from a Minister or a member that would result in him breaking the law. I ask the Department of Administrative Services to take note of that. It is a fact; I have been told about it by drivers. It is a matter that has to be remedied as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address a few brief remarks on the same subject covered by Senators Gietzelt and McLaren, that is, the Commonwealth car fleet. During the hearings of the Estimates committees I posed a question on this subject-I think it was to Mr Mills-by asking whether there was anything in the Marks report or any other consultant's report that justified in terms of economics the decision to reduce the size of the Commonwealth car fleet. The reply from Mr Mills was: 'The answer to that would be yes'. The reason why I asked that question was that evidence had come out, in regard to the cleaning services to which Senator Gietzelt has already alluded, that the decision was not made basically with economic criteria in mind. It was almost an ideological decision. There was no evidence that the reduction in cleaning and watching staff proved more economical than having government employees doing that job. Apparently, in terms of transport, the Government will claim that it is cheaper to use outside transport. I think we in this Parliament are entitled to ask for some evidence of that. I realise that the public servant concerned was not in a position to release the Marks report or to allude to its contents because the Government regards it, apparently, as a confidential document. But I think the Parliament is entitled to see the costings of private transport compared with government transport. Without that sort of information we cannot make an informed decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At that Estimates Committee hearing I also asked the question: 'How many cars are provided for a Minister in his home State?' I was informed that there was one. I also asked, and I have not received a reply: 'How many cars are allocated to the Speaker, Mr Snedden, in Victoria?' There was no answer provided to that question in the additional information. I would like to know whether the Minister has that information available now some couple of weeks after the additional information has become available. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, on the question of Commonwealth cars, we are not arguing that they should be retained from a parliamentarian's point of view because the Marks report recommends that parliamentarians receive Commonwealth transport in any event. But other areas will be cut back. I think this is serious. Every driver I have talked to is considering his future. I do not think the drivers have been properly informed about the exact state of play at the moment. Many who have served for more than 20 years are looking for jobs at the moment. I think this is creating a great degree of ill-ease amongst those government employees. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary I would like to know whether the Marks report will ever be made available to Parliament for perusal. Secondly, I would like to know whether the Speaker, Mr Snedden, is allocated one or two cars in his home State. </PARA>

Senator McLaren has maligned those people by saying that all that was obtained for a sum in excess of $400,000 was a new name, a new logo and a change of colours. I have pointed out in the past that that is not the fact. I have pointed out in the past that, in fact, it was the work which is undertaken by such consultants on behalf of a large cross-section of the major companies and statutory authorities of Australia. The whole development of a corporate management plan was involved. The whole development of an analysis of the operation was undertaken. The development of a system for the management of the company, including its financial affairs, its structural management, its public presentation, its public relations and all the rest, was involved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the remarks of my colleague Senator Robert Ray in that it seems to me that it is vital that the Marks report on transport be made public. The entire staff of the car pool of this Parliament is in a state of suspense and great indecision as to its future. The Marks report, as I understand it, addressed itself entirely to the car pool. It did not take into account the much broader and much more important aspects of transport generally for the Public Service. The Services-the Royal Australian Army and the Royal Australian Navy-can organise their own transport, and there is considerable evidence of waste in this area. The comparatively small number of people employed in the car pool are being attacked, it seems, because of the Marks report which has not been made public. I believe it is urgent that this report be made public and that there be consideration of wastage insofar as the whole transport area of the Public Service is concerned, and particularly that of the Services. An investigation into the whole area in long overdue. It seems to me to be grossly unfair that the investigation has so far been directed at the comparatively small number of employees in the car pool who, in my experience as a senator, operate with remarkable efficiency.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of matters have been raised by several honourable senators in relation to this aspect of the Estimates. I think the aspect that seems to have the greatest interest is the Marks report and whether it should be made public. The Marks report was commissioned by the Government to deal generally with transport and storage responsibilities of the Department of Administrative Services. It was a report dealing with a number of matters, one of which was the car pool, in which honourable senators seem to be particularly interested, no doubt because of their close involvement with the services of that pool. I want to emphasise that the Marks report was not commissioned to deal with the car pool but to deal with transport services and storage facilities generally provided by the Department. The report covers a much wider range of activities than the those of the car pool. The report was commissioned on the basis that it would deal frankly with various matters. Because of that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) decided that the report should not be made public. It is a report which, as I have said, was commissioned for the purpose of consideration on a confidential basis. It was not prepared on the basis that it would be made public. The Minister has decided that it will not be made public. That is the stance that the Government maintains.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly the expressions of view in the course of this Committee debate tonight will be considered, but I think it ought to be known that that was the basis on which the report was commissioned and the reason the Government has taken its position. The subsequent inquiry into the activities of the car pool has beeen undertaken as a result of the Marks report. It is a separate and discrete inquiry into the car pool. Although some broad decisions have been made in relation to the pool, which have been made public and to which honourable senators have referred, the fact is that that is a separate inquiry and one which has not yet been completed. Therefore, in relation to the problems with which honourable senators are concerned-they being natural concerns on behalf of those who may be affected by the report-nothing really can be done to alleviate any concerns until that report is made. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator McLaren asked at the Estimates committee hearings about the consultancy fees for the consultant who was to be engaged in the preparation of that report. The answer to that question is shown on page 46 of the additional information which has been provided. Nothing further can be said or provided in relation to that report because it has not been completed. Senator McLaren also commented on some answers that have been received in relation to questions he asked at the Estimates committee hearings. He asked about the number of hire car companies engaged in Canberra and whether any of these companies have been reallocating government bookings to persons who do not have hire car plates. He went on to ask whether, if that was so, the passengers travelling in the vehicles not covered by the hire car plates are covered by insurance. The answer given appears on page 47 of the written replies to questions asked during the Estimates hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that that was a very adequate answer to Senator McLaren's question. If anything it really went further than the question. For some mysterious reason that seems to have troubled Senator McLaren. That is a problem which I think he will have to resolve in his own mind. I cannot help him any further. It is a perfectly clear answer as far as I am concerned. It sets out who are the hire car companies in Canberra, about which he asked. It states that there has not been any reallocation of bookings to people who do not have hire car plates. It goes on and provides further information. If that situation did occur, although it has not occurred, passengers in those vehicles would be covered by insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> That seems to me to be a perfectly clear answer and to be perfectly correct from a legal point of view. I do not know what Senator McLaren is complaining about. I do not think there is anything further that I can add to the debate that has taken place. Senator McLaren says that he had a number of questions that he still wants to ask. If he likes to pursue those questions, specific answers will have to be obtained in relation to them at a later date. A full attempt has been made to answer the questions that have been asked during the Estimates committees. Those answers have been provided in an additional booklet that also has been tabled in the Senate. At this stage I regret that I can provide no further information to the Committee. </PARA>

Will the report by the consultants ever be released on the basis that we have paid upwards of $50,000 for it? Secondly, if the Marks report is not going to be released, could some document showing the comparative costs of the Commonwealth car pool versus private transport be prepared and released?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the answer just given to me by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). I posed a question to him. How would passengers be covered by insurance if they were transported in cars where the job had been reallocated by a hire car company to a car which is not licensed to carry passengers? My understanding of the law is that third party insurance would not cover a person paying to be transported in a car if that car was not licensed to carry passengers. I again ask Senator Durack: What method would be used to insure the passengers travelling in cars when these bookings may have been re-allocated from a hire car company, which found itself not having enough cars to do the job at the time for which it accepted the booking, to a person who carried the passengers in a car which was not licensed to carry passengers? What I want to know is: What method has the Government used to ensure that such passengers, whoever they may be, are covered by insurance if there is an accident?</PARA></TALK.START>

Obviously the question of releasing a report that has not yet been received is hypothetical. Whether it should be released will certainly be considered and that will have to be judged at the time. The suggestion by Senator Robert Ray that some paper be prepared setting out the information that he seeks regarding the comparative costs is also a matter which I will have to refer to the Minister and ask him to give consideration to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am afraid that I cannot take the matter raised by Senator McLaren any further . The situation that he envisages has not occurred and certainly should not occur. Without giving any specific opinion in relation to the rules relating to third party insurance, the general principle under third party insurance is that people are covered in the situations that are envisaged. It would appear that the information that has been provided on the face of it is correct. In the light of Senator McLaren's pressing the issue I will refer it to the Minister. </PARA>

I want to correct one matter concerning the Hansard record of the hearings of Estimates Committee C on 19 April 1982. At page 89 questions I asked about the fees paid to consultants are recorded. It is recorded that Mr Stuparich, one of the departmental officers, gave certain answers. It appears as though he was asking the questions when in fact the record should read that I was the person asking the questions. This is the section in which I said that the matter of consultants' fees-the amount paid or even the name of the consultancy firm engaged-should not be a matter of secrecy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise a couple of matters concerning the Australian Electoral Office, which is covered in the Department of Administrative Services estimates. At a hearing of Estimates Committee C Senator Gietzelt asked of a departmental officer a question concerning the habitation review. In the additional information supplied by the Electoral Office-it is quite detailed information-we were supplied with an accurate rundown of the habitation reviews to be conducted by 30 June this year. There are some fairly wild disparities in those figures. We were informed that the Electoral Office is short of money; that it is not being funded to the extent that it can carry out its duties properly. One of the areas cut back on in order to save money has been the habitation reviews. People would realise that any habitation review needs quite a deal of manpower because virtually every house in Australia has its door knocked on to establish who should be on the role and who should not be .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a couple of areas I have difficulty with in regard to the information supplied; for example, why has New South Wales been so heavily reviewed and some other States not reviewed at all or only very little? I do not think there is an electorate in New South Wales where more than 50 per cent of the people have not been reviewed. However, in Queensland there has been absolutely no review at all . It is noticeable that the Queensland State Electoral Office, concerned with the State electoral roll, is carrying out a major review at the moment, which includes some excellent television advertisements, full page advertisements et cetera. </PARA>

In Victoria we find that the average coverage is about 30 per cent. In Tasmania, the Northern Territory and Queensland there has been no coverage at all. If we are to have an independent electoral office that is supposed to do its job efficiently and well , I do not think that the lack of funds is enough justification for not having the electoral rolls up to date. I realise that the Australian Electoral Office is operating under one of the most archaic electoral Acts of any country. I think the Government has promised to do something about this by Christmas 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raise another matter concerning the Electoral Office. In September I asked whether it would be possible in every electorate to count the ballot out if there was an absolute majority for a candidate; in other words, to get a two party preferred vote in every electorate. My question asked in September was misunderstood and the costing came back as $200,000-odd. I qualified that question recently and I have now been provided with the information that it would cost approximately $20,000 across Australia. I urge the Government, in considering reviewing the Commonwealth Electoral Act, to look at that suggestion . I do not think $20,000 is too much to spend to establish the final two-party preferred vote in each House of Representatives elections. That would dispel the sorts of thoughts which were prevalent in 1954, 1961 and 1969; namely, that the Australian Labor Party was robbed in having got more than 50 per cent of the preferred vote but not having been elected to government. That would establish once and for all what the final preferred vote is throughout Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity while we are discussing the Estimates for the Department of Defence to raise the subject of the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. Along with other senators and members of the House of Representatives about two weeks ago I met here with a delegation from the factory. The reason the delegation came here is that the factory had been told that 40 to 60 jobs were due to be lost at the end of May. Now it has been informed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) that 60 jobs will, in fact, be lost through attrition over the next year rather than retrenchments. It has also been told also that no guarantees can be given on this front beyond May of next year. I do not believe that this Government can claim that Australia has no need for small armaments. An article in the Adelaide Advertiser of 16 March 1982 gave a fascinating insight into what is happening in Singapore at the moment. This country is becoming the region's foremost producer of armaments. In fact, the article states that Australia buys large quantities of ammunition from Singapore to overcome shortfalls from its own ordnance factories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the Lithgow people have good reason to worry about the future of the small arms factory there. In fact, history has shown us the callousness in which jobs are lost through Defence Department decisions. I refer, of course, to 1958 when 250 jobs were lost at the factory when the Army's 303 rifle was replaced by the FN rifle. The writing is on the wall at the moment. If the Army wishes to replace the FN rifle-I believe at the moment that the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is seriously looking at an Australian replacement for the FN rifle-then I think we have to look at the fact that this Government might not give out the contract to local industry. It is most likely to import rifles from Singapore which, although they will certainly be cheaper, might not be of as high a quality as those which are produced by the Lithgow Small Arms Factory at the moment. Of course, there is a real danger that if Australia begins increasingly to rely on overseas armament manufacturers our local defence capability will be destroyed. This will be the crucial point in times of war. I believe that this Government owes the people of Lithgow reassurance that their factory will continue to operate at full strength and that future small armament contracts will remain with local Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I place on record tonight the fact that Mr David Simmonds, who was the Australian Labor Party candidate for the seat of Calare at the last election, was approached over this very issue. He raised the matter with Mr Ross Free, the member for Macquarie, who then approached Senator Mulvihill who is the chairman of the Labor Party's manpower committee. We were able at very short notice to put together a meeting of people in our party who were concerned about this matter. We are determined to do everything we can to make sure that the Lithgow Small Arms Factory continues to remain viable and employ the same number of people as it employs at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another matter that I wish to deal with in the consideration of the proposed expenditure for the Department of Defence and that is the methods of payment used by the Department. In my belief, the way the Department is making payments at the moment needs to be carefully reviewed. It did not surprise me at all to see a piece in the Daily Mirror in Sydney of 20 April 1982 which read:</PARA>
<PARA> The owner of a Sydney whitegoods company is reeling in disbelief at a letter he received from the Defence Department after he provided them with $20,000 worth of equipment. They say they can't pay until 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>Over the last two years I have made endless representations on behalf of a small local firm in the Manly-Warringah district in Sydney where I live on this very subject of late payments. One rather desperate letter that was sent to me from the company made the point that from 28 invoices sent to the Department of Defence only seven were paid on time-I have all the authentication of this-with the remainder taking up to 59 days to be paid. By normal standards, I think anybody would agree, payment should be made within 30 days. I was assured by the then Minister that a better and faster system for paying accounts was to be instituted. Obviously there is still something drastically wrong with the Department of Defence system of payments, if this newspaper article is correct. From the personal experience I had I tend to agree that the article is correct. Most firms, particularly small firms, cannot afford to give credit during the present unhealthy economic climate and probably themselves have large bills to pay. I hope that this is something on which we can get an answer from the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The last issue that I wish to raise as far as the Department of Defence is concerned relates to the officials who came to answer our questions during the Estimates committee hearings. The situation was not satisfactory. In fact, the report of Committee D states that the number of undertakings by the Department of Defence to supply in writing answers which could not be given at the time of the hearing were more than those from the other two Departments-Foreign Affairs and Immigration and Ethnic Affairs-combined. The Committee strongly believes that at Estimates hearings departments should be represented by officers who are sufficiently senior to answer confidently and correctly, with the facts, most of the questions put to them. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, I asked what I considered to be a very basic and uncontroversial question. I inquired whether the Department had a policy of installing solar energy systems where possible in order to cut down on fuel costs. Clearly, that question was not designed to put the Department on the spot. I do not think that it required a long, complicated or carefully researched answer. But the officer who rose to answer my question knew nothing about such proposals and a written reply was promised. The reply that we finally received revealed that the Department indeed does use solar energy units in some situations and expects their more widespread use in future years. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this is an example of the lack of senior well-informed departmental witnesses that the Committee was faced with. It contrasted greatly with the situation in which we found ourselves when we spoke to representatives of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. In fact, both these departments were represented by their permanent heads, Mr Henderson and Mr Menadue, which was very much appreciated by the Committee members. We hope that in future the Department of Defence will be able at least to provide the same level of representation as we received from the other two departments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to supplement the representations of my New South Wales colleague Senator Sibraa on two counts. It is fortunate that Senate Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, who represented the Minister for Defence at the Committee hearing to which Senator Sibraa referred, is in the chamber tonight again representing the Minister for Defence. Firstly, in regard to the termination or cessation of certain operations at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory, I believe that the Government should be aware of a problem encountered in the Vietnam war. I do not suppose that honourable senators on this side of the chamber would endorse the principles involved in that war. I remember that when I first came to this Senate in 1968 many countries in Europe were rather lukewarm in their attitudes to the issues in Vietnam. Australia needed some procurements from Sweden. The Swedish Government was rather cold in relation in that war and it deliberately held up or did not proceed with a certain contract. Do not get me wrong; it was not a major one. Senator Sibraa was pointing out what can happen if we become too dependent. He quoted an article to support his assertions. At the moment Australia may be on good terms with the Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr Lee, but if at any time he had a difference with us he would be the first person to apply some form of armament sanctions on Australia. I think that, quite apart from the aspect of decentralisation, that is something to be kept in mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also endorse what Senator Sibraa said about slow responses from the Department of Defence in comparison with the dialogue and answers that we received later from Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I think this is epitomised by a case I raised that was documented by Mr Wyner, secretary to the New South Wales branch of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union of Australia. I sought a simple explanation about the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act and a payment to a retired painter and docker named Bennett. It is quite some weeks since the Estimates committees met and it is beyond my comprehension that I have not had an answer by now. So I leave those matters with the Minister to transmit to the new Minister for Defence (Mr Sinclair), although some of them, I know, will follow Mr Killen to his new portfolio. I assume, mindful of the ruling which you gave earlier, Mr Chairman, that I can now proceed to two other maters.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GM7">Senator MULVIHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. When we dealt with immigration, I asked Mr Menadue about whether Australia had made any complaints about discrimination, or perhaps harassment, by the countries of the European Economic Community towards Australians. This was more or less exemplified by one or two Australians who had sought to take their chances in British and European soccer. He said that there had been no complaints from Soccer Federation officials, but as I interpreted that, I wondered what our Foreign Affairs Department, as the logical spokesman- not the Immigration Department-had done. Unfortunately, I did not ask the question then, but all of my fears were realised, and I shall have passed to the Minister a copy of the National Times of 25 April which contains an article by a journalist, Ken Healy, headed 'Socceroo's Roundabout Route to Canberra', concerning a boy of Greek parentage and the problems that he experienced in both Greece and Britain when he encountered EEC limitations on his activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say at the outset that it might be argued in those countries that the Professional Footballers Association could be deemed equivalent of a trade union . But I think that that is an oversimplification of it. The point that I take is that the meek do not inherit the earth. Consequently, I should like to know at the outset whether the Foreign Affairs Department has any form of dialogue with EEC countries when we feel that we are being discriminated against. I know that National Country Party members of the Cabinet have chastised the EEC countries at times about certain trade policy, but this is a matter concerning the free travel of individuals. I know that the Sydney and Melbourne Press and a host of people in the soccer field, mainly boys of post-war migrant stock, wonder why our Government is so passive and why we do not talk about this matter to those European countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I say this with some feeling because, as one of those who were trade union fledglings in the 1948-53 era, when I was a member of the Sydney Labour Council I voted for Marshall Aid for Europe. While the bulk of Marshall Aid obviously emanated from the United States, Australia made a contribution. Today, when we get some of the fat cat European Common Market countries applying discrimination to Australians and New Zealanders, I believe that we should remind them of our response to them when they were rebuilding in post-war Europe. Probably fate will give me an opportunity in September-October at the Council of Europe to make those remarks in person. But what I want to find out is whether our Foreign Affairs people ever speak up bravely and make suggestions to those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> After all, we are always the good guys. We have never countenanced guest workers here, and rightly so. But some of the European countries bring people in , let them do all the dirty work, and then, when those countries get economic problems, they pack such workers out across their borders. Whatever may be said at times about some facets of our immigration policy with which we might not agree, we can look Europe in the face and say that at least we have standards and principles. I appeal to the Minister to get me a clear cut answer. Must we always remain passive in this regard?</PARA>
<PARA> The other matter to which I want to refer is related to immigration. Some weeks ago I asked Senator Durack, as Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, about the progress of indications to the New South Wales Teachers Federation in regard to the funding and staffing of adult migrant education. The answer I received was that the New South Wales Government and the Teachers Federation were remiss in that a copy of a statement by Mr Justice Dey of 28 August 1981 had not arrived. I have in my possession here a copy of a letter sent to Mr Macphee dated 30 April, under the signature of Jennie George, General Secretary. It is reinforced by several telephone conversations that I have had with the Federation's organiser, Alderman Peter Woods, a close associate of mine who handles this section of the Teachers Federation operation, which refuted that and pointed out that way back in February the Federation had clarified this point. Be that as it may, on 30 April it again responded with the information. I think that in the light of that I am entitled to ask how Senator Durack was given a bum steer in relation to that answer to me. In view of the fact that the Department has apparently now got the real score on this matter, what sort of a response am I able to get?</PARA>
<PARA> Another matter relates to a score card I got on people who had transgressed our criminal code and were facing deportation. I am interested in developments in relation to Brett Collins and Greg Stone. I admit that the Department has given me a lengthy and comprehensive list but I am curious about the position in regard to Stone and Brett Collins. I will not hold up the Committee by giving my reasons but I think they will be known to a number of people. I think the Minister will appreciate that since we had the Estimates committee hearings things have happened. I refer to a recent issue of the Australian Financial Review in which certain remarks are attributed to the new Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee). I know him well enough from his involvement in his other portfolios to know that he is not a man with a hatred of trade unions. However, I noticed in the middle of this article that someone had raised the question about pommy shop stewards, a term applied to people who have been much maligned. I suppose it beats using somebody's particular name. The article stated that Mr Macphee had said that when he left the Immigration portfolio he left a policy which would not allow too many of those characters to enter Australia. I think that is a rather sweeping statement . I know what the family reunion scheme is. I know what job skills are. I would like an assurance that because somebody happened to be active on the work shop floor in Britain it would not mean he was not wanted here. After all, we are not ashamed of the Tolpuddle Martyrs saga and we are not ashamed of the Eureka Stockade. I could think of a few other groups of people who have also been sent out here and who have clashed with authority. But that is not the Ian Macphee I know. It is probably a journalistic error. I would just like that situation to be clarified. </PARA>
<PARA> I just jump back again to the Defence Ministry. I have hammered this point repeatedly. As the Royal Navy has released papers on certain aspects of campaigns in World War II, I wonder whether we are perfectly satisfied that the details have been released about the full circumstances of the sinking of HMAS Sydney. I refer to a book by the British author Montgomery. Several former members of the German Navy have disputed some reference in the book. I think that is a matter on which I should get some information because recently the Royal Navy released papers about the unfortunate British admiral who did not fire on the remnants of the Vichy fleet as it was passing Gibraltar and probably the papers that were released removed the particular stigma on him. Perhaps it is not impossible to ask whether we can get something of that nature as far as that situation is concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of matters have been raised relating to Estimates Committee D. Firstly I refer to the comments of Senator Sibraa on the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. I have no information here tonight that would enable me to deal with the matter that was referred to by Senator Sibraa but I will seek an early answer from the Defence Support ministry on the matters that he has raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as the payment of accounts is concerned, I am informed that there is no general difficulty with regard to the payment processes and as far as the Department is aware the system is functioning normally. I do understand that around about August-September 1981 there was some difficulty with the computer. That may be around the time that was referred to by Senator Sibraa as being of some difficulty. But all departments are urged not to have late payments. The usual practices and procedures are such that late payments should be avoided. If there are particular difficulties for any reason I am sure that the responsible Minister would like to hear about them and endeavour to overcome the delays because we do understand that anyone, whether he be in a small or large business , who is a supplier to the Government is entitled to receive early payment and settlement of the accounts that are due for payment.</PARA>
<PARA> If there are particular instances where information may be given that would facilitate payment-I know that Senator Sibraa has said that he has had to attend to this himself for constituents-that is one way to overcome the problem. We would certainly want to hear of any general difficulty that is being experienced . </PARA>
<PARA> The matter concerning the officials who attended the Committee hearing has been raised. I noted that in the Estimates Committee report reference was made to this matter. Perhaps there are differences in the way in which departments are able to present themselves. I think it would be accepted that the Department of Defence is a very large department. It is very specialised and is segregated in its duties. An enormous number of people would need to be in attendance at any particular time to deal with all of the requests. It is interesting to note that the committees had different views about the number of people who ought to attend and the way in which Senate Estimates committees could be assisted by officials. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Finance, in its guidelines for the preparation of explanatory notes for the Estimates committees, which were issued in January of this year to the departments, did advise the departments that they should ensure that sufficient advisers were available at committee hearings in order to answer as many questions as possible, thereby minimising the need to provide supplementary information at a later stage. It does require a lot of departmental work if the officers are unable to deal with detailed questions. I think it would be agreed that in the great majority of instances the Estimates committees can be provided with answers to many of the questions even though they may be of a detailed nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Finance has drawn attention to the fact that the functions of some departments by their nature-for example, the Department of Defence-may attract a wide range of questions, very different types of questions and a line of questioning which may result in a question being asked which is remote from the matter originally raised. I think that in that sense Estimates committees are of great value. This may result in a written response being required. I am sure it is agreed that where any of the departments have offered to provide written responses these are dealt with as completely as possible to assist the committee concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee did make some further observations in support of its comments with regard to the level of the officers and the range of the officers who attended. Perhaps it could be noted at this stage that two other committees- Committee A and Committee H-were concerned that too many officers are required to attend Estimates committees. In an attempt to reduce the officers attending it has been suggested that if notice were given to departments of the committee' s interests appropriately briefed advisers could attend. This suggestion appears to have the endorsement of committees A, D and H. So we do have different views of committees. I accept that the committees wish to ensure that officers are present who are able to deal with their questions. The secretary or the head of the department is not always the person who is able to deal with every detailed question of a specialised nature. Those of us who have been present at an Estimates committee hearing concerning the Department of Defence would recognise that a very wide range of officers, civilian and military, do attend and that the information that is given is given freely. Where a question has to be taken on notice and information has to be supplied, every effort is made to do this. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sibraa referred to the matter of solar installation. In this instance it was necessary for the Department of Defence to refer the matter to the then Department of Housing and Construction, and I think the Department of Administrative Services, to get an answer. If further information is required on that same subject I will see that the new Minister for Defence receives notice of the matter raised by Senator Sibraa on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Mulvihill referred to a number of matters, including a Royal Australian Navy book. I believe the matter which he raised concerns a letter which is under consideration for reply by the Minister. I will see whether a reply can be facilitated. He also expressed the hope that the Department of Foreign Affairs makes it clear to the European Economic Community that on any occasion we feel discrimination is shown by it against Australians, we should state our objection very strongly. I can assume only that the Department of Foreign Affairs would do so in individual cases, but perhaps I should see that Senator Mulvihill is fully briefed before he goes to the Council of Europe. If we are able to facilitate the passing of any information to him or cite particular instances in the course of briefing him we shall do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The honourable senator would never know where he might finish up but as long as he comes back safely to work for the migrants of Australia they will be very happy. The honourable senator has incorporated in Hansard the letter form the New South Wales Teachers Federation and that will be drawn to the Minister's attention again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have some information concerning certain immigration matters that the honourable senator has raised. For instance, he asked what had been the reaction of the New Zealand Government concerning the deportation of Glen Stone and Brett Collins. I am advised that the New Zealand Minister for Immigration has decided that Mr Stone is not to be readmitted to New Zealand. Our Minister is currently reconsidering the question of Mr Stone's deportation in the light of the recommendation by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that the deportation order against him be revoked if he cannot be deported to New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to Mr Collins, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal affirmed the deportation order. Mr Collins appealed successfully to the Federal Court on a question of law and the matter was remitted to the AAT for re-hearing on 10 October 1981. I understand that the Minister is now considering Mr Collins's position and I will endeavour to provide early advice to the honourable senator about that appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator also referred to the staffing of the Adult Migration Education Service in New South Wales. The report of the working party, which included representation by the New South Wales Teachers Federation, has been passed to working party members for their consideration. The report, with the views of the members, will be considered by the Minister when it has been received. We are not aware that Judge Dey's decision has been received, but the matter will be followed up and I will see that the honourable senator is advised . Also, I will endeavour to obtain information concerning any other matters that he has raised. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the use of the term 'pommie shop steward' is concerned, I will ask the Minister whether that was an accurate report of any comment that he made. No doubt he will have advice to give us on that subject. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a couple of remarks about the estimates for the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs before Senator Mulvihill raises other issues. One matter on which I spoke at length in the Senate after the Estimates committees hearings of last year concerned the long and frustrating delays experienced by British people who wish to visit, or apply to migrate to Australia. Mr Menadue, the departmental head, agreed that the delays were not acceptable and said that consideration was being given to improving the situation. I can understand that an intending migrant would face some delay while an application was being processed, but to have to wait three or four months before even the first interview is arranged, is appalling. I particularly believe that there is no excuse for such excessive delays when it is clear that the migrant has a skill that is desperately required in Australia or it is imperative that a family member be reunited with his of her family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An article in the Australian Financial Review of 10 February 1982 describes the present situation at Australia House in detail. That article states:</PARA>
<PARA> BHP's general manager of personnel, Mr Ron Wallace, said while the company had received . . . co-operation from DIEA,</PARA>
<PARA>The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs-</PARA>
<PARA> We cannot help feeling that there are not enough staff in the department to handle the volume of migration being carried out. The resultant delays make things difficult for both employers and prospective employees. </PARA>
<PARA>Last year BHP launched a recruitment drive and placed two advertisments in the British national press which drew 17,000 inquires. By June last year the company had selected 400 potential employees. However, when this article was written- that is on 10 February 1982-only 180 had arrived and the prospects for getting more people out did not seem bright. The staff shortage extends also to the visa section. In fact, an article in the Canberra Times of 5 February 1982 claims that applicants for visas have to wait up to four weeks because of drastic staff reduction. Australia House is getting a very bad name for being inefficient, slow and unco-operative. I would not be surprised if a number of potential visitors are discouraged from travelling to Australia because of the delays and difficulties experienced in obtaining a visa. The Government must show some flexibility towards staff ceilings in the Department, particularly with respect to our officers in the United Kingdom. In any of the remarks that I have made, I do not wish it to be interpreted that the people who are working in Australia House have been inefficient. We receive repeated complaints-I know that a number of members and senators are receiving them-because the staff ceiling situation is impossible with the number of applications being made at present for migration to Australia and Australian visas. If the whole section of our High Commission in London is to operate efficiently, what is needed is a complete review and overhaul of the visa application and migrant inquiry section. </PARA>
<PARA> I would again like to point out the Committee's appreciation of the fact that Mr Menadue, the permanent head of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, was present at our Estimates Committee hearings. I was particularly pleased because it gave me an opportunity to ask him his opinion about the present situation in our Embassy in Beirut. He had only recently returned from that country. The situation is that the embassy is located in west Beirut, which makes it almost impossible for christian Lebanese living in east Beirut to get to the embassy. The short trip is just too dangerous an undertaking for most of the christians to consider. They are then faced with the alternative of travelling to Damascus. The journey is uncomfortable, long and, again, hazardous . Furthermore, when they reach Damascus they believe that their applications are prejudiced because local staff in the embassy in Damascus do not treat christian Lebanese applicants as fairly as they should. The point that they are making is that they are discriminated against. I visited our Embassy in Damascus. I talked to the Australian Immigration people and found them to be very co-operative. I talked to the locally employed staff and their explanation of the situation was certainly acceptable to me. However, an increasing number of christians in both Lebanon and Australia are complaining of what they believe is prejudice shown against them by the locally employed staff at our embassy in Damascus. I made this point to Mr Menadue. He admitted that he had received a number of complaints about the situation. This Government must do something to improve the position of the christian Lebanese who are effectively being denied the right to apply to migrate to Australia that is available to other people around the world . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Chairman of Estimates Committee C I will speak briefly to the report relating to the Departments of Defence, Foreign Affairs and Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. It is my intention not to go through the report from A to Z but just to consider one or two of the recommendations or comments that have been made. Page 2 of the report refers to the seniority and expertise of departmental witnesses. I note that other members of the Committee have spoken about this and the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) has responded. The only point I wish to make in regard to this matter is that there is no criticism of the number of departmental witnesses who attend. I reiterate what was expressed by a committee in October 1976; namely, that the departmental people who come before the Estimates committees should be of a breadth of knowledge and experience not necessarily available to officers at lower levels. During the committee hearings one or two points were made that it was somewhat surprising that questions asked could not be answered at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time I want to commend the departments and the departmental staff who have participated in the Estimates committees for their expertise. I am talking now about the preparation of documents that have been brought before the Estimates committees that no doubt have made their whole proceedings and hearings much more efficient. I believe that the criticisms that have been made in regard to the giving of evidence are of a nature that can be overcome with liaison between the departments and the committees. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not my intention to take up the time of the Committee but there is a point that, as Chairman of Estimates Committee D, I must bring forward. I refer to the evidence relating to overseas property which was mentioned on page 6 of the report. Firstly, I want to say that it is not the right or the intention of the Committee to come to a decision. But it believes that the administrative arrangements in relation to overseas property should be considered. Before I refer to the points that have been raised in the report I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Committee, having considered the report of Estimates Committee D, recommends that the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations:</PARA>
<PARA> A review of administrative arrangements in relation to the purchase, construction and maintenance of overseas property. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has not taken a decision but in the taking of evidence a situation arose which it believes should be further investigated. We believe that a committee of the Senate is the proper organisation to review it. In referring to overseas property, the Committee said:</PARA>
<PARA> Overseas property, while occupied in the main by the Department of Foreign Affairs, is maintained by the Department of Administrative Services. While evidence was given that the two departments maintained close liaison, the Head of the Department of Foreign Affairs pointed out that on occasions there were certain practical difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>It was stated in the evidence:</PARA>
<PARA> It is the Minister for Foreign Affairs who is responsible for the wellbeing at posts. The wellbeing of individuals at posts has very much to do with the state of upkeep of their apartments, whether there is enough money for regular maintenance, whether, for example, there is enough money for maintenance in Moscow to keep the heaters going and in Jakarta to keep the refrigerators going. Yet that is the ministerial responsibility of somebody else, and that can be a problem. </PARA>
<PARA>That evidence appears at page 157 of Hansard. The Committee considered the situation and stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Additional problems may result when accommodation overseas is designed to standards suitable for Australia but not necessarily suitable for the particular conditions encountered overseas (e.g. see Hansard, p. 157). The Department of Foreign Affairs, with personnel on the spot, may be better situated to provide an input of local knowledge, and to employ local architects and tradesmen where necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . The Committee recommends that such a review be undertaken by the Finance and Government Operations Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee understands that there have been, for want of another expression, two departmental inquiries into the aspect of who should be responsible for the wellbeing of buildings and capital installations belonging to the Australian Government overseas, whether it be the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of Administrative Services. Certainly, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the matter should be looked at very thoroughly once again. Australian ambassadors apparently do not have the responsibility of maintaining the wellbeing of staff in Australian dwellings. I have noted that the Australian Embassy in Cairo is in a poor state of repair. The value of an Australian asset is being allowed to dissipate-</PARA>

The committee members and I wonder whether the organisation is able to manage an efficient operation. One could go on at length, but I have made the recommendation that this matter should be considered. Whilst the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations is a hard-worked committee and two departmental committees have been looking at it, the Committee members and I believe that it should review the matter. We are not making decisions; we are merely recommending that the matter be reviewed in the interest of Australian assets overseas and the Department of Foreign Affairs staff who man these places .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to the matters relating to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Once again we commend that Department for the way in which it has presented evidence and make brief reference to the new migrant selection scheme. The Committee intends to maintain a watching brief on preparations for the new migrant selection scheme and to continue to review it to see that it is kept in very good condition. We realise that the number of migrants will increase this year. I think there will be an increase of some 10 per cent to 13 per cent which means that we will see some 125,000 migrants coming to Australia. It is the intention of this Committee to continue to oversee the operation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment on the recommendation from Senate Estimates Committee D. The Department of Finance makes the comment on this recommendation that the one hundred and seventy-second report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts presented in November 1978 concerned the financing and administration of property owned or leased overseas by the Commonwealth Government. Recommendation one of that report was that the function of administering overseas property should be under the control of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In presenting the Government's response on 18 September 1980, the then Minister for Administrative Services, Mr McLeay, pointed out that such proposals are matters for the Prime Minister but that administrative arrangements are reviewed from time to time and the Committee's views would be taken into account. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) wrote to the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Peacock, on the matter on 6 November 1980 advising him that he had concluded that it would be preferable not to alter the present arrangements at that stage. The Prime Minister took into account the numerous changes in portfolio responsibility for the function over the years and measures for improved co-ordination between the Department of Administrative Services and departments with overseas operations. Those measures include the secondment of officers from relevant departments to the Overseas Property Office, strengthening the oversight of property matters by senior staff in relevant departments and the delegation of authority to heads of missions. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the comment from the Department of Finance which related to the discussion in the Senate Estimates Committee hearing. I have noted the comments made this evening by Senator Kilgariff. I am sure that Senator Peter Rae, as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, also would wish to make some comments on this recommendation. But I simply point out the comments referring to that earlier report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. As I have noted, there have been other reviews of this from time to time. It seems that it is one of those things that people will keep reviewing and talking about. Perhaps it is timely that some other investigations of the matter be undertaken. However, I will leave the matter with those comments and I will be interested to hear Senator Peter Rae's comments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said earlier in relation to another motion for a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, the Committee is certainly not seeking further references . However, until we get some form of reorganisation of the Senate committee structure the position is that the Estimates committees can only achieve follow up from a permanent or standing committee by a reference through the Senate of a matter which concerns such a committee to the appropriate standing committee. In this sort of case the Finance and Government Operations Committee has been regarded as the appropriate committee. I therefore suggest that it is an appropriate matter for the Senate to approve on the basis that the Estimates Committee wished to have the matter pursued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In saying that, however, I point to the fact that not only has there been the report in 1978 by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts but also there has been another inquiry by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. There has been some hot contention and difference of opinion between the Department of Foreign Affairs and other sections of government on what is the appropriate method of managing overseas properties. The extent to which it would be appropriate to reopen the whole inquiry or to find out what matters have changed since 1978 would obviously have to be taken into account by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations when it considers-if it receives this reference-what is the proper way to go about dealing with the reference. I suggest to honourable senators that it is appropriate that the Senate accept the motion arising from the Estimates Committee and refer the matter. Then it will be up to the Finance and Government Operations Committee to determine how it goes about the matter. </PARA>

<PARA>Minister for Immigration,</PARA>
<PARA> and Ethnic Affairs,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Macphee,</PARA>
<PARA> Federation is most disturbed that there has been no resolution of the important problem relating to the funding and staffing of Adult Migrant Education that was considered by the working party set up last year at the instigation of yourself, the New South Wales Minister for Education and this Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> Federation is disturbed to hear that this matter will not be considered because your Department alleges that certain information was not placed before it. A copy of Mr Justice Dey's statement of 28 August 1981 was forwarded as requested some months ago. You now state that an announcement will not be made until this statement is received. </PARA>
<PARA> An Officer of this Federation, Peter Woods, phoned your Department in February of this year enquiring as to when the Government would be making a response and was told that the report was to be presented to you in order that it could be dealt with in the week beginning 9 March 1982. Your Department did not indicate at that time that Mr Justice Dey's statement had not been received. Indeed this Federation would see it as somewhat irrelevant to the matters under consideration, whilst at the same time acknowledging that it is considerably supportive of the contention of this Federation that funding and staffing of the Adult Migrant Education Programme has been significantly inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, a further copy of Mr Justice Dey's statement is attached and it would be hoped that your Government will now expeditiously deal with the matters in dispute and promptly rectify the obvious deficiencies within this most important area of public concern. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GM7">Senator MULVIHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are other matters to which I want to refer. With the advent of Mr Hodges as Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs there is a sort of limbo, as it were, in relation to matters on which the Committee on the Determination of Refugee Status has probably made positive evaluations. I have in mind several Bolivians, one who had the backing of the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia, another who had the backing of the Australian Railways Union and a third, a Chilean, who had backing from the bus employees union. I do not have to relate to honourable senators the turbulence that exists in Latin America, with the exception, probably, of Peru. I am hoping that the new Minister will give special attention to some of these cases because people were interviewed almost eight or nine months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will wind up about Uruguayans. I have received several letters from the Central Office of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The matter stemmed largely from Senator Primmer. I think Senator Chipp also raised the matter of Uruguay. The United Nations stated in one letter that 80 Uruguayans were in a camp in Brazil. We were prepared to take a sizeable number. I subsequently received a letter which I do not have with me. I am not altogether sure whether the Minister or Mr Menadue signed it. We rightly felt that we were not impressed with the first couple who presented themselves. I received another letter which said that our humanitarian program would take people on board but it did not finish the original idea. If there were, say, 80 people and we rejected several, are we to take any of the residue? All this agitation was also supported by my Victorian colleague, Senator Primmer, at the request of the Uruguayan community in Melbourne. I understand that the Uniting Church in Sydney , through the representations of some Uruguayans, was also interested in the matter. Perhaps that matter can be clarified in relation to just what our commitment is. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, mindful of what the Chairman of Estimates Committee D did with the problem, we have-to adopt the words of the title of Charles Dickens's book-great expectations for many in relation to the family reunion program. To be brutally frank, because of the number who will apply how many will have to be compressed in the first year? It will be a very difficult ministerial exercise. I read in the Canberra Times that Cabinet ultimately-it was similar to a question I asked about the Public Service Board-would augment the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs by another 25 employees. Could we get a break-up of how many people will be allocated to Sydney and Melbourne? I am sure the Minister is aware of the regional problems notably at Parramatta in New South Wales. What is the position at the moment-there has always been a blame him or blame them attitude-about getting full co-operation from the Australian Federal Police and State police on the vetting of citizenship applications. This is an important factor in the time span. Could we get some information on that? Maybe the Minister will say that the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) should supply some of the answers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a number of brief issues relating to the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs. Late last year I moved in the Senate, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, as a matter of public importance the need for the Australian Government to supply food aid to Poland. At that stage martial law had not been imposed. Nevertheless the Australian Government still refused to grant such aid despite the clear urgency of the situation. Furthermore, just prior to the imposition of martial law the Polish Government asked Australia to extend trade credits to enable it to buy food-stuffs. The Government's subsequent decision to suspend consideration of this request until martial law has ended shows little concern for the wellbeing of the average Polish citizen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government has been in an excellent position to assist the Polish people during this trying period but has, I believe, not given the complete co-operation required. Nobody in Australia supports the imposition of martial law but it is obvious that the Polish people are suffering enough without this country taking such a tough, uncompromising line towards them. Poland needs Australian support at this time whether it be in the form of food aid or an extension of trade credits. It seems inconsistent to me that our Government, which according to a Foreign Affairs officer at the estimates hearings continues to support the idea of private humanitarian assistance to Poland and pays $1m to the Help Poland Live appeal-I do not oppose that decision ; in fact I agree with it-at the same time still refuses to back down on food aid and trade credit issues to Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs estimates I visited Lebanon earlier this year and during the Estimates committee hearing I took up the question of the value of the United Nations interim force in Lebanon. It is clear to me that this force has come in for a great deal of criticism from a number of countries. I strongly support the criticism that has been made by a number of countries about the United Nations interim force. What the Lebanese people desperately need at the present time is a proper United Nations peacekeeping force throughout the whole country within the internationally recognised borders, not just on her southern border. At the moment I believe that the interim force is a waste of time, effort and money. For that reason I gave notice of motion earlier this week which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) urgently requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to initiate immediate action by the United Nations Security Council to bring about a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Lebanon, and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) is of the opinion that such settlement should embrace-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) strict respect by all members of the United Nations for the territorial integrity of Lebanon within its internationally recognised boundaries;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) extending the responsibilities of the United Nations Interim Force to apply to the internationally recognised boundaries of Lebanon;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the transfer of responsibilities currently exercised by the Arab League peacekeeping forces to the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces, and the subsequent withdrawal of the Arab League Forces;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) disarming of factional and communal militias, and the PLO</PARA>
<PARA> (e) concurrent steps towards a settlement of the Palestinian question which will provide Palestinians with a national homeland. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe it is about time that the Australian Government, which contributes every year to the United Nations interim force in Lebanon, raised this issue in the United Nations. There is one further issue concerning the Department of Foreign Affairs that I would like to comment on. During the Estimates Committee hearings I asked whether all our Foreign Affairs posts overseas received Radio Australia news summaries. Unfortunately it appears that some posts do not have the communications equipment to pick up the Australian news summaries. Not surprisingly, these posts feel very out of touch and not up to the date with what is going on in Australia. I was particuarly pleased to hear from the permanent head of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr Henderson, that the objective is to rectify this situation so that all posts receive Radio Australia news regularly. I hope that the available finance is provided as quickly as possible in order to fix this situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier Senator Sibraa raised matters with regard to delays in processing the applications of British people and others to come to Australia. He noted what was said by the Secretary to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs at the time of the Estimates Committee hearing. I am not able to say very much more than was said at that time. I think it is accepted there are delays in some instances and that sometimes those who have sought early application because of skills related to employment opportunities expect that these things may be able to be conducted more quickly than they are able to be. I think it was said a little later by another speaker that if we were able to facilitate all applicants coming as quickly as they would like we would probably have difficulties staying within the figures in our immigration program laid down for this year. I have noted what was said by Senator Sibraa. I thank him for the spirit in which he made the comments because it is not a matter of criticising those who are working very hard and effectively to process as quickly as is possible and to facilitate the applications. Other difficulties arise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Sibraa mentioned the position in Lebanon. I am not able to say a great deal about what he raised as a very real difficulty of some people in applying for migration from that part of the world. I know he is aware of this and I know the Committee was given information with regard to the processing arrangements. I can only add to what I think is known about the way in which the arrangements proceed. At present we have under review the situation applying at the Australian Embassy in Beirut. At this stage I can say no more than that. But I accept that there are very many difficulties and uncertainties in that part of the world. In the latter comments of Senator Sibraa I noted what he said about the interim force. He drew attention to his notice of motion. Of course, that notice of motion is known to us. It will have the attention of the Minister concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Mulvihill again raised a number of matters. Firstly, he mentioned those matters relating to the Committee on the Determination of Refugee Status and a number of countries such as Bolivia, Uruguay and others. He was concerned that matters he had raised earlier may not now be considered as urgent by the new Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hodges). I can assure him that the matters he raised are under consideration. He will have the same response from the new Minister as a matter of continuing Government policy as he would have had there been no change. Senator Mulvihill raised matters of co-operation between police forces. I am advised that the time taken for the completion of penal checks by the Australian Federal Police has been significantly reduced and the average turn round period is currently three weeks. There are no particular difficulties that I am aware of with the current level of State and Federal police co-operation in these matters. Senator Mulvihill raised a question at the Senate Estimates hearing on which I can now supply him with information. He asked whether we were catching up on the backlogs or whether the delays were getting worse. The response to that question is that we are reducing the citizenship backlog overall and the on-hand caseload in the Sydney office fell from 15,760 to 10,285 in the period June 1981 to March 1982. In Melbourne office the on-hand case load was 8,837 in June 1981. It rose to 12,780 in December and has now fallen to 11,196. On an Australia-wide basis the on-hand case load was 41,411 in June 1981 rising to 44,679 in December 1981. It now stands at 40,800. So there has been some reduction in the citizenship backlog. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senate Estimates Committee E reported in May 1982. It drew attention to only one item. This item was virtually a repeat of a matter that was raised in our previous considerations in a report in October 1981. I say at the outset that there has been, from the experience that I have had on the Estimates committees over six years-originally under the chairmanship of Sir Reginald Wright-a vast improvement in the amount of information that each of these committees has had available to them from the departments. It has been my observation that the departmental officers and the senior officers within those departments are anxious to provide the sort of information that honourable senators and the Senate Estimates committees require . I regard the latest details that have been supplied to our Committee as being the most detailed and the most informative that we have received yet. I also pay credit to the Committee secretariat which looked through these figures and provided the Committee with a great deal of information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The particular item on which I wish to address the Senate at the moment deals with the Department of Housing and Construction, as it then was called. I quote from the report of Senate Estimates Committee E in October 1981 which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Of the total of $1,135.6m allocated to the Department, $467.26m is for work carried out on a contractual basis for other Government Departments and Authorities. Because the Department of Housing and Construction is only acting as the contractor, it is not possible for its officers to be questioned on the purpose, background or need of the items involved. As no justification can be sought from the Department of Housing and Construction, the Committee feels it is desirable that each initiating Department should be questioned on the respective amounts. This could be facilitated by individual Departments including an explanation of such expenditure as an appendix to their Explanatory Notes. Only a broad statement of this expenditure need be included in the Department of Housing and Construction's Explanatory Notes. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator McLaren and honourable senators of both sides of the chamber have expressed displeasure on previous occasions when they have had to go from department to department, from Estimates committee to Estimates committee to find the department or the committee in which a particular item that attracts their interest was located. I have been particularly frustrated in asking questions on capital expenditure and capital works to find that the relevant items are all listed under the Department of Housing and Construction and are not listed under the client department. </PARA>

I am pleased to say that in our latest report we make the following comment:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has been informed by the Department of Housing and Construction that it has written to the Department of Finance concerning the adoption of certain procedures to facilitate examination by Estimates Committees of the particulars of new works proposals of individual Departments, as recommended by the Committee in its Report to the Senate of 13 October 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequent to that report being produced I had a visit from senior officers of the former Department and we discussed the way in which the recommendation should be carried out. I am very pleased to say, as Chairman of the Committee, that the solution that was arrived at by that Department has my complete approval. The offer that was made by the former Department of Housing and Construction, which would of course, be subject to the approval of the Department of Finance and client departments, is that any new works to be undertaken by a client department would be listed under the relevant department' s expenditures. Honourable senators who have an interest in that matter could then ask questions of the relevant department as to why a particular building should be built and they could go into the details that they think necessary. We did not regard it as essential that once a building had been commenced any reference be made in subsequent reports but considered that such references could remain in the old Department of Housing and Construction reports. Any subsequent alterations to the costs and estimates would most likely be the responsibility of the client department. I thank the Department for its co- operation and I thank the Government for its ready co-operation in meeting the wishes of Estimates Committee E. </PARA>

As I have suggested previously and as I suggest again now, that is something that we cannot allow to happen. I think we are failing in our duties as members of parliament if we do allow it to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am well aware that there are many problems in the community in coping with the difficulties of these young people. I have spoken with very many of them in drop-in centres and elsewhere and I have found that almost uniformly they are young people who did not do well at school and who now regret that fact. It is the lack of work experience and, indeed, skills in education that are keeping them out of work. I am convinced that the majority of them, if they were offered a work situation which they found acceptable, in which they felt confident and in which they could acquire skills-preferably they should work with their own peer group and have some choice of occupation-would be quite prepared to work hard. If that work element could also have an element of national service in the true sense so that it would be demonstrably something of value to the community and the young people engaged in it would feel that it was so, I am not so cynical about our young people as to believe that it would not appeal to them, as it has appealed to every generation of young people if it has been properly put to them in that way. </PARA>
<PARA> I would think that such work would need to be voluntary. I do not believe that it would be good if it were done on a compulsory basis. My reason for saying that, largely, is that if a scheme is voluntary, it has to produce results. If it is compulsory, it can impose all sorts of things on people and not have to justify itself as a success. I think that that is one of the best reasons for its being voluntary. It should offer a variety of work and concentrate strongly on the acquisition of skills. There should be a very strong training element within it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am encouraged in that view, which I am well aware is deeply debated in the community, almost universally, among people who are thoughtful on this issue, to find that it is also echoed quite strongly by two of the three people who have written the excellent document 'Challenge to Australia', which all honourable senators, I think, must have seen. In that document, Sir Barton Pope, Sir Macfarlane Burnet and Sir Mark Oliphant-I hope that they will forgive me for referring to them as three of the grey eminences of our society-have laid down ' Challenges in planning for the next One Hundred Years', 'Australia's Needs in the Immediate Future', and 'Looking at Today and Tomorrow'-the titles of their three contributions. Sir Barton Pope says:</PARA>
<PARA> We must purge from our society the present uncertainty and despair of our youth . . . National service intake could be increased and, as in other countries, training extended for part time strategic road contruction, logistics, water boring, and use of heavy equipment in the outback, all urgently required for defence from within. Upon release such youth would be better equipped and orientated to a life away from the urban areas. So trained, their services would be sought by the mining and mechanised rural industries where Australia's future activities should lie. This is the recruiting ground for our leaders of the future. Governments must accept some responsibility for the character of our youth. </PARA>
<PARA>That last sentence is perhaps the most important part of what I have quoted. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to Sir Mark Oliphant's view. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> A large and growing part of Australia's G.N.P. is spent on unemployment benefits and on pensions for people still able and willing to work. This at a time when so much remains to be done in this underdeveloped country. Roads, railways, airfields, pipelines for gas and water; electrical grid systems; greater exploration for minerals, oil, gas, and coal, underground water; are some obvious needs that can be satisfied without importing anything or incurring any external debt. To pay people to be idle when these tasks, many urgent, remain undone, seems to me profoundly uneconomic. It confirms the view of the distinguished American diplomat, writer and teacher, George Kennan, that man has not yet learned how to govern. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are hard words but challenging ones. They should be taken to heart, considering their origin. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a great need for community consensus on this subject. That consensus, when it comes, must take the eminently respectable and reasonable view of the trade union movement into account. Such a scheme must not create a sort of subservient class of workers, it should not interfere with the conditions and salaries that unionists have. That should be its first prerequisite, because the viewpoint of the trade union movement in that respect is absolutely sound, and I could not agree with it more. Indeed, if there is any such consensus or an attempt at it, perhaps it would be good to ask the trade union movement first what it thought about that sort of thing, and perhaps suggest some situation in which the trade union movement took a major stake, if not all the stake, in the organisation and running of such a national enterprise, which would achieve some of the things which those two eminent men that I have mentioned have suggested. </PARA>
<PARA> These elements should be regarded as vitally important. Whatever the enterprise is it should have a strong training element; it should not do work which would otherwise be done by unionists, it should be voluntary, and it should be demonstrably in the national interest so that the young people engaged in it feel some sense of satisfaction, prestige and achievement in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> I am raising this matter now during the consideration of the Estimates of the former Department of Employment and Youth Affairs in the hope that the Minister will take it to the new Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) and ask one question: Has the Government thought about whether a scheme such as this might not be brought about? I am sure that the Government has thought about it. I could not believe that it would not do so. Has it, however, just assumed that such a scheme would not be possible because of the automatic opposition of the trade union movement to it? If so, that would be tragic because I believe there are many thousands of young people who are literally rotting, in a psychological sense, who are trapped in a situation which they cannot control and which they cannot get themselves out of. Only the community can get them out of that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> So, I ask the Minister for Finance-and I would like her response on this question, please-whether indeed the Government has considered this, whether it has assumed that it would not work because the trade union movement would automatically be opposed to it and whether it will not now take up this matter in a serious fashion by consultation with the Labor Party and with the trade union movement to see whether something can be done to break this wretched situation which has trapped so many of our young people as victims of a problem not of their choosing and not their fault. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel I ought to rise just for one moment to reply to some of the remarks made by Senator Mason. Whilst agreeing with his general concern that those who are unable to find work in our society should be aided by society in order to recover some of their self-esteem and be prepared to contribute to society should economic recovery present itself under the next federal administration by a Labor Government, nevertheless I think there were two aspects of his remarks which may need to be queried. One was his endorsement of the idea that a program ought to be undertaken whereby our young people were taken out of their city urban environment into the outback and taught how to sink water bores. To be quite frank, what we ought to be doing instead of proposing this fantasy world concept which is applicable to some sort of Benedictine or Chinese Maoist theory of preparing people for life by making them work with their hands--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You were endorsing them, I believe, Senator Mason. What we need to do is prepare our young people for the realities of Australian urban life, for instance, the existence which they find in the western suburbs of Sydney or wherever it might be. To think that some time spent in the outback is going to prepare them for their adult life within Australian society is, I think, not very helpful to them. It is about as helpful as many of the Community Youth Support Scheme projects were in which we found people making candles or doing leather work in the belief that somehow this was meant to prepare them for a contribution to their family's welfare in later years. Senator Mason seemed to be endorsing an idea put forward by some knight by the name of Sir Barton Pope that the Government should be responsible for the character of our citizens. I find in that suggestion a very disturbing thought indeed because I would expect that to be a remark from those who endorse totalitarian governments and their total formation of the character of their citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we are to create Australians who have moral and ethical standards which embrace integrity, perseverance, courage or any of those things which we say make a good character I believe those characteristics, those standards which make up a character which we would applaud, ought to be gained by presenting to our young people models of those individuals who in history, whether from religious traditions or non-religious humanism have achieved those sorts of impacts on human history which are so remarkable. Such persons should be presented as heroic models for our young people. One thinks of Martin Luther King in the United States of America, a great man from a contemporary industrialised Western democracy who showed how non-violent social change can be achieved against the forces of prejudice and so on. One thinks of Gandhi. One thinks of Mother Theresa in Calcutta. I think it is far better to think of a program alerting our young people and inviting them to mould their character on and to adopt as their character base the character of these individuals who are so important in human history rather than thinking that governments can mould character. Once one thinks of governments having the responsibility to mould character, one is in the realm for the justification of all those laws against victimless crimes, for example, which I am sure Senator Mason would think are unnecessary on our statute books. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable senator is talking about character in terms of employment and unemployment he is inviting an argument about the necessity of work in order to prove one's worth as a citizen. Then one enters the question of character and the protestant work ethic and whether there can be a fulfilling human life without the need to contribute to society by way of paid employment. In that respect I believe that many honourable senators and many Australians are now moving to a belief that there is much to be said for the view that there are many realms of human life which do not fall into the realm of paid employment which are valuable and can be undertaken only by those with the character of courage and self-sacrifice which is not required in many paid occupations. So to equate character with the question of employment or unemployment seems to me to be unfortunate. I rose only to make those remarks. Perhaps they are not strictly pertinent to any estimate which is in my mind at the moment. I simply put those remarks in contradistinction to some emphases which were perhaps unintended in Senator Mason's contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly about the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs. This Department is mentioned on page 23 of the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1981-82. There has been some comment and concern expressed about our unemployed youth. I can only say that it is one of the greatest tragedies of our time that such a large number of young people are unemployed and are placed in difficulty when seeking employment today. In my experience there is only one immediate solution to this problem and that is permanent part time employment. School to work transition programs are putting young people in artifical situations. If unemployed people are given a responsibility, albeit on a part time basis, they respond very quickly. They are placed in a real work situation. They have to accept the discipline of appearing at specific times during the week. Very quickly they become part of the work environment. I have seen young people who have opted out of society completely. Some have never had a permanent job in their life. However, once they were placed in a permanent part time environment in industry they very quickly changed their attitude. Instead of opting out of society they decided that it was not such a bad idea to be involved in a real work situation and thus they decided to seek full time employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have discussed this matter with the former Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr MacPhee) but in reply have received only comment along the lines that the matter would be considered. I do wish to take the opportunity to emphasise again in the Senate that if we accepted the principle of providing permanent part time work and threw down to employers the challenge to make at least one position available on a rostered basis we could very quickly, and without significant additional cost, employ at least on a part time basis, all of the unemployed in the community. That would solve a very real social problem, one that is rapidly developing into a situation in which a large percentage of the young people in the community are opting out of society completely and becoming frustrated and disruptive. </PARA>
<PARA> Such trends, if allowed to develop, will reap a very bitter harvest for our country in the years to come. We can solve the problem of youth unemployment immediately; we cannot leave it any longer. It is not one that we can think about and solve tomorrow. It must be solved today. I repeat, to use unemployment as an economic weapon, particularly against the youth of our society, is a crime and an urgent change of direction in Government policy must take place. The problem of youth unemployment must be solved now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of matters have been raised by recent speakers, most of whom have been concerned with the question of youth unemployment and the most sensible approaches that might be adopted in remedying it. In a sense, I am very pleased that there have been multiple contributions because the variety of the approaches taken by Senator Mason, Senator Tate and Senator Siddons help to illustrate why it is not simply a matter of saying: 'We would like a bit of good will in this matter.' There are serious questions as to how one should tackle the problem and they are seen as serious, in most countries that we would regard as equivalent to ours, right around the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the present Government's approach, as would be well known to the Committee, there has tended to be an emphasis on training and work experience programs. In the last Budget there was a change in emphasis, with a considerable real growth in expenditure in this regard, but a decision was made that the Community Youth Support Scheme would no longer be funded. Some of the reasons were reflected in the comments which Senator Tate, in I believe a quite non-partisan way, made in the debate tonight. It is history now that the good points of CYSS became a matter of intense public interest and debate and the Government restored the program but changed the guildelines to try to ensure that more value was obtained from the projects than had been the case before. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple point that I wish to make in response to the contributions of honourable senators is that it is very easy for us to agree that there is a significant problem, both economic and social, in this field. It is very easy to agree that the Government has a responsibility to do things in this area. I hope it is common ground that in the current budgetary period the Government has shown that it is prepared to make an additional effort in a Budget in which it was trying to hold the line. There was certainly an increased allocation in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now faced with suggestions that further and different approaches might be taken. I would not wish to treat those suggestions with disrespect, but I think that it would be disrespectful simply to acknowledge either agreement or disagreement at this stage. I can only say to honourable senators that the question continues to be on the agenda for Government consideration and that I will ensure that the points raised will be taken into account in the course of that consideration. I can understand that Senator Siddons, who says that he has spoken to the former Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs and merely been told that it is under consideration, might think that that is not a very adequate answer. I can only say as one of the Ministers concerned in the deliberations in this area-of course, consideration by other Ministers such as the Minister for Education is relevant in approaching the broad questions which arise, for instance the proper courses to be made available to youth-that certainly the matter is currently on the agenda for joint consideration. Of course, we would like to improve our performance in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I would confess to some modest scepticism about the idea that any wholesale solution can be found by working in the bush. That appeals to me in a personal sense and it would undoubtedly suit some of Australia's youth but I think there is a lot of force in the views put forward by Senator Tate that for a great number of Australia's youth that is not really likely to be part of their long term reality. For that reason I think one has to be cautious in embracing any single approach which might be thought to provide a universal solution. Surely what we have learned from both overseas experience and our own is that there is no single solution. In fact there needs to be a continuous and multifaceted approach to the very real problem of ensuring that all Australian youth find a place in Australian society. To balance the debate a little, it is proper that the Senate should show its concern for the perhaps one in five young people who might be having difficulty fitting into society. It is worth remembering that there is a very significant large group which is not suffering difficulty. One must remember that the system does pick up a substantial number of children in an adequate way. That is not to say in any sense that we are not responsible for or should not be concerned about the others. </PARA>
<PARA> I note also Senator Siddons's suggestion about permanent part time employment. Without having the statistics with me, it is a fact that in Australia recently there has been very considerable growth in part time employment. That is not unusual and is not peculiar to this country. I merely say to honourable senators that matters that they have raised will become part of an ongoing consideration which will include consideration in the Budget context. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Elstob raised a matter of some particularity and I am not sure that I can necessarily give him all the answers that he would wish. My advice is that the contract for courier services for the Commonwealth Employment Service was let to Australia Post by the Department of Administrative Services in the normal course. The Department of Administrative Services acts as the Commonwealth's agent for the letting of such contracts and such contracts are let on the basis of competitive tender. I understand Senator Elstob was concerned at the lack of contact between the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs and the actual contractor. I can only say that these difficulties arise, I suppose of necessity , if we preserve a system in which contractors are not chosen because we like the colour of their eyes or for whatever reason, rather that contracts are put to tender to ensure that there is an opportunity for people to compete and that there is a fair allocation of those contracts. I imagine that Senator Elstob would be on his feet complaining bitterly if for some reason Australia Post was not able to compete for that contract. It is probably inherent in the system that we follow-which is meant to be fair to the community, to ensure that we get best value for money and that those who are interested in doing the work get a chance to compete for it-that some of the difficulties arise that Senator Elstob is concerned about. I suggest that, if he wants to follow up the matter with more particularity, he do so with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee). I think it is unlikely that we can deal with it further in this debate. </PARA>

I would like also to thank the departments involved, which presented to us their Estimates in a form which was such that they required very little additional explanation or questioning, although it seems that honourable senators always find a way of looking for things that are not in the Estimates no matter how well they are presented to them.

I want to thank not only the Committee staff and the departments but also mention the co- operation of the committee members, namely, Senators Coates, Georges, Jones, MacGibbon and Withers.

<PARA> I had intended to apologise to the Department of Transport for not taking up an invitation. I do not know whether this was done. Due to pressure of work, I have not had a chance to examine the Department's training areas. I, and several other members of the Committee, do intend to do so as soon as possible. The Department invited me to undertake the inspection because I seem to criticise continually the amount of money that is spent on training some of its pilots as examiners of airmen. The Department sends some officers overseas for training and it costs this country a considerable amount of money. </PARA>

I would like to hear how it will be handled. The Committee did comment, in its report, on the difference of some $7m in the estimates for wages. I will be pleased to hear the answer to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the Senate Estimates committees are working very well. There is some talk around the corridors that the Committees have become redundant. I do not believe that for a minute. I believe that Estimates committees do a valuable job. Due to the pressure on Estimates committees over the last few years, the estimates are presented to them in a way that reduces the number of questions that have to be asked. I think it would be a mistake if Estimates committees and standing committees, for argument's sake, were combined. I think it is very valuable to have Estimates committees separate from standing committees. I think that is something which the Senate may look at in the near future; it is something which I believe it should look at very closely. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point is that now we have a department responsible for aviation, distinct from the Department of Transport. I hope that, as the aviation sector of transport is of more interest to me than the other area, we will be able to retain that area in Estimates Committee F, which I am lucky enough to chair at this stage. Aviation, of course, is very important to many areas of Australia, particularly to Tasmania because of that bit of water separating us from the mainland. I hope that in the reorganisation, due to the new ministries, that area will remain with this Committee. Finally, I thank the Committee members and the staff for the work they did and also Senator Messner for his help and tolerance when we were trying to extract information that perhaps he thought we should not have. I thank everybody involved and look forward to a reply about the $7m. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment briefly on one point in the estimates relating to the Department of the Capital Territory. I must say at the outset that one always has a feeling of unease when dealing with the Department of the Capital Territory in that there is very little monetary restraint in what it does; no one seems to appreciate the value of money. There is a general belief that the world owes it a living. I think that is well illustrated by an item of expenditure of $848,400 for the provision of child services. Basically this was the cost of looking after 50 or 60 children for a year. All the members of Estimates Committee F were astonished to discover that this was going on. This amount works out at a cost of between $14,000 to $16,000 a year to look after one child. All the parents on the Committee were astonished . In my case, it would cost between $56,000 or $64,000 a year to look after my four children if such a rate of expenditure applied within my family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The disturbing thing is not so much the huge sum of money involved but the attitude of the Department. There is simply no restraint-no upper limit-on what it costs to look after children in these organisations. These are not private organisations; they are charitable organisations such as Dr Barnardo's home, the Marymead children's centre and the Outreach Inc. Home. The Department asks: ' What did it cost you last year to look after the children?' They give their total cost for the year, which the Department divides by the number of children. It divides that by the number of weeks or months in the year and pays the organisation on a pro rata basis. It then comes back for more money in the supplementary estimates. That is an intolerable way of looking after public funds because it works out at a rate of $14,000 to $16,000 a year, at the upper limit, to look after a child. </PARA>
<PARA> The officer answering the questions made the situation even worse because there is no correlation, apparently, between the institutions. One institution charges in excess of or around $250 a week for each child and as you, Mr Temporary Chairman, said, you can keep someone in a hotel for that. Another institution charges $147 a week for each child. That is a very big difference. It costs about $103 to provide exactly the same service. But the story gets even worse because the officer admitted that the Department pays foster parents $30 a week to provide exactly the same service.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hate to repeat what the previous honourable senator spoke about but this was one of the points I was so aware of when it was raised. I think Senator Georges may have asked questions originally and those questions, together with the couple of questions I asked, brought the information to light. The information that came to light, as Senator MacGibbon said, was that children were being looked after at a cost of $250 a week-up to $ 14,000 or $16,000 a year. The point I want to make, without labouring the points already made by Senator MacGibbon, is that it seems very unreal that this Government should expect parents to bring up children on the amount of child endowment it pays and yet one of its departments is now paying $250 a head for children who are its responsibility in a particular area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We must also consider that some working fathers or mothers would be taking home less than $250 a week and keeping a family of two or three. Either the Government's estimate of the amount of child endowment it should pay is very wrong or there has been some sort of neglect or overpayment in the area of child care administered by the Department. I am not sure of the procedures but it seems to me to be such an error that it is nearly unreal that we should approve this sort of estimate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is right. The Estimates Committee asked questions in relation to a particular item and received certain answers. Not only did the answers amaze Opposition honourable senators but also they amazed Government honourable senators. It is absolutely out of this world to expect us as senators responsible for the expenditure of money in the Australian Capital Territory to accept the amount of money that the Department says it is required to pay to keep one child in the A.C.T. I hope I am not being critical of the officers who appeared at the Estimates Committee hearing or of the institutions which look after the children. I am not sure, but I believe that the Government should look at those people who have been handling the care of children and see what sort of officers have been negotiating a deal in relation to that expenditure. That amount of money should not be being paid for one child. I think that somewhere along the line the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) should take a very close look at what is happening in the A.C.T. in relation to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the estimates of the Department of Transport which are contained in Group F and a problem that exists in Port Augusta where attempts have been made over a long period to incorporate the local aerodrome in the local ownership plan. I raised this matter during the Estimates Committee debate on the subject. I pointed out that because of the growing interest in the northern Spencer Gulf area and the increased demands being placed upon the aerodrome, which is in a very mediocre state, I have asked the present Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) to regard this as a matter of importance and to include the aerodrome in the local ownership plan. I am glad to say that at last the Government, through the Minister, has recognised that this matter is important and has approved in principle the inclusion of the aerodrome in the plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the first instance, the original plan for the aerodrome was seen to be a little too sophisticated for the current demands. Apparently at the moment consultations are continuing with respect to the detail of the plan to ensure that what is ultimately put forward to the Department and the Minister for his consideration meets the current requirement. I have a letter to which I refer. It substantiates my concern. It is from the Port Augusta hospital and is written to the Minister for Transport. A copy of the letter was given to me and to other members of parliament. I will read it for the benefit of the Committee to highlight the importance of this airstrip to the northern Spencer Gulf area. The Chief Executive Officer of the hospital, Mr Robins, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> On the night of 12th April 1982, a male patient with gunshot wounds to the head was admitted to this hospital in a critical condition. Following assessment and stabilisation, an aerial retrieval team from Adelaide was called to evacuate the patient. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier that day, another retrieval team enroute to Adelaide had landed at Port Augusta, where upon, the pilot of the aircraft expressed great concern about the poor condition of the runways. When making arrangements for a retrieval team, hospital staff were advised that retrieval team pilots had refused to land at night on the Port Augusta aerodrome because of its extremely hazardous nature. As a result the aircraft landed in Whyalla--</PARA>
<PARA>which is about 50 miles away-</PARA>
<PARA>the retrieval team then travelled by road ambulance to Port Augusta and returned , with the patient to Whyalla for the return flight to Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> As you will appreciate, it is essential that such critically ill patients be evacuated in the minimum time possible with the least movement and added distress; these factors can contribute significantly to fatalities in circumstances such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. Over the weekend in question, three (3) aircraft carrying ill patients were diverted from Port Augusta to Adelaide and Whyalla because of the condition of the Port Augusta aerodrome. Pilots of emergency aircraft have, over the past years, repeatedly criticised the safety standards of the runways. As the major receiving hospital in the area , critically ill patients are evacuated through this hospital, which, with growing frequency and concern, is experiencing difficulty and reluctance by authorities to commit emergency retrieval teams and aircraft to land in Port Augusta. </PARA>
<PARA> The Board of Management of the hospital finds this situation abhorrent. It compromises the care and expertise provided to stabilise and maintain patients until retrieval teams arrive. It unnecessarily places at risk, the lives of patients as a result of excessive delays and movement. The emergency service provided by this hospital is placed in jeopardy, raising serious questions about its capacity to respond to emergency situations. The demise of the hospital's emergency service capability is intolerable and disastrous for this, the remote Northern and Western Communities served by Port Augusta Hospital. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter concludes by demonstrating the urgency of the matter as far as the Port Augusta hospital is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also a base for the Royal Flying Doctor Service. I understand that at the present time consultations are continuing which, I hope, will result in a program being established and a plan being drawn up that will meet the requirements of the current demand. The Minister for Transport has given me the undertaking that he will give it priority. I understand that it is then a question for the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) to determine whether it should have a high priority--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After dinner Senator Peter Rae came into the chamber and accused my colleague Senator McLaren of South Australia of constantly repeating certain defamatory statements in relation to a consultancy firm which had devised a new corporate image for Australian National Railways. It was suggested by the Chairman that the matter be taken up during consideration of the estimates of the Department of Transport. That is what I now intend to do because a statement by Senator Peter Rae, who is a senior senator in this place and a lawyer, that another senator had engaged in such repetition and had made defamatory statements is of some importance. As to the element in his charge that Senator McLaren had engaged in tedious repetition I hardly think--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Peter Rae" NAMEID="0P7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator Peter Rae</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not tedious.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that any repetition in itself should be any great cause for concern because if an honourable senator has a matter that is constantly of concern to him and which he believes ought to be of concern to the Australian people then he has a duty-is quite entitled in any case-to raise it constantly for the attention of the Senate. When one thinks of Senator Peter Rae 's obsession with Trans Australia Airlines, which is constantly reiterated in this place-it is of a destructive kind in my view-and his constructive constant concern with the so-called quasi-autonomous national government organisations or qangos, one can see there is nothing in the charge of constant repetition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to the charge that Senator McLaren has made defamatory statements in relation to the consulting firm I say that if an honourable senator looks at the commercial operations of any organisation and the way in which it operates in society and wants to comment on those operations in the Senate chamber he will highlight or give special attention to certain aspects of that operation. I thought at first that Senator McLaren may have unduly or unfairly highlighted that aspect of the consultant firm's task, undertaken for Australian National Railways, relating to the mere change of name; that perhaps he had left out, as Senator Peter Rae indicated, many other constructive proposals and tasks undertaken by that firm on behalf of Australian National Railways. In fact Senator McLaren asked, on 25 February 1981:</PARA>
<PARA> Was a firm of corporate image consultant experts engaged by Australian National Railways to recommend the new name of 'Australian National'; if so (a) what is the name of the firm; and (b) what was the fee paid for the services rendered. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister, Senator Messner, replied yes. In other words a corporate image consultant expert had been engaged. The Government there admitted that this was indeed the consultant's task-to change the corporate image not only in respect of potential clients of Australian National Railways but also vis a vis the public as a whole. A corporate image consultant was engaged and indeed that was its primary and, I think, sole task. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's answer continued and indicated that there had been three stages to the particular campaign undertaken to change the image of Australian National Railways; that it included, amongst other things, the new name of Australian National. In the question asked by Senator McLaren and in the answer supplied is the indication that the task undertaken by the consultancy firm was indeed a narrow one, that of changing the corporate image of Australian National Railways at a cost of some $400,000. That was the cause of the concern that Senator McLaren raised in his question. It is very clear that if a lawyer of Senator Peter Rae's standing comes into this chamber and accuses another senator of making a defamatory statement he must have some evidence that defamation has occurred. In relation to a trading corporation he has to show, of course, that some real injury was suffered by the corporation in relation to existing or potential clients. No evidence of such injury has been brought forward in the chamber by Senator Peter Rae. In that regard I say that he has not sustained his charge that Senator McLaren has defamed the consultancy firm. As I said, the charge of constant repetition is of no moment. In regard to the serious charge, I wanted briefly to put those remarks on the record by way of rebuttal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that Senator Tate has misunderstood what I said. What I was referring to was not Senator McLaren's question on 25 February 1981 and the reply; I was referring to Senator McLaren's statements this afternoon when he was talking about something quite different- the Marks report. He brought in again his references to Australian National, the change of name and the cost which, he said, was over $400,000 in respect of a consultancy which did no more than advise in relation to dropping the word ' Railways' from the name and giving a new colour image.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that Senator McLaren has raised this issue also in previous debates of this nature not just by way of a question in February 1981 but in relation to the Appropriation Bills. He has referred to it several times. I will be quick in replying to him because I have been asked to be quick, not because I wish to be. What I was saying about repetition is that if it has been brought to somebody's attention that there is at least a basis for reconsidering what that person has quite properly, quite legitimately, raised in the first place and then without making any investigation that person continues to repeat it, then that changes the nature of privilege of this place. That was the point that I was making. That was the point about repetition. That is the point about when we lose the privilege of this place. I simply reiterate that Senator McLaren, I believe, should not be permitted to continue to make a remark which is certainly damaging to Australian National management and to the firm of consultants without at least making an inquiry to find out what was the full nature of the contract in which they were involved, including the development of a corporate management plan, how many people were involved in it, how long it took and what it affected . I have already on two occasions in this chamber, I believe, explained to Senator McLaren what was the true nature of what happened. He has chosen to continue to malign these people without making inquiry. I believe that is behaviour which should not be tolerated. </PARA>

<PARA> That, notwithstanding anything contained in the Standing Orders, the President transmit to the Senate House Committee, as an in camera document, a copy of the complete report by Urwick International Pty Ltd relating to the Joint House Department, the Parliamentary Library and the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that, as a result of the October 1981 Report of Estimates Committee A, the Senate directed its House Committee to inquire into and report upon the organisation, operation, functions and financial administration of the Joint House Department. The Senate empowered the Committee to call for persons, papers and records and, in accordance with normal practice, advertisements were placed to notify interested organisations and individuals of the inquiry and to invite submissions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee received a number of submissions in addition to requests from some honourable senators and honourable members to discuss with the Committee their views concerning the Joint House Department. Certain of the submissions directed the Committee's attention to the review by management consultants of the Joint House Department, the Parliamentary Library and the Parliamentary Reporting Staff which, according to evidence given by the Speaker to House of Representatives Estimates Committee A on 28 August 1980, recommended the amalgamation of those three departments. The Senate House Committee was also informed that there was considerable disquiet among certain of the parliamentary staff that such an amalgamation might be agreed to, and we were urged to exercise the powers given to the Committee by the Senate to call for a copy of the management consultants' report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considered the position it should adopt on this question. The management review was ordered by the Presiding Officers in 1979 and was undertaken by Urwick International Pty Ltd. The cost to the Parliament was $75, 000, which was funded through the expenditure appropriated to the Joint House Department. The Committee determined that, as part of the reference by the Senate directed its inquiry into the organisation and functions of the Joint House Department, a thorough examination would have to embrace any proposals for new functions or the taking over of existing functions from other Parliamentary departments. Accordingly, the Committee wrote to the President on 25 February 1982 and advised him that it was of the opinion that it would be of considerable benefit to its deliberations if a copy of the report were made available. The Committee's letter also offered to classify the report as an in camera document should the President be concerned to limit access to it. The President replied to the Committee on 1 March 1982 stating that he felt obliged to discuss the matter with the Speaker as the report we sought 'was submitted to the Presiding Officers as the officers jointly responsible for the three Joint Departments'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee subsequently commenced its program of public hearings and found the validity of its opinion-that the report would benefit our deliberations- confirmed by the evidence given at the hearings. On 22 April 1982, the President , in his response to a further request for the report, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . on 1 March I wrote to the Speaker informing him of my response to your initial request and indicating that I was of the view that approval should be given to the release of the report to the Committee on an agreed basis of confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, I had discussions on the matter with Mr Speaker but agreement between us could not be reached. </PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances you may consider it appropriate that the Committee now take the matter up directly with Mr Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee, whilst fully aware of its power to continue to deal directly with the President in the matter, nonetheless decided that it would write to the Speaker. The Committee's letter, which was dated 29 April 1982, requested the Speaker to consider agreeing to the President releasing his copy of the report pointing out that to do so would greatly assist in expediting the Committee's consideration of the reference. We also emphasised that the Committee's request was still for the report to be classified as an in camera document. The Speaker replied to the Committee on 3 May 1982 stating that he regarded the report as confidential to the Presiding Officers and that the-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . enquiry into the organisation, operation and functions of the Joint House Department by the House Committee of the Senate is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Such inquiry is in direct conflict with the authority and responsibility which the Presiding Officers have for the operation of the Joint House Department, in particular the statutory powers of the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The Speaker concluded his letter by declining to comply with the Committee's request. Yesterday the Committee replied to the Speaker informing him that whilst we were aware of the powers conferred upon the Presiding Officers by section 9 of the Public Service Act, we did not agree with his claim that the inquiry was in direct conflict with his statutory authority. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard an extract from section 9 of the Public Service Act . </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>

<PARA>Senate House Committee,</PARA>

<PARA>Canberra, ACT</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Martin,</PARA>
<PARA> I have your letter of 29 April in which you ask that I agree to release to the Senate House Committee the Report by the Consultants which dealt with the Joint House Department. This Report embodied the results of an enquiry by Urwick International which was initiated by me as an independent review. </PARA>
<PARA> The Report is confidential to Presiding Officers and its circulation has been restricted to senior officers charged with examining and implementing recommendations. There are aspects of the Report which go to the root of the Presiding Officers's control over the service departments. Some recommendations have been adopted. Others are still being evaluated and assessed. Furthermore the Report covers the three service departments, two of which the Senate Committee is not empowered to enquire into. </PARA>
<PARA> I have indicated previously to you and have informed the Secretary of the Joint House Department that I have no objection to an inquiry in the general nature of a Senate estimates committee form of questioning. I understand that you are receiving information of that kind. I take a quite different view concerning the inquiry moving into areas which are properly the responsibility of the Presiding Officers jointly. </PARA>
<PARA> I have previously indicated to Mr President that I think the enquiry into the organisation, operation and functions of the Joint House Department by the House Committee of the Senate is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Such inquiry is in direct conflict with the authority and responsibility which the Presiding Officers have for the operation of the Joint House Department, in particular the statutory powers conferred on the Presiding Officers through Section 9 of the Public Service Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The operations of the Joint House Department are not the concern of the Senate only. It is a service department serving both Houses and Members of the House could well take a different or contrary view to the Senate Committee. As Speaker I am bound by the Legislation. In the absence of amendment of the Act of Parliament, the House must expect me to carry out my responsibilities of control of the Joint House Department as provided. Certainly I would not be prepared to pass to the Senate Committee any of my responsibility for the organisation, operations, functions and financial adminsitrations of the Department. To accede to your request to provide a confidential administrative report made to the Presiding Officers would not be consistent with our responsibilities in my opinion. Accordingly, I decline to comply with your request. </PARA>

<PARA>18 May 1982</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Speaker,</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate House Committee has now considered your letter dated 3 May 1982, in response to its request that you agree to the President making available to the Committee his copy of the Report of the Management Consultants which dealt with the Joint House Department, the Parliamentary Library and the Parliamentary Reporting staff.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee is aware that section 9 of the Public Service Act confers certain powers upon the Presiding Officers, separately or jointly as the case may be, in relation to the administration of the Parliamentary departments.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee does not agree with your claim that the Senate House Committee's inquiry is in direct conflict with your statutory authority. Ministers have the same statutory responsibilities for the administration of their Departments, yet Parliamentary committee investigations are not opposed on those grounds. Parliament has accepted that information involving public interest or national security may be withheld from Parliamentary committees, but these are not at issue in this instance.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Committee is of the opinion that the statutory responsibility referred to above does not override the responsibility that each Presiding Officer has to respond to the wishes of their respective Houses. This position is embraced in the concept that a Presiding Officer is the servant of his Chamber, not the master.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the duty of each House to take such steps as it thinks necessary to inform itself on matters coming before it. It is for this reason that the Senate House Committee was charged by the Senate to undertake an inquiry into the Joint House Department.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of regret to the Committee that you have chosen not to concur in the release of the document on an in camera basis. The Committee, therefore, has determined that it has no further option but to call on the Senate to direct the President to release his copy of the report to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> As Chairman of the Committee, I will be giving a notice of motion in those terms in the Senate later today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the estimates for the Department of Transport. Before we adjourned the debate to deal with the other matter my colleague, Senator Tate, had raised a matter on my behalf. He defended me-I thank him for it-in regard to an attack made upon me shortly after 8 o' clock this evening by Senator Rae. Senator Rae compounded that attack in his brief reply about 15 minutes ago. I want to quote what Senator Rae said in making that attack. I speak from memory, but I think I am nearly correct. He said that some way had to be found to prevent me from making statements in this chamber which were both libellous and defamatory and which I would not be prepared to make outside. He was referring to statements that I had made concerning the employment of a firm of consultants by Australian National Railways. In every speech that I have made on that matter I have dealt with facts as provided to me by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), through the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), who represents him in this place. Senator Rae misrepresented me when he claimed that the amount of money expended by ANR in engaging the firm of consultants was in fact used for a much wider purpose than that for which I have said it was used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at the facts. These are what I have been relying on every time I have complained. For Senator Rae's information, I state that at no time have I ever attacked that firm of consultants. My complaint and criticism have been levelled at ANR and the Government-mainly at the Government and the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt)-because he would have had to authorise this payment, or brought it about, to have this firm of consultants engaged to do this inquiry. I put a question on notice, No. 372:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLaren asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport, upon notice, on 25 February 1981:</PARA>
<PARA> Was a firm of corporate image consultant experts engaged by Australian National Railways to recommend the new name of 'Australian National'. </PARA>
<PARA>In my question I emphasised the words 'to recommend the new name of Australian National'. My question continued:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if so (a) what is the name of the firm; and (b) what was the fee paid for the services rendered. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer as recorded at page 956 of the Senate Hansard for 31 March 1981 states:</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Messner" NAMEID="9I4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) Yes. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the answer to my specific question. My specific question-I quote it again-was:</PARA>
<PARA> Was a firm of corporate image consultant experts engaged by Australian National Railways to recommend the new name of 'Australian National'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is all I asked-was this firm engaged to recommend a new name-and Senator Messner gave me the answer 'yes' from Mr Hunt. The answer continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Pieter Huveneers, Corporate Positioning and Identification, Milsons Point, New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the firm that was engaged and I have never criticised it in any way. The answer continued:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The study has been undertaken in 3 stages:</PARA>
<PARA> Costs for Stage 1 (Feasibility Study)-$48,350</PARA>
<PARA> Costs for stage 2 (Presentation of Developed Layouts)-$110,311</PARA>
<PARA> Costs for Stage 3 (Preparation of Manuals Artwork, et cetera)-$250,000 ( estimate). This stage is not complete; $86,786 paid to date. </PARA>
<PARA>When we total up those figures we arrive at an amount of $408,671. That is the figure I have used repeatedly when I have said that the ANR has expended that money just to change the image, just to drop the name 'Railways' from the title 'Australian National Railways'. I have always claimed that if we have a railway we ought to call it a railway. As I have said on many occasions in this place, when people are talking about railways they want to have the word 'railways' in their speech, not just the words 'Australian National'. It could be the Australian National anything. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Rae came in here tonight and, in reply to Senator Tate, said that I had referred at some length to this issue tonight. I have the 'pinks' of my speech. When referring to consultants I was dealing with another matter; that is, the Marks report and the Department of Administrative Services. I will quote the only words I used in reference to the ANR and the consultants. When we consult the Hansard record tomorrow we will see that Senator Rae is the real offender in talking about this firm of consultants for the ANR. I would say that he used at least five times as many words as I used in these remarks. These are the words I used-I will read from the 'pinks' which I have in front of me. I spoke about Mr Marks, who was the person engaged by the Department of Administrative services to carry out an inquiry into transport an the car fleet. When speaking about him I said:</PARA>
<PARA> That applies particularly to the employment of Mr Marks who, I understand, is now Chairman of Commissioners of the Australian National Railways Commission. One of the recommendations--</PARA>
<PARA>These are the pertinent words that were used-</PARA>
<PARA>made by a firm of consultants at a cost to the taxpayers of $409,000 was to drop the word 'Railways' from the title 'Australian National Railways'. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Mulvihill by way of interjection asked me:</PARA>
<PARA>What was the charge for that, Senator?</PARA>
<PARA>In reply I said:</PARA>
<PARA> It was $409,000. That is on the public record. That is what the Government paid consultants just to get a new logo, to change the colours of ANR and to drop the word 'Railways'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is all that I said. They are the only words I used tonight in talking about ANR. I know that we cannot talk about transport when dealing with the estimates or appropriations for the Department of Administrative Services. We cannot talk about railways because that Department does not control the railways. Obviously Senator Rae was not aware of that. He came in here and launched into a great tirade of abuse against me because of what I said about the railways. He had to be stopped by the Chair. He was not aware, although he has been a member of this place for longer than I have, that he could not use that device to attack me on that matter. That is all that I said about railways tonight, just as an illustration to point out that this Government seems to have a bent to engage firms of consultants. When it gets them it then recommends that another firm be engaged to do the same job over again. That is what I was complaining about. </PARA>
<PARA> I say again that if anyone has offended the Standing Orders of this chamber tonight and if anyone should be prevented from attacking another person it should not be me; it should be Senator Rae. No doubt, as he is a member of the Standing Orders Committee, from what he said tonight he will endeavour in some way to stop these matters being exposed in the chamber because it has hurt him deeply that the public at large knows that ANR expended nearly $409,000 of its revenue just to get the word 'Railways' dropped. That is what I have been talking about all the time. I have never criticised the firm of consultants. I know nothing about it and I do not want to know anything about it. In the main I have criticised the Government, through its Minister, Mr Hunt, and ANR. The Australian National Railways Commission has never contacted me. I have had no communication from it to point out to me all the things which this consultancy firm was supposed to have done and which Senator Rae said it did. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Messner in his reply never told me that. He never said that this expenditure was used for anything other than what I asked him about and that concerned changing the name of the Australian National Railways and recommending a new name. To my question asking whether this had been done I was given the answer: 'Yes'. Who am I to believe? Am I to believe Senator Messner, who answered in this place on behalf of Mr Hunt, or am I to believe Senator Rae who came in here in all his glory at 8 o'clock tonight and told us that this firm, through the money which was paid to it did many other jobs? I would have thought that had the firm done all of these other jobs Senator Messner would have told me that in his answer. I am not a mind reader. Of course, I could not know whether that money, or part of it, had been spent on doing other jobs for which the firm was engaged. I was not concerned about that. I repeat again--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Three matters have emerged so far in this debate which deserve some attention. Firstly , Senator Jessop raised the question of Port Augusta Airport. I think that there is a great deal of concern locally about this matter. Concern has been expressed in many forums, including this chamber during Question Time. It has been expressed to the present Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt) and the former Department of Transport about the status of this set of negotiations. There is a need for the Government to consider the proposal which Senator Jessop advocated in terms of Budget priorities. No doubt that will be taken into account in the next few months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter which was raised by Senator MacGibbon and commented upon by Senator Jones related to the Department of the Capital Territory and the cost of funding the care of children in various institutions in the Australian Capital Territory . Those institutions are run by church groups and/or welfare agencies within the Capital Territory. I think the general thrust of the argument was that the cost of caring for people in those circumstances is quite considerable. Figures such as $14,000 a year were mentioned. I should point out that first of all it is important to recognise that the children who are being cared for in these circumstances come from broken homes or are parentless and perhaps are in a state which we would call very disturbed. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite. It would be expected that the cost of looking after them in the institutions set up in the Territory for that purpose would be considerably more than that of looking after them in one's own home. I believe that we should acknowledge that. It is important also to acknowledge-and this did not emerge from questioning in the Estimates Committee-that the cost of looking after children in these circumstances in the Territory is not significantly different from the cost of looking after children in State institutions in the various States. In fact, the costs are reasonably comparable . So, on the whole, one cannot be satisfied entirely that the costs are not somewhat higher than might otherwise be expected, but the Department is well aware of the high cost, a fact which emerged during the discussion in the Estimates Committee. Taking into account the kind of care that is offered in the various institutions and the need for an overall balance in financial priorities , the Government is currently undertaking a review of the situation and no doubt will have more to say on the matter in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third point, which was raised by Senator Townley as Chairman of the Committee, related to the question of salary and the Committee's concern in relation to identification of an underprovision for salaries in the estimates of the Department of Transport before the Appropriation Bill was actually finalised . Honourable senators will appreciate that the Department of Finance does examine the reasonableness of salary and other departmental estimates, frequently detecting inadequacies in those estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> That the examination of the Department of Transport's salary estimates was not as effective this year is partly explained by the move away from uniform to individual award increases. As these individual awards involve penalty rates, shift allowances and varying dates of effect for over 100 occupational categories and almost 500 separate designations within the Department of Transport, the broad review techniques, together with the advice provided by the Department of Transport on which the Department of Finance relied, did not reveal the underprovisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Other factors included the timing of some determinations, which made it impracticable for departments to take into account the preparation of the draft Bill. The Department of Transport also indicated in its evidence to the Committee additional reasons which led to the underprovision. The Department of Transport and Construction and the Department of Aviation are to examine carefully their own procedures with a view to reducing errors of this kind so that adequate provision may be advised in sufficient time for their inclusion in the Bill. The Department of Finance is reviewing its own processes in the light of that as well. </PARA>
<PARA> There remains the question, raised by the Committee, of whether and how the Government can validly fund the underprovision. The funding, which relates to salary and like payments, is urgent and the underprovision was not foreseen until after the last day on which it was practicable to include the provision of the Bill. I suggest that these circumstances allow, in terms of the legislation and the statement to the Senate of the Minister for Finance on the Advance to the Minister for Finance in May last year, the funding of the underprovision validly from the Advance. I suggest that there might also be scope for funding some of the underprovision under section 5 of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1981-82 , which relates to the funding of award increases, and under section 37 of the Audit Act 1901, which relates to transferring provisions within a subdivision of an appropriation Act. These matters will be examined by the Government over the next few weeks and the course adopted will be reported to Parliament in the normal manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that the then Acting Minister for Transport had written to the Minister for Finance on 19 April 1982 seeking advice on the means for funding the underprovision. The Minister for Finance indicated that she did not believe that seeking an amendment to the Appropriation Bill was practicable, especially in view of the other avenues that were open to the Government. The Minister for Finance also noted in her reply that officers of the departments of Transport and Finance would need to consider a number of matters related to the underprovision. One other point might be made in relation to the reference by Senator McLaren to the $400,000 cost of rationalising and designing a new corporate image for Australian National Railways. It is true that the question answered the specific point raised by Senator McLaren but of course it did not give further information as to the broader expenditure which was incorporated in that $400,000 worth of costs. I make that point now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I raise the case of Brett Anthony Collins, a deportation matter which did receive some attention earlier today from Senator Mulvihill and also, in reply, from the Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. I believe that the importance and urgency of this matter and some of the principles aroused by it justify the attention of the Senate in a little more detail even, I acknowledge, at this very late hour. The Government, or more accurately the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hodges), proposes to deport Collins and that order will take effect on Friday of this week unless it is countermanded or some further legal proceedings intervene. I want to add my voice to what is a growing chorus demanding that that decision be revoked. I believe it is a case of quite considerable importance not only to the individual concerned and to his family. It also throws into sharp relief the principles and basis upon which the decision to deport is exercised-an area of administrative practice which, of course, has also been thrown into sharp relief in recent times by the equally insensitive behaviour of the Minister's predecessor in the context of Pochi and Barbaro.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The story in respect of Collins, briefly, is as follows. He came to Australia from New Zealand in 1968. In 1971 he was convicted of armed robbery and assault and sentenced to 17 years gaol. Nobody could possibly doubt that the offences for which he was convicted were very serious. Nobody could possibly have believed at that stage of Mr Collins's career as a future Australian citizen that he had very much going for him. However, ten years later, on 11 June 1980, he was released with parole until 1989. On 4 July 1980 the then Minister, Mr Macphee, ordered that he be deported. In November-December 1980 he appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal constituted by Mr Justice McGregor. In January 1981 there was a decision upholding the deportation order. In mid-1981 the Federal Court of Australia quashed the decision of Mr Justice McGregor. In December 1981 there was a rehearing before Mr Justice Davies and on 30 April 1982, just a few weeks ago, a judgment was given by Mr Justice Davies that the deportation order be upheld. So we had a period of 21 months elapsing between the making of the original order and the final AAT decision. I suggest to the Senate that that is a very important period, that 21 months, because it enabled Mr Collins to demonstrate publicly his concerns and his abilities, and also qualities that can be said, and certainly have been said by many people, to be of courage and persistence which he had already arguably begun to display while he was in prison. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me mention briefly some of those activities of Mr Collins in that 21-month period. In the first place, he assumed a very significant role in the administration of Glebe House, a halfway house for prisoners in Sydney established not very long ago. He assumed the responsibility for the administration of that establishment about six months after his release. In that position he has been accountable to several funding bodies, namely the Department of Corrective Services in New South Wales, the Department of Youth and Community Services and the Drug and Alcohol Authority. He has been administering a budget of some $80,000. Glebe House has been a conspicuous and immense success in that it has significantly lowered the rate of recidivism, certainly when compared with other halfway houses, and it has an excellent reputation with those, including magistrates, who are concerned with the administration of justice in New South Wales. Secondly, Mr Collins has been very active and visible as a spokesman and leading figure in the Prisoners Action Group. He certainly has been involved in some activities which have caused irritation to the government establishment. Certainly he has been a thorn in the side of those who have wanted to ignore the issues of prison reform. For example , I refer to his involvement in the recent case in New South Wales against certain prison officers. Thirdly, he has been involved in an organisation known as the Prisoners Legal Service which operates as an advisory committee to the Legal Services Commission of New South Wales. It was set up in 1981 to monitor the legal services provided by the Legal Services Commission to prisoners in New South Wales. In this respect, in relation to his activities, I seek leave to incorporate a one-and-a-half page letter to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs from Ms Susan Armstrong, the Assistant Ombudsman in New South Wales, which deals particularly with the prison reform activities of Mr Collins.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>18426</PARA>
<PARA>SA:DS 13 May 1982</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Hodges</PARA>
<PARA>Re: Brett Collins-Deportation Order</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing to ask you to review your decision to deport Brett Collins, which I understand is likely to have effect at the end of this week. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not a personal friend of Mr Collins, and I do not agree with all his views on prisons or prison reform. However, my job as Assistant Ombudsman in N.S.W.- which is the position which has prime responsibility for dealing with complaints from prisoners and complaints against police-has brought me into contact with his work on behalf of the Prisoners Action Group and Glebe House, and I believe that he is performing a most valuable role in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The issues on which Mr Collins acts as spokesman and activist are issues of fundamental importance, which need to be the subject of public discussion and on which the voice of prisoners must be heard. I believe that the emergence of the Prisoners Action Group-and in particular Mr Collins-as a spokesman for prisoners has contributed significantly to their greater willingness to seek the changes they desire through established political and legal channels rather than through acts of senseless violence or destruction-as, for example, occurred in the burning of Bathurst Gaol. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Mr Collins has played a role of some importance in fostering the use of orthodox and legal avenues of approach among the prison population.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that Mr Collins is, and is recognised as, the key figure in the prison reform movement. It may be unfair, but his deportation would certainly be viewed by prisoners as a deliberate means of depriving them of their chief spokesman and there can be little doubt that the level of frustration and anger among inmates would rise accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that, if he is permitted to remain in this country, Mr Collins will be able to make a most valuable contribution to the Australian society. He is clearly strongly committed to work in an area where people of intelligence and energy who wish to work within the established political and legal systems are rare and greatly needed. His work at Glebe House-which performs a most useful function and to which this office has referred prisoners on their release -has been particularly valuable and I have no reason to suppose it will not continue. I understand that he has recently completed an Arts degree, and wishes to undertake studies in law, and my knowledge of his abilities would lead me to believe he could make a most useful contribution in this. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears to me that Mr Collins is, in fact, an exceptionally striking instance of successful rehabilitation. </PARA>
<PARA> When the deportation order was first made on his release from gaol in mid 1980, I could not have quarrelled with the Minister's view that, in accordance with normal policy, the likelihood of his reoffending made deportation appropriate. However, two years have now passed and to my knowledge no suggestion that he has been, or is likely to be, involved in illegal activity has ever been made, and he has clearly demonstrated his willingness to work through existing legal and political mechanisms. I understand that the extent of his 'unlawful' activities to be his involvement with organised civil demonstrations, an activity which he shares with a very large number of most respectable citizens-including, at a recent Sydney demonstration, eight bishops. I have never heard it alleged that Mr Collins has been involved in violence at demonstrations. The extent of Mr Collins commitment to his political activities would make it, in my view, most unlikely that he would jeopardise his position through any such illegal action. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, I believe that Mr Collins is playing a most valuable role within the Australian community, and that this is widely recognised even by people who may disagree with some or all of his views. People of his ability, intelligence and commitment are needed in this country if the democratic political system is to function fairly and effectively, and I would urge most sincerely that you reconsider the decision to deport him. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours faithfully</PARA>
<PARA>Susan Armstrong Assistant Ombudsman</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to quote one passage from that letter to indicate to the Senate its importance. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I believe that the emergence of the Prisoners Action Group-and in particular Mr Collins-as a spokesman for prisoners has contributed significantly to their greater willingness to seek the changes they desire through established political and legal channels rather than through acts of senseless violence or destruction-as, for example, occurred in the burning of Bathurst Gaol. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Mr Collins has played a role of some importance in fostering the use of orthodox and legal avenues of approach among the prison population.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition to those activities, Mr Collins has been involved in university studies. In 1980 he completed a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of New South Wales, a degree which he commenced while in prison. He is now enrolled, I understand, as a law student in the post-graduate diploma of criminology course at the University of Sydney Law School. In relation to his family and personal background, Mr Collins has remarried following a divorce which occurred during his imprisonment. The evidence given to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and not, I understand, in any way subject to dispute, is that he and his wife are, indeed, very happily married. His wife testified to the effect that the period of their relationship since his release has been an extremely important, creative, constructive and satisfying period in her life. He has re-established contacts with his son by a first marriage. It is acknowledged by everyone concerned in this case, including Mr Justice Davies, that his wife and son would suffer seriously if he were deported. </PARA>
<PARA> An impressive feature of this case is the array of glowing testimonials which have been given publicly or privately on Mr Collins's behalf by a number of highly credible people. I have already incorporated the testimonial from Susan Armstrong, the Assistant Ombudsman of New South Wales. I simply mention that others who testified to Mr Collins's considerable personal qualities and who have opposed the decision to deport him include Mr John Baston, senior lecturer in law at the University of New South Wales and a barrister, Mr David Brown, lecturer in law at the University of New South Wales and also a practising barrister and solicitor, Mr Rod Madgwick, barrister and National President of the Australian Society of Labor Lawyers; the South Australian Prisoners Action Committee and Lenn Lehmann, the well known convenor of that committee; and various other people such as barrister and senior journalists who have spoken favourably in one way or another of Mr Collins at the various hearings in which he has been involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The crucial aspect of this decision to deport, is, of course, the adverse decision that was brought down by Mr Justice Davies on the rehearing of this matter in April 1982. It is that decision which, I believe, deserves some scrutiny by the Senate-not that it is appropriate at this hour to give it very close scrutiny-and more particularly, the weaknesses in that decision deserve very close scrutiny by the new Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Hodges. While I take the view that Mr Justice Davies is a competent and usually sensitive judge, on this occasion, from a reading of the 55-page decision put down in this case, I believe that it is quite unsatisfactory in a number of respects. These are matters which should be very closely borne in mind by Mr Hodges in reviewing, as I hope he is, this case. The basic elements in the judgment are these: The judge reviews very carefully the whole background of Mr Collins, his activities in the period during his release, the family networks and support systems he has developed and so on and in relation to all those things basically, on balance, comes down favourably to Mr Collins. One extract from the decision in this respect on page 55 is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I accept that many of his activities-particularly his work as administrator of Glebe House, as an assistant to the Legal Services Commission, as a counsellor to prisoners and former prisoners and as an intelligent person with an extensive experience of the prison system who can advise on problems affecting prisoners-serve a very useful function and are of considerable benefit to the community. </PARA>
<PARA>But having acknowledged that and having made all the other points I referred to briefly in passing, the judge then goes on to find that on balance he believes that the retention of Mr Collins as a member of the Australian community will involve some risk to the Australian community, that there is a danger of recidivism in Mr Collins's case. That may be so but it is not a danger that emerges very clearly at all from my reading of this case. I believe that a number of other aspects of the judgment warrant more concern even than that, that on balance the judge may have got things wrong. I believe in particular that a quite undue weight was given to Mr Collins's political beliefs, and more especially his participation in political demonstrations. I believe that it is clear that an unfavourable view was taken by the judge of his involvement in the prison reform movement and that while his work in Glebe House is described, as I said, as laudable, on page 23 of the judgment the judge puts it in this way:</PARA>
<PARA>but it is not the same thing as the adoption of an ordinary occupation. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, and even more disconcertingly, there is a clear suggestion that that it is immature or unsound for someone in his mid-thirties to be 'actively involved in demonstrations for a variety of causes'. That is on page 21 of the judgment. God help many of us in the labour movement-indeed many of us on both sides of politics-who at one stage or another in our adult lives, not least in our thirties, have been actively involved in demonstrations for causes in which we believe! There is further a clear suggestion that a passionate commitment to a cause is in itself a dangerous quality or at least a demonstration of unreliability of a kind which can apparently give credence to the claim that a person is a risk to the Australian community. I think these sorts of remarks are disturbing becasue they suggest that considerations quite irrelevant to the purpose for which the power to deport convicted persons under section 13 of the migration Act exists. </PARA>
<PARA> To move quickly-I will not take the time of the Senate much longer-to the issue which is central, clearly, to the exercise of ministerial discretion, that is the question of the likelihood of recividism, I believe again the judge's remarks are simply not satisfactory. Senator Durack may nod his head in sleep over there and look vaguely amused by the concern I am expressing for this case at this late hour--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Crichton-Browne is in the chamber listening. With his reputation in these matters it is a sign of a welcome change of heart and mind that he is taking seriously and listening earnestly to what I am saying. There is a suggestion in Mr Justice Davies's decision that the possibility of the commission of summary offences at demonstrations is relevant when manifestly it is no more relevant to Collins than to anyone else engaged in legitimate political activities. The further point which I make demonstrates some clear antipathy on the part of the judge to the political activities as such of this gentleman. In relation to demonstrations, Mr Justice Davies drew the inference that Collins-I quote from page 21 of the judgment:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>has not entirely cast off the traits which I think led to the crimes for which he was convicted. </PARA>
<PARA>In this part of the judgment, on page 22, a strange test is advanced relating to his 'inability to control his thoughts'. There is the suggestion that 'his mind concentrates unduly upon the present to the exclusion of other matters which he ought to take into consideration'. This appears to be amateur psychology at its worst which would be ludicrous were it not so important to the future of this individual and those who have come to depend, in a family sense, on his presence in Australia and those in the more unfortunate sections of our community who have come to depend on the very active spokesman-like role which he has played in the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally in respect of the likelihood of recidivism by Mr Collins, the judge seems to be taking into account on page 22 the fact that his criminal activities commenced at a fairly early age. On page three he says that the juvenile convictions and the facts surrounding them are 'facts which tend to increase the risk of recidivism'. Again in respect to that one finds it very difficult to believe that that can possibly be a serious consideration. Even after all of this and the extraordinary array of propositions which seem to bear upon the judge's final decisions, all of which I have suggested in one way or another are less than satisfactory, the judge, on page 22, states:</PARA>
<PARA> Probably, Mr Collins will not again commit a major crime. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a clear acknowledgement that the probability, not the possibility, is that there will be no recidivism. Yet, inexplicably, that remark is immediately followed by the statement by the judge that he 'cannot conclude that there is no significant risk of recidivism'. That is the situation that arises from this judgment. The key to it all is perhaps, finally, in the summing up on pages 54 and 55 when the judge, having acknowledged that there is an inability if Mr Collins were in New Zealand to pursue his interest in prisoners' rights, states:</PARA>
<PARA> On the whole, however, it seems to me that his continuing association with prisoners and demonstrations--</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . his continuing association with prisoners and demonstrations is more likely to lead to volatile situations in which he may commit a major crime than would be the case should he devote his energies to pursuing a less emotional interest. </PARA>
<PARA>All this is said in the face, as I have indicated, of a very considerable body of evidence from a number of people that he would not re-offend and in the face of the judge's conclusion that the probability is that Collins will not commit another major offence. I think I have said enough-no doubt for Senator Durack more than enough-to indicate to the Senate that this case deserves, notwithstanding the adverse judicial finding, some very serious reconsideration by the Minister and some very urgent reconsideration, because the order is scheduled to take effect in 48 hours' time, of just whether there has been a proper basis for the deportation order. Surely the relevant criteria that should be applied by the Minister are the real likelihood of recidivism, the contributions to the community which the person has made, the family ties and the social networks that the person has created and the dislocation to them that will result if the person has to leave the community.</PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me, as I said in the context of the Pochi and Barbaro matters, that a deportation should be made by the Minister only when the strongest possible probative evidence is available to him of involvement and likely continuing involvement by that person in an activity which is totally incompatible with that person's continued membership of the Australian community. I find it impossible to believe on the very large amount of material which I have scrutinised in relation to this case that that criterion or, indeed, any of the others I have mentioned could possibly be satisfied. I urge the Minister to revoke the order and to do so on the basis that the judicial decision was manifestly insensitive to the basic principles which should be applied in this area. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes, through the Sub-Commission's Special Rapporteur on Indigenous Populations, Mr Jose R. Martinez Cobo, who was appointed in 1971 and visited Australia in 1973. Material on inter alia the treatment of Aboriginals in Western Australia and Queensland was provided during his visit to Australia in 1973. Further information was conveyed to Mr Martinez Cobo in March 1975 and in May 1980. Mr Martinez Cobo is expected to submit his final report to the Sub- Commission's 1982 Annual Session.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia also provided written information to the Sub-Commission on the situation of Aboriginals in Queensland, Western Australia and elsewhere in Australia in response to a statement made by a representative of the Minority Rights Group to the Working Group of the Sub-Commission on Slavery and Slavery- like practices on 15 August 1979. On 3 September 1980 the Australian observer to the Sub-Commission also provided information on Aboriginals in Queensland and Western Australia in response to a statement made by a representative of the National Aboriginal Conference speaking under the auspices of the World Council of Indigenous Peoples which had raised a number of issues relating to Aboriginal policy in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes, in paragraph III.1 of Sub-Commission Resolution 8 (XXXIII).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In accordance with its obligations under the International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Australia has provided three regular periodic reports to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. These reports were submitted in July 1975, August 1979 and July 1981. All three reports have included material on the situation of Aboriginals in Australia. Australia has also been represented at the sessions of the Committee where its reports have been discussed, and has responded to questions raised by Committee members in relation to the Reports. These sessions were held on 6 and 12 April 1977, 6 August 1979 and 4 and 5 March 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> Pursuant to United Nations Economic and Social Council Resolutions 728F and 1503 the United Nations Human Rights Commission and Sub-Commission have developed special confidential procedures relating to communications concerning human rights and the provision of human rights information. Australia has co- operated fully with these bodies in their enquiries relating inter alia to Aboriginal issues.</PARA>
<PARA> In the course of Australia's multilateral diplomacy within the UN framework, the question of Aboriginals has been raised in a variety of contexts over the years. Australian representatives have, of course, provided relevant information as required.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes, pursuant to paragraph III (I) of Sub-Commission resolution 8 (XXXIII). The Government has been examining the provisions of the convention and has not as yet responded formally to the Sub-Commission's request. The Government however continues to have doubts about the convention and considers that it reflects a number of outmoded concepts. For example, the convention's emphasis on 'integration' does not accord with the Government's current policy of recognising the fundamental right of aboriginals to retain their identity and traditional lifestyle if desired. On this point, we understand that the ILO is looking at the possible need to redefine the objectives of ILO Convention No. 107, replacing the present emphasis on integration by the principle of respect for the indigenous population's identity and wishes. This would be consistent with the Australian Government position in respect of this convention.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The question of an international legal regime to protect indigenous populations has been raised on a number of occasions in multilateral fora over recent years. The most significant development has been the adoption by the 38th Session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in March 1982 of a proposal of the UN Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and the Protection of Minorities to set up a working group to examine the rights of indigenous peoples and to draft a set of standards to protect those rights. This United Nations' initiative followed several international non-Government organisation conferences relating to indigenous peoples. The most notable of these was the Third General Assembly of the World Council for Indigenous Peoples (WCIP) held in Canberra from 27 April to 2 May 1981 which agreed on a charter of rights for indigenous peoples. It is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of all conferences since 1970 dealing with the question of conventions concerning indigenous peoples, many of which were conducted under non-Government auspices.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Australia is not a member of the Sub-Commission but sent an observer to the 34th Session of the Sub-Commission during which the proposal was originally formulated. As a member of the UN Commission on Human Rights, Australia was in a position to give its full support to this initiative at the Commission's recently concluded 38th Session. As regards non-Government organisation conferences, no provision was made for official Government representation at the Third General Assembly of the World Council for Indigenous Peoples although Australian officials observed the proceedings and assisted with arrangements. A delegation from the National Aboriginal Conference attended the conference and supported the charter proposed.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's position in support of measures to protect the rights of indigenous peoples, demonstrated specifically by our support for the Commission on Human Rights initiative to set up the working group, remains unequivocal. The Government recognises the special vulnerability of indigenous peoples to violations of fundamental human rights and wishes to see effective international standards developed which deal with the particular needs and aspirations of indigenous peoples in every part of the world. The Government regards close consultation with representatives of indigenous peoples themselves as crucial to the drafting of such standards.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister in Federal Affairs and Public Service Matter has supplied the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Former officers of the Australian Public Service (APS) who are eligible for re-appointment fall into three categories:</PARA>
<PARA> those persons who have resigned from the APS;</PARA>
<PARA> those persons who have been retired from the APS; and</PARA>
<PARA> some persons covered by the officers' mobility provisions in Part IV of the Public Service Act.</PARA>
<PARA> Statistics are not available on applications for re-appointment by staff in any of these categories.</PARA>
<PARA> The third category requires clarification. The Public Service Amendment Act 1978 came into operation on 15 March 1981. This Act repealed and replaced the Officers' Rights Declaration Act with the new officers' mobility scheme now contained in Part IV of the Public Service Act. This scheme provides a two-tier arrangement. The first tier covers Australian Public Service officers who are selected for employment with Commonwealth authorities or certain non- Commonwealth authorities for up to 3 years. The second tier covers those officers who, at the end of the 3 year period, decide to remain with authorities . The second tier also includes:</PARA>
<PARA> those persons covered by the Officers' Rights Declaration Act for 3 or more years who elect to join the mobility provisions;</PARA>
<PARA> those persons whose absence from the Service on leave without pay exceeds 3 years, and who are employed by either the Postal or Telecommunications Commissions; and</PARA>
<PARA> those persons compulsorily transferred to the Postal Commission, the Telecommunications Commission, the CSIRO, the National Gallery, the Australia Council, the Commonwealth Accommodation and Catering Service and from the Australian Legal Aid Office.</PARA>
<PARA> Although a person covered by the second tier ceases to be an officer of the Service, he retains certain rights. These rights include transfer and promotion to Public Service positions and a person who is successful in gaining a transfer or promotion, and subsequently takes up duty in the position, is deemed to have been reappointed. A person in the second tier may also apply for re-appointment in certain circumstances. Such an application is dealt with by a Re-appointments Review Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It has been necessary to establish only one Re-appointments Review Committee to consider one case to date. The three members of the Committee were the Chairman of one of the Promotions Appeal Committees, a member nominated by the Public Service Board and a member nominated by the relevant staff association. The one application submitted to the Committee was brought to finality by other administrative action agreed to by the person concerned, resulting in his re-appointment at the classification level he held when he left the Service for employment in a statutory authority.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) obliges each non-nuclear weapon State Party to the Treaty not to manufacture or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices and not to seek or receive any assistance in the manufacture of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. The Treaty also imposes the obligation on each non-nuclear weapon State Party to the Treaty to accept International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA) safeguards for the exclusive purpose of verification of the fulfilment of its obligations assumed under the Treaty with a view to preventing diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.</PARA>
<PARA> Article X of the NPT provides that any State Party has the right to withdraw from the Treaty if it decides that extraordinary events related to the subject matter of the Treaty have jeopardised its supreme interests. Such a Party would have to give three months notice to all other States Parties and the United Nations Security Council which notice must include a statement of the extraordinary events it regards as having jeopardised its supreme interests.</PARA>
<PARA> The NPT is the principal international instrument aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. It is a persuasive symbol of a broad-based international consensus and an important deterrent to proliferation. The strength of this consensus is demonstrated by the fact that 113 States have already adhered to the NPT. Abrogation of the Treaty by any State Party would have serious political and economic consequences. Such a State would forfeit its access to supplies of nuclear material and expertise. No State party has ever withdrawn from the Treaty except the Socialist Republic of Vietnam which in 1979 advised the three depositary governments for the treaty that it did not consider its self bound by the treaties and agreements signed by the former Saigon administration.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. However, in June 1981 the Board of Governors of the IAEA approved a nuclear safeguards agreement between the IAEA and Vietnam covering the Dalat reactor in connection with the supply of nuclear fuel for it from the USSR. This suggests that Vietnam proposes to recommence operating of the reactor.</PARA>

<PARA> In a report in the West Australian of 19 September 1981, Mr Robert Riley, Chairman of the Aboriginal Child Care Agency, expressed serious concern at the number of Aboriginal children lost from the Aboriginal society through activities of the State Community Welfare Department. Mr Riley said that according to 'Children in Limbo'-a report recently published-66 per cent of children in long term care in Western Australia in community welfare institutions and placed with white foster parents were Aboriginals. The Aboriginal community was only 2.3 per cent of the State's total population. Mr Riley said that the Minister for Community welfare, Mr Hassell, had indicated that foster parents might soon be able to adopt children who had been in their care for two years. Mr Riley said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'This means that a lot more Aboriginal children will be lost from the state's Aboriginal community. Under the old assimilation policy children were forcibly taken from Aboriginal communities and put in missions. This proposal to ease adoption regulations is exactly the same, only more thorough.'</PARA>
<PARA> Is the loss of cultural identity a matter which is within the charter of the Human Rights Commission? Can the Attorney-General indicate when the Human Rights Commission will be established and able to deal with such cases?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The scope of the powers and function of the Human Rights Commission are laid down in the Human Rights Commission Act. Broadly, the Commission is required to investigate complaints that Commonwealth law or practices infringe human rights and it is empowered to review legislation to conduct research and educational programs.

<PARA> The Chief Minister visited Paris from 26-29 April for discussions with French government organisations in the power generation field, including nuclear energy. The Government understands that there was some discussion about sales of Australian uranium to France.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's nuclear safeguards policy as announced by the Prime Minister on 24 May 1977 does not require existing nuclear weapon states such as France to be parties to the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in order to be eligible to purchase Australian uranium. However Australia's policy does require an assurance from such states that nuclear material supplied by Australia for peaceful purposes will not be diverted to military or explosive purposes and that it will be covered by International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.</PARA>
