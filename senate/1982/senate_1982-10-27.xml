<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:-</PARA>
<PARA>That:</PARA>
<PARA> The Great Barrier Reef is unique and is included on the World Heritage List.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act was to create a marine park to provide for the proper protection and management of The Reef, only 14 per cent of the total area defined in this Act as the Great Barrier Reef Region has been declared marine park.</PARA>
<PARA> The only insurance against an oil drilling blowout in Reef waters is to prohibit oil drilling in the Region and its vicinity.</PARA>
<PARA> This can only be effected by declaring the whole area of the Region a marine park under the above legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should request the Government to take action to hold a referendum together with the next Federal Elections on the question that:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The entire area of the Great Barrier Reef and its surrounding waters, defined as the Great Barrier Reef Region in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, as amended 1978, be immediately declared a marine park under the provisions of that Act.'</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>14th October 1982.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Michael Townley,</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, A.C.T. 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Townley,</PARA>
<PARA>PRIVATE MEMBERS BILL. SOUTH-WEST TASMANIA As Tasmanians we are appealing to you to support the proposed private members bill, declaring the Franklin River ''an inviolable national park''.</PARA>
<PARA> When Mr Gray became leader of the State Parliamentary Liberal Party, he announced the No. 1 policy was an ''immediate start to negotiations with the Federal Government to have Bass Strait declared a strike free national sea road, backed by State and Federal legislation''. This was deemed essential to promote business confidence to invest in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA> After gaining Government this policy has been shelved in favour of the emotional appeal of the ''Dam is Essential for Survival''. (Examiner Oct. 11). The dam is to be a panacea which will automatically ensure business investment for the State.</PARA>
<PARA> While the World economy is expected to improve, will boom conditions in mining and metal industries return to Australia? These industries were the principal users of the State's electricity.</PARA>
<PARA> Experts have pointed out that a South-West power scheme has a longer lead time than a thermal power station. The Turnbull Report (Sept 81) is even more relevant today. ''The State could be faced with the bleak prospect of attempting to sell off an excess of expensive, non competitive power''.</PARA>
<PARA> We have a Premier who has tried to correct the former Labor Government's economic mismanagement, but he has shown his inexperience in his handling of the South-West issue.</PARA>
<PARA> We are a State of only 427,300 people, reliant on the goodwill of mainland people. Is it rational that Mr Gray should antagonise the media and people of the mainland inorder to safeguard jobs for hydro construction workers?</PARA>
<PARA> It is time the Federal Government took action concerning Mr Gray's barrage of public statements-the warnings to Mr Fraser to keep out of the South-West, and threats of secession from the Commonwealth. For how long should a Federal Government be subservient to a Premier representing only 3% of Australia's population?</PARA>
<PARA> If we accept World Heritage Listing, The South-West would become only the thirtieth natural area so listed. Surely this would benefit all Australia, and particularly Tasmania. Overseas people would become aware of Tasmania as a place of scenic beauty, worthy of inclusion in an overseas tour.</PARA>
<PARA> At stake is a power station with a small generating capacity (180 m.w.) which would cause desecration of an area of ''irreplaceable'' beauty and flood the Franklin valley caves.</PARA>
<PARA> Naturalists and Scientists throughout the world have proclaimed that if Australia allows this destruction to occur, it will be guilty of an act of gross vandalism.</PARA>
<PARA> We sincerely trust that the proposed Bill will not be shelved or evaded on any technical ground-but will gain the support of patriotic Government members, who place the future inheritance of Australians, above placating an inexperienced Premier who mistakes belligerency for strength.</PARA>
<PARA> The Young Liberal Movement expresses the concern of all thinking members of the younger generation. The Gray Government shows no respect for the Senate, and is proceeding with the power scheme regardless of what the Senate Select Committee may report.</PARA>
<PARA> These circumstances call for strong action by Federal Parliament now.</PARA>

I understand that Australian Labor Party front bench senators have advocated that there should be more expenditure in terms of advertising social security benefits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Is the Minister aware of a statement by the Western Australian Minister for Resources Development, Mr Jones, which appeared in the Australian newspaper on Monday, 25 October 1982, that the Federal Government's welfare policies were not working and should be reviewed and that food stamps and only a small amount of cash should be given to Aborigines instead of the dole? I ask: Will the Minister contact Mr Jones and inform him that Aborigines are Australian citizens and are entitled to the same benefits as all other Australians? Further, will the Minister inform Mr Jones that the Federal Government's Aboriginal Affairs policies are working because of successive caring and understanding Ministers for Aboriginal Affairs in the Fraser Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not familiar with the statement which is attributed to Mr Jones, the Minister for Resources Development in Western Australia. I do not think it is a communication to me. I would be grateful if Senator Bonner would let me have a look at the statement which is attributed to Mr Jones. As far as the Government's welfare policies and their application to Aboriginal Australians are concerned, it was true for a long time that social welfare benefits which were available to Australians generally were not available to Aboriginal people. One of the substantial changes which have occurred over the last decade or more has been the genuine effort to extend the same benefits to Aboriginal people in the social security field as are available to other Australians. Occasionally it remains a matter of some difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The employment of Aboriginal liaison officers in areas where there is a substantial Aboriginal population is one of the measures which have been taken to try to ensure that Aboriginal Australians do get the same benefits as other Australians from the social security system. In that sense, the Department of Social Security tries to do no more and no less for Aboriginal Australians than for any other Australian. Certainly, we do not discriminate between different sections of the Australian population. In general, the Government has taken the view that social security beneficiaries are entitled to receive their income maintenance in the same form as other Australians receive wages-in other words, as cash payments. It is not for the Government to determine how social security beneficiaries should use the resources which are made available to them. The general rule that is followed by the Commonwealth is to provide income maintenance in the form of cash, which gives the recipient the maximum freedom to exercise his or her own judgment on how to spend or use those resources. If Mr Jones did say something like that, he was probably referring to the fact that there are situations in which there is room for concern about problems which have followed the availability of cash incomes in some Aboriginal communities. There are areas where there are problems with, for example, excessive drinking, which is of great concern. This is an area in which this Parliament has made an extensive committee inquiry to try to find out some of the answers.</PARA>
<PARA> There are some Aboriginal initiatives in this area. In a number of areas the Aboriginal people have requested lump sum payments or an arrangement for social security benefits which enables a community administration of benefit. There is the Community Development Employment Project, which is a variation on the normal social security arrangements. In South Australia, again at the request of Aboriginal people, arrangements have been made for the payment of social security benefits to the Aboriginal Housing Board, which deducts rental payments and pays the balance of the social security payment to the beneficiary. The same arrangement is being developed or explored in Western Australia by a committee of the Aboriginal Housing Board. I spoke with housing Ministers in Darwin last week about the possible extension of that arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA> I am sorry to give such a long answer. I suppose I was not wanting to get to the point at which Senator Bonner was recording the fact that Aboriginal Affairs policies are working because of the wonderful succession of Liberal Ministers that we have had. Modesty prohibits my endorsing that with too much enthusiasm. But it is a fact, I think, that in this difficult area there are significant areas of progress. One is that in general governments, both Labor and Liberal, have tried to extend to Aboriginal people the same benefits as other Australians are entitled to. I believe that that is the rule which all Australians would wish us to follow.</PARA>

Is it not an irony that one day we have people clamouring for a shorter working week and higher wages and the next day they are fighting retrenchments?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose one could say that there is some irony in a situation in which there is a very determined campaign to reduce working hours and hence increase the unit cost of labour-a campaign that has succeeded to some extent- followed by a period in which there is a considerable shedding of labour, in part because of the difficulty that many sections of industry have in profitably employing labour at the current cost. I suppose it is fair to point out that there is some irony in that situation. It seems to me that it is an irony that is likely, unfortunately, to escape many people. There appears to be very great difficulty in many parts of Australian society in recognising the significance of the cost of labour in determining just how much employment there can be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that most of us welcomed the acknowledgement in difficult times that Australia had in 1974, when Frank Crean was Treasurer, when he made the point that one man's wage rise could be another man's job. That is a view which I am sure was not expressed by Mr Crean in a sense that was meant to be anti-labour or against the work force, but was simply an acknowledgement of the simple arithmetic that if labour cannot be employed at a profit, labour will not be employed, and if the price of labour gets beyond what will be produced by that labour, we shall get unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> I make that point because as recently as this morning Mr Dolan, in an interview on the national Today show, was making statements which seem to indicate that he does not see the cost of labour as being particularly relevant. But that is a view which I think very few people in this chamber would share, if they express their honest views. I think that there is a growing understanding of the fact that the cost of labour is a significant element in Australia's ability to compete internationally and to maintain a growing economy. I think that the successive statements of members of the Government have been an attempt to bring home that reality to the Australian public. I think that all of us, though, have a part to play in trying to get that fact known and understood. It would be the wish of everyone in this chamber, without dispute, to have a much higher level of employment in Australia than we have today. There are disputes in this chamber about how we can bring about that higher level of employment, but there should be no dispute about the fact that one of the factors-I pick up one of the points that is made-in determining how many people will be employed in Australia is the cost of employing people at any time, including today.</PARA>

Whilst I realise that some people take those examinations purely out of a desire to obtain a supplementary licence, most people are wanting to become involved in flying for a livelihood and need the licences before they can do that. As the airlines have an upper limit for the age beyond which they will not accept applicants, the limited number of examinations and the slowness of the publication of the results limits a pilot's chance of being accepted by an airline. Will the Minister ascertain whether commercial pilot licence examinations can be held more frequently? If not, why not? Can the marking of such examinations be speeded up?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I do not see any conflict in the statement of the Treasurer that high wages are the cause of many instances of unemployment because unless some commodities are produced at competitive prices they will not find their way into the market. Wage levels and productivity need to be looked at in comparing prices of similar goods processed elsewhere. It is a fact that Tasmania has low levels of employment and this is of great concern to all Australians. It may also be a fact that Tasmania has the lowest average weekly wage, but unless Tasmania is able to find markets competitively for goods which it is able to produce, there will not be opportunities for increased employment in that State.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is interesting that the former Premier of South Australia, Mr Dunstan, at a State Labor conference in 1974, said that the Federal Labor policy of centralised funding was wrong and that the only solution would be revenue sharing based upon a fixed percentage of income tax. That is in fact what this Government is doing. The fact of the matter is that it is the overall policy of government that counts.

Amongst them were those that Senator Ryan has now raised again. I am not aware of the stage the working party has reached, but I will make inquiries. I think the Treasurer recognises the urgency of the matters raised with him. I assume that that working party is collecting information so that some action may be taken by the Government.

The only thing that the Government can do is to make strong representations to try to assist the persons in Australia to have their cases dealt with by those in other countries.

In view of the increased costs to be incurred by pensioners between now and next May could the Government make some interim adjustment to pensions to take the September quarter increase into account?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For about eight years now-except in one year I think-there have been biannual adjustments of pension. In each case, the pension has been adjusted in November and May. To the best of my recollection, it has always been adjusted on the basis of whatever the rate of inflation was. The November adjustment reflects the rate of inflation up to the preceding June quarter and the May adjustment relates to the December quarter figure. Therefore, the answer to the first part of the question is, yes, it is a fact that that is when the adjustment will take effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think, though, there is some false arithmetic in the sort of calculation which is made by Senator Colston and which, indeed, is made by many people who raise this point. If, for example, Australia experienced a constant rate of inflation of, say, 10 per cent and that figure was evenly 2 1/2 per cent per quarter, it would not matter which quarter one took in making those biannual adjustments because the result would be exactly the same. In other words, when we set the pension rate in August 1976 to take effect in November 1976 and said we would adjust it twice a year thereafter, if the inflation rate is constant it makes no difference which quarter or which half year we choose on which to make the adjustment. So, one is behind only if in some sense it is suggested that the initial setting of the pension was behind. I think that there is some false arithmetic there. If inflation is falling, the further back one takes the adjustment the larger the adjustment to the pension will be. If inflation is rising, there is some temporary loss to pensioners of whatever the difference is between the six-monthly rate to December and the six-monthly rate to the March quarter.</PARA>
<PARA> So, the answer to the second part of the question is that, whilst the Government could make an additional adjustment, I do not think that that is likely and I would not wish to raise hopes that would be likely to be dashed. In fact, the pensions have, as I have said, on a very regular basis now been adjusted twice a year on the basis of a six-month period of inflation. I think the fact that we have chosen for administrative ease a measure which is separated in time from the date of adjustment does give rise to the sort of unfortunate impression that is in the question. But I do not think the reality is there.</PARA>

<PARA> I would think that the next figures will show at least 8 per cent, that means there are still 92 per cent of the workforce employed, and those people, as I say, are seeking to maintain their real wages and their standard of living even at this time. Now I'm, you know, nobody has ever been able to convince me, and all the rhetoric about wage increases meaning loss of jobs, no one has ever put facts and figures to show that this is the position, or that it would be the position, and that, you know, one job would be created by virtue of a reduction in wages.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the statement of Mr Dolan this morning to which I referred which does fly in the face of views put by Mr Crean during a period in which we were in similar difficulties in the sense of having sharply rising unemployment. The view put by Mr Crean was that one man's wage rise could be another man's job. I think the facts which are brought out by Senator Archer in his question are one of the illustrations of why that can be so. If Australia's cost of production increasingly rises as against the cost rises of our trading competitors, obviously our competitive position slips. An interjection was made by, I think, Senator Walsh that the basic proposition being put by Senator Archer in his question would apply only in a situation of fixed exchange rates. Of course, the movement of exchange rates does affect the competitive position of Australian goods overseas. But if we are to be constantly adjusting our exchange rate because of Australia's declining competitive position that, in itself, will affect the standard of living in Australia and the real incomes of Australians in a way that will be quite counter-productive. I believe Senator Walsh would agree that it is a fact that, notwithstanding exchange rate adjustments, if our competitive position generally is shifting against us we, as a very substantial trading nation, will suffer employment loss. I think the point of Senator Archer 's question was that he wanted a clear statement of that situation, and I will refer his request to the relevant Minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I may not be able to answer precisely the questions raised by Senator Tate but I am able to say on behalf of the Foreign Minister that the Government is committed to an early end to the nuclear arms race. This can be achieved only on the basis of balanced and verifiable measures of arms control which provide for militarily significant reductions. The most hopeful course towards this end is the negotiations that are under way in Geneva on the reduction of both intermediate range weapons and strategic arms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been suggestions and discussions with regard to the concept of a freeze. I am able to say here that the Minister believes that a freeze would not of itself represent disarmament. Under present circumstances it would also perpetuate an unequal military balance, given the greater momentum of the Soviet weapons program and the asymmetries in the arsenals of the two super-powers. If a freeze were to be accepted by both super-powers as leading unambiguously to verifiable reduction of nuclear weapons to equal force levels this would be a major achievement. But it is not clear that an across-the-board freeze in the terms that have been advocated would provide the essential enhancement of security which must underlie any such proposal. Australia strongly supports the negotiations on strategic arms reductions between the United States and the Soviet Union which commenced in Geneva on 29 June. We see these negotiations as offering the most realistic approach to achieving a stable nuclear balance at the lowest possible level. I will refer the details of the question to the Foreign Minister to see whether he has any further comment to make on them.</PARA>

There is no doubt that our trading partners are very sensitive to the fact that we have disruptions. In a time of world recession this is causing very considerable trouble. It is true that the wage rates in other countries, the United States of America and West Germany, have fallen very considerably and that wage rises in Australia have costed us very significantly out of world markets. It ought to be possible for Australia, having the natural resources and all the elements around it, to be a leader in trade today, even in a recession. It is the extra weight that we put in our own saddle bags-the pressure for higher and higher wages and the industrial disruptions-that makes countries worry about us as a good trading partner.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last year there were a number of general Government decisions relating to the contracting out of printing. I do not recall the full detail of those decisions but certainly it is true that my Department, I understand in common with other departments, is required to contract out printing. Questions of comparative costs can be difficult because determining the cost of something done by a government body is sometimes a little difficult owing to the difficulty in assigning all the relevant costs and overheads which might be incurred. One may, in many cases, be dealing with questions of marginal cost rather than a share of the total cost. So some quite complicated arithmetic can be involved. Whether there is any contradiction in the instructions is a matter on which I would have to check with the Department. My understanding is that there is a general requirement on the Service to perform its tasks as economically as possible. There is certainly an instruction with respect to the contracting out of some printing. I think a question has arisen in my Department as to the extent to which we can comply with that instruction within the amounts which are appropriated for printing. It is an area in which I know some questions have arisen. I will obtain a careful and defined answer for the honourable senator as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although I have not seen the survey referred to by Senator Missen I am aware of some of the facts about sugar intake in Australia. Senator Missen is quite correct when he asserts that Australia's intake is high by international standards. I understand that the per capita consumption of sugar in Australia exceeds 52 kilograms a year. Senator Missen is correct in saying that more than two-thirds of this comes from prepared foods. The difficulty in answering Senator Missen's questions as they relate to what action the Government might take rests in the fact that the constitutional responsibility for some of the lines of action is with the States. Although the Commonwealth can play a role in identifying the problems and in laying down standards, it is to the States and Territories that we must look for action on food composition and food labelling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The National Health and Medical Research Council has taken some action to involve itself in advising the Australian public. It has recommended a reduction of the sugar content of baby foods and it has recommended that sugar content be identified on the labels of foodstuffs to put more information in the hands of consumers. A working party is now trying to develop recommendations to go to the States. The Council, through its nutritional education committee, has produced printed material. It has produced a number of dietary guideline publications, including one which recommends less sugar. An available publication entitled ' Dietary Guidelines for Australians' deals with this subject. The only other comment I make on the question asked by Senator Missen concerns dental caries. I make the obvious observation that those Australian communities fortunate enough to have flouridated water, especially those fortunate enough to have had it for a generation, have children growing up without dental caries, in spite of the dietary habits which we might care to criticise.</PARA>

Some quite active lobby groups are working to extend the B class widow's pension , which at present cuts out between the ages of 45 and 50 if there are no dependent children involved. There is no proposal to extend that widow's benefit . The women in that category who may, depending on their work history, have difficulty in re-entering the work force have common characteristics with other people in the community who also may have difficulty in entering the work force. For example, a woman who stayed home to look after her aged parents may well have little work experience and be left without support at the same sort of age. There are many men who, after a lifetime of unskilled or semi-skilled work, find that current economic conditions leave them very awkwardly placed in relation to entering the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>

The matter is receiving attention. I would be reluctant to see a general extension of a benefit which was based on some prior status and which would simply give as a class women who had borne children the permanent right to maintenance from the state, bearing in mind that roughly half or more than half of women now have regular periods in paid employment.

Those States which are able to rely on highly profitable industries may be able to pay a higher wage rate than some other States and still maintain employment. But I think the general view which I expressed earlier in Question Time and which, for the sake of the Opposition Whip, I will not repeat, hold true, whether we are looking at those States or at any part of Australia. The fact remains that if Australian manufactured goods, to pick an example which is of particular importance to South Australia, are manufactured by labour which is significantly more costly than the labour of competitors, obviously that affects the ability to compete with imports.</PARA></TALK.START>

I can confirm that a visa was refused in accordance with long- standing Government policy. Mr Ramos Horta is a representative of Fretilin, which is dedicated to gaining independence for East Timor, which the Australian Government regards as a province of Indonesia. With regard to the general elections in East Timor, the Indonesian Government has explained that there were 3,227 more votes cast in East Timor than there were registered voters in the province by the fact that a large number of persons originally registered in other provinces actually voted in East Timor. A similar situation also occurred in Sulawesi Tenggara province.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Grimes asked me a question about the changed interpretation of entitlement for sickness benefit, in particular the circumstances where a person could not be shown to have lost income due to sickness and hence would not be eligible for sickness benefit under the provisions of section 108 of the Social Security Act. In response to him yesterday, I said that I was awaiting advice from my Department. I can confirm that I have had advice from my Department. It was in my office, and I had not seen it at that time. As a result of considering the views put to me, I would now propose to bring the matter before the Government. I am not in a position to advise the Senate on what changes, if any, might be brought forward. Any change which might be made can have the disadvantage of bringing in people who traditionally have not been regarded as entitled to sickness benefit and, in particular, people who are without earnings on a permanent basis, such as housewives, who have not normally qualified for sickness benefits during a period of illness. But the matter will receive Government consideration as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also wish to advise the Senate-because it is relevant to the matter raised- that as an interim measure all States have been instructed to provide for these cases by way of special benefit, payable at sickness benefit rates, and subject to a liberal income test; in other words, the amount of benefit payable is being reduced only where other income is being received. The normal hardship provision related to special benefit is not being applied. I mention that because Senator Grimes asked whether action would be taken during the current session. I indicated that I thought that that would be difficult. The fact is that the practice during the period of consideration should prevent hardship accruing in cases which have been caught by the changed interpretation of section 108.</PARA>

<PARA>5 October 1982</PARA>
<PARA> Sales tax increases on sporting goods announced in the Federal Budget, and expected to yield about $90 million in revenue this financial year, should be made available to sports assistance programs throughout Australia, Senator Gerry Jones (Labor, Queensland) said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> He said out of an allocation for sport of $26.7 million in the Budget, only $3. 2 million was available for 110 struggling sporting organisations and about 4 million participants. </PARA>
<PARA> ''While the allocation of funds benefits the 'glamor' sports such as tennis and swimming and the most promising sports stars, Australians, on a per capita basis , receive only 21 cents a year for the promotion of sport and a healthier lifestyle.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''Per capita spending in the U.K. is double that amount, while the Canadians spend $1.30 per head-more than six times the expenditure of the Australian Government.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''Almost 90% of the $26.7 million allocation for youth, sport and recreation goes to construction and maintenance costs and almost half the total funds, $12 million, will be spent in the A.C.T. alone.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''Provision for top class sportswomen and sportsmen to have access to specialised training programs amounts to $4.8 million, $4 million of which goes to the A.C.T.,'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jones said that while the Australian Institute of Sport deserved such level of funding, many potentially top-class competitors were unable to train way from their homes, their work or their studies. </PARA>
<PARA> He said that these people should have access to first class coaching facilities in other centres. </PARA>
<PARA> ''From $3.2 million, 110 national sporting bodies will have to pay for administrative and coaching positions, travel to international competitions, the hosting of major events and for the National Athlete Award Scheme for high performance athletes.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''There was no increase in this year's Budget for assistance for sport and recreation programs for the disabled,'' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jones said the Labor Party in government would provide co-ordinated sports programs in schools, sporting facilities in capital cities and regional centres, the development of programs to attract large numbers of people to take part in healthy exercise and would facilitate the progress of skilled athletes. </PARA>
<PARA> ''Most Australian athletes have to make a choice between their sport or pursuing their career. And with the spectre of unemployment hanging over just about everybody's head, Australian sport is losing countless competitors.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''The elite training provided by the superb Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra, catered to 153 trainees last year on scholarships. Thirty six of them coming from Queensland, and aged between 12 and 29.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''But applications are being received from hundreds of athletes throughout Australia for scholarships at the A.I.S. and the numbers are limited and the entry standards high.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''For hundreds of latent champions who are unable to live, study or work in Canberra and are starved of adequate local coaching facilities, the prospect of achieving success in competitive sport is dwindling.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''Governments overseas provide extensive services for prominent athletes, including the back-up services of sports science and medical personnel during normal training.''</PARA>
<PARA> ''Capital city and regional coaching institutes, with access to these services, are essential if athletes from all parts of Australia are to enjoy equal opportunities to achieve their ultimate sporting potential,'' Senator Jones said . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Anyone with eyes to see or ears to hear would know the justification for bringing up this matter of public importance today. I feel that I need say no more about that. On 9 September 1974, the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), who was then shadow Minister for Labour, in an interview with the Age, said that he accepted the principle that as unemployment rose, so too should unemployment benefits. The principle would be designed to protect individuals who quite innocently are caught in the turmoil of a mismanaged economy. On 19 November 1976, addressing the Liberal Party Federal Council, the same gentleman, the present Prime Minister, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The strategy we are pursuing aims at a gradual and sound recovery. It is designed to achieve a reduction in unemployment by mid 1977. </PARA>
<PARA>These were fine words and fine principles, but both the words and the principles are empty, as are all the words and principles of the Prime Minister. Using the August figures for unemployment beneficiaries, one finds that the number of beneficiaries has increased by 118,300 in two years-103,400 in the last 12 months. The September figures have increased by 140,000 from September 1981, when there were 306,000 on unemployment benefits, to September 1982, when there were 446,300 on unemployment benefits. From August to September this year the increase in beneficiaries was 24,400-in a period in which unemployment has traditionally held steady or improved. If we consider previous year's figures it can be seen that a further increase comparable with the rise in the last few years will result in the number of people on unemployment benefits being over 500,000 by January or February, and no one expects an improvement in this time, especially not the Treasurer (Mr Howard).</PARA>
<PARA> In my home State, Tasmania, the situation is especially grim. On the latest figures available unemployment was 10.9 per cent, and the numbers have obviously increased since then. The number of people on benefits has increased by more than 6,000 in 12 months and in other regions such as the Illawarra and the Hunter Valley a similar disastrous situation applies. Unemployment has more than doubled under this Government. It has increased by 50 per cent in the last year. The Government appears to accept with equanimity the real life tragedies, the family breakdowns, the bitterness and the alienation which lie behind these figures; the Australian Labor Party cannot. More people are fronting up to the Social Security counters knowing that they will be dependent on unemployment benefit cheques indefinitely. More of them, which is very important, are not our older workers who have difficulty re-entering the work force, nor our teenagers who have never been able to find jobs, although plenty of them fall into those categories. They are workers with families who have been our taxpayers, our producers of goods and services, our most stable members of society. I give a few comparisons. On 30 June 1975 fewer than 20 per cent of unemployed workers had been on unemployment benefits for more than six months. On 31 May 1982, 41 per cent, more than double the number, had been on unemployment benefits for more than six months. The average duration of receipt of unemployment benefits is now 39 weeks. The benefit is no longer, as the Government has continued to argue, a temporary benefit. As the economy closes in it has become a way of life for too many people. </PARA>
<PARA> The proportion of recipients of unemployment benefits for more than six months was higher for married persons than for single persons, yet the married unemployed made up less than a quarter of the total number of unemployed on benefits. Between May 1981 and May 1982 the proportion of under 20s and over 45s on unemployment benefits dropped. The age range of people on unemployment benefits which increased was the 21 to 44 year olds. One cannot blame the education system for this situation, as the Prime Minister has tried to do. These people are workers, not new applicants to enter the work force. The parents cannot be blamed, as the Prime Minister has tried to do. It cannot be said that these people had unrealistic expectations, as the former Minister for Social Security, the present Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), has said. It is not only the young unemployed whom the Government must answer to, as witnessed by the intense anger of the workers who marched on Parliament House yesterday. We are looking at an industry crash which is affecting more and more families with mortgages and with children who are looking at nothing in the future under this Government because it has nothing to offer them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government attempted to disguise the extent of unemployment by abolishing the publication of the Commonwealth Employment Service figures. All it has done has been to cloud the implications of one set of figures while all the other indicators of unemployment have taken off. The CES figures would at least have given some indications of State and regional unemployment so that remedies could have been taken, perhaps by more local authorities, but because the Government ran scared of publishing the figures we have no local information. I am pleased to hear that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) is taking another look at that shortsighted decision of his Government. In previous years some 75 per cent of CES registrants were on unemployment benefit. On that premise today there would have been around 600,000 registered for work with the CES-probably more. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Government stopped publishing CES figures in March 1981 there were 25, 000-odd unfilled vacancies. In the last Australian Bureau of Statistics survey of August 1982 there were only 21,500 job vacancies and right now I think most people would be surprised if the number reached five figures. While the Government has hidden the CES statistics from view we are still left with the ABS survey figures and the Department of Social Security unemployment benefit statistics, and each of these tells a very sad tale. For instance, the most recent labour force statistics published by the ABS show a drop of 72,000 in the full time work force between September 1981 and September 1982-72,000 fewer jobs and more and more people desperate for them. The September ABS survey of unemployment notches up an unemployment rate of 7.4 per cent, with 504,800 people estimated to be looking for full time and part time employment. We all know the deficiencies in the ABS criteria. They exclude job seekers who have worked for more than hour in the previous week and people who, because of illness or family circumstances, had not taken steps to find work in the preceding weeks. Yet still the figures reach more than half a million. </PARA>
<PARA> The unemployment benefit figures are even more stark. I point out that these figures represent real people who have had to fit every one of the stringent tests of the Department of Social Security. They exclude men or women whose partners are in work and people who have been taken off unemployment benefit for alleged infringements of the work test. Yet they show that last month a record 446,000 people received unemployment benefits, a rise of 50 per cent over the September figures of last year. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table demonstrating this change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These are not notional figures as the ABS survey statistics are. They represent real people who have addresses, work histories, or a lack of them , and who put in income statements to the Department of Social Security. Otherwise they are not paid. Their numbers will take an enormous leap in October as the workers of Newcastle and Wollongong-and Tasmania-who were retrenched last month start collecting their first unemployment benefit cheques. They will take another large jump in November as the workers whose redundancy payments which lasted a month-including many of the workers who were here yesterday-start a career on social service benefits, which the Labor Party fervently hopes will be short lived. The figures will go up again in December as industries which have depended on the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd and some major industries close down and as tertiary students who have finished their courses join the lines at Social Security. The figures will go up by a staggering amount in January and February as school leavers take up their entitlements of unemployment benefits because they have no work offered to them. If the Government believes the situation will get better then I, for one, would like it to tell me and these unfortunate people how.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The numbers on unemployment benefits do not include those whose spouses are working or those who have given up-the hidden unemployed. Who knows what the true figure is? They do not emphasise the catastrophic situation with youth unemployment where the rate is a startling 25 per cent to 30 per cent, and even higher in some areas. The figures also do not include the underemployed, those who want full time work but who are on a four-day week in the mining industry and manufacturing industry-such as the car components and white goods industries . In addition to these workers, throughout Australia many people are in a state of anxiety about the future of their jobs because of the decreasing viability of the firms they work for. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should remember that there is savage discrimination against people on unemployment benefits. Some of this discrimination comes as a shock to those who are newly on benefits. If they are paying off a mortgage they will get no corresponding tax rebate if they are not paying tax. If they are paying rent they are ineligible for the $10 a week supplementary assistance. If they or their families are ill they will get a disadvantaged person's health card but no free pharmaceuticals and no entitlement to dental or optical treatment. They are expected to look for work but in most States do not get transport concessions. They do not get telephone concessions. The States will not give them rate, electricity, car registration or other concessions in general. They are out in the cold, hard world on their own and below the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA>In the area of unemployment the Government had its chance for seven years and, to use the vernacular, it has stuffed it. We have this situation in industry as a result of contractionary economic policy which is aimed at fighting inflation first. It is therefore worth while looking at just what has happened to inflation. There has been a complete lack of ability to control inflation. In the year to the March quarter of 1982 the consumer price index rose by 10.5 per cent. In the year to the June quarter it rose 10.7 per cent. Now the figures for the September quarter show a rise of 12.3 per cent. In other words, inflation is accelerating. Even Mr Fraser, the Prime Minister, admits that this is a national disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> We are entering a period of economic disintegration with our worst inflation rate for 5 years. That is very much higher than that experienced by our major trading partners. Inevitably our international competitiveness will be further eroded. Exporters and primary producers will pay a heavy price for this Government's failures. Mr Fraser cannot even find a scapegoat for this disastrous performance. Clearly, overseas inflation is not being imported. Mr Fraser can no longer blame the Whitlam Government-that was seven years ago. The 12.3 per cent rise to the September quarter 1982 is higher than the comparable rate in the last year of the Whitlam Government. Mr Fraser in fact has only one scapegoat left, one legitimate source of blame-himself and his Government's own lamentable policy failures. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1975 Mr Fraser took office on the basis of a claim to superior economic expertise. Since then, inflation has continued apace, unemployment has soared to record highs and economic growth has faltered. On all the criteria Mr Fraser has claimed superiority he has failed. These failures are not surprising, I suggest. They flow directly from the Government's incompetence as an economic manager, its inconsistent policies and its single minded pursuit of irrelevant goals- particularly the striving for a small deficit at any cost. That was so until the most recent Budget. That inconsistency has again been demonstrated by another U- turn. One wonders whether we are now asked to look forward to a deficit-led recovery. It seems to be about the only sort of recovery which has not yet been promulgated by these desperate men and women in the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's own actions have helped to fan the fires of inflation. The largest components of the September quarter CPI increase were due to government policy. Import parity pricing and new taxes of course have forced up petrol costs. Hospital charges and health insurance rates have risen because of the health insurance shambles. The States have had to raise charges in many areas because of Commonwealth fiscal stringency. These are not new developments but have been occurring since the Fraser Government took office; they are a major reason why inflationary pressures have intensified. The Government has also contributed to inflation by encouraging the abandonment of a successful system of centralised wage fixation. The wage increases Mr Fraser now points the finger at were the inevitable outcome of this Government's push for decentralised wage bargaining. Mr Fraser abandoned or sabotaged the supporting mechanisms that would have allowed the continuation of a viable system of wage indexation with an anti-inflationary impact. He dismantled Medibank and artificially boosted the health component in the CPI. He dismembered the Prices Justification Tribunal. He abandoned tax indexation, which was necessary for the maintenance of real wage levels. He allowed a thriving tax avoidance industry to grow and prosper, thus undermining public confidence in the overall fairness of our fiscal system. This combination of fiscal haemorrhage and deficit fetishism was the basic cause of rising indirect taxes and government charges, all of which fed back into the inflationary spiral. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1980-we all very much know about it in the Senate-Mr Fraser and his Ministers talked up the economy on the basis of a resources boom that never materialised. He engendered an attitude of resource boom euphoria amongst employers and citizens generally in the community with resulting distortions in the economy. Nowhere did we see that more frequently and more vigorously pursued than by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick). The Government's 'fight inflation first' strategy has therefore amounted to no more than a policy of deflating the economy while almost everything else it has done has contributed to undermining any benefits that might have been derived by way of reduced inflation. It is small wonder now after seven years in office the only material outcome is a level of employment which is the highest since the Great Depression, while inflation remains as high as when the Government took office. These policies not only have failed but also have been disastrous for the living standards of Australians and particularly for the unemployed who face a bleak future. Taxes have risen in relation to incomes, but social benefits have fallen. Our growth performance has been lamentable. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia now ranks eighteenth among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries in terms of per capita output; we were fifth in 1950. This decline is entirely due to the failures of successive conservative governments in this country. In fact, during the Whitlam Goverment years gross domestic product per head rose at an average annual rate of 1.9 per cent in Australia- significantly higher than the OECD average of 1.2 per cent per annum. Since 1975 that situation has reversed to where we now have an average growth rate of only 1.2 per cent per annum in Australia compared with 2.7 per cent per annum for the OECD as a whole. This Government has no solutions. The 1982-83 Budget holds out the abysmal prospect of negative growth in 1982-83 with unemployment rising to 9 per cent or more. We believe that this is a policy of despair. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a situation where despite the abject failure of policies the recipe is for more of the same. Economic policies will continue to bear down most on wage earners and the disadvantaged. The unemployed are told they must bear their plight until market forces cause a recovery. Worst of all, we are to continue with the combative approach of the Prime Minister exemplified best when he accused the secretary of the Miners Federation yesterday of fomenting revolution as a result of yesterday's demonstration. Mr Macphee, a normally compassionate man, on AM this morning said despairingly 'there is nothing else we can do'. The Government has not only failed but also is bereft of ideas because it cannot overcome its ideological hang-ups. </PARA>
<PARA> Something can be done. Instead of confrontation we can have co-operation. Instead of economic stagnation we can stimulate sensibly economic growth instead of nineteenth century laissez-faire policies and have a sensible intervention in the economy. It is possible and can be seen as possible. Instead of taking as our models the monetarists such as Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, we can look further afield to those countries which have eschewed monetarism and instead have sought co-operation though a sensible prices and wages policy--</PARA>

Its members were described as lunatics by the Acting Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and condemned by the Prime Minister. The time has come for government, unions and business to get together, but they cannot do so because they are frustrated by intransigent and blinkered hierarchy in government. It is for this reason and for the good of the country and every citizen in the country that the Government must go because I am afraid the time for it to change is too late.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with some interest to the remarks of Senator Grimes in putting the matter of public importance relating to economic policies, high unemployment and increasing inflation. I have something to say as far as the Government is concerned on those matters. I am not in disagreement with some of the figures which Senator Grimes has cited but many of the conclusions which he draws would sound very different from the Government's point of view. The Government fully recognises the serious labour market situation facing Australia. It is something about which we have been talking very strongly on every possible occasion. Any claims that the Government is seeking to avoid its responsibilities in regard to the difficult economic and employment situation are totally unfounded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The labour market has deteriorated substantially this year reflecting difficult economic circumstances, not only in this country but also in many parts of the world where we trade. The deterioration is particularly reflected in the recent spate of large-scale job losses in areas as diverse as insurance, steel, the motor industry, meat processing and agricultural machinery. We could go on and on. It is expected, as has been noted in recent surveys, that heavy job losses will continue to occur in a number of key industries at least until the end of this calendar year. The recent rises in unemployment have fallen disproportionately on adult males. I noted that Senator Grimes made that same point. That indicates that the recession is attacking the very core of the Australian labour market. In addition to those adult males who have been disproportionately affected in recent months, Australia has a high level of youth unemployment and other disadvantaged groups are facing difficult labour market problems. However, Australia is not alone amongst industrialised countries in experiencing high levels of unemployment. For instance, the current level of unemployment in the United States of America is above 10 per cent, in the United Kingdom around 13 per cent, in Canada over 12 per cent, in West Germany 8 per cent and in France around 9 per cent. The latest seasonally adjusted figures for Australia indicated an unemployment rate of 7.4 per cent in September. </PARA>
<PARA> The adverse labour market situation results from a number of factors. The international recession has reduced Australia's export opportunities and led to a phasing back in new resource investments. A very serious drought is now beginning to have a major impact not only on rural centres but also on metropolitan based industry. I think it has often been said that if there is a healthy rural sector in this country there is a spin-off from that into other manufacturing and service centres. As I have said, we are now experiencing a downturn in metropolitan based industry as a result of that rural drought. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of excessive wage increases over the last couple of years has also been significant and I will return to this crucial area later in my remarks this afternoon. Excessive wage increases cannot be ignored when we look at unemployment, inflation or the economy as a whole. These developments required the 1982-83 Budget, which is before the Senate at present, to be prepared against a particularly difficult economic background. Within that context, the Government did all that it could do to provide relief, assistance and incentive consistent with a responsible economic policy. I would want to say something about that a little later on and contrast the policy of the Opposition with that of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The policy of the Government remains firmly directed to the containment of inflation and to the encouragement of sustained growth in the private sector. An important aspect of the Budget is the increased assistance to those groups most disadvantaged in securing work. The Government recognises that increasing unemployment requires further emphasis on manpower and training programs, particularly for young Australians. The Budget makes available over $250m in this coming year for manpower and training programs of the Employment and Industrial Relations portfolio and that is a 21 per cent increase on last year's figure. The form of the Government's program reflects its commitment to young people, its commitment to a better trained and more flexible labour force and its commitment to bringing about an increase in permanent and long term job prospects. The available evidence shows that most unemployed young people have left school early and are generally ill-equipped to take their place in the labour market. They have few skills; they have few educational qualifications; and in many cases they have no work experience at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's program seeks to overcome these difficulties by providing young people with the opportunity to learn vocational skills and to develop work skills. The emphasis on youth programs is one that the Opposition does not deny. In fact, I believe we have support for the programs which involve training, work incentives, opportunities to gain work experience and things of that sort. The Government's commitment to long term job prospects can be seen through the type of program offered. Our programs are not short term creation schemes. Rather, they are schemes designed to lead their participants on to permanent employment and to provide them with wider employment opportunities and skills which they would be able to use in the employment that they seek. </PARA>
<PARA> A basic problem for the Australian economy at present is that our costs are out of line with those of our major trading partners. Wage settlements and rates of inflation are tending to moderate in our major trading partners. As measured by consumer prices, the rate of inflation in Australia's major trading partners fell from 8.6 per cent over the year to August 1981 to 6.5 per cent over the year to August 1982. That is a considerable fall measured in any terms. In some cases, wages in those countries are increasing less quickly than prices. The Australian situation is quite different from that. In the last two years, earnings have risen far more quickly than prices. Average real earnings increased by 3.5 per cent in 1980-81 and 3.8 per cent in 1981-82. As a consequence of those increases, our rate of inflation has been rising while the rates of inflation of our trading partners have been reducing. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only have wage rates increased rapidly, but there was also a general movement to shorter working hours which further increased hourly labour costs. The plain fact of the matter is that, in the last two years, we gave ourselves wage increases and improvements in Australian working conditions at a rate far beyond that which the economy could sustain without creating inflationary pressures and destroying jobs. I do not think it could be argued that attention was not drawn to that factor by the Government, by Government spokesmen and by anyone who seriously looked at the claims that were made for wages and changes in employment conditions compared with what could reasonably be afforded by industries and what could reasonably be expected to create jobs or at least to maintain jobs for people already employed. The Australian economy clearly needs a period in which to digest the wage increases that have already taken place. I do not know that this seems to be understood. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Howard), in responding to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) yesterday, remarked on Mr Hayden's almost total refusal even to acknowledge the possibility that wage increases may be an element in the high level of inflation that we are experiencing in Australia. A censure motion was debated in the other place yesterday and I think the comments of the Leader of the Opposition and the Treasurer make very interesting reading, particularly in view of the way in which Senator Grimes has brought forward this matter of public importance today. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very strange for the Leader of the Opposition not to acknowledge the importance of the relationship between wage increases and the rate of inflation, given remarks that he made as Treasurer of Australia in his Budget speech of 1975. Let me quote Mr Hayden in 1975. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> If wages and salaries continue to outstrip productivity increases the productive capacity of the economy will decline and we shall all eventually be worse off. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that these remarks were made by the present Leader of the Opposition in 1975 when he was Treasurer of Australia. Mr Hayden further said:</PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, however, it is clear that some wage and salary pressures are unrealistic and, when successful, harmful. It does employees generally no good to get higher and higher money incomes if the results are just higher prices, a severe squeeze on profits, a slump in new investment and a contraction of job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the Leader of the Opposition should re-read those sentiments that he expressed in 1975 and place them into the context of today and the wage increases that have occurred. Mr Hayden also said in his 1975 Budget Speech:</PARA>
<PARA> Some sacrifice and patient restraint is called for from all of us in our demands for more resources, whether it is additional public services that are wanted or higher personal incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, I would suggest that the Opposition re-reads those sentiments and places them into the context of the present state of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1982-83 Budget was constructed in such a way as to provide a basis for the exercise of wage restraint by wage and salary earners. A number of actions were taken in this Budget to increase people's real disposable incomes. For instance, the burden of taxation for the ordinary pay-as-you-earn tax earner was reduced, family allowances payable to everybody with children were increased and tax advantages were provided on housing mortgages. As an example of the benefits that will flow from this Budget, an average fitter with a dependent spouse and two dependent children and with an average mortgage will benefit very considerably from the provisions which were made in the present Budget and which are due to take effect from 1 November. He would require little more than a 10 per cent increase in award wages to gain the same benefits as are being provided in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> These actions represented a direct response to the views that were put by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and by the Confederation of Australian Industry at the tripartite economic conference which was held in July of this year. It was an important conference and one in which very firm recommendations were made to the Government as to the forthcoming Budget. The Government's response in regard to a number of areas in respect of which it will extend a direct benefit and give assistance to the average working man and his family is, I believe, well known. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to meeting the immediate problems of low to middle income earners, the Government has set out as an example to other wage and salary earners, to restrain salary increases for more highly paid Government office holders and officials. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Sir Phillip Lynch, and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Macphee, have all written to industry leaders urging their support for a similar approach with regard to those who are in the higher salary brackets. It is imperative that, in order to retain as many jobs as possible and to set the economy on the soundest possible foundation to take advantage of the world economic recovery when it occurs, we obtain the lowest possible wage outcomes over the next 12 months. I think that the next 12 months represents the resting period from wage demands that we must have so that, as there is economic recovery and as our trading opportunities expand, we will be ready and will have a sound foundation on which to expand our trading. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition seems unable to recognise the need for wage restraint at this time. The proposals announced yesterday by the Leader of the Opposition would be a certain recipe for higher rates of inflation and further losses of jobs; that is, more unemployment and greater hardship. The hard fact of life is that for wages to be increased in line with prices, at a time when business is finding it difficult enough to operate at present cost levels, would be a recipe for real disaster. The Leader of the Opposition appears to think that his proposal about forgoing productivity increases represents moderation, but that is an absolute illusion. There are likely to be few, if any, productivity gains while the present difficult economic situation persists. In any case, in the last two years real wages have increased in excess of productivity. That is precisely why the economy needs a breathing space in the next 12 months. Real progress in the fight against inflation and unemployment will not be made until such time as the union movement and the Opposition face the facts realistically and understand the important role that excessive wage increases have played in our current economic difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the matter before us today concerns inflation and the Government's economic policy. I will say one or two things about that because the Government is committed to the achievement of a substantial and sustained reduction in inflation.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Yes, and economic circumstances are not the same year after year; they change. Our commitment to a substantial and sustained reduction in inflation is still very firm. To that end it has been the policy of the Government to pursue anti-inflationary fiscal and monetary policies. Even allowing for additional expenditures on drought relief and unemployment benefits under the Budget, the Budget deficit appears to be about one per cent of gross domestic product. The Government is committed to financing that deficit in a non -inflationary manner by the sale of securities to the non-banking sector. In the September quarter of 1982 the non-bank take-up of securities was $884m, compared with a rundown of $114m in the comparable period last year. That is a turnaround of about $1,000m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has indicated its intention to restrain the average year on year growth in the M3 money supply to between 9 per cent and 11 per cent. It is currently running at near the top of that range. The Government is attempting to encourage a more responsible system of wage determination and in this regard notes that the metal trade employers have called for a six-month wage freeze in light of their current profitability and competitiveness. I stress that from 1 November the net take home pay in the pockets of average Australian salary and wage earners will be greatly improved by the reduction of income tax and the introduction of other benefits that, as I have said, are in this Budget. This should surely provide a basis for some moderation in the wage claims of Australian workers. </PARA>
<PARA> The consumer price index for the September quarter is certainly most disturbing to the Government and should be disturbing to all who are able to read the signs of the difficulties within the economic climate. It highlights the serious inflationary problems facing the Australian economy. Perhaps the most worrying aspect is one that the Government and the Opposition have referred to-that our inflation has been accelerating while inflation abroad has been declining. Consumer prices in Australia's major trading partners increased at an annual rate of only 6.5 per cent over the year to August. Our competitive position is being seriously eroded by the differences between our inflation rate and those of our trading partners. It ought to be obvious that unless we can restrain our inflation level we will have little chance of benefiting from any upturn in overseas activity when it occurs and of restoring economic growth and employment levels in this country. It could well be argued that inflation in this country ought to be lower, but in view of the problems that have occurred and some of the reasons for the present rate, we ought to be considering seriously what should be done to restrain it. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer first to the serious drought in Australia, which inevitably has an impact on food prices. In the September quarter the drought contributed to higher prices: Fresh fruit and vegetable prices went up by 12.9 per cent. These were offset partly by lower prices for lamb and mutton, which were down by 4.8 per cent, and a moderate rise in beef and veal prices-up 0.7 per cent. We may expect some upturn in meat prices once the drought breaks and restocking commences. Perhaps it should be recognised that drought is a serious difficulty about which we are not able to do a great deal except alleviate the distress that occurs as a result of it. </PARA>
<PARA> But we ought to be able to do something about excessive wage increases. While they have been accelerating in Australia they have been slowing down in other countries. Last year wages in this country grew by some 3 per cent or 4 per cent more than the rate of inflation. Some measure of the size of recent wage increases can be obtained by the following figures for the all-persons average weekly earnings index. In the December quarter of 1981 these rose by 3.4 per cent; in the March quarter of 1982 by 5.3 per cent; and in June quarter of 1982 by 3.4 per cent. The increase in award wages continued to run at well over 13 per cent in July. One indication of the importance of wage increases is given by the fact that the services component of the consumer price index increased by 18 .8 per cent over the year to the September quarter. Whilst possibly we ought to be getting together and talking about these things, as suggested by Senator Grimes, it ought to be recognised that unless we get together to restrain wage increases and help to contain inflation we will not be in a competitive position to take advantage of trading opportunities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there is one element of consistency in the arguments of successive Fraser governments it is surely to be found in its blaming of the workers and the trade unions for wage increases and its insistence that all of the current evils-inflation, unemployment and so on, and perhaps excepting the drought-flow from the faults of the workers and the trade unions. Many Australians who are listening to this debate must wonder just what country they are in. They are being told endlessly about excessive wage increases. They look at their pay packets and say to themselves and to each other: 'Just who is getting these excessive wage increases?' We hear reference made to the average weeky earnings and the earnings of the average fitter or the person with trade qualifications. We very rarely hear reference made to the earnings of a person who is on or near the average weekly wage rate which, in August 1982, was $233 a week for men and $213 a week for women. Most people would not believe that to be an excessive wage rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I realise that the point that is being made is about the very rapid increase in those wage rates in comparison with other economic measures. If the Government were as conscientious in its attention to price increases and to its policies which are responsible for those price increases; if it were concerned in its policies and through the State governments to control rents; if it were concerned to control profits; if it were also concerned to be as conscientious about collecting taxation, I believe that the vast majority of Australians who are on very low wages would be a little more impressed. The 1983 predictions for unemployment are for at least 10 per cent of the work force. Since 1945 the rate of unemployment amongst women has been higher than that for men. The rates are often underexpressed because unemployment amongst women is largely hidden. They lack opportunities in the work force and have access to a much narrower range of occupations. If all the mature women who are presently in the work force were to leave the work force, their jobs would immediately be taken by all of the mature women who would work if work were available for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Schools are stll churning out girls who are streamed into a narrow range of occupations. If in fact there were equal opportunities for boys and girls in our education system and in our industrial system, there would be no difference in the rates of their unemployment. However, of girls between the ages of 15 and 19 years, 20.7 per cent are unemployed as against 15.6 per cent of boys in that age group. Yesterday, when the demonstrators were here from Wollongong and from south-east New South Wales, demonstrating and putting to us the problems that they have in that area, we met women who came with them and who were working for the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd at Wollongong. As a result of their having taken a class action under the State's equal opportunity legislation they were able to get jobs there that women do not normally do. These are amongst the very few women who have been able to break the gender barrier-one as a welder, others as fitters' mates, some as machine operators and several of them in labouring jobs. These are amongst the people who will lose their jobs in the next couple of weeks. Amongst the other people at Wollongong who will lose their jobs are apprentices-males and females. All except about 15 of the fourth year apprentices will be put off. </PARA>
<PARA> The availability of jobs for older women is totally inadequate. This stems from their lack of education and training and, in many cases, because of their lack of encouragement and lack of confidence in themselves. Many of those who have been able to go back to the work force are in jobs that in many cases are threatened because they are in manufacturing industry. Obviously, within the job market, where very little formal training is required and where very little is required in the way of formal education, such people are very easily replaced. They are very well aware of the fact that they are easily replaced. The result of these inequalities is the high number of women receiving welfare payments. In June 1982 women constituted 61.2 per cent of social security pensioners and beneficiaries. If we exclude those on unemployment benefit, the percentage reaches 67.3 per cent. Over 95 per cent of people on the supporting parent's benefit are women and very many of those women would be delighted to be able to find employment. In fact, we have been told that the majority of women on the supporting parent's benefit stay on that benefit for as short a time as possible . If they are able to get work they certainly do not stay on the supporting parent's benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The majority of pensioners living solely on welfare are mainly women, partly because of the relative lack of opportunity for employment and the greater longevity and earlier retirement of women. The total picture that these figures represent is what some analysts have referred to as the feminisation of poverty. We know that the Government has taken some measures to ameliorate the effect of the recession on these people. However, a close look shows how inadequate these measures are, especially when they are considered together with increased hikes in sales tax. Increased indirect taxes show up in increased prices for consumer items. Low income households are particularly hard hit by escalating electricity charges, rentals, rates, transport costs and other State and municipal charges. Within most of these families it falls upon women, either as family heads or as partners, to stretch the minimal income to meet these rising costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Part time work has greatly expanded in the past 10 years. This has hidden the extent of unemployment, representing as it does in very many cases involuntary unemployment and under employment. Between July 1981 and July 1982 only 3,000 new jobs were created in Australia. In that time there was a decline of 19,400 in the number of full time jobs and an increase of 22,400 in part time jobs. This represents an enormous amount of underemployment and waste of skills and, for the female sector of the work force, it represents a great increase in lack of security, increasing technology which threatens jobs, and the deskilling of those who have taken a pride in their work. The average number of hours worked by part time workers in Australia is 15. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier to weekly wage rates and the fact that the rate at August this year was $233 a week for men and $213 a week for women. That translates into not quite $6 an hour for men and a little over $5 an hour for women. Very many of the people who are working part time are being paid at casual rates which gives them the princely amount of an extra 20 per cent on top of those hourly rates to compensate for causal employment. These are the people I referred to earlier-the ones who are absolutely stunned by, amazed at and disbelieving of the continual references to rapidly increased wages for which they are being blamed and which, if the Government is to be believed, are at the root of all the economic problems of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> During the demonstration yesterday, I spoke to two young women whose husbands are coal miners at Kemira 'sitting' in the coal mine for two weeks. The women came with their little children on a very long and uncomfortable journey to Canberra to take part in the demonstration. I asked those women whether there was work available for them as their husbands are now unemployed. One of them told me that yes, she had a part time job. Last week she earned $34. That did not go very far towards paying off a heavy mortgage. This is the situation of very many families in Australia where the second income is simply a small amount which tops up the family's income keeping that family out of poverty. The loss of the second income, whether it be the primary one or that small supplementary one, can be a great tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the past 18 months we have seen a number of demonstrations outside Parliament House. Until yesterday all of them were by people who could fairly easily be ignored. They included pensioners, people concerned about child care- the people protesting about women's refuges were a little noisier than the rest- the handicapped and Aborigines. Yesterday, however, brought to Canberra a group of people who in a physical sense could not quite so easily be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> When they came into King's Hall we heard from the chamber what sounded like a dull roar; when I went into King's Hall I found that the demonstrators were singing-it still sounded like a dull roar. The song they were singing was written for them by the people who were staging a sit-in at Kemira. I wish to read the two verses of this song. I will not sing it; I will not inflict that on the Senate or the listening public. For a start, I do not want to get into trouble with the musicians union! The song went as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> How many jobs must a man hold down Before you can call him a man?</PARA>
<PARA> Yes, and how many times must a man get the sack Before he is branded for life?</PARA>
<PARA> How many days must we stay underground Before BHP sees the light?</PARA>
<PARA> How many times must we go outside Before we can see our wives?</PARA>
<PARA> Yes, and how many ears must the BHP have Before they can hear people cry?</PARA>
<PARA> And how many jobs will it take till they know That people need work to exist?</PARA>
<PARA>What that song lacks in literary merit I suggest it makes up for in poignancy. It would not be of any satisfaction to any of us, the people listening to us or the miners themselves that the miners will have a lot of time on their hands in which to indulge in choir practice, in the near future. The miners were not just calling on BHP to solve their problems. They were calling on the Government to give them back their jobs, to assert its authority over BHP, to stop further sackings, to obtain and disclose information on BHP's future investment plans and to ensure rational planning of the coal and steel industries. I think it would be reasonable to suggest that the requests of the miners would apply to very many industries throughout Australia. These are exactly the sorts of approaches that should be taken by the Government. It is fruitless, specious and dishonest to go on blaming the wages workers of Australia for Australia's current economic ills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Today the Senate is debating a matter of public importance proposed by Senator Grimes in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The disastrous failure of the Government's economic policies as demonstrated by the unacceptably high unemployment rate and increasing inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a serious matter. The Government accepts that unemployment at the moment in Australia is at an unacceptably high level. As a matter of interest, however, it is at a level that is still below that of countries such as West Germany and France, which are presumably the democratic socialist models we are being invited to follow. Nevertheless, we do accept that unemployment is unacceptably high. Furthermore, the September consumer price index figures show increasing inflation which is, unfortunately, frighteningly out of step with our trading partners. Therefore, it is quite reasonable to ask whether there is, in fact, an alternative better economic strategy for this country. I give credit to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) because yesterday, at least, he was prepared to put an alternative strategy. That is good because it gives this Parliament and the Australian people an opportunity to look at the Government's economic program and the Australian Labor Party's alternative to it. I intend to deal with that in a little while, but first I wish to set the scene. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a trading nation. Thirty per cent of our gross domestic product is comprised of revenue from trade. We are in the midst of a major world recession- probably the worst recession in the last 50 years. Unfortunately, it is a recession that is getting worse internationally. Our exports comprise largely minerals and primary produce and, to a lesser extent, manufactured items. Unfortunately, and most regrettably, at the same time we are in the midst of what is possibly the worst drought in Australia's history. The international depression has slashed out the markets for our minerals. The drought in Australia has slashed the opportunity for our rural exports. It appears that this year Australia of all places, will need to import wheat to feed its sheep. Thirdly, our exports of manufactured goods struggle because of the high cost of Australian labour and transport. We do not hear cries from the Labor Party to reduce the high cost of labour in Australia. The cry is quite to the contrary; rather that it should be maintained or increased. Even the Labor Party would not claim that the Government is responsible for the world recession and the collapse of the mineral market. Nor, I suspect, would the Labor Party claim that the Government should be held responsible for the drought and, therefore, the collapse of our rural economy this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Great difficulties face government at the moment. It is impossible to look at the economic circumstances of this country outside the context of world economic difficulties. It is also a mistake to assess economic performance over too short a period. The growth performance of this Government over recent years has been better than that in most other countries. Last year in Australia real personal expenditures rose by 3 per cent, gross domestic product by 3 per cent and non- farm sector growth by 2 per cent. That should be compared with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development area generally in which real gross national product increased by only half a per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic policies of this Government and Australia's relative energy endowments have sustained our economic growth beyond that of others. We have until now been able to cushion ourselves against the international recession, but such cushioning can be of only a temporary nature. As the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said in the other place yesterday, the recession hit us later but it is not hitting us any less because of the timing difference. When international circumstances are running against us is it a time to exacerbate rather than reduce those adverse international circumstances? That is what the policy package of the Opposition would do. It is a somewhat familiar recipe. The Leader of the Opposition said that the answer lies in increased capital works, higher pensions and benefits, maintained protection levels and a freeze on all State and Commonwealth charges. It is interesting to reflect what was said in this morning's Australian Financial Review about that package, the Australian Financial Review being a newspaper that has not always been kind to this Government. The editorial states:</PARA>
<PARA> In this climate it is easy for the Labor Party to make grandiose promises about spending stimulus through tax cuts or higher pensions and benefits, to avoid the need to increase government charges at a time when government enterprises are running huge deficits, to make capital grants for job creation, to maintain industry protection regardless of the viability of industries, and to maintain real wages. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what the Leader of the Opposition proposed in Parliament yesterday. It is a recipe not only for economic disaster, but also what is worse, given the need for a strong democratic system, for the ignominious collapse of yet another Labor Government if the ALP should win the next federal election. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are very harsh words. The editorial continues:</PARA>
<PARA> This leaves the Labor Party with a fiscal program which promises nothing-</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat-</PARA>
<PARA> This leaves the Labor Party with a fiscal program which promises nothing but unemployment and inflation on a larger scale than we have now, and the prospect of further involuntary devaluations of the Australian dollar as we are locked into a devaluation/inflation spiral. From his public comments so far it seems that the shadow Treasurer, Mr Willis, has learnt very little from his sojourn in France. </PARA>
<PARA>That reference to his sojourn in France is interesting also because one thing that came out of the recent International Monetary Fund meeting in Toronto was an agreement that the first step in the recovery of Western nations had to be the control of inflation. It was agreed that the control of inflation remains the single most important objective for industrialised countries. One can refer particularly to people such as Prime Minister Trudeau, whose policy in the past has favoured the expansionary theory as a solution to economic problems. On this occasion, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Inflation is not consistent with growth and stability. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer also to the Minister of Finance in France. We know that France went the way that the Opposition is recommending to the Australian public that our economy should proceed. Already, even after such a short period of government in France, the Finance Minister, at the International Monetary Fund meeting, said:</PARA>
<PARA> We must not give in to easy temptations of unrestrained public expenditure or the deceptive, transient attractions of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>So even in France there has been a major change in attitude, a change away from what was recommended yesterday by the leader of the Australian Labor Party. The Government also says that the Opposition's proposed package is economic nonsense . It will not work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, in France the unemployment rate is 9.1 per cent as opposed to the rate in Australia-which we accept nevertheless is unsatisfactory-of 7.4 per cent. If honourable senators want to compare unemployment rates I point out that the rate in the United Kingdom is 13 per cent and in the United States of America it is 9.8 per cent. It is an unfortunate fact that throughout the Western world rates of unemployment are far too high but, relatively, Australia is not as bad as some. The Government does not attempt to use that as any form of excuse. We say that the Labor Party's proposition is economic nonsense. We require policies to keep inflation down, to encourage greater production and growth and to increase economic efficiency. It is only by real economic growth and economic efficiency that we will be able to absorb the unemployed in long term employment, not just some form of temporary employment, the cost of which itself will delay recovery. Artificial schemes have been tried before and they have failed. If they are attempted again they will fail again. It is easy to redefine employment and solve the problem in that way but it does not mean that the community is better off. An extreme example is the Soviet Union. By definition, it has full employment but nevertheless there are food queues and a low standard of living. So employment in itself is not the total answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The real concern now must be whether we will be in a competitive position when the world comes out of the current recession. As the Treasurer said in his Budget Speech:</PARA>
<PARA> The plain, inescapable fact is that Australia has priced herself out of many world markets. </PARA>
<PARA>The high inflation figure just released in part results from the fact that we in Australia, we the wage earners, are giving ourselves increases that simply are beyond the capacity of this country currently to withstand. One has only to look at increases over recent years. In 1973-74 the increase in average weekly earnings was 16.2 per cent; in 1974-75 it was 25.4 per cent. I will not be so unkind as to remind the Opposition who was in government at that time. Increases for the following years are: 1975-76 14.4 per cent; 1976-77, 12.4 per cent; 1977 -78, 9.9 per cent; 1978-79, 7.7 per cent; 1979-80, 9.9 per cent; 1980-81 13.5 per cent; and, in 1981-82, something around 14 per cent. That situation has to be contrasted with the rate of wage increase in the countries that make up our markets. For last year the increase in Germany was only 4 per cent. Japan had an increase of somewhere between 3 per cent and 4 per cent, the United States of America 6 per cent and the United Kingdom 7 per cent. We are severely out of step. This was recognised recently by the Commonwealth Banking Corporation in a commissioned study for the Metal Trades Industry Association when it said:</PARA>
<PARA> In the current climate of depressed corporate profitability, declining international competitiveness and flat market conditions, both domestically and internationally, failure to achieve a marked deceleration in wages growth will inevitably lead to a deeper and more prolonged downswing in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>In the same survey the bank indicated that, unlike what the Labor Party says, the degree of increases in prices is not in step with increases in wages and is not contributing to inflation to the same extent. I remind the Senate of what the Treasurer, Mr Howard, said in 1981. It turns out to have been something of a profound warning. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if unchecked the pressure for higher wages will not only lead to higher inflation but reverse the falling trend in unemployment and put at risk both investment and employment growth. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course that is what has happened. Someone recently said that there is too much concentration in Australia on the politics of consumption and not enough on the politics of production. Perhaps that is right. However, in recent times the Government has made a number of changes to facilitate economic growth and they are worth referring to today. They seem to have been rapidly forgotten by the Opposition. In the field of assistance to industry I remind the Senate of the package delivered last July which included accelerated plant depreciation provisions to encourage efficiency, investment and growth. We remember that it included for the first time depreciation of income producing buildings, an increase in export market development grants in recognition of our trading needs and continued support for industrial research and development through a realisation that to survive in a competitive world we must be technically competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the Budget decisions reduced income tax rates in order to increase incentives. The retention allowance for private companies was increased, as were rebates on dividend income to encourage investment. Rebates are now allowable for employee share acquisition schemes to encourage workers to become more involved in the companies for which they work. All these measures demand credit. I remind the Senate also of the employment encouraging schemes funded in the last Budget. There has been an increase in the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training Scheme to assist another 226,000 Australians. There has been a 36 per cent increase in youth training programs. Unemployment and training program expenditure has been bolstered by 20 per cent to a figure of $250m. I remind the Senate also of the 20 per cent increase in capital expenditure in the Budget, and what is now being advocated is an even greater figure. In conclusion, I remind the Senate of what Mr Hayden said in his 1975-76 Budget Speech when he was Treasurer. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to provide more and more Government services or transfer payments from the Budget without ultimately having to pay for them through cutting back after-tax earnings via increased taxes. It is not possible to get quarts out of pint pots. </PARA>
<PARA>On this occasion it is worth reminding the Opposition of what its leader said when he was Treasurer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, put forward the Government's attitude to the current economic problems which we are now debating. She said, in effect, that we have to wait for an upturn in the economies of the Western world, we have to wait for the drought to break and we have to wait for tax cuts to take effect. I believe there are two consequences of the Government's economic policy, of the Government's approach to managing the economy, which cannot wait for one day longer. I refer to unemployment and to the balance of payments on current account. These two problems, taken together, are now so serious that we have got past the point of economic debate. We cannot discuss or talk or argue about what will happen in these two critical areas; action is required immediately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to examine in some detail these two factors of Government economic policy. I refer first to employment. It is important for the people of this country to realise that unemployment is not inevitable. Senator Hill pointed to unemployment levels in other countries. I am not concerned with those countries; I am concerned about what happens in Australia. We are 15 million people living on an entire continent. If we cannot fully employ our work force under these conditions, we do not deserve to inhabit this continent. Unemployment, it must be realised, is not a technical problem beyond the control of governments. Unemployment is a government responsibility. The Government must be forced to take action. It will take action if sufficient people say that they are not prepared to tolerate for one day longer these levels of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, unemployment is a moral issue. It is wrong. It is bad. It is an outrage on the dignity of the individual. It creates impossible stresses for family life. If this country were at war, there is no doubt that we would find the money to fight that war. I suggest that we are facing a crisis of unemployment which is every bit as serious as this country being attacked. We have to develop an attitude that we are on a moral crusade. We have to adopt an attitude that the unemployment problem has to be solved, and solved immediately, or we run the risk of breaking the social fabric of our society. Money has to be found to be directed carefully into efficient, labour intensive industries. I do not pretend to list what those vital industries should be. It is up to the Government to arrive at a consensus among the parties. The need for consensus is one aspect of the speech of the Minister for Finance with which I do agree absolutely. There has to be a consensus as to what the long term goals of this country are to be. Money then has to be found to be directed into those areas so that the problem of unemployment can be solved quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to develop a renewable energy source. We have to develop water conservation. We have to build roads and we have to build houses. We have 270, 000 people living in caravans in Australia right now. We have 100,000 people waiting for emergency housing. Above all, we have to develop small business enterprises which are efficient and are wealth producing enterprises. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle said: 'Let us wait for the tax cuts to take effect'. We might be waiting a long time if the American experience can be taken as a model. What has happened in the United States with the much heralded tax cuts in that country is simply that the money has gone straight into savings. When there is massive unemployment, that is where tax cuts will go, of course. People are going to build up their savings as quickly as possible because of the constant fear of unemployment. Tax cuts are not necessarily going to solve our problem. There is only one way really to stimulate consumption, that is, to get goods to the public more cheaply. That can be done in a variety of ways. We could reduce payroll tax which is the tax on labour. We could reduce sales tax. Somehow cheaper goods have to get to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> The second fundamental problem with the Government's economic management is that we have a critical balance of payments problem on current account. Unless there are policy changes so that our continuing current account deficit is arrested, there is no doubt that Australia will become internationally insolvent within only a few years. Last year, our current account deficit was $9.1 billion . That was made up of exports for which we earned $19 billion. We spent $22 billion on imports. The balance of those two figures was $3 billion in deficit. The invisible trade deficit was another $5.8 billion. That trade deficit, the invisibles, is made up of interest rates on foreign loans and paying dividends on investments for multinational companies in this country. We simply cannot go on putting the country into hock at this rate. </PARA>
<PARA> What should we do about the problem? There are various policy initiatives that we could adopt to erode this run on our foreign exchange. I simply point to our history, to go back to the years 1950 to 1953. As honourable senators will recall, there was a change of government about that time. The Menzies-Fadden Government came to power in 1949. It had only just come to power when it found that suddenly inflation was running at the rate of two per cent a month, which is at the rate of 24 per cent per annum. It found that the balance of payments had suddenly deteriorated and that unemployment was rising rapidly. To the eternal credit of those two men, they took action. This Government has to do likewise. The Menzies-Fadden Government adopted a positive and flexible attitude towards short term economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government can no longer sit back and adopt the comfortable monetarist approach which says that a government does not need to interfere in the management of the economy: Just control the rate of supply of money, and everything else will fall into line. That policy has not worked. It is patently obvious that it is not working. There has to be a change of approach by the Government. What did the Menzies-Fadden Government do? It introduced import quotas. It brought down a moratorium on imports from the United States. It immediately controlled interest rates. It used taxation in a counter-cyclical manner to stimulate the economy. It is not my place nor is it my party's place to say precisely what the Government's economic policy should be; but I am saying that, if honourable senators look at our history, they will find that previous conservative administrations were prepared to act in a positive manner in relation to emergencies which arose. This Government has to do likewise. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by pointing out that the two basic problems of unemployment and balance of payments are matters which the Government cannot wait to rectify. I believe that, if the Government were prepared to approach all parties in this Parliament in order to get a consensus, it would be surprised at the degree of co-operation that it would receive. Nobody in this Parliament wants to see a repeat of what we saw yesterday when we had armed police walking the corridors of this Parliament, probably for the first time in the history of our Federation . </PARA>
<PARA> My message is also to the Australian people. I believe that they have been hoodwinked into believing that unemployment is inevitable and that the Government cannot do anything about it. The facts of the matter are that if governments are prepared to accept unemployment as the first priority, if they are prepared to put people first, if they are prepared to say that nothing else matters and that the unemployment problem has to be solved first, they will very quickly arrive-particularly if they attempt to arrive at a consensus-at policies that would solve the unemployment problem. Coincidentally, the same policies would probably solve the balance of payments problem. The answer is not to tighten further the economic screws. The problem will not be solved if the Government sits back and hopes that something will happen overseas. Action has to be initiated right here and now. If the Government is not prepared to take action, if it cannot see what policy initiatives should be taken and if it is not prepared to attempt to arrive at a consensus of action, I suggest that it should not occupy the seat of government for one day longer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to contribute briefly to this debate about the condition of the economy, unemployment being the principal thrust of the matter which is before the Senate. I want to look at the question of unemployment in the context of the Government's general management of the economy. Let me say at the outset, to paraphrase something that Senator Siddons said, that this Government has had a policy of fighting inflation first for seven years, and I do not think that the Government has been very successful. In fact, in that fight the Government is now getting hell beaten out of it and it is probably time it picked on something smaller than the current inflation rate rather than continue to fight inflation with the degree of success it is having as a government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to talk about this seven-year period of disaster of the Fraser Government and, in a sense, set it in the context of the last 33 years of Australian politics, 30 of which have been presided over by Liberal-National Party governments. What has been happening to this country over the last 30 years is that it has been going down the hit parade very steadily in terms of economic performance and growth. That process has accelerated over the last seven years. The acceleration has been due to mismanagement, ad hockery and broken promises. The whole question has been compounded by the Government's penchant every year prior to an election for manufacturing some fictitious recovery, such as the resources led recovery before the 1980 election and the consumer led recovery in 1977. All of these things which were going to happen were distractions before an election and were quickly abandoned and forgotten about after the election was over. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent days the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has been very anxious, one might even say desperate, to try to paint Australia's economic performance as being in some ways quite good when one compares it with that of other countries. I want to go through, as a matter of fact, what the situation is in respect of some of the main indicators of economic management. I shall deal first of all with the question of unemployment. Unemployment has been high in Australia for a number of years. It is now at its highest level since the Great Depression, with 7.4 per cent of the work force unemployed. This figure is in fact higher than the level recorded in the 1933 census when the Depression was drawing slowly to a close. Let me compare the present level of unemployment of 7 .4 per cent in Australia with that of other countries. In New Zealand the level of unemployment is 4 per cent; in Sweden, 4 per cent; in Japan, 2.4 per cent; in West Germany, 6.6 per cent; and in Italy, 10 per cent. Italy always has a higher unemployment figure than Australia. In the United States the level of unemployment is 10.1 per cent. In Mexico it is 8 per cent; in Canada, 12.2 per cent; and in Britain, 14.8 per cent. The disaster areas are Canada and Britain. It is not a very good comparative record for Australia which, as we are all reminded from time to time, is a resource rich country. </PARA>
<PARA> The same sort of comparison can be made when one looks at the consumer price index which, for the year ended September, showed a 12.3 per cent increase over the last year. For the September quarter of this year it showed a 3.5 per cent increase. I do not need to deal with the multiplying factors which previous Ministers of this Government have used about inflation figures. I just draw the attention of the Senate to the actual figure. At the end of the September quarter the growth in the CPI was 12.3 per cent. Up to August of this year the average annual rate of all Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, compared with Australia's 12.3 per cent, was 7.8 per cent . In July only France and Canada, amongst all OECD countries, exceeded Australia 's rate of inflation. In the month of July, Japan's annual rate of inflation was 1.7 per cent; the United States, 8.5 per cent; the United Kingdom, 8.7 per cent; and West Germany, 5.6 per cent. The real concern is not these comparative figures but the fact that inflation is going down in the majority of OECD countries while in Australia it is going up. The inflation rate is now back where this Government started from and worse. The average rate of the European Economic Community was 10 per cent and falling, while the OECD rate was 7.8 per cent and falling. At the same time, if one looks at interest rates, the long term government bond rate in Australia is currently 13.2 per cent. In July, the equivalent rate in Japan was 8.3 per cent; in the United States, 13.9 per cent; in West Germany, 9.3 per cent; and in the United Kingdom, 12.1 per cent. Again, that is not a very favourable comparison for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the Australian dollar continues to fall against the United States dollar. The figure published a week ago is Australia's lowest rate ever against the United States dollar. One can go through other indicators, such as housing approvals and the incomes of Australians. The average income of Australians has fallen significantly in the last seven years. Two million people are now said to be living on or around the poverty line. Consumer confidence is at its lowest in nine years and working families are now some $30 a week behind the living standards of seven years ago. I mention those things which, of course, can be the subject of dispute. That does not add up to a very impressive record for a government which has had three chances and should be denied any more if this country is to make any progress and get out of the current economic malaise which it is in. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of excuses are offered by the Government for this position. This Government is one of the world's experts in finding scapegoats and excuses for its own abysmal performance. The first excuse, of course, is that wages in Australia are too high and that there were large increases in wages in 1981. That is true and it is most undesirable. It is most undesirable that there should be any significant wage increases at the present time. But where does the explanation for all that lie? Where does it lie in terms of a government which promised to maintain the Prices Justification Trubunal, which is relevant to the question of wage fixation? Where does it lie in terms of a government which said that it would maintain wage indexation and in July of last year just abandoned it? This Government has no wages policy. I am not the only authority for that proposition. Mr Peacock, the new Minister for Industry and Commerce, argued the view quite recently that this Government has no wages policy except to say that wages are too high. In the absence of a wages policy, a government which assumes responsibility for the economic management of a country cannot get out of it by simply blaming wage earners and trade unions for the wage explosion of last year . This Government has had no success in negotiating towards a proper prices and incomes policy in this country and it will have no success. There has been a lot of talk of consensus in this debate. There is no person in this country who has done more to fracture the possibility of social consensus on these issues than the Prime Minister. The absence of the capacity to obtain a consensus because of promises made and readily abandoned is relevant to the whole question of a wages policy. The second thing is that this Government has said that it does not believe in having a centralised wages policy. Until it gets that fundamental question resolved it really has no hope of dealing with this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The second excuse of this Government is that State charges are responsible for the increase on the consumer price index and the increase in inflation in Australia. State charges have increased, as have national government charges. I make the point that one of the reasons why State charges have increased, and probably the most significant reason, is the very fact that the present Government has embarked upon a policy of new federalism and it has not been prepared to meet its own obligations under its own stated policy of new federalism. The essence of the new federalism policy, which was enunciated with such fervour in 1976, is that governments should raise the money which they intend to expend. That is the simple proposition involved in all of that. There is much to be said for that view. But the Government has not done anything about carrying that view into effect. I do not wish to be an authority for that proposition, but Senator Chaney's friend, Professor Russell Mathews, has put it in these simple terms:</PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that the reason why no State has legislated for a surcharge--</PARA>
<PARA>He was talking about a tax surcharge-</PARA>
<PARA> Is that it would have to be superimposed on an already high and inequitably distributed burden of income taxation. If the Commonwealth had been sincere in its professed intention of permitting State personal income taxes, it should have made tax room for the States by simultaneously reducing its own tax rates and the level of tax sharing entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA>That puts it in a nutshell. It is one of the reasons why the States have had to raise charges. It is one of the reasons why the States are in their present budgetary positions. One could go on documenting, as it were, this Government's failures and crises in economic management and failures and crises in a resource -rich country which has seen a steady decline of its manufacturing industry, a steady growth in unemployment, and no hope for the future from this Government in respect of any of those things. What I suppose, personally, that I resent most about this Government is that it has turned the lucky country into the land of lost opportunities. It has had seven years of opportunities to do something about these issues which are now confronting it as nightmares. The progress in terms of encouraging new industries to this country, the progress in establishing or helping to establish high technology industries here, the progress in boosting the fortunes of manufacturing industry by sensitive restructuring programs, has not gone on at all. Nothing has happened. That is why it is a land of lost opportunities, after seven years of the Fraser Government. Unless we do some of these things, we are absolutely right in concluding that there is no hope. That is the greatest failure of this Government in terms of seven years of bad economic management-that none of these things has happened and that there is no promise for the future. These things have not happened because before each election the Government has been content to rely on some mythical boom that is about to take place, as a means of stimulating its own fortunes in the election, for the morale of the troops, and that sort of thing; but the booms and talk-ups of the economy have had no relation to reality. Any debate in this Parliament and any debate about the future of this country and the state of the economy must surely, now in present circumstances, be conducted on a basis of starting from realities. There is no agreement about starting from a basis of realities, and there is very little capacity now, after these seven years of experience, to obtain any agreement on those questions. I know that Senator Martyr will take the usual line, saying: ' the Whitlam Government was bad; look at the inflation rate in 1975'-or something like that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin where Senator Button left off. When he prophesied that I would be saying something about the years of the failed Whitlam Government, of course he was right, because that is the only example in recent years that the people of this country have had to judge the now Opposition. It was an utter and complete failure. No one denies that, not even some of the people in its own ranks. I make two points immediately in regard to Senator Button's assertions about the prices and incomes policy. He does not understand that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has the job of balancing all the difficult and unreliable variables. If excessive demands are made, he must reject them firmly. That is his duty to the whole of Australia. So he is accused, because he is firm, of not looking for consensus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Lord preserve us from this stupid and silly word 'consensus', which has appeared just recently in the vocabulary of the image makers. Consensus is not necessarily the answer to the problems of this country. It is another slogan word. It is like the subject matter of this debate today. It is just a slogan. We have heard it day after day and week after week, the same old thing. The Opposition feels that if it shouts this weekly from the house tops, someone will hear it. It is like the sower scattering his seed-except that in this case it is the blind hoping to give sight to the unsighted. Someone out there might believe it. </PARA>
<PARA> All Australians know that we have problems, but they know that the answers are difficult. They know that the economic anarchy that the Australian Labor Party proposes will make matters worse. That well known supporter of economic anarchy, Senator Grimes, always conveniently forgets the saying-it is one that we should all remember-of his former colleague, the former Treasurer, Frank Crean, that one man's wage rise is another man's job. That is true. The cost of labour is relevant in all economic argument. Minimum wage awards in this country are one of the greatest bars to the maximum utilisation of youth in the work force. If the trade unions will moderate demands somewhat, employment prospects must improve. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other reasons for unemployment. There were two news items today concerning the matter. One is about Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd refusing a request by the Federal Government to delay the retrenchment of nearly 400 colliery workers at Wollongong. The second is a mining union official saying that protests by coal mine workers would continue until the unions are satisfied that retrenchment by BHP and its subsidiaries is the only avenue left. In present circumstances, I believe that that is probably the only avenue that is left. There is no demand for the coal. Australia cannot produce steel economically. If we wish to preserve our markets for iron ore and coal to Japan and other cheap steel producers, we must be prepared to buy back some of the steel product. I realise the difficulty of employment around Newcastle and the Hunter Valley. But should not the unions have fought the conservationists who denied other employment opportunities of new industries which will not now be in the Hunter Valley?</PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Button mentioned, there is a connection between this matter of public importance debate today and the debate in the House of Representatives yesterday, both of which, I hope, are only coincidental with the disgraceful incidents that occurred here yesterday. There is no excuse whatsoever for the demonstation which damaged the doors of this building. I hope that Senator Button, in his speech earlier, was not threatening us with any more of the same. It does not need much logic to appreciate that pulling down this building will not solve any of Australia's problems, or any of the wreckers' problems either. Those who quietened the mob yesterday, whether they are from this side of the house, the other side or the police, deserve our thanks. I repeat that it should never have happened. I would have thought that the Opposition would have had enough of this sloganising after yesterday's caning it got in the House of Representatives, particularly the Leader of the Opposition in that place. However, Senator Grimes, Senator Button and others are gluttons for punishment. They keep coming back for more. They repeat the hyperbole of their colleagues in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> We acknowledge that the problems exist. We have never run away from that, but we are doing as much as we reasonably can to solve them. Senator Grimes and others act and speak as though the Australian economy were nothing but a money tree-that if they just give it a shake it will solve all of the country's problems. Even the Leader of the Opposition in the other place, Mr Hayden, concedes that we have problems. I quote from his speech yesterday. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> One freely acknowledges that it is extremely difficult to handle a national economy at present, given the state of the world's economy. </PARA>
<PARA>I could not ask for a better basis on which to make my speech. I could not ask the Opposition in this place to do any more than to read those words of the Leader of the Opposition in the other place. But not all of the members of the Opposition agree. Some difference of opinion was expressed today from the views of the Leader of the Opposition in the other place. In a television interview on 25 October Mr Willis, the shadow Treasurer, was asked by the interviewer: 'Do you think any other government could have done better?'. He replied, naturally: 'I think we should have done better. I think we would have done better, yes'. Now let us see how well the Opposition performed when it did have the chance. At this stage I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table of figures on the consumer price index and average weekly earnings year by year for the last 10 years. The table was in the hands of Senator Button when he was at the table earlier. I understand he did agree to its incorporation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Those figures show that it is ludicrous for the Opposition to say that the Government's anti-inflation policy has failed. On looking at the figures it will be seen how the Government has significantly reduced the inflation rate. Labor allowed it to rise by nearly 7 percentage points in 1973-74. The Governemnt has kept control over the pressures in the economy. It has kept control as best it could over the CPI and the AWE figures, unlike the Labor Government. Under Labor average weekly earnings shot up. They rose at a rate of 25 per cent in 1974-75, which naturally pushed up the inflation rate. We are now seeing a resurgence of wage pressures and we are all sorry about that. Average weekly earnings rose by nearly 15 per cent last year but the rise was 13.5 per cent in 1980-81. I repeat that this will have a bad effect on employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Giles said that we-the Government-blame the ordinary wage earner for economic troubles. Never. We blame those who mislead the workers, such as Senator Grimes and Senator Button. They create expectations which cannot be gratified, and so do some union leaders-not all of them-some of whom were here yesterday. Australia's problems are the problems of the world, as Mr Hayden has said. But we have a very high home ownership rate and a social security net with mesh so fine that hardly anyone goes wanting. Our social security system contains a policy of almost guaranteed minimum income for everybody in this country. These are the big differences between this country and some of the other countries that the Opposition has been speaking about. Remember that the home ownership rate in this country, as high as it is, is one of the greatest distinguishing factors between Australia and other countries. Certainly we have unemployment but by world standards, as some of the other Government speakers have demonstrated, it is not the worst. As I have said, the social security system is so good that no one is yet suffering-and never will-as people did in the 1930s Depression. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition speakers in the Senate do a disservice when they raise the spectre of the 1930s. No one in government wants worse unemployment than we presently have. Opposition speakers laud European socialist parties and the governments that they form. My recent experience, having visited the nordic countries during the recess, is that they doctor their unemployment figures. Their deficits are far worse than ours as a proportion of gross domestic product. Senator Hill's description of France as a financial failure is quite right, and for one sound reason-it has gone in for huge public expenditure as the solution for its problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. President Mitterand has recently confessed that the direction is wrong and that France must pursue a direction more in line with that which this Government is taking. Australia's troubles are linked, as Mr Hayden said, with world problems. Australia is employing similar methods to those outlined in the most recent issue of the Economist, from which I will quote. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If inflationary expectations can be conquered, that might allow a return towards the happy-and technologically actually less promising-two decades after 1948 when in most industrial countries a 6 per cent rise in money demand used to bring something like a 5 per cent growth and one per cent inflation. Since 1968, and especially since 1973, a 6 per cent rise in money supply has more usually brought 6 per cent inflation and 0 per cent growth for the logical reason that it has been more profitable to use any extra money to buy an inflation hedge than to invest in industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The Economist is one of the most authoritative economic journals in the world. I think it is worth quoting. It further states:</PARA>
<PARA> Economic growth depends on all four of (a) new technology; (b) the existence of entrepreneurial business mechanisms; (c) the absence of gross inflationary expectations; (d) whether the recent macroeconomic policies of government and banks have been prudent or potty. </PARA>
<PARA>In America, more than in Britain and probably in Australia too, the forward prospects of new technology and the existence of enterprise and business mechamisms look remarkably good. The prospects in the world at the moment, in the absence of gross inflationary expectations, are improving and the rapid fall in interest rates suggests that Reagan and Thatcher macroeconomics have not been entirely potty. This is an accurate assessment of the present world situation. On looking at the present macroeconomic policies of this Government it will be plain that they fit more broadly into that context than into any other. I submit that we are on the right track. We are locked into a world situation and we must rely on exports to pay our way. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate my second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of this legislation marks a significant turning point for environmental law in Australia. This Bill proposes that effect be given in Australia to the International Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage-'World Heritage Convention'. In doing so this Bill does nothing more than put into legislation the responsibilities that this Federal Government has accepted by endorsing the World Heritage Convention. It would create for the first time in Australia truly national parks. The World Heritage Convention was adopted by the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation on 16 November 1972. Australia ratified and thereby became a State Party to the Convention on 22 August 1974. The Convention came into force on 17 December 1975, three months after the twentieth instrument of ratification was deposited with UNESCO. The Convention is aimed at identifying and protecting the world's cultural and natural heritage . </PARA>
<PARA> Cultural heritage includes: 'sites . . . areas including archaeological sites which are of outstanding universal value from the historical, aesthetic, ethnological or anthropological points of view.' (Article 1) 'Natural heritage' is defined as: natural features consisting of physical and biological formations or groups of such formations, which are of outstanding universal value from the aesthetic or scientific point of view: Geological and physiographical formations and precisely delineated areas which constitute the habitat of threatened species of animals and plants of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation; natural sites or precisely delineated natural areas of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty. (Article 2) Each State Party to the Convention is required to identify those properties situated on its territory which form part of the world cultural and natural heritage; it then submits an inventory of those properties to the World Heritage Committee, which may include each property on the World Heritage List. </PARA>
<PARA> To date, Australian property on the list includes sections of the Great Barrier Reef, the Willandra Lakes Region and Kakadu National Park, while the Wilderness regions of South-West Tasmania and Lord Howe Island have been nominated. By becoming a party to the Convention, Australia recognises that '. . . the identification, protection, conservation, presentation and transmission to future generations of the cultural and natural heritage . . . situated on its territory . . .' is primarily its own duty; further it undertakes that: it will do all that it can to this end, to the utmost of its own resources . . . ( Article 4) Article 5 of the Convention sets out a number of more specific obligations which the Australian Government assumed when it ratified the Convention; these include: to take the appropriate . . . legal administrative and financial measures necessary for the identification. (Article 5 (D)) The Australian government has also agreed to . . . endeavour by all appropriate means . . . to strengthen appreciation and respect (by the people of Australia) of the cultural and natural heritage . . . keep the public broadly informed of the dangers threatening this heritage and of activities carried on in pursuance of this Convention. (Article 27)</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is being introduced at a time when Australia is engulfed in the most significant and controversial environmental battle for some time-the battle to save the Franklin and Gordon Rivers in Tasmania, and the wilderness of South- West Tasmania. It is an unequivocal policy of the Australian Democrats-at both State and Federal level-that the magnificent and scientifically significant environment of South-West Tasmania be preserved for all time. The end result of this Bill would be to ensure that South-West Tasmania would be saved for future generations in accordance with Australia's obligations under the World Heritage Convention. Importantly, it would also enable those other areas already on the World Heritage List, and those areas that could be nominated in future, to be given the full protection of Commonwealth Law as required. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has long recognised the unique place of the South-West as part of Australia's natural heritage; this recognition was made concrete in 1980 when the South-West wilderness was entered upon the Register of the National Estate. </PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania has also recognised the value of the South-West by what was until recently a continual expansion of the areas of wilderness dedicated to the public in the form of conservation areas and national parks. On 13 November 1981 the Commonwealth, acting on the recommendation and with the approval of the Tasmanian Government, officially nominated the Western Tasmania Wilderness National Parks for inscription on the World Heritage List. The World Heritage Committee will consider that nomination at its meeting in December 1982. The fact that Australia has nominated the South-West for inscription on the World Heritage List is an express recognition by the Commonwealth that the South-West forms part of the world cultural and natural heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> Having recognised and identified a part of this heritage, the Commonwealth immediately becomes subject to the obligations of the Convention in relation to that part of the heritage. It is not necessary for an area to be inscribed on the World Heritage List before the obligations imposed by the Convention come into play: although inscription on the World Heritage List gives an area an ' official' recognition and status, the Convention applies to all identified and delineated areas which fall within 'cultural heritage' or 'natural heritage' as defined by the Convention. It is thus vital that not only areas included upon the World Heritage List, but also those nominated for it, are fully protected. This Bill provides for that. Clearly, obligations are imposed on the Australian Government by the World Heritage Convention. For our support and promotion of this convention to remain credible we must act now to give the Convention effect in Australia. Support for this Bill will accomplish that. The general position, under the Australian Constitution, is that the Commonwealth Government does not have legislative authority in respect of land use control. However, there are exceptions to this proposition and the question must always be resolved by reference to the heads of power set out in section 51 of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> If, in relation to a particular matter, there is a relevant head of power then the Commonwealth Parliament has the constitutional authority to legislate and that legislation over-rides any inconsistent legislation of a State-section 109 of the Constitution. This was the basis which enabled the Federal Government to introduce the Defence (Visiting Warships) Bill 1982 and over-ride the Victorian Government's proposed ban on nuclear warships. The Australian Democrats concurred with the Federal Government in this move. Section 51 of the Constitution provides that the Commonwealth Parliament shall have power to make laws with respect to external affairs. This power was recently considered by the High Court of Australia in the case of Koowarta v. Bjelke-Petersen (1982). The Court, by a majority, held that the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, enacted by the Commonwealth Parliament, was supported by the external affairs power. The legislation was a statutory implementation of the Internal Convention of on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1966). The Court rejected arguments that the external affairs power should read down to exclude areas otherwise within the concern of the Australian States. The majority pointed to the significance of the fact that a particular matter had been the subject of an International Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> The approach taken in the judgments in Koowarta appears equally applicable to the World Heritage Convention. This was a Convention entered into by a large number of countries under the auspices of an agency of the United Nations. It deals with a matter regarded as being a matter of international concern. It follows that the Commonwealth Parliament has power to enact legislation to implement, within Australia, its obligations under that Convention. It would certainly apply to areas nominated by the Australian Government, and accepted by the World Heritage Committee, as meeting the criterion for inclusion on the World Heritage List namely 'having outstanding universal value'. The Commonwealth Parliament has already recognised its entitlement to legislate in respect of the Convention. The National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 contains a provision section 69, empowering the Governor-General to make regulations for and in relation to giving effect to various specified agreements . These include the World Heritage Convention. It is quite possible that the Federal Government could regulate to preserve the South-West. All people concerned with the environment would welcome such a move so long as it achieved the aim of full preservation. Unfortunately we have waited and waited for the Federal Government to act. </PARA>
<PARA> For the sake of the wilderness we can wait no longer. Every day that the Government delays is another day in which more destruction will be wrought on the environment. Roads are being gouged in to the proposed dam site. Quarries are being excavated and camps are being built. This activity has resulted in a serious fire in the area. In order to live up to the obligations we have imposed on ourselves as a nation, by ratifying the World Heritage Convention and nominating South-West Tasmania, we must enact the Convention. The political and economic arguments have little place in this debate. The essence of this debate is that firstly, South-West Tasmania is a magnificent wilderness area that has been explicitly recognised as such by both State and Federal Governments and secondly, Australia has ratified the World Heritage Convention which gives us, as a nation, an obligation to ensure those areas of our natural and cultural heritage we have nominated are fully protected. There is an obligation that we have accepted and must act upon. I urge all those who are concerned with the preservation of our environment to support this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like some indication from the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) as to when in fact the debate on the Appropriation Bills will resume. We were informed last week that the Supply Bills-the all important Supply Bills-were to be introduced yesterday. The Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats agreed to that change in plan and agreed to expedite the passage of the Supply Bills notwithstanding what has been said publicly by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony). The Bills have now been introduced a day later than the Government indicated. We would like some indication as to when the Supply Bills will be listed for debate in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think at this stage it is significant that I raise this matter because rumours are flying around this Parliament to the effect that the House of Representatives will be rising tomorrow night and will not be recalled for the remainder of the year. Yet we have the Appropriation Bills, or the Supply Bills, brought into the Senate today-a Wednesday-with no indication from the Government as to when they are to be debated. Do I take it that the Government wishes the Supply Bills to be debated and passed by this chamber tomorrow? This means that the Senate would then be asked to undertake the extraordinary course of passing, in a matter of two or three hours, Bills that normally take the Senate when it is working at full speed something like 17 or 18 hours. Do I take it that if the House of Representatives rises tomorrow for the year and the Governor-General grants a double dissolution in the week off to the Prime Minister the Senate will be asked to resume on 9 November to pass the Supply Bills without any debate at all?</PARA>
<PARA> Frankly I am surprised that our colleagues in the Labor Party are not concerning themselves about this matter. If the scenario that is being rumoured in Parliament House at the moment comes true it is possible that, unless we get a guarantee from the Government, the Supply Bills will not be debated at all by the Senate when it rises tomorrow night and that a double dissolution will be announced the following week or the day after the South Australian election with the result that the House of Representatives would have been adjourned for the year and the Senate would then need to be recalled, after a double dissolution has been granted, and told that it has half an hour to pass the Supply Bills which deal with hundreds of millions of dollars of expenditure. I raise these matters because I think they are serious. In having the Bills listed on the Notice Paper for future debate I think that the Senate is entitled to some indication from the Minister as to when in fact this debate will be resumed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The package of Bills-six or seven in all-currently being debated involves changes in taxation laws pursuant to the measures announced with, and as part of, the Budget. Major changes are proposed in respect of the threshold and the rate at which personal income tax is payable . This, of course, will be trumpeted by the Government over the next couple of weeks as a major tax cut. Indeed, the Government has filched $1 1/2m from the taxpayers through a one-line appropriation in the estimates for the Department of the Treasury to advertise at public expense, to conduct a political advertising campaign and to maximise its political gain from these changes to the tax law. I use the term 'changes to tax rates' quite advisedly because it is misleading and it misrepresents the facts to call these changes 'tax cuts'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What these changes do is effectively to apply the principle of indexation. In other words, as a result of these changes being made, what the Prime Minister ( Mr Malcolm Fraser) used to call the secret tax of inflation and what economists call fiscal drag are to be cancelled for this year. But, in real terms, the amount of income tax paid by individuals will be the same this year as it was in the previous year barring only changes in real levels of income. If anything, of course, real incomes are likely to go down because the economy is now in the tail spin of a depression. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard-I apologise for not having shown them to the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) yet-tables which are the same as those Mr Willis had incorporated when this legislation was debated in the House of Representatives. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. These tables demonstrate the amount of tax payable in real terms as a proportion of income by taxpayers in various categories. The broad conclusion that can be drawn from those tables is that 98 per cent of taxpayers are paying more tax than they did seven years ago and that taxpayers overall will pay the same real level of taxation this year as they paid in the previous financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point I make about these changes, which the Government misrepresents as tax cuts, is that if there were to be an election this year and if as a result of some unforeseeable circumstance this Government were returned to office, we could be quite certain that these so-called tax cuts would be cancelled as they were cancelled in 1977. It is apparent and quite clear that there is going to be a $1 billion-or thereabouts-shortfall in revenue. A major reason for that shortfall is the very substantial watering down, indeed the near emasculation, of the proposed recoupment legislation which is designed to recover company and Division 7 tax evaded by people who sold companies with current year profits to so-called bottom-of-the-harbour operators. In the Bill as it was represented to the House of Representatives last week, some 700 companies-about one-sixth of the total-are to be completely exempt from the recoupment legislation. The amount of current year profit, and therefore of forgone revenue, involved is likely to be very much greater than one-sixth. Indeed, in that amendment alone, in that cave-in to the tax cheats alone, the Government has forgone one-third to one-half of the revenue it had previously aimed to recoup through this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second change with equally important ramifications for this financial year is that, provided the vendor shareholders make a downpayment of 25 per cent, they will have 12 months to pay the other 75 per cent. These, remember, are the people the Prime Minister was describing only last month as recipients of stolen money. They are the Prime Minister's words. Recipients of stolen money are to be given 12 months to pay back the money which they stole. Are we to anticipate that the Government will bring in legislation to give bank robbers and thieves in general 12 months after they have been caught to pay back money they have stolen? The money which the Prime Minister says was stolen and which people now will not have to repay will not even carry an interest charge. </PARA>
<PARA> Even Mr Sinclair pays interest on the money that he says his father stole from the Walsh companies, some of which he still has. He pays only 10 per cent and has done so since August 1980, whereas at least some of the funds, according to the documents that the Minister himself provided to the House of Representatives , were misappropriated a decade before that; but at least he is paying something . These tax cheats, these recipients of stolen money, as the Prime Minister has designated them, have not to pay the money back for 12 months. Some have not to pay it back at all. Even those who have to pay it back eventually will not have to pay interest between the time when they receive the assessment and the time by which they will have to complete repayments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has linked what the Government chooses to call tax cuts with the additional revenue that at one time it was claimed would be gained as a result of this recoupment legislation. The Prime Minister said that they were mirror images of each other, two sides of the same coin. On one side we had the recoupment legislation and on the other we had what he called tax cuts; the one was to finance the other. What now will finance these so-called tax cuts? More importantly, if the Government had not sat on its hands, or twiddled its thumbs for five years after it found out about this massive tax evasion, we could have had real tax cuts every year. The Prime Minister knew in 1977 that these schemes were in operation but it was not until 1982, after the publication of the Costigan and McCabe-Lafranchi reports, that he was stricken with an attack of retrospective morality-induced, obviously, not by any moral outrage, since he had known five years earlier what was going on, but by fear of electoral retribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The second most important taxation change contained in this package of Bills- although to some extent that is a matter of judgment-is that which provides a rebate of 30c in the dollar for interest payments above a 10 per cent rate on the first $60,000 of a housing loan when the subject house is the principal residence of the taxpayer. It had been the intention of the Opposition to seek to amend this provision in both Houses in order to restrict the benefit to taxpayers who owned only one house; also, to phase it out in respect of loans exceeding $60,000 until, at the $80,000 level it disappeared completely. There were technical problems in doing that and I do not propose to go into them at this stage. However, an expression of opinion that that should be done has been incorporated in a proposed second reading amendment which I shall read shortly. First, I will explain why we propose to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition does not believe, especially in a time of alleged economic stringency, as it certainly is for very many people, that tax subsidies should be made available to people with loans in respect of luxury houses totalling from $100,000 to $500,000 or, as in one specific case of which I am aware, $3m. Such people are already treated with undue favouritism by the tax laws. We do not believe an extra concession should be extended to them, nor do we believe that people who own multiple numbers of houses should be entitled to such a concession. I will cite one example of the way in which the legislation which the Government has introduced will operate. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) is having a luxury unit built alongside Telopea Park. If he declares it to be his principal residence, he will qualify for a tax rebate in respect of all interest payments in excess of 10 per cent on the first $60,000 of the loan. He may still keep the second house that he owns in Canberra, on which he has a 4 .75 per cent government loan which he granted to himself in 1964, 80 per cent of which he has still not repaid. I repeat, he has a 4.75 per cent government loan in respect of that house in Canberra. Provided he declares the proposed luxury unit in Canberra to be his principal residence he will receive a tax rebate on the first $60,000 of the loan therefor. I have no idea how many units or houses he might own elsewhere. That is the kind of thing this Bill permits. No wonder people who have lost their jobs because of this Government's mismanagement were yesterday battering the front doors of Parliament House. In contrast, the Deputy Prime Minister is treated in the way I have described. Despite this, the Prime Minister has the chutzpah to talk about governing fairly in the interests of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I will summarise quickly the other major measures which are contained in this package of Bills and the changes they will make. The tax rebate for a dependent spouse or daughter-housekeeper is to be increased by $200. There will be a rebate for pensioners to ensure that those who are overwhelmingly dependent on a pension but also have some outside income will not pay income tax. Those provisions are to take effect on 1 November as, indeed, I believe are all of the provisions before us. I have already mentioned the housing interest rebate. There is also to be a rebate on the first $1,000 of dividends received by shareholders in companies and an easing of the Division 7 tax rules to permit proprietary companies to retain 80 per cent of operating profit, not distributing it to shareholders, without incurring a tax penalty. Previously the limit was 70 per cent. Since it applies to income already earned, this is a retrospective benefit. Significantly, I have not noticed any protest from Senator Crichton-Browne or anyone else about a retrospective benefit being given , vocal though some honourable senators are about the alleged injustice of what they claim to be retrospective penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> But more important than the inconsistent standards of assorted Liberal Party politicians-something to which we have become accustomed-is the fact that the use of proprietary companies was a key factor in the sort of tax evasion and avoidance that was the subject of the McCabe-Lafranchi report. The greater the extent to which proprietary companies can keep their income within the company, the greater is the scope and the potential for tax avoidance and evasion in the future. It is no doubt true that there are some companies which operate quite legitimate businesses, socially useful businesses, and which find it difficult sometimes to carry on, or more often to expand, if they are required to disburse as dividends a high proportion of company income. However, there are other options. They are not pie in the sky options. They are options which are already operating, at least in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, under which the Commissioner of Taxation is given discretionary power to waive the tax penalty on undistributed profits which would otherwise apply if the company is facing genuine hardship or has a legitimate commercial reason-as distinct from a tax evading reason-for retaining a greater proportion of its profits within the company. That is what should be done here. </PARA>
<PARA> But what this Government has chosen to do at the same time as it claims to be cracking down on tax cheats-recipients of stolen funds, as the Prime Minister calls them-is to water down the legislation aimed against the tax cheats who have already been caught and to open up loopholes for the next generation of tax cheats to exploit in the future. Legitimate business could have been protected without that being done. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a provision in the Bills to extend the list of organisations to which donations are deductible from taxable income. The Opposition will seek to remove one of those organisations from the list. That will be the subject of a Committee stage amendment. The organisation is the Centre for Independent Studies. I will explain the reasons for that action when we come to the Committee stage. There is a change in the basis by which provisional tax is calculated, designed to pad the revenue for this year, and there are a few other minor or machinery matters. Since these are Budget measures the Opposition, in accordance with the broad declaration of policy made two months ago, will not oppose them. However I will move a second reading amendment which encompasses most of the objections to the legislation that I have already raised. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the home loan rebate is unduly generous to wealthy home-buyers and open to exploitation in that it provides benefits to persons owning more than one residence and is available on large loans in excess of $60,000;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the further increase in the retention allowance to 80 per cent will widen avenues for tax avoidance;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the introduction of a tax concession to shareholders through a rebate on the first $1,000 of dividend income is inequitable; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the Bill should provide mortgage assistance to those home purchasers not in receipt of taxable income such as the unemployed and pensioners'. </PARA>
<PARA>In summary, the most important component of the Bills is that which changes the rates at which personal income tax will be applied. That change is a de facto indexation of last year's rates. In other words, it will maintain the same real level of taxation as prevailed last year. Of course, it will be misrepresented by the Government as a tax cut. For that misrepresentation $1.5m of public money has already been filched through the Treasury estimates-at least the Government has attempted to filch it through the Treasury estimates-to be used in a political advertising campaign to mislead the public. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that those tax changes will not last if Malcolm Fraser remains Prime Minister. We know that he went through that exercise in 1977, of making changes before the election which reduced the amount of money which people paid in tax and then, after the election, increasing it over and above the rate which had prevailed previously. There is little doubt that he had that in mind in any case. The fact that the revenue will fall short by around $1 billion, due to a substantial extent to the Government's servile surrender to the tax cheats over its proposed recoupment legislation, guarantees that the tax cuts would be cancelled after an election if this Prime Minister were returned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget figures in general show that, despite all the talk about tax cuts, the estimates of total tax collections as a proportion of gross domestic product , as contained in the Budget Papers, showed an increase in that figure from 25.5 per cent to 25.7 per cent. Notwithstanding the fact that tax collections will fall well short of the estimates provided in the Budget-for, among other reasons , as I said, the backdown in the tax recoupment legislation-there will not be a commensurate fall in tax collections as a percentage of GDP because GDP will clearly be significantly lower than was forecast at the time the Budget was brought down. It will be lower for at least two reasons: Firstly, because the level of umemployment, on the Government's admission now, will be substantially higher than was forecast in the Budget Papers and, secondly, because the drought is substantially worse than would reasonably have been expected when the Budget Estimates were prepared. So, even though there will be an absolute decline in the tax actually collected compared with what the Government had forecast, the tax paid as a proportion of GDP will fall by less than that amount suggests because GDP growth will be negative. In other words, total GDP will fall this year, on present indications, by something between one per cent and 2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, this package was designed not with the intention of providing a taxation system which was equitable or which was efficient; it was designed to give the Prime Minister some chance-at least he thought it would give him some chance-to retain government in a premature election which, without any doubt, he had planned to call some time this year. Two months ago the Opposition gave the undertaking, based on the policy statement that 'this is Malcolm Fraser's Budget and he can live with the consequences of it', that it would not oppose Budget measures. We will not oppose them. But I trust that the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine will join us in expressing, by way of a second reading amendment, our disapproval of a number of specific inequities in this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak very briefly. I wish to acknowledge three worthwhile changes to our tax laws that will arise as a result of the Budget and the income tax Bills. These changes have been called for by me , and no doubt others, in the past. I think it is only fair that now they are being implemented the Government should receive the credit it deserves for the changes. Unfortunately, in these difficult times the Parliament and the media have been distracted from what has appeared in the Budget and these Bills. They are most worthwhile reforms for which the Government deserves credit. The first relates to the income tax relief which the legislation will implement. There is to be both an increase in the taxation threshold and a reduction in income tax rates. Specifically, the Bills provide an increase in the zero step from $4,195 to $4,595; an increase in the top of the standard rate step from $17,894 to $19, 500, and a reduction in the standard rate of tax from 32 per cent to 30 per cent .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a speech I made in the Senate on 23 February this year I argued at some length the desirability of changing the tax mix in Australia. I argued that there should be a reduction in income tax in favour of a corresponding increase in and broadening of the indirect tax base. I do not propose to canvass in detail the reasons I gave then. However, I did indicate that such a better tax mix would lessen tax avoidance, encourage incentive and, if well structured, could improve equity. The Government has, by these Bills, taken a small step towards achieving that better tax mix. I want to acknowledge that step because I am sure that it will lead to a better tax system for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I raise concerns the granting of rebates on dividends. The Bills provide a rebate at the standard rate of tax of up to $1,000 on dividends received by resident individual shareholders from resident companies. On 27 May this year I urged reform in this area, an area which has been commonly referred to as double taxation of dividends. It is regrettable that although that reform had been widely called for before the Budget, since the Budget there has not been the public recognition of the change which I think is due. Again, I do not want to canvass the reasons which I detailed on the occasion of my earlier speech, but I did point to the inequities of the previous double taxation of dividends-that is, the lack of neutrality and the disincentive to small shareholders to invest directly in the share markets and, therefore, in the nation's growth. I indicated that there would be no better time to introduce the reform than in what was then the forthcoming Budget. It is pleasing to me that the reform was contained in the Budget, albeit at this stage in a somewhat limited form. Nevertheless, it is a major reform and a major step in the right direction. I believe it is a reform which should be applauded. </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter I want to mention on this occasion is that on 4 May this year I spoke of the need for an accelerated depreciation allowance on plant and for the Government to consider for the first time allowing for depreciation of income producing buildings in order that Australian business might be in a position to compete on equal terms with its overseas competitors. These reforms were announced in a statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on 19 July 1982 as part of the Government's package of assistance to industry. The measures were described by the Australian Financial Review as a major reform. That is a reform which I wish to give recognition to on this occasion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a package of income tax Bills which give effect to the income tax changes which were included in the 1982-83 Budget. These tax changes are to operate from 1 November. Three of the Bills are of a purely machinery nature and I do not intend to discuss them in any detail. However, two of them are important and I want to make one or two points about them. As previous speakers have pointed out, it is very plain that the tax cuts that these Bills will introduce were intended as a juicy carrot for an early Federal election. We may still have an early election, although I am sure that such a cynical abuse of power would be treated by the Australian people with the contempt it deserves. We will have to wait and see. I believe there is little doubt in anybody's mind that the tax cuts were put in essentially as an incentive to the electorate in the event of an early election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In earlier debates on the Budget I indicated the Australian Democrats' attitude to the Budget in general and I pointed out that the Budget was essentially contractionary when adjusted for cyclical factors. It is true that tax cuts represent a step in the right direction, but I must point out that they have been skilfully adjusted to benefit the most politically sensitive area as far as the Government is concerned. The wealthy will benefit most from these measures. I am afraid that the poor will have no reason to be thankful to the Treasurer, Mr Howard. The Bills also allow the proposed Home Deposit Assistance Scheme to go ahead. This scheme has been debated at great length in this chamber and I do not propose to discuss it further. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I would like to highlight briefly one aspect of the Bills which I believe is significant. It was mentioned by Senator Hill just a moment ago. I refer to the significant gesture which the Government has made regarding the elimination of double taxation on dividends. The total elimination of double taxation on dividends is Democrats policy. It is outrageous that there has been double taxation for so long in this country. We would like to see it totally eliminated. We believe the double taxation on dividends is one of the principal reasons that there has been a marked lack of entrepreneurial capital available in this country. Essentially, companies are taxed twice; they are taxed on their profits and the profits are taxed again in the form of a tax on dividends in the hands of the individual. It could well be argued that there is a third tax in the sense that some companies have to sustain a tax on their undistributed profits. There is no doubt that this triple whammy on companies has been the reason that no major manufacturing companies have been established in this country in the last 10 years. Some manufacturing companies have been established as a result of overseas initiatives but there have been no indigenous manufacturing companies established here. Unlike the Australian Labor Party, we will be supporting this measure. We think that it is very much a step in the right direction. It has been Democrats policy ever since our formation. The fact that the large investor will benefit as well as the small investor is unfortunate. We would have liked to see some special incentive for the smaller investor, but this is the way the Government has dealt with the matter so we will let that be. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make some very brief comments on taxation generally. I point out that in Great Britain companies that have earnings of less than #100,000 get a significant tax rebate. Only by a measure such as this, or some other similar incentive to small business, can we expect this vital sector of the economy to be stimulated. We believe that the innovative and labour-creating initiatives in the economy are to be found within small business and much more attention should be given to it. I also give notice that we will not be supporting the Australian Labor Party's amendments for the deletion of the special tax grant deductibility for the Centre for Independent Studies.

This package of tax Bills is basic and fundamental to the Government's economic strategy. We welcome two aspects of this legislation: The reduction in taxation is a step in the right direction and the elimination of double taxation on dividends has been Democrats policy since our foundation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for the speedy passage of the Income Tax Bills. As has been said, they are Budget measures providing benefits, adjustments to rates and the range of things that was announced in the Budget and about which we have been talking for the last couple of months. I have noted the Opposition's amendment moved to the second reading and state that the Government does not accept it. Part (a) of the amendment refers to the home loan rebate. The Opposition's criticism is that it is unduly generous to wealthy home buyers as it gives a rebate to persons with more than one home and on the first $60,000 to persons with a loan of over $60,000. I respond on behalf of the Government by saying that both the existing scheme-the first five years of owner occupation-and the new scheme apply to the sole or principal residence of a taxpayer situated in Australia, notwithstanding that the taxpayer may own other houses. That it applies to the sole or principal residence is not something that has been introduced in this new scheme. That is the same as the existing provision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other point made by the Opposition was that mortgages could be shifted from other houses to the sole or principal residence and that mortgages could be arranged to be on the sole or principal residence instead of on other houses owned by the taxpayer. I respond to that by saying that a qualifying loan has to be applied to the construction, extension or acquisition of the sole or principal residence, and that is a matter of fact to be determined in each case. It will not be, as indicated by the Opposition in its amendment, a matter of choice for the taxpayer to exert. The loan cannot be switched from another property to the dwelling in question, nor can a new loan using an already owned home as security qualify for the rebate unless the loan is for the purpose of extending the home. The suggested opportunity for exploitation does not exist and, as I have said, the Government does not accept the amendment to the second reading moved by Senator Walsh. I have a Government amendment, and I understand there is an Opposition amendment, to be moved in Committee. At this stage I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>The amendment was foreshadowed by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) in his second reading speech on the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1982 [No. 2]. As explained at that time, the amendment will effect a change to the provision of the Bill which proposes to provide income tax deductions for gifts to a public fund established and maintained exclusively for the relief of the civilian victims of the conflict in Lebanon. By the amendment the circumstances giving rise to the deductions will be described in a more general way so as to remove any unintended impression of views of a judgmental kind in relation to the sufferings of the people in Lebanon to whose relief the tax deductible gifts are to be channelled. The amendment will not alter the scope of the measure as introduced in the Bill. I commend the amendment as circulated to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment appears to be fairly meaningless because it refers to various identifying marks in the Bill. Perhaps it would be better if I were to explain in simple English what the amendment means. The amendment proposes to remove the Centre for Independent Studies from the list of organisations to which contributions are tax deductible. The reason why the Opposition has decided to move this amendment is that it is firmly of the view-I think any fair minded person who examined the literature put out by this organisation would agree-that the Centre for Independent Studies is a very political organisation, not just in the discussion of politics in an academic sense but political in a very partisan way. We do not believe that it is appropriate that donations to an overtly and very partisan political organisation should be tax deductible. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not saying that the Centre is aligned to the Liberal Party per se although its views are in harmony with the right wing of the Liberal Party. It is certainly a partisan political organisation. We believe that, if the Income Tax Assessment Act were opened up in this way, it would set an unfortunate precedent which could be extended to cover a whole host of very partisan and also very extreme political organisations. We do not believe that is an appropiate use of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not accept the Opposition's amendment. The decision to admit the Centre for Independent Studies followed representations to the Government by the Centre and a number of members of Parliament. In taking its decision, the Government determined that the objectives of the Centre were worthy of support. The following are pertinent extracts from the Centre's objects clause:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> (e) the Centre shall be non-political, non-sectarian and non-racial and shall not take any step or make any decisions whereby it shall in any manner whatsoever align itself with any political party religious philosophical or other group. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose that there are differing views with regard to certain representations that are made for tax deductibility and assistance. But, in general terms, other economic research bodies attached to universities, for instance, could qualify for deduction by virtue of the eligibility of gifts to universities generally in Australia. It was decided that the representations that were made on behalf of the Centre would be accepted by the Government. For those reasons, we do not accept the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think what we are doing tonight is in fact establishing a precedent which the Government will regret. I have taken the opportunity of obtaining information about the Centre for Independent Studies from the Parliamentary Library. I would like to regale the Senate with some of its publications. The first publication that is referred to in the Centre for Independent Studies journal for June 1982, is a book entitled Wage-Price Control : Myth &amp; Reality. It was edited by Mr Shenoy. The list of contributors includes a number of very interesting and important people. It also includes people with very fixed ideas-people who could not be regarded as giving a balance to this particular reading. Under the heading 'Policy Monographs' at another page of that journal, it is stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 4. Free to Shop by Geoffrey Hogbin introduces economic analysis into the ongoing debate about shopping hours. The cost to consumers and to retailers of having to use and provide services in limited time periods-especially given changing work patterns-are seen as not efficient, nor do they provide for the legitimate requirements of the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA>Even the description, short though it is, of that monograph does not put into the scales of that question the rights and responsibilities of employees in the retail industry. Yet here we are, as a parliament, opening up a Pandora's box to provide taxpayers' money to an organisation such as this which, as appears from the material that I have before me-at least the matters I have referred to-has a very narrow and limited view of the economy and the methods of running the economy. I would not mind if this organisation were able to open its mind to a broader view of economic problems and the solutions thereto. We are doing this on the run but, for example, I would not have been opposed to a genuine independent body receiving some encouragement from the taxpayer if the studies were genuinely undertaken. That is no reflection on some of the people who are named as either sponsors or advisers to this body. I notice that a number of those advisers are well respected and very fine Australian citizens. But I would suggest that the policy monograph in the case of the publication Free to Shop ignores completely the problems associated with those who are employed in the retail industry and really argues only from the basis of costs in respect of the efficient use of material and plant. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Senate would give me a couple of minutes, I would be inclined to read some of this material into Hansard. A point about Mr Friedman caught my eye. Referring to another publication, the CIS document states:</PARA>
<PARA> Taxation, Inflation and the Role of Government by Milton Friedman, with comments by Michael Porter, Fred Gruen and Don Stammer, is the paper and commentary from the Centre's second Occasional Seminar. Friedman discusses the role of government in some of the important policy issues of today and also examines the impact of the changing pattern of ideas. </PARA>
<PARA>That is very good, but why should the taxpayers' money be provided for a one- eyed and single-minded approach to the economy? I hope that the Australian Democrats will give consideration to this matter. I hope that the Australian Labor Party will also divide on this issue. I have not been convinced, by anything that the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) has said in either her second reading speech or in the Committee stage of the Bill, to support this proposal. Nothing whatsoever has been advanced which would indicate that this organisation intends genuinely and independently to pursue a thorough-going examination of all aspects of the economy and to give due regard and weight in particular to the employees who are most affected by some of the economic ideas and theories that are advanced in its monographs. </PARA>
<PARA> The other reason that I would oppose the extension of the tax rebate to this organisation has nothing to do with the organisation but it has a lot to do with the fact that a number of requests have been made to the Government from organisations which have far greater claims to assistance from taxpayers than does this organisation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee is debating an Opposition amendment to withdraw from clause 5 of the Bill the provision for the Centre for Independent Studies to be a tax deductible organisation. Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner, as would have been obvious to everyone, I was rather stalling for time. In the interim, I have attempted to obtain as much information as I could from the resources in this Parliament about the origins of the Centre for Independent Studies, about the quality of its work and about the availability of its work. A number of very reputable economists and persons of scientific excellence are on the advisory council of the Centre for Independent Studies. I note also that the list of trustees of the organisation, as at 1980, in a publication 'Centre for Independent Studies', mentions as trustees-some honourable senators may know these gentlemen-in Western Australia, Mr Agnew; in South Australia, Mr Bonython; in the United States of America and the United Kingdom, Mr Fisher; in Victoria, Mr Hugh Morgan; and in New South Wales, Mr Maurice Newman and Sir William Pettingell. They are all well-known figures in Australian business or academia. But that is not the point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point is that, if I were any of those gentlemen, I would be concerned about the inclusion of their organisation in this Bill for the purpose of tax deductibility because, as was said prior to the dinner break, it will open up a Pandora's box. As Senator Walsh said, what is to stop a future Labor government from including, for example, the Fabian Society as an organisation which would attract tax deductibility? Let me refer briefly again to the Centre's publication of 1980. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Economists and other social scientists who work for the Centre are encouraged to follow their analysis to its conclusions even if regarded as 'unpopular', ' politically unacceptable', or 'administratively impractical'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an excellent academic approach. The authors are asked, in the words of the document, to act as analysts of scientific truth. I shall not delay the Senate-I do not have the time-with an examination of what is scientific truth, but it appears, from the context in which that is stated, that the Centre appears to clothe scientific truth with some sort of metaphysical character. I give an example. I come back to the publication Free to Shop. According to the Centre:</PARA>
<PARA> The cost to consumers and to retailers of having to use and provide services in limited time periods, especially given changing work patterns, are seen as not efficient, nor do they provide for the legitimate requirements of the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that an analysis of scientific truth? What about the effect that it has, the cost to shop assistants in providing services outside those limited time periods ? What about that equation? In that particular study, did the author canvass the inquiries that had been held in Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria, all of which came to the conclusion that there was a need for some intervention at that particular time? Leaving that example aside, I return to the Centre's 1980 publication. Let us see what it says about itself. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Since its establishment, the CIS has avoided government funds and sought support wholly from sales of its publications, revenue from activities such as conferences and from voluntary contributions from individuals and companies. In this way it can retain maximum freedom to examine matters which governments neglect or which might be sought in conflict with the prevailing preconceptions of politicians and government departments. For a free society, where economic activity is nevertheless significantly controlled or influenced by the bureaucracy, independence of this kind is all the more important. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the exclusion of the Centre for Independent Studies and take up where Senator Harradine stopped because of lack of time. He was reading from the 1980 report of the Centre for Independent Studies and showing that in its publication the organisation sought to indicate its independence. The reality is, of course, that the organisation refers to the fact that it seeks voluntary contributions from individuals and companies. It then indicates that it is not going to be dominated by politicians and government departments. Senator Harradine did not have the opportunity of going further into the document produced by this organisation where it makes a strong point. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Centre's independence thus rests on:</PARA>
<PARA> Its freedom from government subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA> Its widespread sources of private financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Sales of its publications . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Its freedom from government subsidy is the point that I think should be made. This organisation, which is one of the most extreme political organisations in terms of the material it has produced, is now coming to this dreaded Government that it has so often criticised to seek subsidisation in this way. For this reason I support the proposal that it should not be given this subsidy because the logical extension of this is that every political attitude in this country should receive tax exemption. The Fabian Society has been mentioned. The whole thing is ludicrous. Because this organisation has an extremist political philosophy it is supported by the Fraser Government. In this circumstance we find that this Government is trying to whip into this clause with the Boy Scouts and the Girl Guides an organisation which is the architect of the most extreme conservative philosophy in this country. For those reasons I believe we are correct in leaving this clause for Amnesty International and other reputable bodies to receive assistance and rejecting the Centre for Independent Studies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I think it would be very worthy to give donations to both. Deductibility could be claimed and it would show an interest in both the young girls and the young boys. Earlier I read a couple of the objects clauses of the Centre for Independent Studies. I do not know whether Senator Macklin was here at that time. The ones I have noted particularly state that it is a centre to:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . undertake and prosecute scientific research and enquiry into the fundamentals and theory of a free society including not thereby limiting its application, the philosophical, historical, economic, legal and social aspects of such society with particular relevance to the Commonwealth of Australia the Centre shall be non-political, non sectarian, non-racial and shall not take any step or make any decisions whereby it shall in any manner whatsoever align itself with any political party, religious, philosophical or other group. </PARA>
<PARA>Those of us who have sought tax deductibility for a variety of organisations in this country would know that from time to time many organisations of different kinds and with different interests have been granted tax deductibility for donations to them. This is one that the Government has decided should be included in the list. The organisations range from those we have stated, such as the Girl Guides and the Boy Scouts, youth organisations to conservation organisations. A whole range of philanthropic and community-minded organisations are included in this section dealing with tax deductibility. I can suggest only that if people have other organisations which they wish to seek tax deductibility for they make representations in the way that most people understand that this can be done. When I have had anything to do with it it has sometimes taken some time for them to be included. The list is added to from time to time. On this occasion this particular organisation has been included. The Government does not accept the amendment from the Opposition. I understand that the Opposition does not seek to divide on this clause, however, we are in the hands of the chamber on that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to intervene for the moment on this important clause because I do not think the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) has really touched on the chief objection of Senator Walsh and, in particular, Senator Harradine. I do not think anyone here believes that the Centre for Independent Studies represents other than an extreme, conservative political viewpoint in this community. I do not hear anyone getting up to argue to the contrary. Senator Siddons said that he supported this clause because he agreed with Voltaire. Although he may disagree with the organisation' s views he will defend to the death its right to express them. I share that view . But what is in fact happening here, as Senator Childs said, is that we are providing a subsidy for this organisation from the taxpayers by way of revenue forgone, which is just as much a subsidy as if we paid out a subsidy directly to it from Consolidated Revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle read to us the aims of this organisation which seem to justify, in her view and in the Government's view, the provision of tax deductibility to this organisation. The chief point in those aims seems to me to be that the organisation claims first of all to be independent from any individual political party, and secondly that it has a philosophy which is concerned with the scientific investigation of our society within the bounds of maintaining what it calls a free society. Indeed that is exactly the sort of thing one hears repeatedly from Mr Jeremy Lee and company from the Australian League of Rights. It claims that it is conducting a scientific analysis of our society within the concept of a free society, as that organisation sees it. I suggest that it is the sort of thing one hears from Marxist organisations, which are continually saying that they are conducting scientific analysis of what goes on in society. If the term 'independence' in the organisation's terms of reference or aims is the important thing I suggest that every Sunday night on my local television I hear what is an independent news commentary by one B. A. Santamaria. Therefore I ask whether in fact we are going to provide tax deductibility for the National Civic Council? Again, are we going to do it for the Fabian Society or any other such organisations?</PARA>
<PARA> I believe the most serious thing is that if organisations such as these carefully word the terms of their aims and constitutions to state that they are indulging in scientific inquiry and that they are non-party political, they will get away with it. As Senator Harradine said we have set a precedent whereby any future government in fact can provide tax deductibility to organisations such as the Fabian Society and the National Civic Council. Also Senator Sibraa mentioned the organisation that keeps an eye on the trans-nationals and everybody else. I think this is a serious thing. In fact, it is a precedent. How in fact is any government in the future, whether it is Labor, Liberal or anything else, to refuse any organisation which comes along with a nice set of aims and constitution and which claims it has no affiliation-</PARA>

For any organisation such as this it is a subsidy for revenue forgone. Those of us who may have some association with the Fabian Society or the National Civic Council will be very hard put to refuse such a subsidy in the future.

Surely that is knowledge that any group within the community is entitled to if in fact we are to broaden the criteria. Certainly I would agree with Senator Harradine and Senator Grimes that the criteria are broadened to include groups dealing with quasi-political matters. Nobody has yet denied that the Centre is indeed looking at that particular issue. I am quite happy for it to have a different viewpoint as I am for the Fabian Society to have a different viewpoint.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make it perfectly clear that I wish to dissociate myself from any remarks made by any honourable senator concerning the work of the Centre for Independent Studies. Some of the publications of the CIS are very highly reputable works and have assisted not only members of the parliament but also bureaucrats and economists in an understanding of various subjects. For example, whether honourable senators like it or not, the examination of the airline policy is a case in point. Very good work has been done by the Centre; there is no doubt about that. The work is of a generally high quality except, of course, the work I mentioned before which related to the publication Free to Shop. I have not had the opportunity of reading that work. I have had the opportunity only of looking at the summary of the work in the document before us. I made my observations having regard to that summary. I have attempted to get the work from the National Library of Australia and the Parliamentary Library but neither has it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will not keep the Senate long but I make it very clear that I support the work of the CIS as an organisation which has advisers who are reputable academics and which seeks from academics and economists research papers on various issues. As such that can only advance our knowledge of those subjects. The Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) is playing with words in saying that that organisation eschews philosophical groups. I will quote from a paper which was printed in the Institute of Public Affairs Review Journal of April-June 1979. The article was entitled 'Rekindling the Flame: the Revival of Liberalism' and written by Greg Lindsay. Greg Lindsay was the first full time director of the Centre for Independent Studies. In a preparatory comment to his statement on the foundation of CIS he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Some of the positive signs of a growing awareness of Liberal values can be traced to a number of sources. Perhaps the first great boost came with the visit here in 1975 by Milton Friedman. </PARA>
<PARA> The influence of monetarist economics has been growing for a number of years and Friedman's visit focussed attention on the monetarist sources of inflation in a way that had not been possible previously. Inflation after Friedman became a matter of open public concern and ever since governments have seen the dangers that lie within it and have attempted its control, though with varying degrees of success. </PARA>
<PARA>Time and again the philosophical approach of the current Government in respect of the economic ills of this country has meant an over-concentration on controlling inflation. Of course, to that extent we have a blow-out of the unemployment rate. I should certainly like to see the Centre for Independent Studies focus its total attention for a period on how to overcome the unemployment problem in this country. The article in the IPA Review, written by the first full time director of the CIS, continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The following year saw the founding of the Centre for Independent Studies. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued with the names of those in the organisation and then stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Late in 1976 Australia was visited by Professor Hayek. </PARA>
<PARA> This visit helped to complete the germination of thinking begun when Friedman had been here the year before. </PARA>
<PARA>Compare that with what the 1980 progress report of the Centre for Independent Studies says. I ask honourable senators: Has the Centre a philosophical basis which transcends the sort of economic basis which is claimed? The Centre's report says:</PARA>
<PARA> The CIS, established as a private institute outside the traditional mainstream of research and inquiry, intends to redirect attention to free enterprise, the market economy, and private property as solutions to many of our present day problems, not-as much as current literature would have us believe-the sources. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The CIS thus intends to focus attention on the role of microeconomics-the study of individuals as buyers and sellers, lenders and borrowers, employers and employees, etc.-and the role of personal liberty in an economy free of people. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been largely obscured over several generations by the influence of the Keynesians and the doctrines of the Fabian socialists. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose one could agree with that, but one does not have then to hold on to the coat tails of Milton Friedman and Professor Hayek to get the solutions. All I am saying to the Government is that it is a worthwhile development for Australia to have seen the establishment of the Centre for Independent Studies. There is no doubt that this is a very worthwhile development because the Centre has an attitude which transcends pure economics. </PARA>
<PARA> In summing up, let me give two simple reasons why I believe that the Senate should not go along with the Government and provide the Centre with taxpayers' money in effect for its operation and also why this arrangement is not in the interests of the body itself. The first reason is that such provision would open a Pandora's box. As has been asked in debate, once we open that door, how do we stop other organisations coming in for their chip of the taxpayers' dollar? Let me make it very clear that we are giving taxpayers' money to organisations listed in section 78 of the Act. Does the Centre for Independent Studies really want taxpayers' money, having regard to what it said in its publications, namely , that the basis for its freedom of thought and ability fearlessly to present before the people of Australia the economic solutions as it sees them depends on its freedom from government support. I suggest that there would be very few, if any, of the distinguished advisers to the Centre who, on reflection, would agree to the acceptance of taxpayers' money under those circumstances. </PARA>

On this occasion, it is simply Mr Cliff Walsh who happened to be closely associated both with the Centre for Independent Studies and with the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish only to make a few brief remarks. Again, I wish to answer the question that was put by Senator Macklin. The honourable senator asked: What criteria are used for the Centre for Independent Studies to get tax deductibility? I would say that the criterion is to be a friend of this Government. We in the Australian Labor Party know how difficult it is to get this sort of tax deductibility. I say that because I remember that, when the Menzies Foundation was started, it was immediately announced that there would be a government grant and tax deductibility would be allowed. When the Labor Party set up the Evatt Foundation, we had to put a great deal of pressure on this Government to try to get tax deductibility for donations to that organisation. I might point out that we did not get a grant, as did the Menzies Foundation. Tax deductibility was granted in respect of the Evatt Foundation possibly only because of the intervention of Sir Richard Kirby who criticised the Government and embarrassed the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and also because of the criticism that the Labor Party was able to bring up about the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not believe that the Centre for Independent Studies is a prestigious organisation as is, for example, the Brookings Institute in the United States of America. Even though it is trying to assume that sort of prestige, I believe it is a front organisation. The Government has created a precedent in this legislation. It is a precedent at which I am sure a future Labor government will look. I would hope that a future Labor government would fund foundations which engage in research into the history of political parties as happens in West Germany where the Friedrich Ebert Foundation which assists the Social Democrats is funded privately and by government. I would hope that the major political parties and perhaps even the Australian Democrats would qualify for some sort of political funding from a Labor government. But we would certainly be looking at a number of organisations. We would be looking, for example, at organisations such as the Fabian Society and the Foundation for Labour Studies. I can assure the Government that if it has opened the door for the Centre for Independent Studies we will make sure that we keep it open in the future for some of our own . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few remarks on the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1982 (No. 2). I think it is worth while commenting on some of the aspects of the legislation which relate to social security. As we know, the legislation in fact lowers the rate of tax and increases various rebates for spouses and sole parents, introduces a new pensioner rebate and standardises the tax treatment of the new rehabilitation allowance. These are all matters of vital interest in the social security area. The legislation also introduces some rather generous provisions quite unrelated to social security. For instance, it allows a rebate on tax of up to $1,000 on certain dividends. It provides a new and virtually open-ended rebate for home buyers and liberalises the dividend distribution requirements of private companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I just wish briefly to contrast the generosity of these latter measures with the tax treatment of the disadvantaged of our community. As Senator Walsh has said, we support the reduction in the standard rate of tax and the increases in the other dependent rebates because the income tax burden has become an increasingly oppressive one during the term of this Government. This has arisen in large part, I might suggest, from its toleration of large scale tax avoidance . This relief is long overdue. We also support the principle that increases in the spouse rebate, for instance, should be limited to those with dependent children. About half of that rebate at present benefits couples who have no children and there seems to be little case for extending the benefit in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> Also we support the new pensioner rebate, but it is important to recognise that the need for the rebate results from the Government's failure to index the income tax threshold for inflation during a period when pensions have been indexed. Under the income tax rate structure that was introduced in 1975, a single pensioner would have paid no tax so long as his private income did not exceed $540 per annum. Expressed in 1982-83 dollars, that is about $21 a week. The level of the effective tax threshold became even higher under the 1976-77 tax structure but because the threshold, along with other components of the rate structure, has been only partially indexed, if at all, over the years it has fallen steeply in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation reached the point at which a single pensioner, even with no other income, could have become liable in 1982-83 to the payment of some tax. Labor's spokesmen on Treasury matters, Ralph Willis, and I, with others, warned of this danger and finally the Government acted. But pensioners should not be deceived. The combination of the general threshold rise and the new pensioner rebate will not even restore them to the real position they enjoyed in 1975-76. The effective tax threshold for a single pensioner will still be only $19 a week in 1982-83. The special pensioner rebate will be taken away on incomes above that level, so a considerable net disadvantage will remain. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe another factor that should be noted is that the taper on the rebate, 12 1/2 cents in the dollar, will further accentuate disincentives to earn much more than the pension-free income level. I know that the full year effect of the new provisions will not take place until 1983-84 and the figures that I have quoted for 1982-83 include only the seven months effect from November 1982, but pensions will also rise in 1983-84 and it it hard to perceive that, in real terms, pensioners will be any better off. The Government likes to talk about giving full benefits while actually giving only a small part of them. That con trick is frequently employed by it. The figures presented in the Budget incorporated that deception. Even though the net gains to pensioners are problematic, they are at least something more than nothing, which is what sickness and unemployment beneficiaries will get from this Bill. Their group is presently in greatest jeopardy as a result of this Government's callous attitude towards the victims of its own economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional benefits in respect of children and supplementary rent allowances are, unlike the similar payments to pensioners, taxable in the hands of recipients. Thus, the more children one has, the less extra income one may receive on top of one's social security benefits before tax becomes payable. In the case of a married couple with two children, the benefit payment alone suffices to take income above the tax threshold. That is a matter that the Government and the Treasury should review. Even if such people receive throughout the year no income other than their benefit, their income in 1982-83 will be about $105 above the tax threshold and therefore they will be liable to the payment of $32 in income tax. If they have three children their tax bill will be about $192 and, in larger families, an extra $160 will be owing for each additional child. In the case of a sickness beneficiary who receives a rental allowance, an additional $150 will be owed. These are no mean sums for people who have been subsisting over the course of the year at a sub-poverty income level. Few actually would have the wherewithal to find the amounts owing. I suggest that their liability for tax represents a gross aberration which can and should be rectified. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of other anomalies should be noted. A single sickness beneficiary who receives a rental allowance for the whole of 1982-83 will find that taxation of about $20 will be payable. The situation will worsen in 1983-84. Of course, payments for the single unemployed are so much lower because of an inability to obtain this allowance, that under the circumstances the particular problem to which I have referred does not arise. Another anomaly arises from the different treatment accorded to de facto marital relationships by the social security and taxation systems, a matter that was raised by Senator Martin earlier. The Department of Social Security will pay a higher benefit when there is a de facto spouse who has no income of her own. However, the taxation system will not allow any rebate in such cases. The only solution for claimants is to file separately at the single rate, but that is often less than half the married rate. The situation represents an absurd imposition at a time of record high unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that all honourable senators have had brought to their attention distressing cases in which a de facto couple which have received unemployment benefit throughout the year have been sent at the end of it tax bills of up to $ 400, which they cannot pay. We really should look at what can be done to remedy these injustices. I suggest that three measures are needed to remedy the immediate problems. Firstly, the additional benefit for the children of this group should be made non-taxable. That would be consistent with the proposed tax treatment of the family income supplement and the existing treatment of payments for pensioners' children. It would remove the tax liability of married beneficiaries with children. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the rental allowance also, consistent with the treatment of supplementary assistance for pensioners, should be made non-taxable. If that raises problems of equity vis-a-vis the position of those on low wages, surely the solution is to extend some form of rental assistance to them also, not punish beneficiaries as happens now. Finally, benefits for both married and de facto couples should be equally split between partners in the same manner as for pensioners. If that were done the benefit for each partner would be below the tax threshold and no problems would arise. Alternatively the tax system should be changed so as to recognise de facto marital relationships. </PARA>

All I have done, much to Senator Chipp's annoyance, is to plead for equity in the treatment of unemployment beneficiaries and sickness beneficiaries in this community who, along with single parent pensioners and some low income earners, are the poorest people in the community and are becoming more and more poor as the present Government's economic policies continue and as our economic situation gets worse. At a later time I will advocate this on second readings and in the Committee stage of Bills, despite the harassment of those who apparently think they have more important subjects.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982 is important legislation. In essence it consists of two broad parts. The first part of the Bill is composed of legislation introduced to carry out measures that the Government announced in this area in the Budget-namely, the legislation extends the eligibility for health benefits to sickness beneficiaries; it extends pensioner health benefits to those on the new rehabilitation allowance; it extends the health care card for 12 months to those on invalid pensions and rehabilitation allowance recipients who are starting employment; it ensures that the new mobility allowance and the family income supplement are not counted as income for determining entitlement to the health care card, and it also introduces a new three-tiered pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The second broad part of the legislation represents a direct attack on the Victorian Government in that it seeks to disallow the Victorian Government's outpatients levy. We do not argue against the Budget proposals except on their inadequacy. We consider that the pharmaceutical benefits charges are excessive and unnecessarily complicated, but we believe the opposition to the Victorian out-patient levy is the result of ideological bloody-mindedness of the worst type.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall deal with the pharmaceutical scheme first. Under the present system there is a charge of $3.20 per item for pharmaceuticals. For pensioner health benefits card holders there is no fee. We are to have a new fee of $2 for disadvantaged persons. The unemployed and social security pensioners who do not have the pensioner health benefits card will also receive this benefit. The legislation also provides for an increase of 80c, or 25 per cent, for all others , bringing the charge for other items on the list up to $4 each. As I have said, we now have a three-tiered system. I suggest that this system is administratively complex. It is discriminatory in that people with similar degrees of economic or social disadvantage are treated differently and unfairly. The unemployed are discriminated against as compared with other disadvantaged groups, adding to the discrimination present in all other legislation which deals with them. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase of 25 per cent to $4 per item generally means that ordinary citizens, but in particular sick citizens, in this community will have experienced an increase of 170 per cent in the cost of pharmaceuticals since 1975, compared with the consumer price index increase of about 100 per cent in the same time. They will now have to pay 70 per cent of the average cost of prescriptions compared with 40 per cent in 1975. This means that those with chronically, or recurrently ill children-asthmatics, those who have repeated respiratory infections, those who suffer from epilepsy, et cetera-will have to bear more than their fair share of the burden of health costs. Those adults who have chronic or recurrent illnesses are in a similar position. They will have to pay more than their fair share of health costs. The Government-in particular the Minister for Health, Mr Carlton-calls this the user pays principle. The users are the sick, particularly the chronically sick and those who have illnesses with recurrent episodes. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of the Victorian Government levy is very serious. It has nothing to do with the Budget. It was not announced at Budget time and is quite divorced from the Budget. It is being tacked on to this legislation in an attempt to get it through in association with the beneficial parts of the legislation. In July this year the Victorian Government, in an eminently sensible move, described so by all the media in Victoria, decided that a better way of collecting money for out-patient services-rather than by going through the administratively costly and inefficient method of individuals having to go to their health funds and organise payments back to the hospitals-was to introduce a levy computed on a membership basis, using Federal Government figures, to do away with this complicated method of collection, enabling hospitals to provide out-patient services free of charge at the point of service. We are talking about more than 2 million out-patient services costing about $2m to collect. The method proposed is simple, cost-efficient and overcomes many of the problems caused by delays and accounts. It will release bill collecting staff and the costs of collection so that they can be used for the provision of health services, which is what hospitals and health services are about. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the justification given by the Government for its action? What sort of arguments have we heard for this extraordinary action by the present Government? The first argument used by the Minister for Health is that the action of the Victorian Government goes against the user pays principle. That is nonsense. The problem is that the Government, and in particular the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-this is shown by his repeated speeches-has a pathological hatred for, and a pathological and ideological difference with, the Cain Labor Government in Victoria, and this has become an obsession with the Government. The Minister takes action against the Victorian Government because it allegedly cuts across his concept of user pays but he takes no action at all against the Queensland Government which does exactly the same thing in its free hospital policy. The only difference is the political complexion of the two governments. No greater example of political bias or hypocrisy can exist. Apparently the Government, like so many of my colleagues, believes that medicine should be practiced as much as possible on what is called the gypsy principle-each service should be accompanied by crossing the palm of the giver with silver. I suggest that this a medieval concept which is insulting to both the doctors and the patients involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The second argument used by the Minister-it is the worst and only other argument-is that the levy introduced by the Victorian Government is too high and the cost to the insured will be too high. In fact, as has been pointed out by the Minister of Health in Victoria, by my colleague in another place, Dr Blewett , by the Age newspaper and by everyone who has taken an interest in this matter, the levy is calculated on the Commonwealth Government's own figures and on what the Commonwealth says Victoria should raise from insured out-patient services. Surely the Commonwealth, through the Minister, cannot complain if the figures are based on its own calculations. I can understand the funds complaining because they benefit from the inefficiencies of the present system. They benefit from the fact that some people do not go and claim, they benefit because of the inevitable delay in many people claiming and they benefit because there is an inevitable delay in their paying the State hospitals in these circumstances. With inflation and the interest rates they can get on their funds, they are at an advantage. But I suggest that the Commonwealth cannot complain, because it set the levels. The Commonwealth imposed the levels on the States, and the Victorian Government just used those levels. It may be some of those funds, which are quite unscrupulous in their practices, have convinced or forced the Government to take this step, but I cannot help believing, on hearing the arguments of the Minister and the Government, that the step is ideologically and politically motivated. Therefore the Australian Labor Party will oppose these two provisions in the Bill. They are not part of the Budget legislation; they should not be in this legislation. They are quite separate from the rest of the functions of the legislation and have nothing to do with the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Undoubtedly the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) will express the view that if we amend this legislation it will have to go back to the House of Representatives and so the sickness beneficiaries who are to receive the pensioner health benefit card may have that benefit delayed until after 1 November. I point out to the Minister that the House of Representatives sits tomorrow and there is no reason at all why this legislation cannot go back there tomorrow and then come back here as separate legislation, if we are allowed to divide it, or as an amended piece of legislation. If there is any delay in the provision of these pensioner health benefit cards, the delay in fact will be caused by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to sections of the legislation which concern sickness benefits. Clauses 4 and 14 of the legislation remove the income test provisions relating to sickness benefits so that sickness beneficiaries will receive pensioner fringe benefits. Insofar as it is one step along the way to removing discrimination against pensioners and beneficiaries we certainly welcome this provision. However, I point out to the Government that it is coming into effect at a time when the administration of sickness benefits in this country is in chaos. I was gratified by the statement of the Minister for Social Security ( Senator Chaney) this afternoon that he is now taking the sickness benefit problem to the Government. I hope this means that the amending legislation necessary as a result of recent actions will be introduced quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is necessary to explain to the Senate the present situation of the sickness benefit instructions, and remind the Senate that this situation will continue until further new legislation gives back to ill and injured people their rights to sickness benefits, because without these rights they will not be able to receive the benefits of this legislation. Most of the shambles centering round the payment of sickness benefits results from an opinion given apparently to the Director-General of Social Security by the Attorney-General's Department last April or May which eliminated from entitlement to sickness benefits a large number of people who had been eligible since unemployment and sickness benefits were first introduced in this country in 1945. The result of this will be to cut down the amount of money paid to some other sickness beneficiaries and prevent many people who would otherwise be on sickness benefits from receiving the advantages of the provisions of this legislation and obtaining the pensioner health benefit card. </PARA>
<PARA> The opinion I referred to, allegedly from the Attorney-General's Department, purports to give a definition of loss of income which is at variance with the interpretation of this legislation since its inception in 1945. As the Minister for Social Security has not chosen to make this opinion available, I am not in a position, nor is anybody else in this place, to make a judgment as to whether that interpretation is valid. The Minister has known since the middle of the year, since July, that this legal opinion changed a policy the Department has administered consistently for 37 years. He claims it is not a change in policy but a response to what the law means. As far as I am concerned, and I am sure as far as any other honourable senator is concerned, if people have been entitled to a Commonwealth benefit for 37 years and the Minister is presiding over a department which no longer gives them that benefit, without any change in the legislation but because of some change in interpretation of the legislation, this can be considered only as a change in policy. I cannot understand how a legal opinion given in this way can suddenly drastically change the administration of a policy as it affects thousands of people. </PARA>
<PARA> I give some examples of confusion and the obvious injustice which exists in this situation. Under the new interpretation, self-employed persons whose businesses are going through a bad patch-there are increasing numbers-will not be paid sickness benefits if they sustain injury or illness. I have been given the history of two such people, one with a heart condition and one with injuries to his hands. Neither is fit for work and so they cannot be paid the unemployment benefit. One is getting $67 a week for three people-himself, a wife and a child-and the other is being paid nothing. So two people who would ordinarily have been paid sickness benefits are being kicked out of the way because of this new interpretation. I think one can only advise all self- employed people, farmers and so on, not to get sick because, even if they have no other benefit, they will not be paid sickness benefit. All unemployed persons who have not registered for unemployment benefits should do so immediately because, if they are in a car accident or if they fall ill, they will not be paid sickness benefit unless they are already in receipt of the unemployment benefit. If they are unwilling to take the unemployment benefit until their savings run out, they should forget their scruples because they will be paid sickness benefit only if they already are in receipt of unemployment benefit. They will not be paid if they have been on a pension because invalid pensions, for instance, unlike the unemployment benefit, have now been deemed not to be income. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Department of Social Security, pensioners do not lose their income when they are taken off a widow's pension or if someone decides that they are no longer eligible for an invalid pension. They might lose money, cheques or whatever pays the bills, but the Department of Social Security says now that this is not income. If they have fallen below that mystical 85 per cent disability level but they are still unfit for work because of illness, they are deemed not to have lost income and, therefore, they are not eligible for sickness benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had brought to my attention the case of a widow who was on a widow's pension. She lost her pension because her child went into care. Therefore she lost her widow's pension because she no longer qualified. The woman suffers from a severe illness and needs considerable medication. The Department of Social Security decided that the pension she lost was not income and so it refused to pay her the sickness benefit. It gave her a special benefit but because there are no attached fringe benefits-in particular, there are no pharmaceutical concessions-she has in fact been put in a mental hospital. She can function in the outside world only with medication. The Government has stopped her eligibility for sickness benefit which would give her the required medication. She is only 34 years of age and she has been institutionalised. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation is a mess. The Government should do something about it urgently. I do not think anyone in this community would complain if the Government reverted, while waiting to adjust the legislation, to the interpretation which it and every other government have used for the past 37 years. We have the ridiculous situation where people can be transferred from the unemployment benefit to the sickness benefit and they will have fringe benefits. But, if they transfer from an invalid pension to a sickness benefit, although they are in the same position as the unemployed beneficiaries-that is, they are people who have lost the invalid pension because they could be in the work force now or later or because they are sickness beneficiaries they are unable to work because of temporary illness or injury-they will not get these benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The current legislation, I suggest, makes the stakes higher for people to go on to the invalid pension. The discrimination now is tougher than it should be. I think the Government should take a much more urgent look at this matter than it has in the past. This area has always been an administratively difficult area for the Department. It is now a nightmare for welfare workers. In some cases, such as in the case of the widow who has been forced into a mental home, it can be a personal tragedy from which people may not recover. There is an obvious solution. The Government should restore the sickness benefit provisions so that they are legislatively watertight, and progressively remove the distinctions between pensioners and beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, this legislation is not all that the Opposition would want but those provisions in it which improve the lot of the sickness beneficiaries, the invalid pensioners and those on rehabilitation allowances are certainly welcome. The Opposition does not oppose those provisions. The Opposition certainly does oppose those clauses in the legislation which discriminate against the very sensible move of the Victorian Government in relation to outpatients fees. Initially I will move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of this legislation to express the Opposition's concern. Later, in the Committee stage, the Opposition will oppose those clauses which it finds offensive. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate is of the opinion that-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the provisions disallowing the cost efficient Victorian out-patient levy should be excised from the Bill;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a simpler pharmaceutical benefits scheme should be constructed which does not discriminate between groups in similar income situations; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) any further increase in the general contribution rate for pharmaceutical benefits is unwarranted given the significant increase in the last Budget, and the fact that over the past seven years, the increase in the general contribution rate has run far in advance of inflation'. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that this is a reasonable amendment to the second reading of this legislation. I believe that the Senate should support the amendment that I have moved. I hope that a majority of the Senate will support the excision of those two clauses which affect the Victorian Government's health provisions. If we pass this amendment, at least the Senate will have expressed its disapproval of the actions of the Government and the inadequacies of the legislation as it exists. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard from Senator Grimes that the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982 is in two parts-one part pertaining to the amendments as a result of Budget decisions and the other a vicious attack upon the Victorian Government. The amendment moved by Senator Grimes describes the efforts by the Victorian Government to raise extra taxes as a cost-effective method of running the outpatient sections of their hospitals. The Victorian Government is levying a tax of 80c on every health insured person in Victoria. Whether they use outpatients services or whether they use their private doctor instead of outpatients facilities, health fund contributors in Victoria will have to pay a higher contribution rate. Senator Grimes has described this as a cost-effective method undertaken by Mr Roper in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe it is a levy that has been placed on all those people who are insured to give the impression that the Victorian Government is running a free outpatients service. The general impression will be that one does not get charged when one attends an outpatients clinic. The insured people will have already paid for that service. Of course, those who cannot afford to insure are already paid for by the Commonwealth Government. The Cain Government has nothing to worry about in that regard. If this practice is allowed to continue, I believe that Mr Roper in Victoria will also put a levy on hospital services. We would then have a situation in which the people who entered public hospitals in Victoria would not be charged. Those people who were insured would not be charged for the service provided. That would put up the contribution rate for the Victorian people to such an extent that it would eventually undermine the whole of the health insurance scheme. I am not averse to suggesting that this was the original intention of the Cain Government. The levy was introduced not as a cost-effective method, not as an economic and simple method of charging for outpatients services, but rather as a means of undermining the whole of the health insurance area. I am quite sure that this was the thinking behind the original legislation passed by the Cain Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Grimes skimmed over the Budget decisions very quickly. I am quite sure that those who are listening to the debate in this place tonight will realise why he has done that. As I said before, the Budget expresses the concern that the Government has shown for those in greatest need. It does so in many areas. I should like to run through them a little more thoroughly than Senator Grimes has done. I start with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. As Senator Grimes said, a three-tier system will begin on 1 January 1983. The Government will subsidise pharmaceutical items obtained under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The subsidy will be 50 per cent of the general contribution rate for those disadvantaged people who have health cards. The cost to the general public will now be $4 an item-a rise of 80c-but those disadvantaged people who hold a health card will pay just half of that, $2. This move has been applauded by all the pharmacists throughout Australia. They have been agitating for this move for some time and they were delighted with the Government's response in this area in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Grimes has indicated that the method of identifying the disadvantaged persons who are eligible to hold the health card and so are eligible for the $2 payment will be complicated. There will be no complications in this area. The Government has already said that the back of the prescription will have to be filled in by the eligible person to indicate that person's eligibility. That procedure will be sufficient for that person to pay only half the price of the prescription. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other Budget decisions in this omnibus Bill. There is an income test free benefit. Fringe benefits have been extended, income tax free, to the new rehabilitation allowance for those persons who undertake rehabilitation programs with the Commonwealth rehabilitation service. Total fringe benefits have also been extended, income tax free, to those people who are collecting sickness benefit. I am delighted with the Government's decision in this area. I believe that those people who are sick enough to be in receipt of sickness benefit ought to be able to have this benefit paid by the Commonwealth Government. Also there is the new mobility allowance and the new family income supplement. Neither of those allowances will be included in the eligibility test for the health card. I believe this is a great step forward. It is an indication that the Government is giving these two new allowances completely free. </PARA>
<PARA> For those invalid pensioners and others who receive the sheltered employment allowance and who want to have a go at entering the work force, the Government has provided a health card free of income test for 12 months. Some of those people have often said they would like to have a go at employment but if they did they would lose their benefits, so they cling to their benefits. They will now have a chance to see whether they can cope with employment in the work force and still hold the health card for 12 months. If they find they can cope, they will lose their health card; if they find they cannot cope, they will be back where they were and will have lost absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> In clause 23, as Senator Grimes indicated, the Commonwealth Government is prohibiting any State or Territory from applying a levy on registered health insurance funds. As I have already indicated, this is an area in which the Commonwealth Government has full control. That situation must remain. Health insurance funds are the complete responsibility of the Commonwealth Government and the contributors to those funds must be protected from any State Government which wishes to enter that field and apply extra levies. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 19 is important primarily, I suppose, because I drew the attention of the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) to this matter last year when we were debating the health legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. As he will recall, I drew this matter to his attention last year when we were debating the health legislation. I indicated at that time that the health funds had no redress concerning any directions that the Minister for Health may make to the health funds about their administration. The Parliament in fact had no knowledge of any direction the Minister might make. At that time Senator Baume indicated to me that the Government would look at this area and would correct it at the first moment that was opportune after the recess. I thank the Government for accommodating me in that regard. The matter was brought up in this omnibus Bill straight after the Budget. The situation now is that if the Minister gives a direction to a health fund on its particular method of administration the Minister's direction must be tabled in either House so that, 15 sitting days later, the Parliament may move for disallowance. Another initiative in this Bill is the right of appeal against administrative decisions. Previously there was no right of appeal. Other minor amendments also exist. I think that covers what I want to say in relation to the omnibus Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would very much oppose the division of this Bill in any way. I believe that the Federal Government has acted correctly in saying that health insurance, as a Commonwealth initiative, is a Commonwealth responsibility. The Commonwealth is responsible for ensuring that the health funds are administered in the right manner and hence the Minister is able to direct them. The Commonwealth has full control over health funds and no State or Territory should be allowed within this area. The Commonwealth Government must protect the contributors of Australia. It must protect the contributors in Victoria against the wilful intrusion of that State Government in an effort to raise money as a direct tax. It would raise money well above the normal amount that outpatients would require and so subsidise its hospitals through those people who do not use outpatient facilities. I certainly will not be supporting the Opposition's amendment to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Legislation Amendment Bill ( No. 2) is another one of the Government's omnibus Bills. It is different from the other omnibus Bills in that this omnibus Bill contains one or two rather unwelcome passengers, namely, clause 23 and clause 43, which are, as has been stated by a previous speaker, totally unrelated to the other proposals contained in the legislation and which were not foreshadowed in any way during the Budget Speech of the Treasurer (Mr Howard). I will deal with those clauses a little later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major part of this Bill affects proposals that were brought down in August by the Treasurer. It seeks to amend the National Health Act, the Health Insurance Act and the Health Insurance Commission Act. The Australian Democrats have no great quarrel with the provisions in all but two of the clauses contained in the omnibus Bill. Certainly we do not intend to oppose the Budget provisions which are included in this piece of legislation. I would, however, like to comment on one or two of the proposals which my party and I believe, and I have said this before in relation to other pieces of health legislation brought forward by this Government, do not effectively help the sorts of people who require the help which is allegedly being given. </PARA>
<PARA> Among other things, this Bill aims to implement an expansion of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The Government proposes to make available drugs and medicinal preparations on the pharmaceutical benefits schedule at 50 per cent of the general contribution rate to a number of people who presently pay the full contribution rate. That, as far as it goes, is to be commended. These new arrangements will come into operation on 1 January 1983. The Minister for Health (Mr Carlton) in his second reading speech described a three-tier system of contribution in place of the present two-tier system. By virtue of clause 27, concessional beneficiaries, that is, health care card holders and those on social security pensions, including supporting parents' benefits or service pensions, who because of income are not entitled to a pensioner health benefit card, will now be entitled to pharmaceutical benefits at the reduced contribution rate of $2 per benefit item. The rest of the community, the Minister said, will pay an increased patient contribution of $4 per benefit item -an increase this year of 80c from the $3.20 which was, as honourable senators will recall, increased in the 1981-82 Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Herein lies the major problem, because the rest of the community includes a great many people whose chronic illnesses, as Senator Grimes has pointed out, require them to expend a large proportion of their income on pharmaceuticals which are necessary for them to maintain a satisfactory quality of life, and in some cases which are necessary for them simply to stay alive. These people are not, as the Minister indicated, on pensions of some other sort and are not eligible for the $2 concession. Often, too, they are people who are part of a family with multiple problems. Earlier this year, in another health debate, I raised the situation of a family which was facing extraordinary problems in paying pharmaceutical costs. The father had cancer, the mother had another very debilitating disease, and they had a number of children who were faced with the usual childhood complaints. </PARA>
<PARA> This naturally enough, as I have pointed out, again in previous speeches, puts the pharmacist in an invidious position. He is faced with the dilemma of being approached by customers who come straight from a doctor with a number of prescriptions but with the money to pay for only one or two of them. That is a decision that no one should be asked to make. The costs of some chronic illnesses are astounding. The costs of diabetes, for instance, which is a particularly common and very chronic illness in Australia, are extraordinary. The annual costs of medical care, hospital visits, ancillary aids and medicine for diabetes in Australia has been estimated as being about $160m annually, and diabetes is by no means the only chronic illness which has that sort of cost to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also an additional problem arising all too frequently these days which comes from the removal by the Government of drugs from the pharmaceutical benefits list after they have achieved a high degree of acceptance among users. In some cases the drugs are removed because it has been discoverd, too late in the piece, that there is some sort of dependency inducing quality in the particular medication; but that can hardly be considered to be the fault of the consumer. In some cases, too, the drug is simply removed as part of a cost- cutting exercise. On 2 January last year, the Age ran an item entitled: 'Doctors criticise cuts-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Age article on 2 January 1981, to which I was referring, was headed 'Doctors criticise cuts in free list drugs'. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The removal of some drugs from the pharmaceutical benefit list by the Commonwealth Health Department is provoking a stream of protests from doctors and pharmacists. One Melbourne pharmacist said that the removal of drugs was being decided by bureaucrats with little understanding of the effect it had on patients, particularly the poor. He said pensioners previously could obtain the widely used pain relieving drug, digesic, for nothing but now they had to pay $4 .93 for 50 tablets. The Minister for Health, Mr MacKellar, said in August that the trimming of the pharmaceutical list would save the Government $2.17m per year. </PARA>
<PARA> That same pharmacist went on to make the point that the system of reviewing drugs by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee seemed to lack perspective. He said valium was a valuable tranquilliser but more than 80 per cent of prescriptions for it were unjustified, and yet the Government was not removing it from the benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>The article went on at some considerable length to complain about the problems being caused to patients who had been induced into taking a particular drug by a doctor who was prescribing it on the understanding that it was free, presumably, from dependency inducing characteristics and because it was available on the free list, only to find later that it was taken off when the patient, often an elderly person, had become used to that particular medication. </PARA>
<PARA> I also received a letter recently from a gentleman in Western Australia who was concerned about this problem of the costs of pharmaceuticals. He suffers from chronic hypertension. He has had this condition for a considerable time. He said that it was diagnosed seven or eight years ago. In that time he has spent a total of three months in hospital in search of an effective combination of drugs to control his condition. Most drugs proved less than adequate, he said, and also induced adverse side effects, including sexual problems, difficulty in breathing and a tendency to fall asleep during working hours. His letter goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> My most recent admission to Kalgoorlie Hospital produced an admixture of Minoxidil, Propanolol, Frusemide and the potassium supplement Slow K. When it was first prescribed, Minoxidil was still undergoing clinical study and was available only from hospital pharmacies. At that time the drug was supplied free of charge. Not only did it control my condition to a high degree under all circumstances, but it was also relatively free of side effects. </PARA>
<PARA>He adds in brackets at this point-some honourable senators may care to note this -</PARA>
<PARA>(The only noticeable result was a tendency to reverse my incipient baldness and to increase the need to shave frequently.)</PARA>
<PARA> However, when I had become almost totally dependent on the drug for a normal life, a charge was introduced. The tablets now cost $50 per 100 . . . This one drug cost me $1 a day, or $365 annually. Together with the other medications mentioned, plus treatment for chronic sinusitis and frequent migraine, my drugs are costing me from $600 to $700 each year. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not an isolated situation. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Surely, the point, Senator Baume, is that it ought to be possible for this Government, which presumably contains some thinking members, to come up with some sort of scheme that would help people who are chronically ill but who are not necessarily pensioners. The Minister will recall that I have raised this point with him during Question Time. His answer to that, as I recall , was: 'Well, we cannot help everyone, so we have to get our priorities in order '. So we leave, in effect, a batch of people in the middle, in the twilight zone , who are not pensioners, who are not necessarily well off, but who are faced with massive pharmaceutical costs simply because they suffer from some sort of chronic illness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Other amendments in this legislation extend health care card eligibility to persons in the work force after recently having been on invalid pension or sheltered employment allowances. Senator Grimes has gone into considerable detail on those particular areas and I do not want to deal with them in any detail tonight. However, I do want to discuss at some legth the two clauses which are included in this omnibus Bill and which have no business being there since thay have no connection whatsoever with the rest of the legislation or with anything to do with the Budget. Those two clauses are clauses 23 and 43; 23 being the substantive clause and 43 being the consequential one. They were inserted into this piece of legislation in an attempt to frustrate the perfectly constitutional actions taken by the Victorian Government. They are an attempt to invalidate an Act that was brought in by the Victorian Government to assist it in getting over the Commonwealth Government health funding cuts and to make up the costs for what was an inefficient, ineffective and costly method of administering the Victorian hospitals' out-patient departments. I understand that South Australia has a bulk billing system for in-patients and is planning on extending that to out-patients. If the Federal Government gets away with stopping the Victorian Government from taking its steps to introduce an administratively efficient system, I wonder whether it will then step in to stop the South Australian Government from doing what it wants to do to solve the same problem by a different route. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and then presumably Queensland will not be allowed to run its Golden Casket lotteries or whatever on similar grounds. The legislation which was passed recently by the Victorian Government imposes a levy on health insurance organisations in that State. It imposes the levy only on patients who are insured. While I question the size of the levy, it is nevertheless the province of the Victorian Government to decide how much money it needs to administer efficiently its public hospital system and therefore to whom it will spread the charge and how much it will charge those people. The levy is intended to finance, in effect, the out-patient services provided to insured persons in Victoria. Instead of bills being sent out in single accounts, they will be obviated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> According to the Federal Minister for Health the levy arrangement has a number of undesirable implications which, from the Federal Government's viewpoint, make it unacceptable. In other words, it offends against the present Government's user pays fixation. But not everybody seems to feel that this is a problem. The Age editorial of 18 October 1982 certainly did not share the Minister's concern. Age editorials are not noted for being particularly left wing or radical. The editorial stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has no business to be interfering, at the behest of the private health funds and for dubious reasons of its own, with a perfectly legitimate and justifiable measure introduced by a State Government to reduce costs and raise revenue for its public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say towards the end of the editorial:</PARA>
<PARA> In effect, the levy is borne by all Victorians with the exception of pensioners and the disadvantaged exempted under Federal policy . . . and of a small minority who feel they do not need or cannot afford health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA>The system also certainly meets with approval from the Australian Hospital Association. I have received-as I presume other senators also have-a number of telexes, one from the General Manager of the Victorian Hospitals Association Ltd and one from the National Vice-President of the Australian Hospital Association. These people too are not noted for their terribly extreme left wing or radical attitudes to health, to health insurance or to the provision of health care generally. The telex from the Victorian Hospitals Association states:</PARA>
<PARA> A return to the previous system of individual billing would add to patient confusion, increase administrative costs, reduce hospital income, and jeopardise the present level of hospital services. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no evidence to support the assertion by Minister of Health Carlton that the levy will lead to overcrowding in outpatient departments. </PARA>
<PARA>The second telex, which is from the Australian Hospital Association, states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Association accused the Federal Government of maintaining a double standard , arguing on one hand that the management of health services was a State responsibility and then interfering when it suited their political purpose. The Australian Hospital Association strongly supports the concept of States having full responsibility for health care delivery provided the Commonwealth Government adopt and maintain national standards for health. The revenue generated from the levy is essential to maintain current health services in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA>The telex finished by stating:</PARA>
<PARA> The Association had not been consulted about the proposed legislation and it can only conclude that the Commonwealth Government has responded to pressure from the health insurance industry. </PARA>
<PARA>That, I suspect, is precisely what has happened, if the representations that have been made to me by the health insurance industry are anything to go by, because the health funds collected with the levy are some sort of back door way of providing universal health cover. The industry also claims that uninsured patients are getting free treatment, especially on weekends, because patients are not required to fill in a declaration stating that they are insured. That, of course, means that those who are insured and who may never use the out- patients department are paying for the uninsured who do. Again I say that is the State of Victoria's problem. That State is making whatever bed it has to lie on. If the Victorians do not like it they have a perfectly valid chance to express that disapproval at the ballot box in the next State election. Leaving that aside, this is not the first occasion on which the subsidisation of insured patients in public hospitals has occurred. On other occasions it has been done by the Commonwealth Government. I refer honourable senators to a very lengthy article which I do not intend to read. It is headed 'State of the Nation' and is by Geoffrey Barker. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Would Senator Bonner like to hear it? Under the heading 'Health Care: the inequities abound', it states in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last year's Budget Papers also estimated that Commonwealth outlays on private hospital bed subsidies this year would be around $100m. As only those insured at higher levels can generally afford private hospital care the bed subsidies represent another direct transfer of benefit to the more advantaged groups. Some 60 per cent of all admissions to public hospitals are in fact 'private patients' , paying uniform State-regulated fees of only about half average operating costs . Thus, again indirectly, Commonwealth dollars are subsidising the advantaged insured patient in public hospitals-and the greater their economic advantage, the greater the value of the subsidy to them. </PARA>
<PARA>That is simply because their insurance rebates are higher. The rather churlish refusal by the Government last night to allow the splitting of these two clauses from the omnibus Bill is a transparent piece of blackmail. In effect the Government is saying that the Senate will accept some unacceptable proposals if it wants to get through the rest of the legislation, which does offer some support and assistance to some sections of the population who are in need. I say that that will simply not work. Those of us on this side of the House will not now be subjected to the sorts of blackmailing tactics that have been put to us by the present Government any more than we were at the end of the last session. The Senate will recall that last session the House of Representatives rose considerably earlier than the Senate did and we were put in the invidious position of being asked to write out a carte blanche to give the Government what it wanted since we knew that there would be no opportunity for any amendments that we made to legislation being looked at by the House of Representatives, which had gone on holiday. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand from the buzzing in the corridors at the moment that this may well be the last substantial piece of legislation debated in the current session because the Government is intending to dissolve Parliament tomorrow and to have a full double dissolution on 4 December. If it does dissolve Parliament tomorrow on the grounds that the Senate is objecting to an intrusion by the Federal Government on the States' rights-in this case Victoria-then so be it. I can think of no better reason for the Senate to be accused of being obstructionist or difficult than that it is operating as a House of review, for which it is here, and that it is defending the rights of a particular State government to operate constitutionally. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt in my mind at all that the Victorian Government has the right to do what it is doing. There is no doubt in my mind at all that the Federal Government has no right to include clauses 23 and 43 in what is essentially a piece of legislation intended to deal with Budget proposals. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the Australian Labor Party's amendment to the second reading motion. If this Government persists in not allowing us to split off clauses 23 and 43 so that those sections of the omnibus Bill which come into effect on 1 November can in fact do so, then we will have no option other than to vote against clauses 23 and 43 in the Committee stage and trust-I suspect somewhat in vain-that the Government will then move expeditiously to bring the amended legislation before the House of Representatives before it dissolves it tomorrow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) which is a benefit Bill. I have appreciated the contribution of honourable senators. I was particularly interested in Senator Grimes's contribution, dealing as it did almost entirely with social security matters and only briefly with matters contained in this Bill. I found it most instructive but probably not completely relevant. The Bill contains several main provisions set out by speakers who have taken part in the debate. The first matter concerns the decision to confer a new benefit on those people who need pharmaceutical benefits and who are in a disadvantaged capacity. The Bill creates a new class of person for whom pharmaceutical benefits will be available at a discounted price. This is a new benefit. It will help a large number of people. In the Senate last year we promised that we would try to introduce something of this kind to ease the burden, referred to by honourable senators, which falls on those who have chronic illness, who need a number of drugs and who need these at a concessional price. As honourable senators will know, the three-tier system to be introduced will involve a large number of Australians who will pay nothing for their pharmaceuticals, some Australians who will pay $2 a prescription and the vast number of us who will pay $4 a prescription.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second main group of features of the Bill concerns changes to pensioner health benefit card entitlements. These will be extended to new classes of people who at present do not have them. Again this is a benefit conferring measure. The PHB entitlement will now be given to all sickness beneficiaries, irrespective of how they would qualify under an income test This will help people who were previously not able to get the pensioner health benefit card. It will also be available to a new group of people receiving rehabilitation help through the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service and who become entitled to the new rehabilitation allowance. Again this is a benefit conferring measure to a group of people who are in need, who are undergoing rehabilitation and who will value the acquisition of the pensioner health benefit card. </PARA>
<PARA> There will also be an extension of the health care card to invalid pensioners who may in fact, although they may remain incapacitated, want to take a chance and try to work. The health care card extension will last for 12 months while these people undergo the experiment. In fact, this is an incentive measure. It will give people an incentive to try to get out and join the work force again without suffering a penalty in terms of eligibility for the health care card. The card will also be extended to those receiving sheltered employment allowances who also elect to go out into open employment. The third main group of features in the Bill are what I referred to earlier as the Walters amendment. That is the one to which Senator Walters referred and about which a promise was made to her during a debate some months ago. This is simply to ensure there is tabling and the capacity for disallowane in the Parliament of any directions given to organisations under the Act. This will enable Parliament to have continuing oversight of the administrative determinations of a Minister or his officers. </PARA>
<PARA> The final group of provisions in the measure relate to the levy which has been raised by the Victorian Government. This seems to be a matter which has aroused considerable passion amongst some honourable senators who have spoken. There is an indication that honourable senators may seek to set that aside. The Government believes that it is proper to resist these measures. We will persist to try to retain in the Bill those provisions which set aside what the Victorian Government has set out to do. I remind honourable senators that it is the Commonwealth that has the constitutional responsibility for health insurance matters. Health insurance rests with us. We are responsible for the registration and control of organisations, the establishment of the contribution rates which may be charged and the interests of contributors to health insurance funds. It is not the State governments but the Commonwealth Government which is responsible. The responsibility rests here. We take measures which we believe will protect the interests of contributors, and we make no apology for doing so. We ask honourable senators to consider whether it is not a proper exercise of our power and something that they would want us to do on behalf of the community . </PARA>
<PARA> Over three million people in Victoria have hospital insurance cover. What the Victorian Government has proposed will mean that these three million people will be paying, through health insurance, about 20c a week more for hospital insurance than they need pay. This is because the Victorian Government will be taking, by way of its levy, more money than it needs to cover the costs of the function it seeks to pay for. The levy is not based on an accurate assessment of the current utilisation of out-patient services in Victoria. It is a badly costed levy. The measure takes more from the Victorian people than is needed to cover the costs of what it is out to do. The cost is higher than it need be. It appears to be designed as a revenue raising measure quite separate from a recoupment measure for the use of out-patient services. If it was properly costed that might make a difference. </PARA>
<PARA> The States should not be allowed to apply levies of this kind which impinge and impose on the contributors to health insurance for revenue raising purposes. I put it to honourable senators that there is an issue of equity here. The levy would raise about $44m. The Commonwealth estimates that with complete collection about $31m should be sufficient to recoup the costs of out-patient services. I might say that the actual amounts being claimed under the current charging experience are much less than this. The Victorian hospitals in fact were raising only about $20m from their out-patient services. Not only will they be seeking to raise more than they were but also will they be seeking to raise more than they need and more than they can justify in terms of the services that they render to Victorians on proper costs. I put it to honourable senators that what we are proposing in those terms is reasonable. The levy will push up unduly the contribution rates for health insurance in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> What interest does the Commonwealth have in this matter? We subsidise health insurance rates not least because of the health rebate which they attract. This will be a revenue raising measure for Victoria not justified on economic grounds which will impinge upon the Commonwealth revenue by way of a tax rebate and additional revenue foregone. The Commonwealth has a responsibility to the people of Australia to ensure that health insurance is available to everyone and that it is available at the lowest possible cost. The measure being proposed by the Victorian Government is one that will raise health insurance costs and will do so unnecessarily. The Parliament has given the Minister for Health (Mr Carlton) the authority to control the benefit levels relating to hospital in-patient and out-patient charges. If the concept of a levy on health funds extends to cover in-patient services as well, the Commonwealth's control over health insurance would be eroded and our capacity to look after the interests of contributors would be virtually destroyed. If this levy and similar levies were allowed, the role of the Commonwealth in carrying out and exercising its constitutional responsibility to health insurance contributors and for health insurance would be impaired. We think the Commonwealth role could be then downgraded to little more than approving the contribution rates to meet the various levies raised by State governments on the health insurance funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument that a State has a capacity to raise taxes is incontestable. The argument that the Victorian Government, if it had chosen to do so, could have put a tax on the people of Victoria to raise that money is incontestable. But we believe that the route it has chosen to travel is the wrong route. We believe that its costings are wrong. We believe that it is seeking to raise too much money and that the contributors to health insurance will suffer. The Government will, therefore, press to retain those clauses in the Bill which have been the subject of some discussion and debate tonight. In addition, because this is a benefit conferring Bill, because there is a commencement date of 1 November for many of the benefits and because this is almost the last sitting day on which we can consider this legislation, we will oppose the amendment which has been moved by the Opposition and, during the Committee stage, we will seek to have the Bill retained intact. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that in a few moments Senator Grimes will move for procedural purposes a motion to suspend Standing Orders. I will speak to that motion at an appropriate time. I might indicate now, however, that the Government believes the Bill should be considered as a unity. We believe that it can be dealt with clause by clause in Committee. That is within the competence of the Committee. There is no need to split the Bill so that the Opposition can make the points that it wants to make. There is no need to split the Bill for the purpose of passing or rejecting various parts. I will address that matter in a few moments when Senator Grimes moves his motion. However, in the meantime, having indicated the Government's position, I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I wish to raise a point of procedure. The Senate gave the Joint Committee of Public Accounts the right to sit while the Senate was sitting. The Committee commenced to sit at 8 o'clock this evening in the House of Representatives Committee Room No. 1. I would have expected that it would be understood that, the Committee having been given leave to sit, its members would automatically be paired. It so happened that when the bells rang Senator Lajovic and I found difficulty in leaving the committee room. Having got out of that room, we proceeded under great difficulties to this chamber. I repeat that, the Committee having been given consent to sit, its members should automatically have been paired; that it should have been quite unnecessary for Senator Lajovic and me to run madly through the corridors of the Parliament in order to reach this place. I ask what the position would have been if I had not reached the Senate in time. What would have been the position if the vote had been so close as to involve a difference of one? A very serious decision could have been made by the Senate in a certain way because of the absence of senators engaged in carrying out duties authorised by the Senate. I am still out of breath as a result of being subjected to that imposition and I suggest that the leaders of the House should take the matter in hand.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I believe there is no need for debate. Senator Georges's point is well taken and I realise that he has made a considerable effort to reach the Senate in time. However, the matter is one which involves a personal explanation rather than a point of order. As every honourable senator knows, pairing is not a matter for formal action by the Senate but rather one for the Whips of the parties. I am sure that both the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition will take the matter up with the Whips and ensure that the situation will never occur again.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That it be an instruction to the Committee of the Whole that the Committee divide the Bill so as to incorporate in a separate Bill clause 23 and Part IV of the Bill relating to the taxation of registered organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not wish to delay the Senate. I am aware of the Standing Order that necessitates that an absolute majority of senators be in favour before the Standing Orders may be suspended. I am also aware that some honourable senators consider that Standing Order to be unconstitutional. Perhaps we should do something about it later. I attempted to follow this procedure last night. Due to circumstances beyond my control, and that of others, yesterday a contingent notice of motion in order to permit this procedure to be followed was not moved at the usual time. If it had been I would not now be seeking to suspend Standing Orders. I do so now merely because of that set or circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night, when I sought and was refused the opportunity to move my contingent notice of motion the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume)-not absolutely unreasonably, I suggest-pointed out that I had not given him very much notice. However, I believe that, quite unreasonably, he gave the further reason that he had been unable to consult the Minister in another place. I pointed out that it was not the business of a Minister in another place to decide what procedures should be followed in this chamber. The reason for the motion to suspend Standing Orders was clearly outlined by both Senator Haines and me during the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill consists, firstly, of provisions which implement the Budget proposals of the Government. In fact, they are not opposed. We may have questions about the extent to which they go, or the way in which they will be applied, but we do not oppose them. However, tacked on to the Bill are two provisions-namely, clause 23 and Part IV-which have nothing to do with the Budget proposals. They were not announced in the Budget and have been tacked on quite separately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have been associated, in previous announcements, with the Budget. The honourable senator should not become too excited; she will have her chance to speak. The Opposition believes that it is reasonable to remove them so that, in the course of referring the legislation back to the House of Representatives, we will be able to present to that House two clear and distinct pieces of legislation. Of course, the Opposition is concerned by the Minister's veiled threat that the provision of pensioner health benefits to sickness beneficiaries, which is due to begin on 1 November, may not take place because, if the legislation is referred back tomorrow, obviously the Government will decide not to deal with it. But I still move for the suspension of Standing Orders to make the point that we believe that these are separate pieces of legislation. They have separate functions and clearly they are not connected. We therefore believe that the Bill should be separated so that the Senate can deal with it in a sensible way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders for the separation of these particular clauses from the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). It is consistent with the amendment to the second reading that has just been carried by the Senate. It will have been observed by honourable senators that the original proposition in sub-paragraph ( a) in the addendum to the second reading motion was as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The provisions disallowing the cost efficient Victorian out-patient levy should be excised from the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the original proposition by the Opposition. That was then amended and became certainly acceptable to me. It was amended from the form I have just mentioned to the following form:</PARA>
<PARA> The provisions disallowing the Victorian out-patient levy should be taken out of the Bill and considered separately. </PARA>
<PARA>In my view, the Senate's having adopted that motion only a few minutes ago, it would be acting quite consistently if it now adopted the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders moved by Senator Grimes. I support that motion because of my long standing objection to the Government's penchant for tacking unrelated matters on to a particular measure, thus tying into that particular measure matters which ought, of their very essence, to be considered separately. I am perfectly well aware that this debate is academic. Even though the suspension motion is likely to attract the majority support of the Senate, that will not be sufficient, because of the provisions of Standing Orders, to carry the day. Of course, the reason for that is that such a motion, in the event that notice thereof has not been given, requires the support of a majority of the Senate, namely 33 votes. As we have observed in the divisions tonight, for some reason or other people seem to have taken off and gone over to South Australia. Of course, that is their business. </PARA>

I should like to deal with those matters at the appropriate time. I would have preferred to have dealt with them, if it had been possible, as a separate issue from this Bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue before the Senate really is not an issue as to whether the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) is divisible. The issue is not an issue about tacking or about the constitution of this Bill, nor is it a denial of the capacity of the Senate to rearrange its affairs if it so wishes. I accept the sovereignty of the Senate and of some of the declarations it has made in the past. The issue is what should happen here and now with this Bill. I am not questioning the principle. The Senate lays down procedures which are designed to protect the rights of all honourable senators. It was competent upon any honourable senator to have given a contingent notice of motion on any of the preceding days of sitting. Had that been done, the normal procedures of the Senate would have been followed. Honourable senators would have had the notice to which they are entitled under the Standing Orders. They would have had the protection of the Standing Orders and as Senator Harradine pointed out quite correctly, a simple majority of honourable senators would then have determined the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>

Goodness me, it would have been no trouble. If Senator Harradine and I had been doing it together it would have been no trouble, using the Standing Orders properly, to have divided the Bill. It is a simple question. The Government is quite happy to discuss the issue of the Victorian levy. We are not contesting the divisibility. We are saying that it is not in our interests. It is not in the interests of the community, nor of anyone on this occasion, that this Bill should now be divided. We want the Bill dealt with as a unit and considered with its clauses as it is. If the aim of the Australian Labor Party is to oppose this Bill, then let it do so. Let it be seen to do so. There is no way that it can weasel around, to be able to oppose part of it and to be seen not to be opposing part of the package that we brought in.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I merely wish to say that I am disappointed in the level of the reply from the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume). As Senator Tate interjected, we have heard a schoolboy type debate from the Minister. Last night the Minister's reason for refusing me leave to give a contingent notice of motion was that he had not had sufficient notice of what it was about and that he could not consult with his colleague in another place. He has now had almost 24 hours notice. He now has two arguments. Firstly, he argues that we did not-I accept that we did not-get the contingent notice of motion in at the right time, for circumstances beyond my control, as I have said . But he then goes on and says that really we could have moved the notice of motion today and deliberately delayed this legislation until after 11 p.m. so that we would have been covered tomorrow. That is the sort of level at which the Minister and the Government operate. They claim that they want this legislation through by 1 November. We want to have the legislation dealt with tonight to give them the opportunity to take the Bill, if it is amended, back to another place, and to give them plenty of time to deal with it. They do not want time to deal with it. They are playing funny games and little tricks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am sorry that the Minister has taken this approach. I am sorry that he has changed his tack so much in the past 24 hours. He is pretty desperate but I accept, as does Senator Harradine, that, with the way the numbers are in this place and because of the Standing Orders, this motion will be defeated and we will then go on to deal with the Committee stages of the Bill. We will deal with that as Senator Baume advises us. But we will deal with it in a more complicated way than I suggest is necessary. We will not divide. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clause 23 of the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) was fairly widely debated at the second reading stage. I do not want to go through the arguments in detail. We oppose clause 23 because this clause, plus Part IV of the legislation, has the effect of preventing the Victorian Government from applying its levy to facilitate the collection of out- patient fees, to make it administratively more simple to deal with problems regarding out-patient fees and in particular to cope with the difficulties faced by Victorian hospitals in the collection of those fees, and to overcome the problem of bad debts. We believe, as do most other people, particularly those listed by Senator Haines, that it is a reasonable and sensible approach to the funding of out-patient departments of hospitals bearing in mind the health insurance system which we have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tonight the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) did not quite use the arguments that were used in another place in support of the legislation. For instance, I noted that he did not place the heavy emphasis that the Minister for Health (Mr Carlton) did in another place on this being contrary to the user pays principle, but he did make a great deal of the fact that he thought the levy was too high and that it put too much of a burden on Victorian insured patients. Tonight was the first time that I heard that proposition. The levy rate was set to collect $38.4m, which is the amount that the Commonwealth claimed Victoria should collect from insured patients and by which its grant was accordingly reduced. The Minister of Health in Victoria, Mr Roper, and the Premier, Mr Cain, have stated that if the Commonwealth revised that estimate up or down the levy would be adjusted. They were using the Commonwealth figures-the Commonwealth calculations. Suddenly in this place the Minister claimed there is a great disparity between the amount raised by the levy and the amount the Commonwealth claimed the Victorian State Government should raise by applying the out-patient fees. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to the other argument that I used very briefly at the second reading stage. It seems to me that the Federal Government has an ideological obsession with Mr Cain and his Government. The Government thinks it is horrendous that the Victorian Government should use this eminently sensible method to collect out- patient fees, a method which is administratively less costly and more simple and which will release funds and people to perform the tasks that hospitals are supposed to perform-that is, to treat the sick rather than to collect bills and spend time pushing paper around wondering where those bills should be collected. For those reasons we oppose this clause of the legislation, as we did in another place. We urge all honourable senators to join us in that opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. What appears to be the situation is that the Commonwealth is using its insurance powers to negative what the State of Victoria considers are its justified taxation powers to ensure that its responsibility in the health area is honoured. It appears to me that we have reached this stage because of a misunderstanding between the Commonwealth and that State. The Commonwealth reduced the grant to Victoria by estimates of amounts which it considered Victoria would be able to collect. Those estimates, for one reason or another, have been found to be short to the tune of something like $18m to $20m. Of course, the Government of Victoria must turn round and try to find that money. All sorts of reasons might well be advanced as to why this has occurred. First of all, why were the Commonwealth estimates so far out? That is a question which I now raise at the Committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to Senator Harradine because he has raised a fair question which I think I need to answer to help clarify the debate. I will try to be as brief as I can.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not trying to talk it out. He stated that the Commonwealth had made an estimate that at a charge of $15 a service Victoria should be able to raise $36m-that was his figure-of which 90 per cent was in respect of insured persons. Those were the figures he was using based on Commonwealth information. From 1 July 1982 the charge was $20 per service. As the arithmetic worked out, all other things being equal, an amount of $43.2m would have been raised from insured persons. This appears to have been the figure on which the Victorians based their levy calculations. This calculation was made despite the fact that a review of the revenue raising capacity was then being undertaken. Victoria had requested the review in February 1982 and it was being undertaken. The review was discussed and completed at the Premiers Conference held in June 1982. The results of that review provide the figures from which we should be working, not the earlier figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the review the Commonwealth revised its estimate of out-patient revenue. Full details of that revised estimate were sent to Mr Roper on 6 August 1982. He had the figures; they were sent to him on 6 August. The amount of revenue estimated to be collected was reduced because of a decline in utilisation and because of the correction of erroneous out-patient data provided previously by the State. I have some more information as to why it was erroneous, but the figures were revised downwards. Also, in the Commonwealth view, insured patients would probably meet about only 77 per cent of the revenue figure, not the 90 per cent which had been our previous estimate. The State had not really considered the number of compensable patients, patients who were outside Commonwealth guidelines who were receiving free treatment, et cetera. For these reasons the figures were lower. They had been communicated to Mr Roper in early August and they were a result of a review which Victoria had requested in line with its entitlements under the new health arrangements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; That raises another question. The question is simply: Why, then, is there a need now for the Victorian Government to come up with all this money? That is the point at issue. Is it not a fact that the Victorian Government suggested that that issue be looked at by the Commonwealth Grants Commission under section 12 of the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act? I remind the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) that that Act makes provision for the Commonwealth Grants Commission to investigate the capacity of the State to raise revenue in respect of that relevant year from charges for health care provided at its public hospitals. Of course the relevant year therein mentioned is the year commencing 1 July 1982. This is the last year under this Act that these arrangements can be made. If the Victorian Government is prepared to submit the relevant facts concerning the charges for health care provided at its public hospitals for consideration by the Grants Commission, why should that not be agreed to by the Commonwealth so that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) can make supplementary consideration of those issues and then in the light of that make a separate adjustment so far as the State of Victoria is concerned?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am concerned about this issue. I am not happy about the Victorian Government' s levy-I say that quite frankly-because it has inherent difficulties within it. For example, people who are insured and who are paying their contributions are being charged for services that they will not be involved in. The people who do not go to outpatient departments will be taxed, as it were, for nothing. Many people in country districts of Victoria will not have the ability to go to out- patient departments. I am concerned about it because of the principle and the likely flow-on to other States. Nevertheless, I am also concerned about the fact that apparently there is a difference of opinion between the Commonwealth and the State which, it seems to me on a reading of the provisions of section 12 of the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act, could have been resolved by the Grants Commission. I would like the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) to address his mind to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, whilst I consider that another problem about this whole question of a levy of the character that is being proposed in Victoria is that it appears to shed responsibility for accountability in certain public hospitals, let me say this very clearly: The health funds also should have some surveillance over their particular operations, and certain outgoings, particularly from the Victorian funds, ought to be subject to audit and control. I know there are audit and control provisions but maybe what I have to say about that can wait to a later stage and be dealt with under a different subject heading. I know for a fact that there is some squandering of contributors' funds in respect of certain matters on foot at the moment. It is minor in the overall aspect but it is major in the other field. I will deal with it under a different heading at the appropriate time. Can the Minister address his reply to the point that I raised in particular, which was that if the Victorian Government was prepared, as I am advised it was, to have these matters looked at by the Grants Commission, why did the Commonwealth Government decline?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish briefly to supplement Senator Harradine 's question, as it was one of the questions I was going to raise. It is my understanding that Mr Roper and the Victorian Government requested the referral of the estimates to the Commonwealth Grants Commission as they wanted independent arbitration because of the dispute between the Victorian and Federal governments over the actual costs. I think it is very important that the question be answered. Supplementary to that, in the second reading reply of the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) which I carefully took down the Minister said in the course of his arguments about this point that if the application of the levy was properly costed it may have been a different matter. Was the Minister saying that the problem is not so much the Victorian Government 's applying of the levy but the fact that in the Commonwealth view it did not cost that levy properly? That makes a great deal of difference to the way various people may see it. We have had so many arguments from Mr Carlton and the Minister in this place against this levy and it seemed to me that an extra dimension was added when the Minister suggested that his main problem was not so much the levy but the fact that it was not properly costed.</PARA></TALK.START>

A number of honourable senators would be concerned about the fact that the Victorian Government has chosen to bring in funds in a certain way; that is, by virtually a discriminatory tax on health fund contributors, some of whom will be unable to avail themselves of the services to which their moneys are being directed. That seems to me to be somewhat unjust. By the same token, it has been suggested that the Commonwealth underestimated the amount that the State could have raised in respect of revenue from charges for health care provided at public hospitals.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this evening I raised a point of order because I believed that an honourable senator was reading a speech in the chamber. The Deputy President at the time said that the honourable senator was speaking from copious notes. Being a very patient person, I waited until that honourable senator had completed the speech. I then asked that the copious notes be tabled and incorporated in Hansard. Unfortunately, it was not possible for those copious notes to be incorporated in Hansard but they were tabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr President, you will recall, I am sure, that on two occasions-on the first, you were not President-we have had a debate in this chamber-many honourable senators from both sides of the chamber entered those debates-about whether honourable senators should read their speeches. Standing Order 406 states:</PARA>
<PARA> No Senator shall read his speech. </PARA>
<PARA>The debates that took place were about whether that Standing Order should be changed: On the first occasion I was one of those who spoke very strongly, I believe, in favour of honourable senators being allowed to read their speeches in this chamber. I felt, and I still feel, that some honourable senators who come into this place find it necessary to take time to prepare speeches, to carry out necessary research into a number of matters that are debated in this place and to read their speeches in this chamber. Of course, many honourable senators felt that that should not be done. They said that that was not the way we should act in this chamber. They put the view that we should be able to make speeches without preparing them and that sort of thing. On that first occasion, those of us who supported the right of honourable senators to read speeches were defeated. We accepted that defeat graciously and we carried on. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, you will recall that, during your time as President, another debate took place in this chamber about the same matter. In other words, we debated whether we should reject Standing Order 406. Again, a number of people made speeches supporting that view and others spoke against it. My friend and colleague Senator Missen spoke strongly against honourable senators having the right to read their speeches in this chamber. He felt-rightly so, I suppose, according to his philosophy and beliefs-that honourable senators should be able to stand in this place and make speeches without having a prepared speech in front of them. </PARA>

Why should they be in a privileged position compared to other honourable senators who are elected to this place to represent their constituencies, whether they be Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory? Why should they be in the privileged position of being able to come in here and read speeches which have been prepared by someone else and which look so beautiful in Hansard and have all the guys in the Press Gallery write them up, saying what great people they are; whereas some person who has come from a lowly background, who does not have that capacity and who stands up here and makes a speech that does not attract or appeal to the Press is left in limbo?

<PARA> No Senator shall read his speech. </PARA>
<PARA>Again I apologise for the wording of the Standing Order. Maybe there was a time when there were only males in this place. But thanks be to God there are now ladies in this chamber.

<PARA> I do not apologise for raising this matter tonight. I do not apologise for calling to order an honourable senator who I believe was reading her speech, any more than I would apologise to any other person, male or female, who contrary to Standing Orders was reading a speech.

I do not retreat from that position. I still maintain that that should be the right of every honourable senator. But if we are going to stick to Standing Order 406, let us stick to it rigidly and let there be no exceptions for so-called shadow Ministers. I cannot find any reference in the Standing Orders or in the Constitution to Shadow Ministers or, if it comes to that, to Ministers. We are failing in our duty under Standing Order 406 if we continue to allow it to go on . </PARA>

Forgive me; I may not have a complete grasp of the Queen's English on that word. But if we are to do that, we are stretching and are not sticking rigidly to Standing Order 406.

I had no intention of doing so this evening but for some of the arrogance, ignorance and intimidation which I have received from some of my colleagues, on both sides of the chamber, outside the chamber this evening on the discussion on this subject, and knowing that this matter was being raised by Senator Bonner. I am not aware of the circumstances that occurred this evening. I did not hear the debate or the matter as it was raised by Senator Bonner at the time, and I am in no position to comment on the circumstances of the senator in question on this matter, although I am very interested in the views that Senator Bonner has raised on this subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As you know, Mr Deputy President, I raised this matter by way of motion before I left this country recently, and the matter was brought on with everyone knowing that I had to leave to catch an aeroplane shortly after 4.30 p.m. on that day. I was able to make a very short speech on that occasion and very briefly to explain my views, after which I believe that the debate in this chamber went on for about two hours. I have since had the opportunity to read the debate, and to appreciate some of the contributions in that debate, such as that of Senator Peter Baume and, although I disagree with him, that of Senator Bonner-made without notes and with great eloquence on that occasion. I believe that there were many speeches in that debate that indicated how well people could speak without using notes, or using only very bare notes on that occasion.</PARA>
<PARA> However, some of the things said in that debate were absolutely ridiculous. I had no chance to reply to that debate. I have resented the fact that it was brought on at a time when I was unable to take part in it in any way, apart from making an initial statement, and finding that persons in the Senate proceeded to work on the basis that what I was arguing at that time was that people should not use notes-which I have never said and I never indicated for one moment that I believe. I believe that people are fully entitled to use notes and ought to use them. If they need to bring before the chamber some matter which requires great accuracy, they ought to have leave to incorporate matters in debate. I have never for a moment suggested the contrary. Yet the debate proceded on that occasion as though I were suggesting what someone described tonight as schoolboy oratory, just off the top of the head, with no notes, and so forth. That is something to which I have never suggested that the Senate should descend. </PARA>
<PARA> I must disagree with my colleague, Senator Bonner, in one respect particularly- that it is not a matter of all or nothing. It is not a matter of no one being able to read anything to this chamber or else all being able to do it. In the motion that I put forward some months ago I made exceptions in the case of Ministers who are putting down a second reading speech, where accuracy is needed with regard to explaining the clauses and the details of a Bill, and which will go a long way. But I would have objected equally strongly to Ministers making their replies on Bills by reading them. Likewise, I object to shadow Ministers making their replies not from copious notes-they may use those-but reading them so that debate does not ensue and so that people do not enter into the spirit of debate and do not respond to interjections. The things in which this Senate was at its glory in the past are now, I regret, in something of the sinking stage of debate in this chamber. They are losing some ground. </PARA>
<PARA> I have returned to this country, as the President well knows, but before I left , when I learnt the result of the debate on my motion, I made it very clear by writing to the President that I was prepared to fight whatever guerrilla warfare was necessary if the Standing Orders Committee did not take some action to properly enforce the Standing Order. I am told by some of my colleagues: 'You must not touch this matter because this Standing Order might be taken out'. If the Senate is so gutless, if its members are so unable to uphold their Standing Orders and the things for which this Senate has been gloried, so be it. It is not my doing; it is the doing of honourable senators. I do not believe for a moment that they would be prepared to see the Standing Order taken away so that we degenerate to the stage of the House of Representatives, where even last night Mr Armitage, a member of that House, pleaded that speeches should no longer be allowed to be read. There are persons in that House who recognise the degeneration of the standard of debate in that House. I do not believe that honourable senators would be prepared to go the same way. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said that I do not believe that this is a matter which has to be all or nothing. In the letter that I wrote to the President before I left this country, I said that I hoped and expected that the Standing Orders Committee would raise and consider this matter. I am aware that at its last meeting it did not have time to reach this item, and that it is on the agenda for the next meeting. I have not raised points of order against honourable senators since I have been back here and since we have resumed debate in this chamber. Yet I have noted with pleasure the number of honourable senators who have told me that they have ceased to read their speeches. They are no longer doing that. I welcome that. One notes the improvements and the interest that their speeches engender because of that very fact. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not sought to make this a matter of confrontation. I have sought and hoped that the Standing Orders Committee will become strong in this matter and will lay down the conditions under which people may be permitted to read speeches and under which they may not do so. I have already said that I think there are some circumstances in which it is necessary. There are always circumstances in which an honourable senator may appeal to his colleagues, saying, 'I wish to read this for a particular reason', and get leave to do that. These things can always be done by leave. I believe that there is a reasonable situation here. However, unless we act, unless we stop the arrogant reading of speeches which has been taking place in this chamber for the last 18 months, unless the Standing Orders Committee faces up to the responsibility that it has a Standing Order to obey and then the Presiding Officers from time to time carry it out and do not, with a smile, talk about copious notes when they know that what is being read is word for word, I shall certainly, if nothing is done, take point of order after point of order. I shall make all the efforts that I can under the Standing Orders to ensure that something is done. </PARA>
<PARA> I assure Senator Bonner that I shall be with him very strongly in that matter. But I hope that, before that, the Standing Orders Committee will have grasped this nettle and will have taken some sensible course. I say to my colleagues who are not present tonight but who have abused me outside the chamber that I shall not be intimidated in the course I have undertaken, because I believe that the Senate is worth fighting for and I shall fight for it to the bitter end. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir John Carrick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Some 350 decisions were taken in the context of the Review of Commonwealth Functions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) to (4) Of these 350 decisions, most have been implemented or are in the course of implementation by Ministers, under the general oversight of the Review of Commonwealth Functions Committee of the Cabinet. The most significant area where decisions are still being implemented relates to the disposal of assets. Where assets are being sold, there has been a need for negotiations with interested persons or bodies to take place in accordance with established tendering and sale procedures and this has proved time-consuming. The administrative and legal issues involved have had to be resolved in a way which satisfies the interests of the employees, the prospective owners and the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA> The facilities of the Australian Wool Testing Authority were transferred to a new private sector company which commenced operations on 1 July 1982. It is anticipated that there will be substantial progress in relation to the disposal of other assets over the next few months.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) to (6) Financial savings have been and will continue to be made as a result of the Review, both directly and also indirectly arising from those measures designed to contribute over time to the efficiency of government. In a previous reply to the honourable senator (see the reply to Senate Question Nos 1257-1282 in the Senate Hansard for 23 February 1982, pages 297-8) it was explained why precise figuring of the type sought on savings cannot be provided. The effects of Review decisions on Budget outlays are combined with those of other government decisions and with variations in other factors affecting expenditures . It is not practicable to separate out the financial effects of each of the many interacting influences on the financial estimates.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) I understand that the unauthorised access referred to in the honourable senator's question relates to access by means of a telephone to various computing facilities. Most of my Department's present computing facilities do not allow any telephone access at all and are therefore totally secure from this type of access. Very limited telephone access is possible to the central development computer. However, adequate controls exist over access to the limited data on this computer, viz:</PARA>
<PARA> Only a very small number of officers are approved for access by the telephone link.</PARA>
<PARA> Knowledge of the telephone number to gain access is restricted to these officers who must identify themselves by special 'log-on' procedures and passwords.</PARA>
<PARA> Most data held on the computer is in an abridged statistical form (minus personal identification information) and most items of information are held as coded values.</PARA>
<PARA> A major computer re-equipment program for my Department is now under way which will increase the accessibility to data by departmental officers. Safeguards to ensure the highest practicable level of security will be important considerations when choosing the new computing equipment.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) All practical safeguards are being employed and these are continually under review. No absolute guarantee can be given but procedures ensure that the chances of unauthorised access to usable data are so low as to be regarded as non-existent.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for the Capital Territory has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The building cost of $156m in May 1978 dollars was the figure provided by the winning architect in accordance with the competition conditions which required each competitor to provide 'a broad order of costs'. The competition assessors had the estimates generally reviewed by an independent cost planner and reported to the Authority that 'we are as satisfied as we can be at this stage that the Competition Winner's cost estimate is generally credible and realistic'. However the estimate is 'subject to detailed confirmation, and it may be that on further investigation and analysis, in consultation with the architect, there will prove to have been some areas of underestimation . . . it must be noted that several significant ''optional'' features of the design . . . '.</PARA>
<PARA> The Construction Authority in its report, tabled in the Senate on 21 August 1980, advised that it was 'essential that a realistic estimate of the cost of the building be established at this stage which recognises the extent of the scope of work portrayed by the conceptual models and drawings submitted and endeavours to anticipate what will ultimately be required when those concepts have been developed for the final construction and presentation of the building. ' To this end, 'intensive examination and discussions have taken place between the winning architects, the Authority's Project Manager and the selected Construction Manager, Cost Planner and Project Planner. As a result, the Authority is convinced that a realistic estimate of the cost to build the winner 's design concept is $220m at May 1978 prices'.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As reported to the Senate on 21 August 1980, there were a number of specific items which increased the $151m base price for a notional building. These were:</PARA>
<PARA> Increase in usable area by about 20 per cent over the design brief to allow for larger public and ceremonial areas and other spaces where future expansion would not be practical such as basement and service areas-$29m.</PARA>
<PARA> Underground car parking, not specified in original brief-$18m.</PARA>
<PARA> Site works and landscaping to implement the unique solution of the winning design, which relies on a landscaping rather than architectural concept for its success-$13m.</PARA>
<PARA> Energy saving devices to achieve substantial reductions in building operating costs-$5m.</PARA>
<PARA> Greater than anticipated areas devoted to ceremonial and public spaces demanded higher standard of finishes-$5m.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The budget for the building is updated to reflect the inflationary effects of movements in the cost of wages and materials specifically in the building industry in the Australian Capital Territory. The 'Australian cost of living index' referred to in the question does not equate to movements in the costs of building and is therefore an inappropriate means of updating the building budget .</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has adopted an index calculated independently by the Department of Transport and Construction as the basis for updating the building budget. This index is derived by measuring the actual variation in costs of a large number of representative building components and applying this aggregated factor to the building budget after deducting work completed. The index is therefore a measure of the real increase in building costs rather than an indication of general movements in prices.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The $370.4m budget at March 1982 prices reported to Parliament on 17 August 1982, is made up of the original $220m at May 1978 prices plus $141.5m for inflation based on the approved index, plus $8.9m for additional requirements previously approved by Parliament. The base building budget has been adjusted to reflect the approved variations and therefore there has been no price escalation in real terms.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Parliament House project receives regular and on-going scrutiny by both Houses through the Joint Standing Committee on the new Parliament House. Only where proposed changes are approved by the Committee and Government are they implemented by the Construction Authority. To date the changes approved by Parliament amount to less than 3 per cent of the building budget. Under this system it is Parliament which exercises strict control over the budget.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The estimated fees due to be paid to the Architects is $15.315m in March 1982 dollars.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The architects' fees will be paid to Mitchell/Giurgola and Thorp, Architects in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (9)-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Concrete Constructions Pty Limited is fully owned by Concrete Constructions Holdings Pty Limited, a company incorporated in the Australian Capital Territory and which has foreign ownership of 14.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) John Holland (Constructions) is a fully owned subsidiary of John Holland ( Holdings) Ltd. Ownership of the shares in the public company is almost exclusively in the hands of Australians, foreign ownership being less than 1 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) No foreign ownership obtains in the case of Rawlinson Roberts and Partners.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) No foreign ownership obtains in the case of the McLachlan Group.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) Yes. The figure foreshadowed the cost of providing items required for the fitting out of the building and not included in the building budget such as furniture, sound and vision broadcasting equipment, internal and external communications equipment, kitchen equipment, document/goods movement systems, waste disposal systems, security equipment, high voltage electrical equipment and artworks.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) $92.3m at March 1982 prices.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) The consumer price index would not be an appropriate measure of the effects of inflation on these items. The budget will be updated by an approved index calculated in a similar way to the building index but using factors which more accurately reflect movements in the cost of individual components which make up each non building item.</PARA>
<PARA> (13) As with the building budget, the budget for non building items will not increase in real terms except with the approval of Parliament and the Government .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 20 May 1982 (Hansard, page 2213) Senator McLaren asked the Minister for Finance the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Noting that the $121,700 appropriated in the Additional Estimates for the Department of Administrative Services for a mailing service for the Government Information Unit represents $2,300 a week, if it is for a whole year, I ask whether it is in fact for a whole year or for only part of a year. If it is not over a year, what is to be the weekly cost over a full year? I further ask whether her Department or any other Department will conduct any kind of effectiveness audit of this service?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government Information Unit provides a service whereby information papers relating to Government policies and programs can be distributed quickly following announcements to selected interest groups. Distributions are not on fixed or regular dates or to a constant number of recipients. Costs vary therefore from week to week. The year 1981-82 was the initial year of operation of the scheme and the requirement was difficult to anticipate. In the event an amount of $23,847 was expended between March and June 1982. The effectiveness of such mailings is kept under close review by the Government Information Unit and by the Department concerned. In general this may be judged by the number of people seeking further information. While this response varies, experience suggests that the service is greatly appreciated by recipients.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 September 1981 (Handard, page 560), Senator Bolkus asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate a question without notice concerning the collection of statistics on foreign investment in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Statistics does collect statistics relating to the inflow and level of foreign investment in Australia. These statistics are published on a quarterly basis. In addition to measuring the magnitude of flows and levels of investment, the statistics are classified in a variety of ways- principally by type of investment, country of investor and industry of investment.</PARA>
<PARA> Prior to 1978 the Bureau also compiled and published statistics on foreign ownership and control of industry sectors in Australia. In that year, following an assessment of relative priorities within the Bureau given available resources, a decision was taken by the Statistician, and supported by the Government, to discontinue the statistics on foreign ownership and control.</PARA>
<PARA> However, in a statement on 20 January 1982 concerning the outcome of a review of foreign investment policy by the Government, I indicated among other things that I had requested the Australian Bureau of Statistics to re-introduce the surveys measuring the extent of foreign ownership and control in sectors of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA> On 7 September 1982 the Acting Treasurer announced that the Statistician had examined a number of matters related to the resumption of the surveys. As a result of this examination, the ABS is to recommence a program of foreign participation studies. In order to retain simple and objective criteria for classifying companies, the concepts, definitions and measures used for the new series will be similar to those used in previously published statistics of foreign ownership and control. The main change will be that, as far as possible , separate aggregates will be published for naturalised and naturalising companies, and for joint Australian/foreign controlled enterprises, which would otherwise come within the statistical definition of foreign control. The first publication, which is planned for release in the second half of 1983, will relate to foreign ownership and control of the mining industry and selected minerals processing industries for the year ended 30 June 1982. Work will also be started on the preparation of foreign participation statistics for other sectors including manufacturing and possibly agricultural industries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 September 1982 (Hansard, page 919) Senator Siddons asked me a question without notice concerning the steel industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my reply to the honourable senator, I undertook to seek further information from my colleague the Minister for Trade and Resources regarding Taiwan and South Korea. The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided me with the information necessary to allow me to complete my answer to the honourable senator's question.</PARA>
<PARA> The facts supplied by the honourable senator concerning the import regimes in Taiwan and South Korea appear generally to be correct. While the import regimes established by Taiwan and South Korea provide for licensing of importers and controls on imports, it is worth noting that Australia's exports of iron and steel (excluding wastes and scrap) to Taiwan in 1981-82 (preliminary details only) were of the order of $15.5m as compared with our imports of these goods from Taiwan which approximated $4.4m.</PARA>
<PARA> During the same year our exports of these goods to South Korea were about 23. 3m compared with imports from that country of approximately $49.4m. This imbalance in favour of Korea being at least partly attritutable to Australia's cost disadvantages against that country in the world market.</PARA>
<PARA> If we have regard to Australia's exports of iron ores and concentrates to these countries which in 1981-82 amounted to about $32.7m for Taiwan and $83.4m for South Korea it becomes obvious that Australia has had a large surplus in its trade exchanges with the steel industries in those countries.</PARA>
<PARA> As was stated in the earlier answer to this question, the Government has pegged imports at 1981-82 levels. This accords the steel industry a breathing space during which its case for long-term assistance can be reported on by the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) and considered by the Government. In taking this action the Government was mindful of the potential cost implications for downstream users and for the economy as a whole, of any action which increased the price of steel.</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time the Government has set up a consultative body, the Steel Industry Council, including union, producer, user and importer representatives, to advise the Government on matters pertaining to the industry's viability and structure, employment aspects and future development. I am sure that honourable senators will all agree that Australia should be seeking to develop and efficient and profitable steel industry.</PARA>

<PARA> (a) Whether the Prime Minister consulted with the Victorian State Government before tabling the synopsis of the unpublished Costigan report?</PARA>
<PARA> (b) If he did not, what explanation can the Minister provide for the Prime Minister's action?</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has supplied the following information in answer to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA>
<PARA> Commissioner Costigan's letter of 6 September 1982, incorporated in Senate Hansard (pages 653-4) on 7 September at the time of tabling the edited Chapter 10 of the Royal Commission's Interim Report No. 4, outlined the background to the provision of that chapter in a form suitable for publication. Mr Costigan wrote to the Victorian Premier and me in response to requests from the two Governments for review of the recommendation that Volumes 2 and 3 of the Report be kept confidential, indicating that it was for the Governments to determine the extent of publication of Chapter 10.</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth officers were in contact with the Royal Commission prior to tabling the report and gained the impression, mistakenly it subsequently appears, that the Victorian Government had advised the Royal Commission of its agreement that the edited Chapter 10 be published.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 21 September Senator Watson (Hansard, page 1044) asked me a question without notice concerning the Conzinc Riotinto proposal for solution mining of gold. I asked my Department to give me information concerning the use of the cyanide process elsewhere and whether or not there are stringent rules regarding health.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised that the proposed CRA operation will be the first of its type in the world. My Department is not aware of any other operation in the world which uses in situ leaching techniques to mine gold. However, a similar technique using acid/alkaline solutions rather than cyanide has been used for many years in the in situ extraction of uranium in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA> Solution mining involves the pumping of chemical solutions into the ground via injection wells with the objective of dissolving certain metals. The process is controlled by varying the amount of solution extracted at the recovery wells and is monitored by means of a series of wells situated around the periphery of the extraction zone. The technique is safe provided it can be demonstrated that the chemical solutions introduced into the groundwater can be contained within the area of interest and recovered without permanently polluting the local groundwater.</PARA>
<PARA> In this context, CRA has reported that the groundwater at the Eastville site is almost stationary and that tests with dyes have indicated that solutions pumped into the aquifer can be contained within the defined areas and can be recovered when required.</PARA>
<PARA> CRA's field research at the Eastville site has been conducted under a Management Plan approved by the Victorian Minister for Mines and Energy and supervised by officials from his Department. Furthermore, a Preliminary Environmental Report on the proposed field trials using cyanide solutions has been prepared by CRA at the request of the Victorian Minister for Conservation and is available for public comment.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that following a period of public review, the Victorian Minister for Conservation will be preparing an Assessment Report for the Victorian Minister for Minerals and Energy. On the basis of such information the Victorian Government will take the final decision on whether solution mining for gold could proceed, if it were to prove economically viable.</PARA>

As to Mr Hall's legal costs in the proceedings for contempt of a royal commission, he may wish to make an application for legal aid to the Australian Legal Aid Office or to apply to the Attorney-General for legal or financial assistance. If he should make such an application it would be considered in accordance with the relevant directive and the means and needs test guidelines of the office or the relevant criteria for the provision of legal or financial assistance. I mention, however, that for many years it has been the practice of the ALAO not to grant aid to cover legal expenses incurred prior to the making of the application for legal aid. If Mr Hall makes an application it would be necessary for him to show that exceptional circumstances exist to justify a retrospective grant of aid or assistance.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 September 1982 (Hansard, page 922) Senator Teague asked me a question without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry in the Senate. His question concerned the elimination of water hyacinth, warehouse beetle, blue-green aphid and spotted alfalfa aphid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Water hyacinth, warehouse beetle, blue-green aphid and spotted alfalfa aphid are considered established in Australia to the point where eradication is not feasible. Consequently control measures are necessarily aimed at ensuring the economic costs of these pests are minimized as far as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> A biological control program was initiated to control water hyacinth in 1975. To date, two insects which feed on water hyacinth have been released and are well established in Australia. Currently, other insects which attack water hyacinth in South America, are being sought to extend the control already achieved, to a wider range of habitats in which the weed occurs.</PARA>
<PARA> The Standing Committee on Agriculture Consultative Committee on Warehouse Beetle decided at its last meeting in Gunnedah, New South Wales in July 1981 that the eradication attempt started in 1977 was no longer feasible, in view of new occurrences in New South Wales. It was decided that a control program funded jointly by the Commonwealth and States be co-ordinated by New South Wales to control warehouse beetle infestations in New South Wales, for a period of one year. The control program is currently underway and will terminate in December 1982, after which time control measures will be the responsibility of the State in which the infestation occurs.</PARA>
<PARA> The blue-green aphid and the spotted alfalfa aphid were detected in Australia in 1977. A combination of resistent lucerne varieties, insect parasites and predators, fungal pathogens, management practices and sprays have been employed to control lucerne aphids. In most regions, this combination of control measures, have reduced losses due to lucerne aphids to a fraction of those encountered when the aphids first arrived.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 23 September 1982 (Hansard, page 1192) Senator Lewis asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it a fact, as reported, that the Dumping Branch of the Department of Industry and Commerce currently has before it some 68 complaints from Australian industry and that notwithstanding the increased staff levels provided last year, inquiries are taking up to 12 months to resolve.</PARA>
<PARA> Will the Government give consideration to imposing some trade sanctions against countries dumping in Australia by imposing, say, import bans for a set period.</PARA>
<PARA> Will the Government also give consideration to contracting some of the investigatory work to private enterprise in order to speed up investigations during this period of economic recession.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> As at 7 October 1982 the Department of Industry and Commerce had 67 formal cases on hand, an increase of 36.7 per cent over the number on hand 12 months earlier. On 8 October 1982 the Public Service Board approved an additional 15 positions for the Dumping Branch. This increase should result in a further speeding up of completion of dumping complaints.</PARA>
