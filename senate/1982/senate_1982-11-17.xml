<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 7,269 citizens of Australia :</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That we wish to express our strongest opposition to any deregulation of trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That if trading hours are deregulated in the Australian Capital Territory the present restrictions on trading hours in other parts of Australia may be lifted.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Past performances have proven that longer trading hours do not lead to increased sales. However, they do increase costs, because shops have to be staffed for longer periods. To cover these increased costs, retailers are forced to increase prices and reduce staff levels. This means that longer trading hours increase both prices and unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. There is no real consumer demand for longer trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The deregulation of trading hours would force small Retail Companies out of business.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Extended trading hours would gravely disrupt weekend recreation and family life of shop assistants.</PARA>
<PARA>Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should: Ensure that retail trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory continue to be regulated by Ordinance as happened in the past.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 250 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that some single supporting parents are unfairly disadvantaged in having chosen to care for children full-time during the formative years, believing such care was essential to their well-being; and that women without dependent children, and who are under 50 years of age are not eligible for a continuing pension. These women have devoted their whole lives to their families and do not have skills relevant to the present employment situation. Their future prospects, with increasing age and length of time out of the workforce are a deterrent to employers. Skilled workers find it difficult to obtain employment and unskilled workers find it even more difficult. Unemployment benefit was not designed for long term usage and the low rate of payment plus the work tests over a long period of time lead to a general decline in the physical and mental health, with the result that the women are being placed on sickness benefits. Sickness benefits however, were also designed for short term usage and is unable to provide security for these women.</PARA>
<PARA>Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Amend the Social Services Act to reduce the age of eligibility for a Class B Widows Pension from 50 to 40 years; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Expand existing training schemes to include women taken off supporting Parents' Benefit.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Provide rehabilitation for women with disabilities which preclude them from the paid work force.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the most fundamental Human Rights, as per UN Charter and are guaranteed by the Constitution, have been cruelly disregarded in Yugoslavia and that the Serbian Orthodox Church is one of the most tragic and, up to now, silent victims .</PARA>
<PARA> The Clergy from the Tamnava Deanery in Yugoslavia, cry out ''OUR CHURCH DOES NOT LIVE ANY MORE,-IT MERELY EXISTS.'' 'Our children know nothing of Christ, because we are not allowed to teach them'. Any attempt in this direction ends in interrogation and persecution of both the children and clergy.</PARA>
<PARA> In an open letter directed to the Yugoslav Presidium and the President of Serbia, the Serbian Orthodox clergy from all over Yugoslavia appeal for an investigation into planned and meditated, 20-year genocide of everything Serbian in the Kosovo region.</PARA>
<PARA> Some 100,000 Serbians have had to flee from their homes. Old monasteries, churches, and graves have been desecrated, destroyed or burned down. People have been harassed, attacked and some have been killed. Criminal offences have been committed against Orthodox students and monastics.</PARA>
<PARA> The petitioners therefore respectfully ask that the Commonwealth Government through their Minister of Foreign Affairs makes a strong protest and representation to the Yugoslav Government asking for protection against persecution of Serbian population of Kosovo region and guarantees of basic human rights, and in particular freedom and practising of Orthodox religion in Yugoslavia.</PARA>

<PARA> Our opinion on paper: That ever since the early seventies, high interest rates of staggering magnitude have made a complete mockery of justice, unparalleled in our time. Resulting in the elimination of employment on a vast scale, in every phase of production causing house ejections, with mind effects and mental disturbances, leading to interrupted education, road toll and social disruption.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Great Barrier Reef is unique and is included on the World Heritage List.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act was to create a marine park to provide for the proper protection and management of The Reef, only 14 per cent of the total area defined in this Act as the Great Barrier Reef Region has been declared marine park.</PARA>
<PARA> The only insurance against an oil drilling blowout in Reef waters is to prohibit oil drilling in the Region and its vicinity.</PARA>
<PARA> This can only be effected by declaring the whole area of the Region a marine park under the above legislation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators are aware the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances deals with technical matters on the Senate's behalf. The Committee realises its responsibility to inform the Senate of reasons for its actions, both when notices of disallowance are being given and when the Committee decides to withdraw its notices. However, the detail which has to be given when making these statements not only tests the patience of all honourable senators, including me, but frequently means that the explanation is not understood. In future, therefore, as a general practice I propose to seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a detailed statement of explanation, which honourable senators may subsequently read if they are concerned about it, and also to give a brief explanation to the chamber which I hope will enable honourable senators to understand what I have been talking about. This ordinance has a somewhat Monty Pythonesque name of the Plumbers, Drainers and Gasfitters Board Ordinance 1982. The Committee has some concern about notification of appeal rights to persons affected by a decision by the Board to cancel or suspend a licence. The purpose of this notice is simply to preserve the Committee's rights while awaiting advice from the Minister. I seek leave to have a more detailed statement incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Regulations and Ordinances Committee has asked the Minister for the Capital Territory whether notification of a right of appeal will routinely be made to all persons affected , and awaits the Minister's advice on the matter. As today is the last day for giving notice of disallowance, the Committee has given such notice to protect its rights while awaiting the Minister's response.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. In the current public debate on the Government's proposed wages freeze some critics are recalling the experience of a similar move in 1977.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I pointed out that there is widespread interest, and indeed active measures are being taken, by ordinary individuals in the community to ensure that they do not, by their own seeking of higher wages, disemploy others. Perhaps the best answer that can be given as to the justification for what is being done today is in the editorial of the Australian Financial Review of today. It is important to understand what that editorial states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no way city populations-and that means everybody, not just the blue collar union members-can continue to increase their real incomes in the face of the situation facing Australia in 1983. One way or another, belt-tightening is inevitable. If it isn't imposed by a Government wages freeze it will be imposed by a collapse in employment as the jobless percentage heads into double figures and wages claims disappear as employees cling with increasing desperation to their existing jobs.</PARA>
<PARA> The editorial goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The need now is to divert sufficient income from the well off employed majority to those who are unemployed, or about to be so, while maintaining overall demand at levels sufficient to avoid further downward multiplier effects on employment prospects.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not an alternative simply to suggest larger deficit finance, or huge additional expenditures, as France's Francois Mitterrand found out the hard way when four-fifths of his expansionary stimulus leaked away into imports, leaving France with the resulting inflation but not much in the way of employment stimulus.</PARA>
<PARA>The situation now is far more urgent than in 1977. In 1977 the world recession had not bitten so hard on Australia. In the last six months the overseas recession has very markedly reduced exports from Australia and has cut down, therefore, on our capacity for employment. If we are to continue to employ people we must stop the upward surge of wages and in fact by so doing carry out what the Australian Financial Review says is inevitable, unless we are to disemploy more people.</PARA>

I am not sure whether the figures quoted by Senator Button are accurate. I can check up on those. I will certainly get further information on those countries. Australia, on the other hand, has had its real wages running very considerably ahead of inflation for quite some time. The main thing, as indeed the Australian Financial Review makes clear, is for us to bear down on inflation. I repeat that Mr Hayden made it clear when he was Treasurer that if one wants to stop unemployment one must bear down on inflation; that upward surges of costs create more unemployment. I repeat also that the essential situation is that the majority of costs ultimately are wages. If we want to reduce costs we must have wage restraint. I commend not just one but the three or four answers that I gave yesterday on this question as to the picture. What I have said in effect is that the countries of Western Europe- facing very high inflation indeed, in some cases inflation twice as high as that in Australia-have embarked upon a policy of wage restraint in order to combat unemployment. That is a principle identical with the one outlined by the then Labor Treasurer, the now Labor Leader, Mr Hayden, and I commend it.</PARA></TALK.START>

I invited the Senate to look at a series of questions and supplementary questions, the totality of the answer being what I have just said, which is that the countries of the OECD, facing inordinate unemployment and then inflation, have in fact called upon their people for major wage restraint because by wage restraint they would get down inflation. Having got inflation down they would then be taking the first steps towards re- employment. As yet they have not been able to get to a point where the recession has bottomed and re-employment can occur. In every country of the free world there is a recognition that the first thing to do to overcome unemployment and prepare for the future is to get costs down.

Since to most Australians it is a matter of simple common sense that we should not go on spending money that we do not have on imports at an ever increasing rate, will the Minister undertake to put to Cabinet a simple proposition to introduce and pass next week a Bill to amend the Industries Assistance Commission Act 1973 so that the Government can re-assume the power it lost under the Whitlam Government to impose import quotas at any time our international insolvency demands that this action be taken? To ensure that such a move has the greatest national impact will the Minister responsible seek Australian Labor Party support for the amendment before it is introduced so that it can have the unanimous support of all parties in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some months ago the Government made a decision not to reduce protection even though it had a series of recommendations from the Industries Assistance Commission before it. The Government has decided to maintain the present levels of protection. The Government faces the situation where one of the troubles in the world in the restriction of trade has been increased protection; countries are putting up walls around themselves and, therefore, not giving opportunities to countries such as Australia to trade. The desirable thing would be, as in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade discussions, to have a world in which people put down their barriers. But it is a real world at this moment and the Government does not intend to accept the IAC 's recommendations regarding lowering protection.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I cannot be precise about the proportion of increases in prices that could be attributed to wages. I think it is obvious that included in prices are the costs of materials and labour and the profit that is expected to be returned on the investment. In measuring the effect of wages, we are aware-I think I quoted this figure earlier this week-that, in the 12 months to September, the adult male wage increased by about 18 per cent. If one combines that with the reduction of hours that took place at the same time and looks at the decrease in hours that have been worked, one would be looking at a figure close to 20 per cent over that 12 month period. During the same period, the consumer price index rose by about 12 per cent. So one surely has a self-evident fact that there is a big component of wage effect in that increase in the CPI. Senator Jessop, in the second part of his question, asked about the timing of the effect of a wages freeze. I think that also would be difficult to be precise about because what we are looking at, in current economic circumstances, is a return to profitability for some enterprises that are unable to continue because of lack of profitability. It would, therefore, be some time before the effect of the wages freeze on increases would be evident.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third part of the honourable senator's question related to whether we were talking only about the public sector wage increases. It was made clear in the statement initially made by the Acting Prime Minister that we would hope to see public and private sector wages show this restraint on increases, probably for a 12 month period; that matter would be discussed at the forthcoming Premiers Conference. If we are to look at the advantages that would come from a wages freeze on increases it would need to have effect in the private sector as well as in the public sector. The effect of the restraint in the public sector would be, in our terms of the proposal, simply to release funds that could be made available for spending and for providing employment opportunities, whereas the restraint in the private sector would enable many businesses to return to profitability or to continue to trade and manufacture. So, the short answer to the last part of the question is that it is envisaged that the private and the public sectors would be involved in any proposed restraint on wage increases.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an interesting situation that when Senator Mason asks the question members of the Opposition welcome the answer, but when a Government senator asks the question apparently they do not. The fact is that I very well recall the Rooseveltian era. I was both a high school student and a young economics student at the time, so I am very well aware of the New Deal, the National Recovery Act, the Agricultural Adjustment Act and the slogan 'We do our part'. I understand that. What I said the other day and what I repeat is this: One cannot compare the major Depression of the 1930s with today's recession. The fact is that in those days there was a negative interest rate and negative inflation. There was gross unemployment. I repeat that there was no inflation and no rising interest rates. In fact, interest rates were touching the floor. It was virtually impossible to lend money. Today we have an entirely different situation. It is quite different from the Keynesian era. After all, members of the Opposition are again knocking their own leader. Honourable senators will remember that their leader in his Budget Speech as Treasurer said that we were no longer in the Keynesian era. The Keynesian era was an era in which there was gross unemployment, low interest rates and low inflation. Fundamentally one cannot compare the two eras. In Australia we are trying to prepare ourselves so that when the recession dissipates Australia will be ready in terms of skills and job experience to seize that opportunity. We are asking for a forgoing of wage increases to stop further unemployment and to create job opportunities. We are saying that at the government level we should be able to make available some $700m worth of new job creation without putting pressure on the deficit, and in the private sector some billions of dollars should be made available for job creation if wage restraint is exercised in that sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a very sensible approach in an era which is entirely different from Rooseveltian times. The Rooseveltian times demanded that there should be huge increases in the American deficit to finance various projects. I emphatically make it clear that, as the Australian Financial Review said this morning, if we increase the deficit we will increase inflation and unemployment. It is no use members of the Australian Labor Party laughing. They are sneering once again at their leader. Mr Hayden, as Treasurer, made it abundantly clear-he is on record in Hansard-that increasing the deficit would increase inflation and unemployment . He said that bearing down on inflation and costs would rectify unacceptably high unemployment. That is precisely what we are aiming at doing.</PARA>

I am sure that this view is overwhelmingly supported in Australia, but no comparably clear statement has been made about our attitude to the Palestinians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Government believes that a resolution of the Palestinian issue is central to the future stability and peace of the Middle East and the long term security of all states in the region. The Government believes that a comprehensive settlement of Middle East problems should be based on the principles expressed in United Nations Security Council resolution 242: That is, recognition of the right of Israel and other states in the area to live in peace within secure and recognised boundaries and withdrawal of Israel from territories captured in 1967. Such a comprehensive settlement should also be based on recognition of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, including their right to a homeland alongside Israel, with the corresponding responsibility to live in peace with their neighbours, together with the right to participate directly in decisions affecting their future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has welcomed and supported President Reagan's initiative, which seeks to reconcile Israel's legitimate security rights with the legitimate rights of the Palestinians and to bring the parties involved into direct negotiations. It is, as well, pleased to note that the recent Arab proposals from the summit meeting at Fez also support the goal of a negotiated settlement. The major significance of these initiatives, as well as of the Venice declaration of the European Council in 1980, is that while they contain specific proposals which may not be acceptable to one or other of the parties, in general terms they all favour a negotiated settlement. The Australian Government believes that the very fact that negotiations are envisaged as an essential element if a settlement is to be attained makes it inappropriate for Australia to pronounce on the specific terms for such a settlement. It believes that these should be negotiated directly by the parties principal to the dispute.</PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of Jerusalem, Australia, along with many other governments, has supported long-standing United Nations resolutions calling for an international regime for the city with appropriate protection for the holy places. However, as the question that has been raised today implies, the status of Jerusalem is one of the most sensitive matters in dispute between the parties to the Middle East conflict. It is difficult to envisage that the comprehensive political settlement that we all hope for in the Middle East would not, among other things , address the question of the status to be given to the city of Jerusalem. The Australian Government believes that whatever should be agreed for Jerusalem should give adequate protection for access to the holy places.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I were convinced before of Senator Evans's capacity in either economics or law, I have the proof now. It is no wonder that Mr Hayden 's judgment is as it is; it is one judgment with which I concur. The fact of the matter is that Australia's export industry is based upon two main elements. It is based upon the mining and extracting industry and the farming industry which, on the most recent figures, make up something like 90 per cent of our export industry. Everybody knows that volume and price of minerals have fallen off. Hardly a day goes by without there being a story to the effect that a country such as Japan has cut back on its imports of minerals. Hardly a day goes by without our hearing the same basic story about bauxite, alumina or aluminium. The fact that the honourable senator is taking a narrow figure of a particular kind does not refute the situation. I would have thought that he also would have known that the farming community itself is facing for the future an enormous problem. With the exception of about one State, it is facing the virtual collapse of its cereal crops. It is also facing lowering prices, particularly in respect of beef, on world markets. Australia's exports in quantity and in price have declined substantially and that depressive factor is primarily responsible for Australia's inability to employ.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All the figures in the world quoted from some statistical situation cannot get away from the fact that the world is in absolute glut in respect of iron ore, that in fact the free world has an excess of something like 100 million tonnes in steel making capacity and an inability to sell steel. There is, of course, the clear evidence of the problem at the Portland alumina smelter. There is the clear evidence of smelters all around the place incapable of being put into production because there is no demand. That is absolutely elementary. We see evidence of that day after day. It is also elementary to look at the agricultural products. I repeat that the fundamental reason for Australia's recession is that overseas countries are not buying goods at reasonable prices from Australia in terms of the volume of goods and the prices they were paying for them before. Of course, they are not investing in Australia as readily as they were before. That is the basis of the recession.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not see any such statement by my colleague, so I cannot comment on that. I want to make it quite clear, without qualification, that the Government intends to maintain its import parity pricing policy. It would be the greatest folly on earth if anything were done at this time to lower the incentives and the stimuli for people to seek alternative fuels. As we come out of the recession we will be facing a world in which oil prices will inevitably rise again. In Australia, unless we can find more oil, unless we can get alternative energy sources, we will be hindered very greatly in our capacity to expand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Import parity pricing has enabled us to span this decade so that it looks now as though there will be very little fall, if any, in the level of the indigenous supply of oil in this decade. That in itself is a massive benefit to Australia. If we were to lower the stimulus we would be in trouble. There is already some falling off in the unprecedented level of exploration and development drilling for oil in Australia, naturally because of world recessive tendencies. It would be bad for Australia if we added any further disincentive. I want to make it clear that we will persist with import parity pricing. In any case we must make it perfectly clear that, as to some 30 per cent of our oil which is derived from overseas, the foreign exchange commitments and the increased freight rates will have to be paid for. Therefore, in fact, consideration of those kinds of prices will prevail whenever we re-assess oil pricing.</PARA>

I repeat: It would be the quintessence of folly if we were now to reduce the incentive to people to find more oil or gas or to reduce the incentive to get away from oil and on to substitute fuels. It would be folly because the greatest threat to this country in the years to come will be with its ability to provide petroleum products and alternatives to petroleum products . This policy has worked and is working extremely well indeed. One in every four wild-cat wells drilled at this moment is producing results. That is excellent in world terms.

I am not aware of the actual figures that he cited, but I accept that there has been a change in the composition of the work force and that at the lower end of the working wage scale there has been a reduction in numbers which would be reflected in a reduction overall at some later time. The figures I mentioned were for average, ordinary time earnings, not including overtime, for adult males which to September showed an 18 per cent increase. That figure stands on its own. I was not drawing anything more from it other than to say that there were people in the community at this time of high unemployment who had an increase of 18 per cent. This figure, combined with the reduction in wages which a large proportion of workers undoubtedly had, reveals a 20 per cent increase in wages for some part of the work force.</PARA></TALK.START>

Perhaps in those circumstances we ought to talk about some way in which we will be able to make an improvement in employment opportunities for those who have lost jobs or have no opportunities for commencing employment and, at the same time, look to those who have had large increases to see what share of the burden they would accept in the forthcoming 12 months.

If we can use everything that we use with more cost efficiency we will be in a better position to get inflation down and increase our level of trade. Specifically, energy, in a world sense, is of enormous importance and scarcity. I point out that my Department and I are very active indeed in this area. We have proven quite clearly that it is possible in ordinary existing homes to obtain a 20 per cent to 30 per cent saving in energy by very simple, costless methods.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose this is recycling a matter that has been discussed on a number of occasions in the Senate; but, in a sense, I want to deal with the particular responses of the Government in the last week which have taken the form of a proposed wage pause that has been described by a number of newspaper editorials and other commentators as a stunt and a gimmick. I say at the outset that, when one looks at this Government's record, there is reason for that scepticism. When one looks at its ill fated wage-price freeze of 1977 or the resources boom of 1980 which was to be a cure for unemployment in Australia-creating tens of thousands of jobs, in the words of the Treasurer (Mr Howard)-one sees that the suggestion ought to be made to the Government that with this response it is not responding in any real sense to the real challenge which faces Australia's economy at present. Rather, there is a lapse, to use Mr Michael Baume's words, into appearing to be doing something about unemployment. That is the essence of the recent announcement of the Government. What we have, of course, is a mish mash of hastily drafted concepts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply summarise the Government's proposition announced by the Acting Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, on Monday in these terms: First of all, we will freeze Public Service wages for one year. That will save an estimated $700m. We will use that money to create jobs. Those jobs will presumably be created in the public sector because I do not see how public servants' money can be used to create jobs in the private sector. If we create jobs in the public sector with this money it is flying in the face of everything this Government has said in the seven years it has been in office. Then, in addition to freezing wages in the public sector, we will hope that the private sector will follow suit. In respect of those persons in the community whose incomes are unable to be controlled by any Government mechanism-that is, professional income earners and so on-we will again hope that they will follow suit and that there will be some freeze on their wages. At the end of that process, we will see what happens. If nothing happens, we can blame the State Governments, overseas factors, trade unions or the Public Service. That is the traditional abandonment of intellectual responsibility in which this Government always indulges in the face of the continued failure of its policies. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point at the beginning that, when we talk about lowering incomes in real terms, we are talking about the incomes of thousands of Australian families who are concerned about the day to day problems of buying food and clothing and of paying off mortgages at a time when interest rates in this country are higher than they have ever been. So we should not talk lightly about lowering incomes. We should look at it in the context of overall government strategy and recognise its real importance-the lowering of incomes to Australian families. In singling out wages as the cause of all the unemployment problems which this country now faces, and to a lesser extent overseas factors, the Government is indulging in simple minded sloganeering, an over-simplification of very difficult problems. I do not retreat from the fact that both wages and overseas factors are relevant to the competitive position of Australia. They are also relevant to unemployment but they must be seen in the context of a wide range of factors that are relevant to employment. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has to face up to the fact that there has been a long term decline in manufacturing employment in Australia. It is sometimes said that manufacturing is the major employment area, but that is no longer so. There has been a decline of 7 per cent in manufacturing employment since 1965. New jobs have been created in Australia, but in manufacturing industry there has been a continual decline in the number of people employed. The Government cannot say in 1982 that wages are responsible for the collapse of the Australian steel industry. They are not. It cannot say that the advance of technology in industry has not been a factor in unemployment in Australia. Of course it has. The Government's own committee, the Myers Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia, found that. What did the Government do with that committee' s report? It put it in a pigeon-hole. We have not heard of it since it was published. </PARA>
<PARA> Another factor which is relevant to employment is the wide age spread of people who are involved in employment in Australia from 16 to 65. In Japan and other countries with much lower levels of unemployment the spread in the work force is from about age 20 to about age 60 at the most. These are long term considerations relating to declining employment in Australia. Of course the more immediate things which have produced the dramatic decline in employment in Australia are the collapse of consumer demand, the total collapse of consumer confidence to spend money and, of course, the collapse of the resources boom which was heralded in 1980, prior to the last election, as being the saviour of Australia's employment problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I argue to the Senate that the problems of the Australian economy are profound. If one seeks to say that all those problems are caused by one factor, namely wages, one runs into the danger described, I think, quite graphically by an American Congressman when he said: 'You run the danger that the light at the end of the tunnel will turn out to be an oncoming train'. That is the position with this Government. The light at the end of the tunnel about which Mr Anthony spoke on Monday could well turn out to be an oncoming train. What happens at the end of the wages pause? We all know what happens at the end of wages pauses in Australia. There is an explosion of wage demands. But what happens if, at the end of the wages pause, there is no visible effect on the unemployment situation in Australia? What does one say then? One says exactly the same as one said about the resources boom which was to produce thousands and thousands of jobs. All sorts of factors intervened and it went away. That is what might happen here , and it is a matter about which I wish to caution the Government in relation to its suggested strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to face up to the fact that Australia, in 1982, has a negative growth rate. That is revealed in the Budget Papers. Australia is one of the few countries-perhaps the only country other than Britain-of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which have a negative growth rate. It is certainly the only country in the OECD which has had the twin successes of achieving high levels of inflation and unemployment at the same time. Indeed, no other country in the Western world has succeeded in having at the same time high levels of inflation and of unemployment. Some countries have high inflation and low unemployment, but no other country in the OECD has achieved, at the same time, anything like the same levels of inflation and unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> Another point to remember is that Australia has the highest interest rates of any country of the OECD. Also, this Government has no wages policy. That is a very important factor to bear in mind when considering what is wrong with this country at this time. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard tables showing inflation and unemployment rates in OECD countries for the period 1977 to 1982. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Mr Anthony's statement of Monday sought to lay the blame for Australia's economic troubles on the dramatic wage rate increases of recent times. I wish to make a few points about that. At the very best we have to make a proper assessment of what has happened in relation to wages in Australia on a truly annual basis rather than on the basis of the last six months. The figures Mr Anthony has used indicate a tendency for wage increase rates to fall in the last six months, from a high point in March 1982. If the Government had any sense of policy consistency it should have taken action in March 1982, or earlier, to deal with the wage rate explosion which occurred in the final quarter of 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The present wage freeze is indicative of total ad hockery in this regard. In fact, the Government's own Budget Papers show that real wage increases occurred in December 1981 and in the first quarter of 1982. I assert that they all occurred because of the abandonment by the Government in mid-1981 of any pretensions to a wages policy and a centralised wage fixation system. When, in July of 1981, wage indexation went out the window the wages explosion developed and many unions caught up, in six months, what they had lost since this Government came to power. That was the economic disaster for this country. As Mr Peacock, a Minister in the present Government put it, this Government has no wages policy. That is what he said at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not assert for a moment that wages are not of some significance in terms of our competitive position and of employment, but the figures used by Mr Anthony to show increases in real wages are from the Bureau of Statistics average weekly earnings series-by no means an unchallenged source. Indeed, serious doubts have been cast upon it. Senator Tate earlier today cast doubts upon it in a question which he put to Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. The National Institute of Labour Studies Incorporated, of Flinders University, publisher of the authoritative Australian Bulletin of Labour, takes serious issue with the ABS figures. It points out that the average weekly earnings series is a poor measure of wages growth during a period when labour is being shed and the composition of the employed work force is changing. The ABS figures measure wages growth on average but do not take into account the fact that lower paid workers are dropping into the unemployment pool and their lower wages are no longer being taken into account in assessing the average. It points out also that other, better, guides could be adopted. The Institute argues that only a 13 per cent increase in earnings growth has occurred over the last 12 months; that, given the current 12.4 per cent rate of inflation, wages in Australia have followed the OECD pattern exactly-they have done little more than keep pace with inflation. They have not increased to anything like the extent which the present government, by plucking odd figures out of the air, claims. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a great deal of talk about wages becoming so high that productivity and profits are affected. Mr Anthony and Senator Sir John Carrick would like to say that this is the reason we are in economic trouble, that the sole problem is wages. But let us look at the Government's own figures. I invite honourable senators who are concerned to understand this matter to look at the Government's own figures at page 28 of Budget Paper No. 1 for 1982-83. That table shows that real unit labour costs measured 108 in the index in 1976-77. This figure is derived from dividing average weekly labour costs by average labour productivity . For the second half of 1981-82 the figure is exactly the same, 108. An examination of the period 1976 to 1982 reveals that real unit labour costs have not changed significantly over the period. In other words, labour costs relatively no more than it did in 1976 in terms of wage costs and productivity. The real reason that jobs are being lost in Australia is that demand is low and consumers have no confidence. Demand is low because of restrictive Government policies. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time available I want to deal with the mythology of increasing wage rates and unemployment. I have said, and I repeat, that I do not say that there is no relationship between the two-there is. I think there is a much stronger relationship between claims for a 35-hour week and unemployment, which should be taken account of by the unions. What has happened in this country, of course, is that the real wages of income groups below the average did not increase between 1976 and 1981. The labour resources study to which I referred goes to August 1981, but I think the figures are still very relevant to this point. What it shows is that a person in a category of above average weekly earnings had a significant increase in real wages between 1976 and 1981, but a person on average weekly earnings had a minus 1.2 per cent real increase during that period. A person on below average weekly earnings, for example on the bottom salary level, had a minus 11.4 percent increase during that period. What I am saying is that we cannot look at the whole picture and just say that wages have increased. Wages have increased in real terms for the wealthy; they have not increased in real terms for the low income earners. I seek leave to incorporate that table in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What has happened in this country in the last seven years is that the burden of taxation has shifted from the wealthy section of the community to the poorer section of the community and the burden of income has shifted in favour of the wealthy section as against the poorer section. That is what that table shows. When we talk about average weekly earnings we must look at who is below the average. That is where the unemployment is and that is where wage increases have not kept pace with inflation. It is the higher groups whose wages have gone up, but the benefits have gone through tax. This contributes to lower demand because the propensity is for lower income earners to spend more. I ask honourable senators to look at that table as proof of what I have been trying to advance by way of argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My argument is that in the longer term the relationship between increasing real wages and unemployment is very doubtful. I invite honourable senators who are concerned and interested in this subject matter to read discussion paper No. 47 of May 1982 by Dr Bob Gregory of the Australian National University Centre for Economic Policy Research. I summarise his conclusion, which is documented in the paper. Dr Gregory said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that there is no stable relationship between wage increases and the level of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>He charts that in a graph showing wage increases going up and the level of unemployment going in a different direction. I invite honourable senators to look at that paper because it is a very important and thoughtful paper on the question of the relationship between wages and unemployment. Low labour demand is caused by low demand for output and the way to increase output is to stimulate demand by putting money into the hands of more people. I notice the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) nodding his head about this. He prefers to believe the simple slogan that Australia's problems are due to wages and overseas factors. It is a beaut political slogan for the Government to be able to say that. What I have tried to do is analyse whether or not it is right.</PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning of my remarks the economic situation of this country is too serious now for us to play politics of the old poll, Malcolm Fraser kind. One cannot go on finding glib political solutions to an enormously difficult economic situation. If one goes on trying to find glib political solutions one will run out of steam after six months or nine months and one will be no further forward in terms of tackling the real problems. That is a very real danger which I fear regarding this Government's purported solutions to this country's current economic difficulties. They are not simple problems and there are no simple solutions. A lot of hard facts will have to be faced up to. It is no good facing up to hard facts and difficult times by mouthing simple-minded cliches and slogans about the nature of the problems which this country faces. I commend these matters to serious thought in the Senate rather than sloganeering of a kind which will no longer work for this country and which will send us further and further down the hit parade of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development countries in terms of our standard of living and our industrial performance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Notwithstanding the somewhat extravagant language of the matter of public importance that has been proposed today, the Government welcomes the opportunity of discussing the announcement made last Monday in regard to a wages freeze or pause being embarked upon by the Government at the present time. Clearly, there are difficulties in implementing any kind of incomes freeze or pause at a time when the Federal Government does not possess the constitutional power to deal effectively with these matters at all levels within the States. Clearly, there is a need for the co-operation of the States at all levels working with the Federal Government to achieve a reasonable approach in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button in his remarks acknowledged quite clearly to us all that he regards I think as a critical factor the effects of wages upon the community and upon the economic development of Australia. I would like to develop that theme a little more as this debate proceeds today. First of all, I think we should address our minds to one or two of the background questions that have existed in this country for some time. There can be no question that for some years Australia has been insulated from the world recession by strong growth that has been directly related to our own mineral and other capital development projects. During the last few years we have seen very high levels of unemployment in the United Kingdom. For instance, I believe that in the last three years that level has been in the order of 13 per cent. In Canada it has been over 12 per cent and in the United States of America over 10 per cent. This is compared in recent times with an unemployment rate in this country of around 6 per cent. Clearly Australia has been doing relatively well. Surely that is no sign of economic collapse as has been alluded to by the Opposition in its matter of public importance. I will deal with the Government's response to this matter at a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go a little further to discover some of the real points at issue in this debate. The world recession was brought about, generally speaking, by a decline in demand by the Western world and particularly for products of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries on world markets. This, of course, has been brought about over a long period through gradual change in the shifts of economic power between the Western nations and the East Asian bloc. Clearly, this has affected our position insofar as we supply minerals and other raw materials to the countries that are dealing in this kind of manufacturing throughout the world. Consequently there has been a very severe effect and in more recent times, as the recession has gathered pace overseas, a downturn in our capacity to sell our products on world markets. Incomes and activity were declining from external causes causing not only unemployment in this country but also reduced, I believe, the level of incomes in this country in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the contributing factors-again Senator Button does not deny the existence of this fact-is that there has been a very significant rise in incomes in this country. It is quite clear that over time incomes have outstripped the rate of inflation and there have been real increases in wages in recent times. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that point in a moment. There was not only the question of direct labour rates but also the question of workmen's conditions generally. We know of the wage package that was settled by the metal trades with the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union and other metal workers unions only 12 months ago. This resulted in an overall net increase in labour costs of the order of 22 per cent. That entailed not just pure raw wage increases but workers' conditions were somewhat severely affected by the reduction of the working week. Other things were involved in that package also which led to a significant rise in labour costs. With the rises in labour costs come further increases in things such as workers compensation insurance costs and other matters that relate directly to the employment of individuals. We are talking about not only labour costs or wage costs but the whole gamut of labour costs relating to wages, salaries and other incomes which is at question here. This is a matter about which Senator Button seeks to mislead us in the Senate today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button has limited his argument to the area of wages and argues that it is only those at the lower end of the wages scale who have suffered. We have to acknowledge that, unfortunately, those at the lower end of the wages scale have, in fact, not done as well as those at the upper levels. One of the reasons-the chief reason probably-why that is so is the existence of wage indexation as it applied from 1975 until 1981. That produced a situation where those automatically at the bottom end of the wages structure were not going to be compensated so well as those at the upper end and that is a direct result of the Australian Labor Party policy which was put in place in 1975 by the then Labor Government. It is a matter which has been argued against year after year by this Government in various wage tribunals. That is a truth. It relates directly to the point raised by Senator Button which cannot be accepted as a truth in this matter. On both those points Senator Button's argument falls to the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to one or two other matters relating to the question of wage costs. Senator Button rightly drew our attention to the fact that there have been changes in the wage structure within Australia. He pointed out that in 1976 the index-he chose to quote from the Budget Papers; I have not had time to check them, but I assume he is correct-applying in 1976 was 108. He made the point that the index applying in 1982 is 108; in other words, there has been no change in real unit labour costs in the last six years. What he did not tell us was that in December 1976 there was a 17 1/2 per cent devaluation of the currency. The effect of that on our competitive structure overseas at that time was enormous. We have a clear example of that in the boost which it brought to our exports during the subsequent years from 1977 to 1981. Senator Button failed to mention those points. Instead he chose to make narrow debating points by quoting such authorities in order to draw our attention away from the real issues which are before us in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> In this time of very real concern, when there is quite clearly rising unemployment resulting from a lack of product demand overseas for our produce and when there has been a rapid fall in our competitive position brought about by rising labour costs-I use that generic term, not just the narrow one of wages and/or other incomes but the associated costs as well-we need to address clearly the fundamental problems. How can Senator Button or any Opposition honourable senator claim today that that fundamental approach to which this Government is endeavouring to bring some conclusion is in some way superficial or hollow, as the terms of the matter of public importance indicate? One would have thought that Senator Evans, in his usual extravagant way, had written the words of the motion. Perhaps the Australian Labor Party has resorted to using its advertising agents to word motions for debate in this place. It is clear that these are fundamental issues. They are the ones which this Government is seeking to attack . The problems of dealing with those issues are enormous. We know that there are constitutional difficulties. We know that there are difficulties in dealing with the States, particularly those of different political complexions. Those matters have emerged in the last few days. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has accepted that challenge and is calling a Premiers Conference to bring the Premiers together to discuss the incomes of public employees, not only those who are employed by the Commonwealth, but also those who are employed at the State and local government levels. By virtue of the influence which the States have in their own areas, the Government is endeavouring to bring those in the private arena into an agreement whereby incomes can be further controlled. This is an operation designed to bring consensus in Australian society-not division. There is clearly an opportunity and a challenge for this country to grasp the fundamental issues, face them and determine jointly a policy which will achieve the desired end. Clearly, this is the issue which is before us and this Government. It is an issue which this Government had the courage to grasp and was put down in a clear and unequivocal statement by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) last week. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no way in which we can easily buy ourselves out of trouble. It is true that some Premiers see it that way. I will deal with those matters a little later. Firstly, I will round off the major point. None of us in this country can exist unless we establish a more competitive base for our industry. Our whole industrial base-whether it be the tertiary sector, the secondary sector or whatever-revolves around the question of our being able to meet import competition or alternatively being able to sell goods produced in this country on the world markets. I wish to quote from the editorial in today's Australian Financial Review which clearly spells out the impacts on Australians at all levels of not facing up to these fundamental truths. The editorial stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no way city populations-and that means everybody, not just the blue collar union members-can continue to increase their real incomes in the face of the situation facing Australia in 1983. One way or another, belt-tightening is inevitable. If it isn't imposed by a Government wages freeze it will be imposed by a collapse in employment as the jobless percentage heads into double figures and wages claims disappear as employees cling with increasing desperation to their existing jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that sums up in very few words exactly where the Government stands on this matter. The Government does not discard its responsibilities. Rather it grasps them and is prepared to deal with the significant political and legal questions that surround these matters. The initiatives that will be put forward at the Premiers Conference on 7 December involve a 12-month pause on all wages. Preferably the Commonwealth and the States will act together to legislate for a pause in award wages in the public and private sectors. Alternatively, they could act together to impose a pause in the public sector and seek, through tribunals and other means, to have a pause also implemented in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> If this proposal were to be accepted it would be on the basis that there would not be any question of a following catch-up for wage increases forgone during that period. The point to which Senator Button drew our attention-that is, a subsequent explosion after a period of pause-is clearly contemplated by the Government in putting forward its proposition. There will be considerable savings to the Commonwealth and State governments. This has been detailed by the Acting Prime Minister in his statement. The savings will amount to some $700m. The Commonwealth has in mind that those savings achieved by governments as a result of the pause should be applied to employment related activities. The Commonwealth will contribute a substantial part of that expenditure but very substantial savings to State and local governments will also result. It will be up to those participating States to deal with their savings in various ways. Of course, it will be up to the Federal Government to work in relation to that also . </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this is a very significant step in the direction of controlling the flood of wage claims which are coming forward at this time and it will be very significant in controlling the rise in the rate of inflation in this country. It is clear that the only way to generate further investment in this economy on the part of business is to return business to a more profitable situation. Clearly, that is related to keeping wage levels under resonable controls. Consequently, we will be continuing to address that. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should now turn to other things this Government has been doing over the last three months, after facing up to its real responsibilities which became evident in the July period. In August the Government introduced a Budget the chief objective of which was to provide some reduction in costs, particularly in government charges, by reducing income tax in order to support families who were in need, especially in relation to the problems they face with interest payments and, of course, the rising level of general inflation. We have seen the Government measures that have already been established. The home loan interest rebate subsidy, which applied from 1 November, has been introduced. There has been a stepping up in the amount of the family allowance. The rate of tax applicable to incomes under about $17,000 or $18,000 has been generally reduced from 32 per cent to 30 per cent. The amount has been increased from around $4, 200 to around $4,600. </PARA>
<PARA> After taking into account increases in sales taxes which also flowed from the Budget, net returns to families of people on average weekly earnings total about $17 a week. That is a very significant contribution to the welfare of families in this most difficult time and, clearly, it is related to the kind of approach which this Government has adopted. It is to be hoped that that kind of benefit, flowing directly from the Federal Government, will be a force for the moderation of wage pressures in this coming period. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, the approach we have now adopted, leading towards a pause in wage costs and pressures, is directly related to that and seeks to lessen the blow on familites of the implementation of this pause over the next 12 months. Clearly it is an attempt by this Government to maintain reasonable living standards at the expense of the finances of the Commonwealth while asking the people of this nation to restrain their attempts to seek higher and higher wages at the expense of our competitive position on world markets. That integrated approach, together with other measures in which I know Senator Siddons is interested, such as the depreciation package back in July which will be very significant in generating further investment in this community and thereby creating more and more jobs, has been made with the same objective clearly in view. It has been made to lessen the pressure on business caused by the effects of taxation and inflation and to encourage business to obtain more effective and updated equipment to enable it to sell goods more effectively and efficiently and with better results on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not an ad hoc approach. It is certainly not a hollow approach to the problems of this nation. It is a reasoned, integrated, rational approach to the problems that Australia faces. It is an approach aimed at creating jobs in a situation in which clearly we are facing tremendous pressures. That approach has been well thought out. It has been developed with consensus in view. It is aimed towards producing a satisfactory result at the Premiers Conference on 7 December . To call it gimmickry is not to face up to the real issues, and this is the hardest thing to do in this country. While we have the Neville Wrans going around seeking quick answers by raising protection barriers all over the place with no regard to the real issues, we can expect this kind of narrow, if you like, 'head-in-the-sand' approach from the ALP which does not deserve to be in any form of government while it adopts that sort of approach. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1976 we were told by the Government that the essential thing was to bear down on inflation and unemployment would cure itself. After seven years of Fraserism, after seven years of bearing down on inflation, inflation has in fact gone up from 12.1 per cent to 12.3 per cent and unemployment has more than doubled. When this Government came into office fewer than a quarter of a million people were unemployed. There are now more than half a million. The economy is collapsing, as this matter of public importance states. It is collapsing because aggregate output is actually contracting for the first time since 1961 and jobs are being lost at the rate of 1,000 a day. What Senator Sir John Carrick euphemistically calls 'disemployment' means people being sacked at the rate of a thousand a day. In nearly seven years from 1976 to the present we have been promised and Government Ministers have forecast an investment-led recovery, a consumer-led recovery, an export-led recovery and a resource boom-led recovery. There have been promises of tax cuts and realities of tax increases. What we have seen is not a coherent policy but a succession of political stunts, the latest of which is the proposal off the top of the prime ministerial head last weekend for a pay pause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Sydney Morning Herald yesterday saw fit to write a major editorial on this latest Government stunt. I will quote extracts from that editorial in the knowledge, and I trust the knowledge shared by most Australians, that the Sydney Morning Herald is, to say the least, not a paper with a traditional record of opposition to conservative governments. Indeed, only once in living memory has it actually supported the Australian Labor Party, and that was more than 20 years ago. This is what the Sydney Morning Herald said about this latest stunt- the pay pause:</PARA>
<PARA>At last the Federal Government is worried about unemployment and is willing to act. After about five months of decision-making paralysis caused by pre-election jitters, action is welcome. </PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> And the special Premiers' Conference to discuss a 12-month wage freeze announced by Mr Anthony last night has a distinct smell of panic about it. Moreover, the proposal also smells of gimmickry and buck-passing. </PARA>
<PARA>This was not said by Bill Hayden; this was not said by Bob Hawke; this is the Sydney Morning Herald's assessment of the Government's pay pause policy. The editorial continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The speed with which the wage-freeze idea has surfaced bears testimony to its panic-induced and ill-considered nature. A Government which is notorious for its ponderous decision-making-which took three months to resolve a simple dispute over the SRD release for housing-has come up with a major new plank in its economic strategy within little more than a week. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the Sydney Morning Herald's assessment. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Until the recent passing of a few carefully calculated dates in Mr Fraser's diary, the Government's plan was cynically to anticipate rising unemployment, rather than actually to tackle it. Its new-found sense of urgency seems to be motivated by political, rather than economic or social, concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>The Sydney Morning Herald continued:</PARA>
<PARA>There is but one precedent for the course the Government has now embarked upon: the ill-considered and short-lived wage-and-price freeze cooked up overnight at the Premiers' Conference of April, 1977. The epitaph of the Government's latest brainstorm can be written in advance from the orthodoxy of the Government's own Treasurers and economic advisers-</PARA>
<PARA>This is not the assessment of a Labor Premier. This is not the assessment of Bill Hayden. It is the editorial assessment of the Sydney Morning Herald, one of the most conservative newspapers in the country. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> The gimmickry in the Government's plan is evident from the novel proposal to divert the savings from the Public Service pay freeze . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The buck-passing in the Government's plan is both direct and indirect . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The second element of buck-passing in the wage-freeze proposal is a little more subtle. By turning the debate about rising unemployment into a debate about wage claims, the Government has focused attention on one aspect of the problem, but drawn attention away from other aspects. In the process it has transferred responsibility for the failure of economic management away from itself and onto the unions. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress again that all those comments were made in yesterday's editorial of the Sydney Morning Herald. The latest of this succession of stunts, the latest gimmick, is intended to divert public attention from the failure of seven years of Fraserism and the absence of any economic strategy in the August Budget. The true measure of failure of this Government is the simple fact that, after seven years of rhetoric about bearing down on inflation, inflation has gone up and the number of people unemployed has more than doubled. It is true that unemployment is high in many countries but only Australia-only the Fraser Government-has doubled unemployment and pushed up inflation simultaneously. </PARA>
<PARA> The response of the Government is to deny responsibility and to declare unconditional surrender to economic circumstances which it avows are beyond its control. The problem of the Australian economy, the Government says, is due entirely to world factors and wage demands by the unions. Even if the figure cited by the Government about wage increases were reliable-Senator Button has already demonstrated that they are not-who is responsible for that situation? Who is responsible for no wages policy over the last 18 months? I suppose that we could blame the Prince of Wales or the Princess Diana, because in May 1981 the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was more interested in jumping on a jet to attend the royal wedding than he was in doing his job as Prime Minister of this country. The Government in the middle of 1981 abandoned any attempt at government involvement in a wages policy and said: 'Let market forces prevail, let us decentralise the wage system and let governments keep out of it'. The Government can hardly complain if, as a consequence of that abdication of responsibility, wages increased, especially as the unions had been subjected to a 12-month long harangue, principally from people such as Senator Carrick, about the resources boom and the untold riches the resources boom was about to deliver to this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Sibraa reminds me, Senator Carrick said that Rundle would be producing 50,000 barrels a day by 1985 and was the greatest thing that Australia had discovered since Bass Strait. Untold riches would be delivered by the resources boom, Government spokesmen told us, again for political reasons. The Government can scarcely complain or expect to be taken seriously when it does complain if, as a result of that reckless talking-up of the resources boom and the abdication of responsibility when the Prime Minister jumped on a jet to go the royal wedding, there were in those sectors of industry where there was a capacity to pay wage demands which flowed on to a significant extent to other sectors. 'We are in a mess', the Government says, 'and there is nothing we can do about it except wait for world conditions to improve, for the inevitable upturn to come, and then we can take advantage of it'. The Labor Party absolutely rejects that negativism and that confession of failure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from diverting attention from the Government's long-standing failures, the wages pause is an attempt to conceal the fact that there was no economic strategy in the 1982 Budget. This latest stunt is an attempt to compensate for the absence of strategy or to cover up for it. Senator Carrick supplements the Government's cop-out policy with a series of untrue assertions, of which we have had at least four in the last week. On 11 November, in characteristic style, he said: 'Well, it does not matter how bad this Government is; the Labor Government which existed almost a decade ago was worse'. Even if that was true it is, of course, not a respectable excuse for this Government. But it is not true. Senator Carrick backs it up with an untrue assertion that when Labor left government inflation was running at 17 1/2 per cent. It is a false claim which he has made many times. In fact, as anyone who cares to look at the statistics will see, when Labor actually left government the annual inflation rate was 12.1 per cent-admittedly temporarily depressed because of a blip. It was 14 per cent at the end of the year. But when Labor actually left government it was 12.1 per cent. It is now 12.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday Senator Carrick said that real wages had fallen in most or all of the countries in the Ogranisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. He was forced to amend that today, like a Stalinist revising Hansard, to say: 'In all other OECD countries there have been calls to moderate excessive wage demands'. Today he said that the Australian recession had been caused by a decline in exports, notwithstanding the fact that in the first four months of this financial year, when the economy had really taken a nosedive, exports in real terms were higher than they were in the same four months of 1981. Today when he really got carried away he said that in the 1930s inflation was negative and interest rates also were negative. That is a novel proposition. The only way one can make sense of that statement is to assume that people paid considerable amounts to banks for storing their money. Senator Carrick said that interest rates were negative in the 1930s and inflation also was negative. It is true that for a year or two inflation was negative; interest rates were never negative. Poor Senator Carrick; he is so confused. I guess that his inability to count is a function of spending too many years picking up brown paper bags full of money without knowing how much was in them. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest stunt produced by this Government is underpinned or reinforced by an appeal to fairness-to spread the inevitable costs of this recession on an equitable basis throughout the community. If the Government really wants to do that, there is a simple and certain way of doing it: Increase unemployment benefits. I do not want to dwell on that matter. The campaign for fairness is led by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony)-the man who granted himself a 4 3/ 4 per cent government loan to buy one of the two houses he owns in Canberra, a loan 80 per cent of which has still not been repaid. If the Government really expects to be taken at all seriously, the prerequisite to gaining any moral credibility, any moral authority at all, is for the Prime Minister to instruct his deputy to repay that 4 3/4 per cent loan. It has been a matter of public knowledge for six months that he has it and nothing has been done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard it said today that the problems of the country are being caused by pre-election jitters. I suggest that the only reason there have been such jitters, if there have been, is that members of the Australian Labor Party have been talking about an election for so long. Obviously they wanted an election at this time. Mr Hayden has been talking about it consistently. As I recall, last week Senator Gietzelt was talking in this very place about an election and wanting to know when it was to be held. The rest of us know that it will be held at the end of next year. The destabilising effect that that sort of talk has is harmful. We have heard quotes from the editorial in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald about the proposal for a wages freeze. I can quote from the Hobart Mercury of 28 October comments on the Labor Party's proposals. Its editorial stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Leader of the Federal Opposition, Mr Hayden, has been in the happy political position of being able to blame Government policies for rising inflation and unemployment without having the onerous task of suggesting better alternatives. This tactic stirs-up anti-Government feeling and gives the ALP and Mr Hayden the superficial appearance of being economic sages. </PARA>
<PARA>The editorial continued:</PARA>
<PARA>It also increases the public perception of doom and gloom. And lack of confidence is dangerous and often self-defeating. It can sabotage genuine efforts to try to contribute constructively towards getting Australia back on the path to prosperity . . .</PARA>
<PARA> On the surface, some of his suggestions appear sound. On closer analysis, however, they fail to impress because they are so remarkably similar to the disastrous Whitlam formulas. </PARA>
<PARA> The main ingredient is for the Federal Government to try to spend its way out of trouble. With inflation already at 12.3 per cent, this seems a recipe for economic disaster. </PARA>
<PARA>It is all very well for Senator Button to suggest that this matter is more serious than playing politics. When one looks at the comments on the Labor Party 's proposals for solutions to the economic problems, we know who is doing just that. As Senator Button has said, there are a number of reasons for the difficulties which exist at present. We have heard about the depressed level of international economic activity and the problem of domestic prices being out of line with those of our competitors, making it difficult for us to compete in overseas markets. No doubt there is a need to contain costs, to sustain investment and to improve productivity so that we are better able to compete. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, one of the factors in higher local prices is the level of wages. It is worth looking at the growth in wages for the 12 months to September of this year. Ordinary time earnings for full time employed adults increased by 17.1 per cent and total earnings of all persons by 15.7 per cent. Let us look at the increased earnings in some other countries: For the United States of America for the 12 months to August of this year, 7.2 per cent; for Japan to July of this year, 0.6 per cent; for the Federal Republic of Germany to April of this year, 5 per cent; for the United Kingdom to August of this year, 10 per cent; for Canada to June of this year, 11.6 per cent. The average increase for members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to May of this year was 10.7 per cent. With our high increases in wages we are, in fact, pricing ourselves out of competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the number of jobless in this country is too high-I cannot imagine anybody saying other than that. Until the end of 1981 the growth in the number of jobs in this country was satisfactory. For the two years to October 1981 the level of employment increased by 4.6 per cent-there was a growth of 281,300 jobs. That was significantly better than in 1979-80, when the level of employment increased by 2.3 per cent and 1980-81, when it increased by 2.7 per cent. In 1980-81 the level of unemployment was the lowest for four years . The international unemployment levels are also worth looking at: In Holland, in August of this year, the level was 12.9 per cent; in the United Kingdom, in September, it was 12.7 per cent; in Canada it was 12.2 per cent; in Italy it was 10.4 per cent; in the United States of America it was 10.1 per cent; in France it was 8.6 per cent; in West Germany it was 7.8 per cent; in Sweden it was 3.7 per cent; in Japan it was 2.4 per cent; and in Australia it is now 7.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is interesting to compare the two sets of figures that I have mentioned with those in respect of Japan alone, where the growth in wages for the 12 months to July of this year was 0.6 per cent and the increase in the level of unemployment 2.4 per cent. Perhaps something is to be learned from that . We have heard cited, in the general debate on this question, figures in relation to the Depression. I suggest that, in fact, they are meaningless. So many significantly different factors are involved that they need to be looked at and some conclusions drawn in regard to them. In the 1930s the population of this country was 6.6 million; it is now 15 million. In August 1982, 6.4 million people, a number almost equal to that of the total population in the 1930s, had jobs. In June 1933 the level of unemployment was 22.4 per cent; some 481,044 people were out of work. This is to be compared with an unemployment level now of 7.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Other conclusions may be drawn from those figures. In 1933 the number of unemployed females was very low indeed; the number of unemployed males was very high. The figures now are different. This indicates quite clearly that the percentage of breadwinners out of work in 1933 was extremely high indeed. Of course, regrettably, now also a large number of breadwinners are out of work. But our young people make up the bulk of the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps there are things in that regard that we can look at also. We can really ask whether the unions care whether anybody has a job. In particular we can ask whether they care whether young people have jobs. Would they agree to attempt to initiate a lower minimum wage for young people? A shop assistant at the age of 16 gets $112.50; at the age of 17, $135; and at the age of 18, $157.50 but frequently, at the same time, he or she receives a dismissal notice. What does that indicate? I think it indicates that young people of those ages are required to be paid more than employers regard as their value. Until that can be rectified there will continue to be significant problems with young unemployed people who cannot offer to employers skills that are regarded as reasonable in return for the wages that have to be paid. If unions were serious about this problem perhaps they would look very closely at it. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, in the tourist industry the penalty rates keep a great number of people out of jobs which would otherwise be available. I do not think there is any doubt at all that most people agree that the tourist industry could be greatly benefited by penalty rates being abolished and a different structure of wages put in place so that more people could have jobs and could work at times which suited them. That would benefit the industry and this country. It is necessary for us to attract more tourists to encourage them to spend their money in Australia. The Weekend Australian of 16-17 October dealt with the matter of minimum wages. The article on that subject commenced:</PARA>
<PARA> There must be something terribly wrong with a minimum wage system that puts youngsters out of work the day they turn 18. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is time that all of us had a look at that aspect of this mater. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has done quite an amount in relation to helping young people who are out of work. Honourable senators will well recall some of the highlights of the Budget of 1982-83 in that regard. The manpower and training programs allocation was increased by 21 per cent to $254.7m, compared with $210.5m in the previous year. More than 252,000 people, representing an 18 per cent increase, can be assisted under the programs for this year. In respect of the Special Youth Employment Training Program an increased subsidy of $20 a week, raising the level from $55 a week to $75 a week, is to be paid. Under the program a number of young people have been able to gain experience and skills to offer an employer. A significant 33 per cent increase in the annual intake of students is envisaged. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training has been adjusted and an extra $1m is to be devoted to technical and further education courses for the long term, young unemployed, to enable them to acquire skills with which to approach the market place. In the Budget provision was made for book allowances, equipment allowances and a number of other forms of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, an additional 25 per cent in funding was provided to permit expansion of the Community Youth Support Scheme, the number of projects under which will increase to 276. That is just a brief resume of the programs involved. It indicates that the Government has an awareness of the problems of young people in trying to obtain employment in these times. As I said earlier, it is a pity that others in the community-I have in mind the unions-have not the same attitude towards finding jobs for young people. </PARA>
<PARA> In Canberra, prior to the presentation of the Budget, a considerable increase in confidence occurred. The Budget indicated the Government's commitment to the growth and development of this Territory and a recognition of the problems that it has faced. The Master Builders Association of the Australian Capital Territory, in a Press release of 18 October, referred to a survey that it had undertaken before the 1982-83 Budget and said that in the next 12 months more than $70m worth of private sector capital works could begin in the national capital. However, union demands for substantial wage increases were making developers hesitate. The Association referred to demands for increases in excess of $65 a week for workers on some sites who were already receiving over $400 a week. The same Press release referred to some of the many bans that had been placed on construction sites in Canberra. The loss of confidence which that kind of action creates causes the private sector to wonder seriously whether it should invest, whether it can afford to go ahead with some of these projects. If it does not go ahead with them, fewer jobs will be available. In the Australian Capital Territory, where we have quite high unemployment-substantially amongst young people-it is particularly important that the unions accept some responsibility in the effort to make jobs available. </PARA>
<PARA> The union bans which exist in the Territory have had effects which go beyond deterring the private sector from proceeding with projects. I think it is worth looking at some of those bans. In spite of a two-year agreement in relation to industrial matters, there have been bans on the new Parliament House site. There have been bans at the Australian Defence Force Academy. Also, I ask: What about the police academy? There has also been a ban at the Grammar School site. Certainly, construction has not started but considerable jobs would be available if the projects were able to go ahead. That project has been banned locally. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth recalling the story about the police academy. It indicates a great deal about the motives of some of these people. One might say it is a parochial issue but it reflects a great deal more than the local situation. The contract for the police academy has been let to a local firm and by now about 40 people should have been working on the project. On 6 August this year it was black- banned by the union, so those 40 jobs are not filled at present. The reason for that is that there was an accident at the Jolimont site, a workman was injured and-there is no doubt about this-there were problems in relation to his workers' compensation. A dispute developed between two worker's compensation insurers as to who was liable, which perhaps indicates the need for reform in that area. I do not condone such disputes. The union conducted a sit-in at one of the insurance offices. After some time some police officers went to the office. They did not forcibly evict the union members; they asked them to leave and they left . The black ban was placed on the police academy site and the union demanded that the police officers give an undertaking that they would never again interfere, as it was called, with union activities. The union saw itself as being above the law in this regard. I do not think many reasonable people would want the police to give such undertakings to the union or to any other section of this community, but the ban continues. One might say it is only 40 jobs, but as far as I am concerned it is 40 jobs that people in the Territory could have. </PARA>
<PARA> At present there are bans on various carpet firms in Fyshwick. The demand is being made that sub-contract carpet layers join a union. The Federated Furnishing Trade Society of Australasia has not gone to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission but has banned at least two firms, Endeavour Carpets and Isa Street Carpets, outside of which sits an iridescent blue Holden, interestingly enough with Victorian registration plates numbered INM-164. They are two small firms being driven out of business by the unions in the Territory. Of course the unions are interfering with others as well, and will continue to do so. They may have genuine reasons for wanting to impose compulsory unionism-which I deplore-in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Fraser Government's hollow and superficial response to Australia's economic collapse. The Australian Democrats are not prepared to accept a wages pause unless it is accompanied by an overall package which attempts to address the fundamental problems of the economy and at the same time seeks to control prices, dividends, directors' fees and all the other aspects of cost in the economy. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Messner, pointed to the high levels of unemployment in other countries. He indicated that these had existed for some time and implied that Australia was just starting in this regard and we had to sit back and cop it for some years to come. This is not an attitude that I and my party are prepared to accept. I wish to use most of the time available to outline the solutions as the Australian Democrats see them. Only Churchill had the right words to describe the present Administration. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No government has ever combined so passionate a lust for power with such incurable impotence in its exercise. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government's lust for power has rendered it incapable of thinking about anything else. It has become paralysed by the fear of the political consequences of any of its actions. It is racked by scandal, it is white-anted by corruption and it is corroded by incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA> Why has this appalling state of affairs come about? How has it been allowed to happen? Until recently most thoughtful people thought that the problem of a serious recession or depression was a thing of the past-were not governments now practised in the use of the many economic tools available and committed to counter cyclical intervention in the economy? The unfortunate fact is that this Government is so committed to a particular ideology that it has failed to act in a counter cyclical manner. As President Hoover did in the 1930s, this Government has cut spending at a time of reduced business activity. It has attempted to fight inflation first rather than to put people first. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the consequences of this? We now have extremely high rates of inflation and extremely high levels of unemployment, and in addition we have a critical balance of payments problem. They are three vital economic indicators, all going through the roof at the same time. Last year we had a $9.1 billion deficit on our current account and this year the figure promises to be even higher. If truly massive amounts of capital had not flowed into Australia, we would have been internationally insolvent. Even a very cursory survey of the present Budget makes it clear that the Government is still attempting to pursue this policy of attracting foreign capital into the country. But the price we pay for this solution to our balance of trade problems is very high indeed. Not only are interest rates kept high to attract money into the country but also we pay the piper in the form of increasing foreign penetration of our economy. We are gradually handing over our destiny to foreign investors and to bankers. Worst of all, we are creating a crippling interest and profit repatriation burden for the future. In relation to this matter, Sir Roderick Carnegie has said:</PARA>
<PARA> If you get $2 in 1979 from overseas invested in equities those owners want a dollar a year from 1990 onwards forever. What I'm saying is this: that's a very high price because they see the $2 coming in today but in ten, eleven years' time a dollar going out is an enormous price to pay . . . in the long term I don 't think it's going to create the kind of jobs for young Australians which I want for my kids. </PARA>
<PARA>What should the Government do? As we see it, at this late stage only two initiatives are available to it. They are two initiatives that will give the economy a short, sharp shock, which is what it needs if it is to be pulled out of the tailspin it is in, heading towards depression. The Australian Democrats see as the first initiative a significant devaluation of the Australian dollar. We would seek the co-operation of the union movement to ensure that the benefits of the devaluation were not lost through excessive wage demands. Australia is a sufficiently small country that a significant devaluation would not bring about international rebuke, nor would it trigger off a round of similar devaluations. </PARA>
<PARA> The second short, sharp shock that this economy needs is the adoption of import restrictions. We advocate adopting this policy as a temporary measure only. We believe that it would have to be selective and reasonable but also very determined. It would have to be based on reciprocity, imposing restrictions where restrictions are imposed on products that Australia exports. For example, the Japanese have consistently forced us to renegotiate contracts and on occasions they have simply refused to take delivery of or to pay for contracted tonnages of coal or iron. Australia is one of the few countries in the world that enjoys a favourable balance of trade with Japan. We would be very foolish if we put this happy state of affairs at risk. But we should demand a quid pro quo with the Japanese. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats certainly support closer economic relations with New Zealand providing we are not ripped off. We support without reservation the continuation of the friendly and co-operative programs such as we have at the moment with countries of the South Pacific. Indeed, we have advocated generous economic aid to those countries. The difficulties do not arise with Japan, the tiny countries of the South Pacific or New Zealand. Australia's problems with adverse trade balances are with the massive power blocs of Europe and North America and the rapidly industrialising countries of South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Venezuela. Right now we have massive imports of steel being dumped in this country from countries such as South Korea and Taiwan. Our steel producer, the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, has only 5 per cent protection against these imports. But when Australia attempts to export its steel products to South Korea or Taiwan they are subject first of all to tariff duties as high as 50 per cent. Every importer into Taiwan or South Korea must be licensed, and imports are barred immediately they affect local industries. On the one hand we face these barriers into those countries and on the other hand those countries are allowed to export their steel using the latest American technology and are subject only to a 5 per cent tariff barrier against competition with the local product. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore urge the Government to introduce import restrictions in the form of import quotas as soon as possible to industries in which imports can be replaced by goods produced by local industry and where the local industry is reasonably competitive with imports. This policy would give local industries breathing space to restructure. It would give us time to provide sufficient jobs for full employment. How can this be done? Of course, under the Industries Assistance Commission legislation which was introduced during the years of the Whitlam Government it is necessary to refer any import restrictions or quotas to the IAC or the Temporary Assistance Authority. Such references, of course, take a lot of time. The Government could argue that its hands are tied and that it cannot act quickly. Nevertheless, there is a very simple solution. Next week when the House of Representatives meets, the Government could introduce a very simple amending Bill which would allow it to reassume the authority it had to apply import quotas before the IAC legislation was introduced. It would be a very simple piece of legislation which would, I am sure, receive the support of all parties in the Senate. This would give the Government the power it needs to act quickly at a time when our international solvency is at risk. </PARA>

<PARA> If we did have import restrictions in the form of quotas as a temporary measure -it should not apply for longer than three years-we could give serious thought to restructuring our industries. I believe the Senate is very well aware of my attitude to restructuring. We must have a process of long term indicative planning. We must bring together the unions, industry and the Government to work out what our long term objectives should be. We cannot have everything. We can have more of one thing and less of something else. We must sort our our priorities. Quotas for a three-year period would give us valuable time to work out our priorities and to put before the Australian people a long term plan worked out in association with governments, industry and trade unions so that the people of this country would know what is expected of them and where they are heading. </PARA>
<PARA> Planning in some circles is regarded as anathema. It is regarded almost as being un-Australian. Honourable senators must realise that many countries around the world have adopted this planning process with great success. It is a major factor in the success of countries such as Japan, Singapore, France, West Germany and Sweden.

Last year the Senate, for the first time in its history, debated a Bill for industrial democracy which, if adopted, would give a new approach and a new direction to the industrial relations climate in this country. To the Senate's credit, the Industrial Democracy Bill 1981 was passed. It has not yet been passed by the House of Representatives. The countries I mentioned have also adopted industrial democracy. This country must have a basic change of direction . It must change direction by 180 degrees. This is the Government's responsibility. We are in a state of crisis. We are looking to the Government for this basic change of direction. If it does not come quickly, the consequences will indeed be tragic.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One may well ask what would be the position of Australia today had not the Federal Government pursued its strong policy towards containing inflation acknowledging two factors; first, our heavy dependence on resource-produced income which is strongly influenced by overseas commodity prices, and, secondly, overseas income from agriculture. The world is indeed facing a recession. Since Australia is a major trading nation it stands to reason that this disturbance is having some impact in this country. One factor of production that unfortunately is slightly out of step at the moment is the labour or wages factor. Since 1980 wage increases have been moving faster than productivity. For example, average weekly ordinary time earnings of full time adult males rose by 18.2 per cent over the 12 months to the September quarter. Wages increased 50 per cent faster than prices increased over that year. That is one of the contributing problems. Another must be traced back to our conciliation and arbitration system. I think there are too many lawyers in the system. There should be some economists, accountants and other people from the business community on the bench. It has become too legalistic and too divorced from the realities of the world to be effective in the Australian climate of 1982. We have recognised that until 1980 productivity gains were slightly in excess of wage movements. For that reason Australia was performing relatively well. Since that time we have seen Australia's international competitiveness being eroded. Unfortunately, jobs have been destroyed and some industries have disappeared forever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sorry reality, therefore, is that in many sectors we are faced now with the situation that one man's pay increase is unfortunately in some cases another man 's job. I think we must have some more positive responses to the Government's suggestion of a wage freeze. I think it was unfortunate that such a negative reaction was adopted initially by so many of the Premiers. I am pleased to say that there was a positive reaction by my State Premier, the Hon. Robin Gray. If one looks at this matter of public importance one must realise that our Government's actions have not been limited to the wage freeze. One has to look to the Budget brought down in August to see some of the positive approaches. There were substantive tax cuts; raised income thresholds; the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program; home loan incentives were given through the taxation system; pensioner benefits were increased; family allowances were raised; there were extensions of tax concessions to secondary and primary industries; and there was assistance to the disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the problems created by the international situation there has been a reduction in economic activity due to the major Australian drought. I mentioned last week that over 90 per cent of farms in New South Wales, over 40 per cent of farms in Queensland and 60 per cent in Victoria have been affected. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics estimated as a result of the drought something like $1,500m loss in net value of rural production. But what has been our response? It has been a very significant one and one which has been appreciated by the farming community. We have introduced fodder subsidies to the value of up to $320m. The subsidy is 80c a month for sheep and $8 a head for cattle a month. In addition to the fodder subsidy there is assistance in meeting interest payments-a farmer essentially pays the first 12 per cent and the Government meets the remainder. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that State governments, as well as the Federal Government, have a responsibility. State governments must look very closely at their charging policies. In yesterday's Press we read of the difficulties being faced by the State Rail Authority of New South Wales because of the drought. With the reduction in activity there is a tendency to increase charges and because of cross subsidisation in pricing we can have a situation in which some price increases can be unfairly reflected in charges to some sectors of the travelling public. I think this is one of the difficulties that all public utility organisations will have to face in Australia. There is a case for some deficit financing in this area rather than raising prices which is reflected as an increase in the cost of living. I repeat that I believe there is a case for some deficit funding. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a case for the Government to give some consideration to deferring the possibility of price increases in relation to petrol for a period so that these increases as a result of devaluation do not get reflected in increased costs to the ordinary working man at a time when he cannot afford it. There is a case for what I might call some sort of price surveillance mechanism. I do not necessarily agree with price controls but there does need to be some sort of restraint over the incomes of, for example, professional people, including doctors but if the Government brought in price controls as some people are suggesting we would be deliberately hitting out against the goose that laid the golden egg. One of the problems of business at present is that it is finding difficulty in recovering its increased costs in the form of increased prices. It is a tragedy that so many businesses are losing money at the moment. Therefore there is negative or no investment. We have to try to change that situation in order to overcome the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> A further constraint is that the constitutional power of control over prices rests with State governments. There are other difficulties in controlling prices . How does one control, for example, the prices of fresh vegetables that are in short supply at any point of time throughout the calendar year? This is a difficulty with which no statutory mechanism can really cope properly. At the same time I believe that we must not harm Australian industry because price controls would not affect imported products. As we heard this afternoon, one of the problems facing Australia is unfair import competition where allegedly dumped goods are being placed on the Australian market. I think the Australian Government has played a commendable role in trying to free up trade. We have to be careful to ensure that it will not be at the expense of Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I think farmers have shown a very commendable attitude in containing a lot of their costs including wage costs. Farmers believe they have been unfairly affected because all wage increases are ultimately reflected in a farmer's costs whereas their prices are largely determined by international competitive situations. Unfortunately, the mining industry has not shown quite the same commendable restraint. At the height of its economic activity it was the pacesetter in the wages area and it drew hundreds or maybe thousands of people from the public sector, the manufacturing sector, from farms and the like. Now the industry is setting up a cry to free up the system. It is making calls for free trade at a time when prices are low. We acknowledge the plight of the industry, but we must not forget that it was one of the bogy-men of the situation which artificially lifted the wages to secure labour at a time it suited it. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the tragedies is that the manufacturing industry always gets singled out as being inefficient and demands protection, but there are a whole host of other industries throughout Australia that have an effective protective mechanism built in. It is not the manufacturing industries that have been the pacesetters in wage increases. The pacesetters have come from other areas such as airline pilots and the transport sector including sea transit. We feel this particularly in Tasmania as we are so heavily dependent on sea transport. It is a problem of our State that Bass Strait is one of the highest cost waterways in the world. Until we can overcome this situation we will have problems in Tasmania. We have to provide encouragement to enterprises to stay in business and to invest, because they are unable to pass on many of their cost increases; their profits are squeezed and the inevitable result is that staff are retrenched. There is a case for the Australian Government to look at providing preference to buying Australian goods at this time. The States, I believe, have a role. For example, I think there is a case for limiting some of the scope of business liabilities in workers' compensation law. Accidents that happen in the home, when a person is preparing to go to work, in some cases are deemed to be subject to workers' compensation liability. I think there needs to be a limit to the monetary amounts that are sometimes paid. </PARA>
<PARA> Unions too have a responsibility to provide a greater opportunity to enable young people starting off in their working lives to find a job. The starting rates for many juniors are too high, so the opportunity for them to enter the work force is disappearing. There needs to be a greater flexibility in working arrangements. Demarcation disputes are all too frequent. I believe a system of industrial unions would tend to harmonise a system much better than the position we have at the moment. Unfortunately our tariff system appears to be too open. It is so honest that it is subject to attack. Other countries use more devious measures to protect not only their jobs but also their industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Acting Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, suggested that something like $700m could be saved as a result of a wages pause in the public sector. I believe we too, as parliamentarians, have a responsibility. Maybe we should look at some of our conditions, including our generous superannuation, which is subject to minimum tax liability. In a nutshell, we must meet fair competition. We must sell profitably and we must encourage investment. We must overcome all measures which generate confrontation because at this time there exists the ingredients for society to erupt against itself with the haves against the have nots. That could be a real tragedy for Australia. As a nation, we cannot afford it. I regret that my time has expired and I now move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few general comments about the operations of Senate Estimates Committee E which I had the honour to chair. I would like to say how much I and I think other members of the Committee appreciated the assistance we received from the secretariat. We received a tremendous amount of assistance in going back through previous reports and inquiries of the Estimates Committee in dealing with the departments whose estimates we considered. I strongly commend to the Senate to study the Committee 's report. One particular matter I wish to raise with the Committee of the Whole refers to an item that came to our attention during both the October 1981 and May 1982 hearings. I am sure that other members of the Committee will raise matters that are of particular interest to them. The first page of Estimates Committee E report to the Senate, under the heading 'Capital Works', states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Arising out of this Committee's Reports to the Senate of October 1981 and May 1982, the Department of Finance has written to all Departments directing that each Department list the capital works for which it is responsible in its own explanatory notes. To the present, the details of new capital works proposals have only been included in the explanatory notes of the Department of Transport and Construction. As that Department is only acting as the contractor, it is not possible for its officers to be examined on the purpose, background or need for the items involved. Although such lists were not included in the explanatory notes relating to 1982-83 Estimates, their inclusion in future will facilitate adequate examination by Estimates Committees of the particulars of new works proposals by individual Departments. </PARA>
<PARA>I questioned officers from each of the departments we looked at. I am sorry to say that in all cases none of them was aware of that particular recommendation made in previous reports. I hope that the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) will draw this matter to the attention of each of the departments involved so that that recommendation is at least responded to in, I hope, a positive way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The first matter I raise today relates to the Parliament House Construction Authority. I have been approached by the Executive Director of the Young Women's Christian Association concerning the possibility of provision in the new Parliament House of a creche. When she wrote to me she included a copy of a letter from the Parliament House Construction Authority which stated in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The possible inclusion of a creche or child care facility in the building has been considered by the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House which acts as the clients' representative in such matters. The Committee as agreed that no provision be made for incorporating a creche or similar facility in the building, however, the Authority has been asked by the Committee to identify a suitable area in the surrounding landscape which could in the future be used for such a purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision by the Joint Standing Committee ensures that the opportunity would remain for child care facilities to be developed in the future . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to make the point, which has no doubt been made already-presumably at the stage of the hearing of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the New Parliament House which dealt with this-that it is an observable fact that members of the House of Representatives and senators are elected to Parliament, and their staff appointed, at a younger age than previously, for which God or whoever is responsible ought to be praised; that there are an increasing number of women in both Houses; that members and senators are taking more and more advantage of the privilege that they have of bringing their families to Canberra a certain number of times a year; and that it is not abnormal to see in the public gallery very young children of members and senators. That, of course, is as it should be. Our staff too like to take the opportunity when they can at their own expense to bring husbands or wives and children over here. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the general public are becoming more and more aware of the parliamentary system that operates in this place and are more and more prepared to spend considerable time looking over the old Parliament House. It is only to be expected that when our rather grand new and permanent Parliament House is in operation in or about 1988 the number of visitors will increase. More visitors will bring small children with them. More of them, like members and senators, will appreciate the opportunity to leave very young children at a creche or child care centre when they go on a tour of Parliament House or when they join their spouses in the gallery. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask, therefore: Why has the Authority looked only at identifying a suitable area in the surrounding landscape which could in future be used for a creche or child care centre? Why is it not envisaged at this stage that it be an integral part of Parliament House? The children of members, senators, staff and the general public who come here will, after all, ultimately be voters in this country, we hope, and are entitled to have their needs catered for, as are their parents, when they come to Canberra. That is the first question I wish to raise. The second question is: Has the Committee identified a suitable area in the surrounding landscape, since that, apparently, is what it was asked to do? If it has done this, where has it recommended that a creche or similar facility be established? If it has not acceded to the request of the Standing Committee can the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) or the Department of the Capital Territory give us some idea of when it will report its findings?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The matter I wish to raise has continually been raised in the Parliament since we dealt with the Appropriation Bills about this time last year. We were then told officially that Mr Anthony, the Deputy Prime Minister, is in receipt of an Australian Capital Territory Commissioner for Housing Loan. Of course that matter has been explored in more depth in the Senate, in the Press, and on television and radio in recent days because of my questions about the payment of travelling allowances. I understand that Mr Anthony is on record as saying that his home has been in Murwillumbah in New South Wales ever since he became a member of parliament. The questions which I wish to ask the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) in respect of Commissioner for Housing Loans are these: Was there a requirement in 1974 that to receive a loan a person had to be a resident of Canberra? Has there always been a requirement that a person must be a resident of Canberra? What is the definition of 'resident'? I have taken a very great interest in this matter for quite some time, I asked a further question about Mr Anthony's home loan during the hearings of Estimates Committee E. I sought details as to the outstanding balance. The reply in the document which is headed 'Written Replies to Questions Asked' states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The balance of the loan as at 1st September 1982 was $14,609.94. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer I got some 12 months ago was that the balance at 1 October 1981 was $ 15,005. An exercise in simple arithmetic shows that in the 11-month period from 1 October 1981 to 1 September 1982 Mr Anthony reduced the principal by $395.06. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. That is what he said he was when he first got the home loan. The amount he has paid off this loan is less than five nights travelling allowance for being in Canberra. He would get $400 for five nights in Canberra. That matter is causing a lot of concern to many people in the community who are now being threatened with eviction orders and court cases. Because of the high unemployment rate and high interest rates many people are unable to keep up their home loans. They have been threatened with their houses being sold over their heads. Only yesterday in the Adelaide Advertiser a very disturbing story was printed about Valerie and Philip Erickson who will lose their home. The article in the Adelaide Advertiser states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Their problem is one of simple mathematics: when they have spooned out their weekly mortgage repayment of $120 there is just $80 left for food, clothing, electricity, rates and taxes, and the basic essentials for the survival of a family . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is one illustration; there are many more. People with such problems come to my office. But the Ericksons have suggested that people in similar circumstances to theirs who are finding great difficulty in paying off their home loans ought to write to their members of parliament. I suggest that, because Mr Anthony has been able to use the system and has had to pay off only $395.06 in 11 months, all the people who are listening to the Parliament today who have problems such as those of the couple in Adelaide whom I mentioned, Valerie and Philip Erickson , should immediately write to Mr Anthony to ask him how, on his salary, he can afford to pay off only $395.06 when they are just about on the starvation line because of what they have to pay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know. Liberal Ministers had some of those home loans in days gone by. John Grey Gorton, who was Prime Minister when Senator Chipp was in the Ministry, had such a loan. That loan still exists but of course it is in his wife's name. I am not concerned about people with those loans who no longer are members of parliament; I am concerned about present members of parliament. According to the list provided to me last year, the only person who fitted into that category was Mr Anthony. He is well able to pay off that loan, I should say , as his colleague was after we aired the matter last year. Mr Nixon paid off his loan. He owed much more than Mr Anthony now owes. I do not know what possessed him to do that. I am told that Mr Anthony is a much tougher nut to crack. I should have thought that 12 months ago the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) would have suggested to him that he pay it off to save the Government embarrassment. The Prime Minister might have done that, but Mr Anthony will not do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next question which arises concerns travelling allowance. Mr Anthony has claimed that his home base, where he lives, has always been in New South Wales, yet he was able to get this loan. In an answer, trying to extricate himself from the problem he has got himself into, in the House of Representatives on 14 October he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Back in about 1964 when I was appointed Minister for the Interior in Canberra one of the things I was asked was whether I would come and live in Canberra so as to take a personal interest in the management and development of this city.</PARA>
<PARA>Later in the same answer he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to enable me to bring my family here I was allowed the privilege which 6, 000 other people who transferred to Canberra were allowed, that is, to obtain a loan to buy a government built house. </PARA>
<PARA>I am told that at that time people purchasing government homes in Canberra were also given a further incentive-quite apart from the low interest rate of 4 3/4 per cent which Mr Anthony got-and that is a discount of 10 per cent on the purchase price. The officers from the Department of the Capital Territory might be able to answer that question as well as the other questions I asked. Was there a requirement in 1964 that to receive a Commissioner for Housing loan a person had to be a resident of Canberra when he got that loan? Yet over the weekend it was reported in the Press on more than one occasion that his home base has always been in Murwillumbah! He is at odds somewhere; the answers do not tally. </PARA>

I will be asking that question at the third reading stage of the debate. Many questions have not yet been answered. I am not blaming Senator Guilfoyle for the answer she put down yesterday.

<PARA> Mr Bruchu bought a car in 1980 which he says turned out to be a classic lemon. According to him, the car collected seven inches of water after a rain storm; the electrical system failed repeatedly; the paint peeled; the parking brake pedal came off; the manual transmision repeatedly popped out of second gear and went into neutral; and the car sat in the dealer's shop for transmission repairs for 135 days over a period of 18 months. The story of his losing battle to have the car repaired satisfactorily was one factor that led the Connecticut legislature to pass its lemon law, despite intense opposition, naturally, from the car industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Connecticut law, which has only just come into force, operates for the duration of a new car's warranty or for the first year of ownership, whichever is less. The California law operates only for the first 12,000 miles of the car' s existence. Presumably if it is sitting in the dealer's yard for this extraordinary length of time it would take some years for it to rack up 12,000 miles or even 12,000 kilometres. The law in Connecticut and California defines a car as a lemon if, within that period, one of two situations arises; firstly, if the car has been to the dealer four times to have the same problem fixed, but the dealer has failed to repair the car properly; and, secondly, if the car has been out of service for more than 30 days in all due to one or more defects. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to my question. Will the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) consider enacting similar lemon legislation in the Australian Capital Territory, over which he has jurisdiction in this regard, in the hope that this overdue and innovative action will be taken up and adopted by other States in Australia, thereby, I think, fulfilling one of the most important consumer affairs roles that this Government has?</PARA>

<PARA> There is another matter in relation to the Australian Capital Territory that I wish to raise. During the hearings of Senate Estimate Committee H, dealing with the Department of Primary Industry, I asked the following question:</PARA>
<PARA> Is there going to be legislation enacted in the Australian Capital Territory to enforce collection under the Poultry Industry Levy?</PARA>
<PARA>An answer to that question was later provided by Mr Geoff Miller, Deputy Secretary of the Department of Primary Industry. The Department of the Capital Territory has the jurisdiction for enforcing this legislation, which is known as the CEMA plan, that is, the Commonwealth Egg Marketing Authority plan. This legislation was introduced many years ago by the late Mr Adermann when he was Minister for Primary Industry. I was furnished by Senator Archer, Chairman of Estimates Committee H, with the following reply to my question. The letter is dated 9 November 1982. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>DEPARTMENT OF PRIMARY INDUSTRY</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, A.C.T. 2600. Telephone (062) 72 3933</PARA>

<PARA> I am writing to amplify and update my responses to Questions from Senator McLaren at the Estimates Committee Hearing on 16 September, when he asked about enforcing hen levy charges in the Australian Capital Territory (Hansard, 16 September 1982, page 701). </PARA>
<PARA> The position is that Bartter (Parkwood Eggs Pty Ltd) who produce eggs in the A. C.T., has paid levy on hens owned by it up to 4 February 1982. Further returns have been lodged for prescribed levy days up to 24 June 1982 but the levy due has not been paid. Returns have not been lodged nor levy paid for prescribed levy days from 8 July 1982, to date. </PARA>
<PARA>GEOFF MILLER</PARA>
<PARA>Deputy Secretary</PARA>
<PARA>The outstanding levy to 24 June 1982 is $123,862.18, plus $5,468.41 penalty for non-payment of that levy to 13 October 1982. I understand that some legal action is being taken to recover this money but colleagues of mine in the poultry industry in the other States are very concerned that the company known as Bartter (Parkwood Eggs Pty Ltd) can get away with such a large amount of money and not contribute to the industry as every other egg producer in Australia has to contribute. I was informed recently from very reliable sources that when an Australian Capital Territory inspector visited the premises of Bartter (Parkwood Eggs Pty Ltd) recently he found that the company had 60,000 hens over quota on the property. That was only a few weeks ago. The same company is trans-shipping eggs over the border into Victoria. It has upped the amount of eggs it has been shipping into Victoria from 27,000 dozen per week to about 41,000 dozen per week . A substantial amount of egg pulp is also going over the border. Most people will recall that I raised this matter in the Senate some time ago. Pulp, which was being sold by this company in Victoria, was very heavily infected with salmonella. It is not subject to inspection. These are the sorts of activities that are going on in this company in the Australian Capital Territory to try to circumvent government legislation. It is hitting very hard at the honest producers who pay their levy every fortnight and send in their returns to the appropriate place. </PARA>
<PARA> I have another question relating to this matter of eggs. Did an inspector count the birds at the premises of Parkwood Eggs about three weeks ago and find that the number of birds according to the advice from my informant exceeded its allotted quota by about 60,000? No doubt the officers of the Department of the Capital Territory will be able to answer that question. I would like to know also whether the Department would ascertain from the Victorian Egg Marketing Board the quantity of eggs that Parkwood is transporting into that State. Has the figure risen from 27,000 dozen to 41,000 dozen as I have been told?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dumping them in Victoria and probably claiming, under section 92 of the Constitution, that we have free trade between the States. That argument certainly will not apply to the unpaid levies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I reiterate that very grave concern is being expressed by egg producers throughout Australia about the activities of a company of this size which, I understand, just about has a monopoly in the Australian Capital Territory; there is very little, if any, competition. I do not know where the matter will end. If the authorities in the Australian Capital Territory do not come down pretty hard on this company and see that it, like every other egg producer in Australia, conforms with the law and pays the levy, it will be operating at a very unfair advantage. It is able to undercut the stable prices which are laid down by the New South Wales Egg Marketing Board, the Victorian Egg Marketing Board and the South Australian Egg Board; it is contributing to a surplus of eggs. I find that , in my State of South Australia, because of better husbandry the quotas of the legitimate egg producers are being reduced each year in an endeavour to prevent a surplus of eggs. Having a surplus of eggs does not mean that the consumer gets eggs any cheaper. It costs an enormous amount of money to keep surplus eggs in cold storage. That all adds to the cost of the end product to the consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> If Parkwood Eggs exceeds its quota by about 60,000 hens, which is what I have been told-we all know that any good poultry farmer can get up to 14 dozen eggs a year from each bird if he is looking after his birds properly-that represents an enormous number of eggs. In addition, the company is not paying the levy on the birds for which it has a quota. Some very urgent action needs to be taken. I do not know how far the legal action has gone but I hope that, in the very near future, we can be informed that Mr Bartter has been made to pay these outstanding dues and that officials in the Australian Capital Territory will keep a very close eye on him to see that he does not exceed his quota and that he pays his levy every fortnight when it is due. I hope that the officers of the Department can provide me with some answers on the state of play in the Australian Capital Territory at the present time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to page 4 of the report of Estimates Committee E which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the Committee feels bound to report that it was not altogether satisfied by the officers' explanations concerning, for example, the apparent failure to define national objectives for the CES and disseminate them properly to CES staff. </PARA>
<PARA>A second feature of that section of the report is:</PARA>
<PARA> A further matter of concern to the Committee which arose during the course of the hearing was the possibility that staff ceilings and other resource constraints could be having an adverse effect on the operations of the CES. Again, the Committee must report that it was not altogether convinced by the explanations provided that the operations of the CES are not being adversely affected by various resource constraints. Indeed, it appeared to the Committee that suggestions that, by re-ordering priorities and juggling resources in the face of resource constraints, the final output of the CES would not be affected were in the realm of pious hope. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer to those statements because, in the course of the Estimates Committee hearings I concerned myself with national objectives. I drew attention to the Auditor-General's report for the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Audit found that national objectives for CES were not clearly defined and disseminated to all CES staff and no formal priorities were set. </PARA>
<PARA>There were a number of responses from the Department. The Auditor-General then presented another report which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Audit suggests that the Central Office should prepare for dissemination through regional offices both long and short term plans consistent with the achievement of national objectives, as well as a statement of priorities to facilitate the co-ordination and timely execution of these plans. </PARA>
<PARA>We believed, as did Audit, that the replies given by the Department were unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> I drew this matter to the attention of the officers at the Estimates committee hearing. The only comment I got from the officer on two occasions was: 'I just cannot accept what Audit had to say'. This is not an adequate reply. I believe that we need only to draw attention in debate on the estimates of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations to matters which we have elucidated during our Committee inquiries and should not comment on them a great deal. I bring those matters to the attention of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle). </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to what Audit had to say which is reported on page 172 of the Hansard of the Estimates Committee hearings. I wish to draw the attention of the officers to the comments that I made on that occasion. During that inquiry we looked at labour market information. Again I draw attention to the fact that Audit was not happy with what was happening in this area. It was obvious to us, from the replies that the officers gave on that occasion, that there were inadequate staff in two areas: Firstly, in the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and, secondly, in the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I will not give the detail as it is recorded in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> But the officers drew attention to the fact that there were two problems which are facing the Department-shortage of staff in the Department and the inadequate data which came to those officers as a result of a shortage of staff in the Bureau of Statistics. Quite clearly a shortage of staff was reflected in inadequate communication. Head Office claimed to have certain objectives. These objectives were not clear to us when we asked the officers to outline them. They outlined a very bald set of statements which could not be accepted by anyone who understands management as being adequate for any major organisation. There is no need for me to stress on this occasion how vital it is for us to have an effective CES. We have at the present time the highest unemployment since the Depression. We obviously need an effective Commonwealth Employment Service which is adequately staffed and which has all sorts of adequate resources at its disposal. I do not have to go into a discussion of Job Bank data and so on. Obviously this is not the responsibility of the Department. This is why I am raising this matter during this debate. Quite clearly, the problems facing the CES are as a direct result of Government policy-a direct result in the first place of the short-sighted policy of cutting back on staff and setting staff ceilings in a growth area such as the CES. It is no good for the Department to come to us and say: 'We are not really short of staff. We have a couple of extra staff'. With the magnitude of the task in front of the CES at the present time, it is clear that there is a shortage of staff. There are not sufficient resources to do the job. We need more staff. I call on the Government to make staff available now to enable the CES to do the job it has been given. Staff is required at all levels, not only at the local office level where obviously, as indicated by the officers during the hearings, local expertise is needed, but also at regional levels and at senior planning levels, including the areas of manpower research and information. I will stop now in case any other honourable senator wishes to speak on this matter. I draw attention to the complete inadequacy of the estimates in providing for staff to do the job which the CES has to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a few words on the subject matter that has been raised by Senator Robertson. The experience of most of us is that the Commonwealth Employment Service is working under tremendous pressure and tension as a result of the Government's policies of across the board staff cuts which have no regard for growth areas or problem areas in the Public Service. Staff members, despite all their efforts, find themselves in the invidious position of not being able to give the sort of counselling, assistance and advice that are necessary to an ever-increasing number of persons who find themselves unexpectedly in a state of desperation and turn to the CES for some compensation, whether it be emotional or otherwise. One, therefore, has to raise with the Government the need to provide staff in these areas where such growth is taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have noticed in recent days that the Government intends to introduce a degree of computerisation to the Public Service. This may relieve some of the pressure in the CES in that it is hoped that it will increase efficiency there. Unless additional staff is made available for counselling and giving advice to people who turn to the CES as a relief centre, the Government will find itself unable to fulfil its proper role in offering assistance to those citizens who suddenly lose their jobs and have nowhere to turn except a CES agency. Fears are held by the staff and its union. The Secretary of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, Mr Cotter, has said that the introduction of computerisation may be used by the Government to fulfil government objectives in respect of reducing staff or just maintaining staff levels and may not be used for the purpose of enabling staff members to carry out their proper functions. If the Government is concerned about the unemployment rate and the general problems that exist in the CES it should ensure that the technology is used for the purpose not of reducing the staff but of assisting the staff in the very onerous task that it has in providing a service. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of parliament are aware of these matters. We find that this is happening in not only areas where the majority of the labour force might be considered to be supporters of my political party but also areas where members have a marginal majority and even in areas where a conservative view generally predominates. Unemployment is reaching out into strange new centres and areas. Consequently in some centres CES offices are now finding themselves under pressure for the first time. So one hopes that the Government will give the Parliament some assurance that in no way will new technology be used as a means of further reducing the staff who have the very difficult task of being the front line spokesmen for the Government when more than a thousand people a day are losing their jobs and turning to the CES for some assistance in finding other employment. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember earlier this week reading in the Press an advertisement for some 90 new members of staff to operate a major shopping complex opening in Wollongong. A total of 1,000 people lined up for those 90 jobs. That is an 11:1 ratio. In those circumstances we can bury for all time the talk about dole bludgers. When one sees such a response for a small number of jobs it is obvious that people want work. </PARA>
<PARA> Other members of parliament have found a similar situation in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. There has been a growth in the work load of this Department as it seeks to carry out Government policy. Members of the staff are absolutely unable to carry out their functions properly because of staff cuts imposed by this Government. I was talking to a representative of the Department only a few days ago. That Department has something like 3,000 telephone calls a day and 1,500 letters a day from people who are trying to get some satisfaction with respect to problems associated with migrants, and people who want to come to this country. Here again there has been this arbitrary imposition of staff cuts without regard to the growth factor which arises out of government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Robertson has correctly drawn attention to the fact that all of these growth factors arise directly as a result of decisions made by this Government. We want an assurance that the staff will be adequate to carry out the job. We should be able to get answers to the questions in the Committee stage which satisfy us that the staff cuts will not be of such magnitude as to create the sorts of problems that have been referred to both in the Estimate committees and in this chamber today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From what Senator Robertson said, I take it there was a fairly wide discussion at the Estimates Committee meeting. I note his comments and the Committee's comments with regard to some of the responses that were given at that time. The questions that Senator Robertson raised link with the ones that were raised by Senator Gietzelt. I can say that the staffing at the Commonwealth Employment Service is a matter that I know to have the direct and personal interest of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) at this time. Negotiations are taking place with the Public Service Board with regard to the staff that is required for the present responsibilities of the Commonwealth Employment Service . The Minister is very concerned that adequate counselling is available at the CES, particularly for the young school leavers who will undoubtedly be using the services of the CES very shortly, and for those who in middle life or later in their career may need assistance that would not have been required if they had had constant employment utilising the skills in which they had been trained. This is directly under the Minister's consideration. I am aware that he and the Department are discussing the matter with the Public Service Board at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am advised by the officers that if we remove from the staff figures of the Commonwealth Employment Service those which relate to functions that were changed as a result of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, such as the functions of the professional employment offices and the functions that the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations previously held with regard to the processing of unemployment benefit claims, there has been a 9 per cent growth in staff over the last three years in the Commonwealth Employment Service . Senator Gietzelt spoke of the effect that the introduction of computerisation might have on staffing. I am advised that the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) has already made a public statement that a significant proportion of staff surplus following the introduction of Job Bank through computerisation will be made available for other pressing work in the Commonwealth Employment Service. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we would all agree that there is probably more need for counselling and different work at present than for actual job placement, because of the reduction in job opportunities to which Senator Geitzelt referred in the instance that he gave. Even if staff have not the opportunity to process job placements to the degree that they may have had formerly, other skills are in demand. Those are the sorts of matters that are being discussed with the Public Service Board. It is certainly not a matter of introducing a computerisation facility simply to reduce staff. In fact, the whole operation of the Commonwealth Employment Service is at present under very active consideration and the subject of consultation with the Board. I expect that the Minister, when those consultations have been concluded, will be making further public statements with regard to the matter. I feel sure that the matters raised in the Senate Estimates Committee hearing have been drawn to the attention of the Minister and that he would be aware of questions with regard to national objectives, the dissemination of Central Office information to regional offices and matters of that sort. If the Minister wishes to respond to any aspects of the comments today of Senator Robertson and Senator Gietzelt I will see that the Senate is advised accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the comments of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) on this matter. It is not my intention in these debates to ask questions but rather to bring to the Minister's notice certain matters which come out of the Estimates committee hearings. I am encouraged by the thought that there will be an increase in the number of staff employed by the Commonwealth Employment Service. It was quite clear from the evidence given to us by the officers themselves that there were in the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations insufficient staff to do the job that was there to be done. I am surprised that there has been a 9 per cent increase, because if there has and the Service is still short of staff things must have been pretty bad. Perhaps that is the reason the credibility of the CES in some parts of Australia has not been as high as the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) or I would want to see it. I hope that the additional staff will not fall into the pious hopes area that Estimates Committee E mentioned in its report. One of the officers said: 'We haven't got as many staff; we haven't got as many resources, but we will do more work'. Quite obviously, there has to be a correlation between the amount of staff and the work which has to be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now raise another matter, one to which the Minister referred briefly in her response; that is, the professional employment office, which the Review of Commonwealth Functions abolished. I believe that was most unfortunate because it was one of the most effective of the Department's operations. Its abolition caused a loss of morale in the Commonwealth Employment Service. During the Committee's inquiries it was indicated that the cessation of this service led to many officers in the Department feeling that their work had been downgraded quite a deal. The attitude of the Government towards the professional employment office was indicated by Senator Sir John Carrick during the Committee's inquiry, when, as the Hansard of Estimates Committee E of 10 September indicates, he said :</PARA>
<PARA> Surely the test of this is whether or not in the end result the volume of employment of those seeking employment is more or less. Whether or not the private sector does it or the government sector does it is only material if one can do it better than the other or if it is not being done. </PARA>
<PARA>The attitude of the Age newspaper was cited by my colleague, Senator Childs who, in the course of asking a question, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Age recently reported that the Commonwealth Employment Service is being ' crippled' by staff cuts--</PARA>
<PARA>I have already mentioned that-</PARA>
<PARA>Budget constraints and the hiving off to the private sector of the more successful CES operations. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to develop the fact that one of the more successful operations referred was the professional employment office. I deplore this handing over to private enterprise of one of the most important aspects of the CES. I cannot accept the Minister's assessment. I do not have to read it out again. It is a strange government that makes a decision to hand over an organisation, or a section of an organisation, that is gaining money and then complains about a department losing money. That is exactly what was happening. The PEO was one of the most effective services. It provided a service to the community of Australia , so the Government hived it off to private enterprise. The added disadvantage- this is what I complain about-is that this action brought with it a low morale in the Service. Any decision taken by government which introduces low morale obviously has to be questioned in this place. The decision also brought with it the fact that the Department lost an opportunity to provide really good quality people for those employers, either government or private, for whom it sought to provide them. A third effect which I think is most unfortunate, is that the Department has lost an opportunity to maintain some sort of oversight of the flow of professsional or skilled personnel. I do not want to speak at any length on this but I ask the Minister to look very closely at the hiving off of the professional employment office. Because of the matters raised in the report and the few brief comments I have made I ask the Minister to reconsider the decision of the razor gang and to reintroduce to the CES the PEO. </PARA>
<PARA> I now address my remarks to the estimates for the Department of National Development and Energy and I draw attention to page 3 of the Committee's report which deals with our concern regarding the Northern Territory power station. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee notes that there have been suggestions that construction of the power station appears to be below the primary surge line and that in the event of a cyclone it could be swamped to a depth of one metre. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that in the case of such substantial outlays, it is simply a matter of prudent management that the Commonwealth should require that a particular project be subject to its own expert evaluation of all aspects of the project. </PARA>
<PARA>I have raised in this chamber over the past couple of years the matter of Channel Island. When I first raised the matter I said that information had come to me that the proposal to put the power station on Channel Island was unwise because, in the event of a cyclone, the island itself would be below the surge line. The first response I received from the Minister, in the chamber, followed his having consulted the Northern Territory Government. An attempt was made to dodge the issue. All sorts of comments were made about mean tides, spring tides and so on as if I were referring to the normal tidal movements within Darwin Harbour. Quite clearly, that was not so. I pursued the matter and the Government then accepted the fact that the site was below the surge line. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government then said that, because of the bund wall and the construction that would take place there it did not really matter if, in the event of a cyclone, a power station was a metre below water. I do not think many of us could accept that proposition. I am not an electrical engineer but one has a vague idea that if one subjects a power station to inundation by a foot of water it must have some deleterious effect. Certainly, it is not sufficient to say: ' We do not get many cyclones; it is not often that there is a tidal surge; we will take the risk; we will spend this money and the odds that it will happen are not very high'. For those of us who lived through 1974 in Darwin the odds are high enough for us to be concerned. It is not as if there is no alternative location for the Channel Island station. My reason for raising the matter here is not to make any comments about the Northern Territory Government-I will make those in another place-but rather to comment about the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern, expressed during the Estimates hearings and again now, is that the Commonwealth made no evaluation of the project. It was prepared to take the word of the Northern Territory Government. I find it commendable, as a Northern Territory person, to be able to say: 'I am glad that you hold our Government in a high regard', but I deplore any sort of business enterprise which is prepared to outlay $124m of Australian taxpayers' money on a project that has not been investigated. Obviously this is pretty poor management. It is pretty poor for the Australian Government to say: 'We will give you $124m on your say-so that everything will be all right'. Quite clearly, everything is not all right. From the replies being given to me, quite clearly the situation is that the station will be covered by one metre of water in the event of a cyclone. </PARA>

I would be happy if even an outside person went to assess the situation so that $124m of our money does not go down the drain. Also, in the event of an unfortunate situation, another calamity in Darwin, we would be left without power and we would have to build another power station. It is quite clear that there has been a dereliction of duty on the part of the Government and the Department in relation to this matter. I believe the Minister should carry out an investigation to see why this amount of money has been committeed without a proper investigation being made of the factors involved.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators and the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) particularly will recall that over the last year or two during Question Time and in debates a number of questions have been posed to the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Sir John Carrick, about the energy requirements of Tasmania. Of course, this is an important matter. Whilst Senator Robertson refers to Commonwealth funds in respect of the Northern Territory, there are scarce capital resources in Australia. The Tasmanian Government intends to plan to meet its energy requirements. It plans to use tremendous sums of capital in Australia to meet its projected energy requirements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the basis of my recollection of what Senator Sir John Carrick has said on several occasions, I ask whether the Department of National Development and Energy has revised its estimates in respect of the energy demands of Tasmania. I think that is an important question. As we well know, one of the problems facing our country today relates to the proper allocation of capital resources. We certainly need to know the Department's estimates in respect of those needs for energy in Tasmania. That would be quite relevant to the allocation of funds by the Australian Loan Council and certainly to the very strong views that exist in the Australian community about the flooding of the Franklin River. Therefore, it is important for us to know the Department's attitude in respect of the energy requirements of Tasmania. It should be determined in an objective way and not in a subjective way which, I believe, is the way in which the Tasmanian Parliament has dealt with this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the matter raised by Senator Robertson regarding the Northern Territory power station, the comments of Estimates Committee E were drawn to the attention of the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick). I think the points raised in the Committee are covered by the supplementary information provided to the Committee on 29 September. The Committee's report was written prior to the receipt of those comments. I would like to add one or two additional comments to the supplementary information provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Northern Territory Government's selection of the power station site at Channel Island was based on extensive work by highly regarded engineering consultants. Account was also taken of work done by the former Department of Housing and Construction on power station alternatives and storm surge in Darwin which recommended acceptance of a risk factor probability of overtopping by storm surge of one in 1,000. The Territory's current proposal in fact incorporates a risk factor of one in 10,000. The Commonwealth's evaluation of the project has been carried out through liaison with the Northern Territory which, of course, under self-government is responsible for all aspects of electricity supply. I simply draw attention to that supplementary information which was provided and make that additional comment.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt raised the matter of the energy needs of Tasmania. I do not have any information I can provide at the moment which would be in any way additional to information that has been given previously by the Minister. If further information can be given at any other time I will see that it is given. We will seek information to see whether any revision has been done. But as far as I know, there has been no revision of the information given previously by the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the comment the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) has made. Obviously there will not be a debate across the chamber. I think she has reinforced the point I made: A risk factor of one in 10,000 is not very high when one is talking about $124m. Also, I draw attention to the fact, which the Minister has overlooked again, that this matter is not the responsibility of the Northern Territory Government. The whole thrust of my argument was that there is a responsibility on the part of the Federal Government to make sure that it does not misallocate $124m of taxpayers' money. It is not enough to hand it over to the Northern Territory Government. The Northern Territory Government has a responsibility. I tried to draw attention-obviously I missed-to the fact that the Federal Government has responsibility because it is allocating the majority of the funds. I wish now to draw attention to another aspect of the report; that is, Rum Jungle rehabilitation. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee recommends that the Government should give urgent attention to expediting the settlement of compensation claims and rehabilitation of the area.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think I have to describe where Rum Jungle is on the Finniss River in the Northern Territory. It was associated with previous uranium mining. Let me read just a couple of comments from an article which appeared in the Weekend Australian of 17 November, entitled 'Hiding the eyesore of Rum Jungle'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> According to the second report of the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry (the Fox report), 100 sq km of the surrounding Finniss River floodplain has been affected by contaminants. </PARA>
<PARA> Fish and other aquatic creatures have been almost eliminated from the East Finniss River for between 10 km and 30 km downstream: pandanus palms, reeds, water-lilies and other plants have been killed, says the Fox report. </PARA>
<PARA> The radiation protection officer at Melbourne University, Mr F. P. Robotham, in Uranium: Energy Source of the Future? . . . wrote: 'According to an Australian Atomic Energy Commission report, the Rum Jungle project discharged some 2,300 tonnes of manganese, 1,300 tonnes of copper, 200 tonnes of zinc and at least 380 g of radium into the environment.' (Similar figures are quoted by the Fox report .)</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously this is a Federal responsibility. The Federal Government has decided that it will allocate $16.2m to the Northern Territory Government for a clean-up of the Rum Jungle area on the Finniss River. I have raised this matter in the chamber on a couple of occasions. I am still not satisfied that the work which will be done by the Northern Territory Government will adequately satisfy the obligations of the Federal Government in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to raise some questions. I do not like to do this in this sort of debate , but I must ask whether the Federal Government's responsibilities to the land owners in that area has been and will be satisfied by the Northern Territory Government work. What attempt has been made to compensate the people who have properties in the area? The Minister may recall that earlier this year I raised the situation of one man who had to get a permit to go on to his property in the 1950s and who, for 22 years, has been trying to move on to the property to live on it. At present he still has been given neither an alternative site nor any compensation for his block. He has made a clear offer in the way that a simple Northern Territory man would do. He has said: 'The block is this big; give me a block somewhere else on which I can retire'. The man is now in his 80s and he is still waiting to retire to his property. It is not enough for the Government to hand the responsibility to the Northern Territory Government and wash its hands of the matter. The Federal Government must make sure that any plan the Northern Territory puts forward not only is an effective plan to rehabilitate the area but also meets the Federal Government's obligations towards those people who own property in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to finish the few comments I want to make by quoting the final paragraph of the article to which I have referred. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Politicians and mining magnates must cringe at the words of the then Minister for National Development, Senator W. H. Spooner, announcing on May 21, 1962, that operations at Rum Jungle would continue despite lack of contracts: 'The plan of development for Rum Jungle--</PARA>
<PARA>Said Senator Spooner-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . has provided a useful model for other enterprises in northern Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA>I would hope that that is not the case. I would hope that the Minister will make sure that the people who want to move on to their properties in the Finniss River area either will be compensated or given alternative sites to allow them to settle. I would hope that the Minister will make sure that all of the Federal Government responsibilities are met by the plan which has been put forward by the Northern Territory Government and that the plan is not simply something which will patch over or band-aid the terrible disaster that is now the Finniss River area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask a question on a matter that I raised when the Committee was dealing with the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. I sought some information regarding expenditure in excess of $2m on plant and equipment. I wanted to know how much of that plant and equipment is purchased in Australia and how much is purchased overseas. The following answer was given to the Committee:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major proportion of plant and equipment (91.7 per cent) is purchased in Australia. However, about 60 per cent is manufactured overseas. </PARA>
<PARA>A table followed, giving a detailed break-up. Items manufactured and purchased in Australia amount to $810,200 or 40 per cent; items manufactured overseas and purchased in Australia amount to $1,047,300 or 51.7 per cent, and items manufactured and purchased overseas amount to $168,500 or 8.3 per cent. My question is: Why is it necessary that all of this plant has to be manufactured overseas; why can it not be manufactured in Australia? I cannot see why, with the expertise and skill that we have here-proven during the last war-some effort has not been made by the Government in this respect, particularly in view of the very high unemployment rate and the fact that Government departments have slowed down their intake of apprentices. Why should we have to go overseas to buy any sort of equipment? Why cannot it be manufactured here and so use our expertise? If we do not have the expertise here needed to assemble the equipment I am sure that we would have the machinery that is needed. Why cannot we train our own personnel so that we can be self-sufficient in the type of machinery which we are now purchasing overseas for enormous amounts of money?</PARA>

But I am advised that we are talking about high technology and as far as the Atomic Energy Commission is concerned I would think the appropriate purchases have been made. I will draw attention to this matter and see what information can be made available.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, as Chairman of Senate Estimates Committee F and on behalf of the Committee I would like to thank the staff who helped us and also the many officers who appeared before us. They were most helpful. Also, estimates are now being presented in a much better way than used to be the case. The format in which they are being presented reduces the amount of time that a Senate Estimates committee has to spend examining figures that are given to it. We thank the departments for the gradual improvement in presentation. I would like to comment on the need for Estimates committees to be able to meet more often than is now the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the meetings of Estimates Committee E a couple of matters have been brought to my attention relating to aviation which I would now like to take up. One relates to the possible closure of one of the runways at Cambridge Airport which is a small airport alongside Hobart Airport. I know that there is a desire by the Government to get as much local ownership as possible and to cut down expense at smaller airports. The Cambridge Airport at Hobart is an established airport. All of the runways have been established. The runways, including the one that I believe is to be closed from the beginning of next month, do not require much maintenance. The runway which I believe is to close is runway 27/09 -the east-west runway. If the runway is closed there will be a need to use a gravel runway-runway 24/06-which will cause more damage to propellers and so on.</PARA>
<PARA> There are several reasons why it is not a good idea to close runway 27/09. I think the decision or thought even to close the runway is quite crazy. The serviceability of 24/06 would be doubtful if there were prolonged rain in the Hobart area. The advice that I have is that in such circumstances the runway would become unserviceable. Also, runway 24/06 would conflict much more with runway 30/12 at the main airport at Hobart which runs almost north-south. </PARA>
<PARA> The runway that the Department of Aviation is thinking of closing is into the wind more that the runway that would remain open. There are very unstable and gusty winds in Hobart. I believe there is a need to keep this runway open. The amount of money saved by closing this runway is minimal. As I have already said, the runway is built. It is not a matter of having to put in a runway. The Department may desire, in the long term, to confine all flying operations to the Hobart Airport. That would be crazy. It would result in a considerable amount of money having to be spent on an alternative runway at Hobart Airport when there is already a good little airport that does not interfere very much with operations at the main airport. </PARA>
<PARA> Whenever the Department of Aviation wants to justify its action it seems to say : 'A safety factor is involved'. I believe it has said that this particular runway is a little too close to one of the hangars. I do not think that any fatalities have been recorded at Cambridge although several crashes have occurred. Pilots have landed aircraft with their wheels up. I think that back in the days of the Tiger Moth one plane crashed. I think the most recent crash involved a Victor that stalled on take-off. It certainly was not using the runway about which I am talking. The crash was caused by pilot error. It was not caused because of the location of that particular hangar. I can remember when Convairs used to take off at the strip that the Department of Aviation is now talking about closing. That aircraft did not seem to have any trouble when using that particular strip. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Aviation quite often brings up the matter of safety. During the hearings of Estimates Committee E I commented about the cost of training check pilots. The safety aspects, of course, was brought up. I am not happy about the amount of money that is spent on training check pilots who fly for only a few hours a year. For just a few hours they sit behind some of the pilots who have flown aircraft hundreds of hours a year and they are supposed to be able to check that their performance is satisfactory. The Department's reason for this is that safety is involved. Of course, that is supposed to cover a multitude of things. Millions of dollars are being spent on the training of check pilots. I have said before and I say again: I believe a lot of that money is not necessarily spent in the best way to benefit the airlines. People are sent all over the world to undertake training. Some of the training is undertaken in Australia but quite a lot of it is done in America. Once pilots in the Department have a certain licence capability then they command a certain salary. This is something which I will take up again at the next Estimates committee hearings. I think it is time we saw a correlation between the salaries of pilots and the training they have undertaken. I would like to know where this money is going. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cambridge runway is not unsafe because of the location of the hangar. If runway 27/09 is left open, as it should be, then there are certain advantages. It would not interfere as I said earlier with main runway 30/12. I have always felt that if the Department wanted to save money it could have less control of light aircraft in the Hobart area. There was a time when there were established lanes through which the pilots were able to fly. In Melbourne they have established these lanes. Some pilots tend to stray a little from where they should be. Such lanes could be easily established in Hobart, particularly for aircraft operating to the west of the Hobart main airport. There is no need for the Department to have radio control over those pilots. Commercial aircraft only rarely fly over the River Derwent. They usually do so on a pleasant day. It is a pleasant flight. Those people who have flown over the River Derwent and who have seen Hobart on a good day are very lucky. It was a very good day in Hobart when I went home last Friday. The Department of Aviation does not need to have as much control over all operations to the west of the airport. </PARA>
<PARA> The same applies to the east of the airport. There could be two or three lanes which are easy to remain in and which have good navigation points. I am sure the Government could save more money by doing that than by closing the strip which is completely serviceable. If the weeds are kept down by some means then I am sure that the bitumen strip would last for a considerable time. I believe that the Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife) is visiting Hobart on 29 November. I intend to see him then about this matter. I would like to ask the Government why it wants to close that strip at Hobart. How much money does it think it will save by closing that airstrip?</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to raise another matter which has come up since the hearings of Estimates Committee F. I refer to the examinations that are held in this country for commercial pilots' licences. Perhaps this applies to other examinations but only those involving commercial pilots have been brought to my attention. I believe that last year only two lots of examinations were held. The reason given to me was that the Department of Aviation was transferring to Canberra. If the Department is stupid enough to want to come to Canberra I do not see why pilots who want to get a licence to help them gain their livelihood should have to wait around at the Department's whim. I believe that these examinations are held only three times a year. Once these examinations are held it then takes six weeks to get them marked. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not done a test for a commercial pilot's licence. I believe that the questions are multiple choice questions and that the person doing the examination just crosses out certain words or ticks a particular box. Those types of examination papers which contain a number of boxes that are ticked or marked can be corrected very easily by putting a cover sheet over them. One can see very quickly whether the answer is right or wrong. I do not see why it takes the Department six weeks to get around to marking those examination papers. If the Department states that the delay is due to the number of examinations then why cannot it stagger the examinations in certain areas of the country? I believe that the Department conducts examinations in Sydney and Melbourne on the same day. I do not see why that it necessary. If all the examinations are held at the same time then maybe the Department has to mark them all at once. It is crazy for the Department to take six weeks to mark the examination papers. I do not know why the Department cannot hold these examinations more frequently. I have asked a question in this place in relation to this matter. I thought that I would have had a reply by now. If it is possible I would like the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) to explain why it takes so long for the Department of Aviation to get around to marking those examination papers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point I wish to raise was drawn to my attention by a story which appeared in today's Press. I refer to an article which appeared in the Australian dated November 17. The heading states: 'Pilot aborts landing as jet blocks runway'. The reason I raise this matter is that I am not sure whether the Press report was correct or whether there has been some mistake about the location of that event. The situation mentioned in this particular article is identical to the situation in which I found myself on Monday when I was flying into Sydney. I would like the Department of Aviation to check to see whether this is happening on a regular basis or whether there was a mix-up in the Press report about the location. The story reads as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The pilot of an Ansett jet aircraft had to abort his landing at Brisbane airport yesterday when another jet blocked the runway. </PARA>
<PARA>On Monday I left Brisbane at 6 a.m. and at 8.30 a.m. our landing in Sydney was aborted because another jet was on the runway. Those circumstances seem to be much the same circumstances of this story. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The Boeing 727 was on final approach about 8.30 a.m. on a flight from Sydney when the captain saw an Ansett 737 on the runway. </PARA>
<PARA> The 737 had been cleared for take-off but failed to move off in time. </PARA>
<PARA> The 727 captain executed a 'go-around' and landed on his next attempt. One flight controller said later this procedure 'would not be altogether abnormal'. </PARA>
<PARA>It may not be abnormal. But if one considers what happened in Brisbane and what happened in Sydney the day before, it looks as though it is starting to become normal rather than abnormal. I would like an explanation as to why this sort of thing is happening. To continue:</PARA>
<PARA> A senior operations controller at Brisbane airport said normal separation had been maintained at all times and denied there had been an incident. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The aircraft on the runway was lined up and had been cleared for take-off, but for reasons so far unknown, delayed take-off,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> A spokesman for the Department of Aviation said in Brisbane last night investigators have found no breach of operational procedures or minimum separation regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> 'For some reason, the 737 did not take off immediately and the pilot of the incoming 727 elected to execute a 'go-around', which is a perfectly normal operational procedure,' the spokesman said. </PARA>
<PARA>One would accept that it was a fairly normal safety procedure but for the fact that a similar incident happened the day before in Sydney. When I read the story I was confused and thought that it was the same incident and that there had been a mix-up. I would like to have the position cleared up by the Department to ascertain whether there was a mix-up or whether the two incidents happened within two days of each other. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the points made by Senator Townley, particularly the point concerning the evidence that for years has been given to the Estimates committees, first of all when looking at the then Department of Transport, now the Department of Aviation, with respect to the training of examiners of airmen for the more exotic types of regular public transport aircraft. I refer to the business of flying examiners to America, paying their expenses there, putting them through a very short period flying each year-10 to 12 hours-and some simulator flying time and then bringing them back to sit in judgment on professional pilots who are flying around 70 to 80 hours a month for nine or 10 months a year. It is quite simply a waste of time. The Department has never been able to justify the situation intellectually, professionally or in any other way to the Estimates committee in the years that I have been on it. One can only assume in a most charitable way that it is hallowed by tradition, that tradition dies hard and that no one is prepared to change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The position is analogous to someone doing medicine, never practising, being given about 10 or 15 hours a year in a hospital operating theatre and then sitting in judgment on specialist surgeons. The point is that it is not simply a matter of technical knowledge. It is a matter of professional judgment having to be exercised; and judgment comes through experience and repetition. We have fought this fight and intend to keep fighting it before the Estimates committees until we get a satisfactory justification as to why these very large expenses should be a charge against the Australian taxpayer. Since the Estimates committee completed its hearings one incident has come up that is quite relevant . That concerned the operations of a Qantas Airways Ltd aircraft. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting I was talking about the practice of the Department of Aviation in maintaining as examiners of airmen people with current experience on the types of aircraft used in this country. I was pointing out the great economic penalty and the dubious benefit of these practices with respect to the larger transport aircraft. Since the Estimates Committee dealt with this matter another couple of points of relevance in relation to surveyors and examiners of airmen have arisen which are worth commenting on. First of all, there is the matter of Seattle Airport. Honourable senators will remember that Qantas wished to originate a flight with paying passengers in the course of the delivery of a new aircraft out of one of the airports at Seattle. Before Qantas could operate that service the Department of Transport demanded that surveyors be flown in to have a look at this airfield in Seattle to see whether it was safe for Qantas to operate out of, despite the objections of Qantas management at the time that this was an unnecessary impost on the Australian taxpayer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This really was a ludicrous situation for three very good reasons. First of all , this airport has something like 100 wide-bodied movements either a day or a week out of it. Those aircraft are the Tristar, the DC10, the Airbus or the 747 which have requirements comparable to those of the 747 that Qantas was proposing to work out of this airport. In no sense was it a bush strip. It certainly met the American standards. Secondly, Qantas's own judgment was that the airfield there was quite safe to operate out of. I think that the Department had an obligation to consider Qantas's position most carefully in this matter because Qantas has an exemplary record in aircraft operations and the practices it follows. Of course, Qantas is one of the most experienced wide-bodied operators in the world. It is an airline whose fleet is entirely composed of wide-bodied aircraft, operating exclusively Boeing 747 aircraft. If Qantas's flight operations were prepared to clear the airport as suitable for operations I would have thought that that was an authoritative enough statement in itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the particular airfield in Seattle is approved by the Department of Aviation in Australia as an alternate for Qantas's operations, presumably into Vancouver. That means that Qantas can fly into this airport, refuel or disembark passengers there and fly out without any let or hindrance on its operations. It is quite legal for it to do that. The ludicrous situation arose that Qantas could not originate a flight there to take out paying passengers. The conclusion is rather difficult to avoid-that it was either an over-zealous use of authority or someone simply wanted a trip to North America to have a look at this field. There was a similar situation at about the same time with respect to Nicosia and picking up people going to the Commonwealth Games which were recently held in Brisbane. Again, Nicosia has been an approved alternative airfield for Qantas for many years. We will go into this matter with the Department in greater detail before an Estimates committee, probably during consideration of the Supplementary Estimates in March. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need for the Department constantly to review its policies and not to be ossified. One of these matters came up in Canberra last Friday when British Aerospace Australia Ltd demonstrated the new BA146 feeder airliner. I am not pushing the case for the 146; I just use it as an illustration of the need for the Department to review its policies. The Department has a policy that no jet aircraft operating on a regular public transport service can operate outside controlled airspace. That means that you cannot fly a jet passenger aircraft into an uncontrolled airfield. Many of our small country airfields are uncontrolled; they do not have a tower manned on a continuous basis. Yet, airlines are allowed to fly propeller-driven aircraft or turbo-prop aircraft into uncontrolled airfields. That was a fair enough decision years ago when the first generation of jet aircraft had problems, particularly in the low speed handling regime. They could not operate with conflicting traffic. </PARA>
<PARA> The basic point now is that the modern generation of jet aircraft being built for this role have good pilot visibility, very good handling characteristics in the low speed regime in their approach and circuit speeds, and some of them have low tyre pressures suitable for operating off gravel. It is quite a different case from the first generation of aircraft. The parameter to be set is not whether the aircraft is a jet aircraft or a turbo-prop aircraft; the number of movements into a field should determine whether it and the air space around it should be controlled. If only a small number of aircraft arrive and depart in a day there is no need to go to the expense of putting in a tower and controlling air space around that field, because operations can be made on a see and be seen basis quite safely. </PARA>
<PARA> We will see more aircraft like the BA146 coming into Australia in the decades to come, and I hope that the Department reviews its policies because the ability to operate these types of aircraft into the regional centres of Australia will be of great economic benefit to us. People who live in outback Queensland and outback New South Wales have very big distances to travel. There is a drift away from those country areas into the cities and if we are to keep people living there we have to provide them with the most efficient and cost effective form of transport, which increasingly will be jet aircraft.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise several matters. The answers to questions I asked in relation to the Department of Aviation during hearings of Estimates Committee F were made available to honourable senators just this afternoon when they were tabled in the Parliament. One of these answers is in respect of the Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan and whether it will apply to the Mount Gambier Airport. I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Have the sums been done to show what it will cost the local authorities there to come into the (Aerodrome Local Ownership) plan?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer, provided today, reads:</PARA>
<PARA> There are no current negotiations regarding the entry of Mt Gambier aerodrome into the ALOP. </PARA>
<PARA> The last approach to the Corporation of the City of Mt Gambier was made in June 1976 with a proposal for pavement reseals, and a new terminal building on a 50 per cent cost basis with the local authority. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time the local authority expressed no desire to enter the Plan. Accordingly departmental resources have not been committed to examination of prospective costs for either the local authority or the Commonwealth, if the aerodrome was to be operated under ALOP. </PARA>
<PARA> A revised proposal for entry of Mt Gambier aerodrome into the ALOP is currently being prepared by the Department of Aviation. This will be completed soon and will then be forwarded to Council for its consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason I raised this matter was that I had had a lot of correspondence from the Corporation of the City of Mount Gambier in relation to the aerodrome. As this answer was tabled only today I have not had time to communicate with the Corporation as to what its attitude is now on entering into the Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan. I hope it is not too long before this revised proposal, which it is said is being considered and will be completed soon, is forwarded to the Corporation. I will then have further communication with the Corporation as to whether, under the proposals put forward, it is prepared to enter into the ALOP.</PARA>
<PARA> In answer to a question which I asked at the same Estimates Committee hearing, I find that for the year ended 30 June 1981 a total of 41,637 passengers passed through the Mount Gambier airport. A total of 69,429 passengers passed through the Kingscote Airport, on Kangaroo Island; 2,788 through the Port Augusta Airport; 77,737 through Port Lincoln; and 48,387 through Whyalla. From those figures it would appear that the Mount Gambier Airport is a major country airport in South Australia. It is deserving of any assistance that it can receive from the Commonwealth Government, particularly in respect of the terminal facilities-that is, the waiting room and the lounge-as what is there is not very adequate. I hope that some agreement can be reached with the local corporation on whatever proposal is put forward by the Government to see whether the facilities at the Mount Gambier Airport can be upgraded. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter which I raise has caused great concern to many people who use charter aircraft. At the Estimates Committee hearing on 20 September 1982, I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Does the Department take any measures to advise potential hirers of charter aircraft that they will not be covered by insurance? Has any thought been given to that matter? Innocent people who charter an aircraft might be under the belief that they are covered by insurance and actually they are not if the aircraft or those concerned are not licensed to carry . . . passengers. </PARA>
<PARA>The answer I received stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959 sets limits on liability for all operators holding an airline or charter licence issued under the Air Navigation Regulations. In this regard all operations carried out under a charter licence come within the ambit of the Act. The Act does not provide insurance cover nor does it require operators to take such cover. However, the Act imposes a liability on the carrier, and injured parties are not required to first prove fault or negligence on the part of the carrier, as would be required under common law action. </PARA>
<PARA> The ad hoc nature of the charter industry does not give the Department access to individual hirers. However, the Department actively encourages all charter operators to take out insurance during the licensing process, although there are no requirements under Commonwealth or State legislation for aircraft operators to carry liability insurance. </PARA>
<PARA> A compulsory insurance system is one of the matters currently under consideration in the Joint Commonwealth/State Government context. </PARA>
<PARA>In respect of that answer, I ask: What progress has now been made in the consideration that has been given to a compulsory insurance system which will operate in a joint Commonwealth-State government context? I believe that many light aircraft owners and pilots may enter into some agreement to fly one or two passengers from point A to point B and the passengers may not be covered for compensation. If there is an accident the dependants of the passengers may find themselves with no insurance cover whatsoever. That concern has been expressed to me by various people. I hope that the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) can give me some up-to-date information on what is happening with this consideration of compulsory legislation in the joint Commonwealth- State Government context. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise one problem which has existed at Tullamarine Airport for some considerable time and which, I presume, will exist for quite some time to come. It relates to the quite extensive alterations that have been undertaken at that airport and the effects which that work has on passengers travelling on commuter airlines. At present, with at least two of those airlines, one is obliged to traipse up the full length of the airport to gate 10 to buy a ticket. Gate 10 is the gate from which those two commuter airlines to which I referred normally fly. The passengers are then told that the plane is leaving from gate 4 or gate 2 and they have to traipse all the way back again. That is all very well for people who are relatively fit and who are not in a hurry to make a connection but it is not very good for young women with children or for elderly travellers. The same applies to commuter flights. Planes at Tullamarine seem to be parked in all sorts of odd spots. Again, elderly people and passengers who have an affliction of some sort or another-for example , passengers on crutches-are obliged to walk quite considerable distances across the tarmac and dodge incoming and outgoing aircraft, baggage tractors and trailers and goodness knows what. I wonder when we can again see some semblance of order at that airport.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter which I raised during the Estimates committee hearings; that is, the annual dividends of Trans Australia Airlines. I do not think I need to go through the complete answer given by Senator Messner on behalf of the Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife), but clearly for the Hansard record I think I need to mention part of the answer given by Senator Messner. The answer states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Section 32 of the Australian National Airlines Act 1945 provides for the Minister for Aviation, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance and after consultations with the Commission, to determine a dividend target that represents a reasonable return to the Commonwealth before the commencement of each financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>There were a number of other points of which I think the Minister for Finance ( Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) is well aware. I raise this matter because the final part of the Minister's answer states:</PARA>
<PARA> The details of TAA's financial position for 1981/82 year will be contained in the Commission's annual report which will be tabled in Parliament later this year. </PARA>
<PARA>The question was answered on 20 September 1982. We are now moving very quickly towards the end of this year. Upon checking with the Records and Table Office I found that no report in relation to TAA has been brought before the Parliament. It seems to me that it is fairly difficult for the Government to assess the dividend to be paid by TAA when in fact the Parliament has not received the report from TAA in relation to that dividend. I draw attention to this matter because of a Press report today in relation to the losses faced by TAA this financial year. The report states that TAA's work force of 8,600 people may be reduced by some 350. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that some real consideration should be given to this issue. I am not sure what the report contains because, as I said, the Parliament has not received it. I am not sure that the Minister has had a look at the report, but surely the dividend to be paid to the Commonwealth Government should be lessened to a degree so that there will be no loss of jobs at TAA. We are already suffering enough from an economy which is causing a cut-back in employment throughout Australia. The Press report goes on to state very clearly that TAA suffers from a lack of passengers and a lack of promotion in order to gain passengers, and that those problems have led to the proposed cut-back in staff. I would like to know, if the Minister has seen the report, when the report will be available to Parliament and when Parliament can view the report in light of today's Press report which states that there will be a cut-back of 350 jobs at TAA. </PARA>
<PARA> Ansett Airlines of Australia, the airline which I use on most occasions, allocates seating by computer. I can have my seat allocated for the entire flight from Brisbane to Sydney to Canberra. But TAA does not have that facility available to it, which is very inconvenient for its passengers. That alone would cause some passengers to fly Ansett instead of TAA. If the Minister could give me some information on those matters I would be very grateful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the report which Senator Jones mentioned, concerning the sacking of 350 employees, but my Department and the Department of Aviation have had consultations with Trans Australia Airlines with regard to the finalising of its accounts for the past year. As far as I know, those matters have not yet been concluded, although I have had some brief comments from my officers thereon. I assure the Senate that the loss of jobs would not relate to any dividend that was required to be paid to Consolidated Revenue by TAA. What was said by the honourable senator indicates that there are difficulties in the trading results of TAA for the past year due both to some reduction in travel generally and to TAA having a smaller share of such travel as has taken place. When determining the dividend that should be payable each year my Department would certainly take into account all the factors that relate to the operations of the airline. Certainly the extracting of a dividend on a profit that perhaps has not been made, that might relate only to the sale of assets, would not result in a loss of employees to the company. The report would be fairly close to being finalised and it will, of course, be tabled in the Parliament. All of those consultations do take place between the two Departments and the airline before the final decision on a dividend is made.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief in my remarks. I wish to refer to a further point I raised at a hearing of Estimates Committee F with regard to VIP flights. In answer the Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife) stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1981-82 recovery of costs for the conduct of V.I.P. flights was $179,185. The rates applied for use of Departmental aircraft were:</PARA>
<PARA> F28-$2,500 per hour for period 1.7.81 to 31.12.81; $2,540 per hour for period 1 .1.82 to 30.6.82. </PARA>

<PARA>This is the part that I am querying-</PARA>
<PARA>-of $96,000 has been included in the 1982-83 estimates for the recovery of costs of V.I.P. flights. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that if we look at what happened in 1981-82 we find that an amount of $179,185 was recovered. Of course, the nominal amount of $96,000 is about $79,000 less than the figure for 1981-82. I ask the Minister for Finance ( Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) whether that means that there will be fewer VIP flights made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and other Ministers during 1982-83. If that is the case, I would accept the figure of $96,000; if not, I believe that there was a fairly substantial under-estimation of the figure of $179,185 for 1981-82. I would like an explanation of the amount of $96 ,000 given for 1982-83. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jones referred to some of the information that was recorded in the Senate Hansard following the Estimates Committee hearing. Of course, during Budget preparation, estimates are made of what will be either expended or realised in respect of the items dealt with. A nominal amount has been included for the recovery of costs of VIP flights. That figure was prepared to the best of the knowledge of the departmental officers and the Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife). The assessment that less will be expended by the Department of Aviation has been based on the information available to it. There is no other way in which I can explain it except to say that that is an estimate of the expected expenditure on the item during the forthcoming year.</PARA></TALK.START>

It seems reasonable to make the point that if that information was not available to the Department it was quite foolish to estimate an amount of $96,000 for the recovery of costs of VIP flights, which is almost $ 100,000 under the amount for the previous year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question deals with the Australian National Railways. I refer to the differential in rail freights from the Frances siding in the carriage of wheat. I was hoping that Senator Messner would be in the chamber tonight. I understand from people from that area in South Australia who have made representations to me that the Minister has had some dealings in this matter; that is, the differential in rail freights and the carting of grain from Frances to Port Adelaide and the neighbouring stations and also from Frances to the port of Portland. I do not know whether the officers here have any information which they can give to me, but some concern is being expressed by grain growers in that area at the fact that negotiations have been entered into and grain is being carted or transported by road transport to the port of Portland at a cheaper rate than that at which ANR can transport it from that area to the port of Port Adelaide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the instruction of the Government the railways now have to show a profit. It is of concern to me as a great supporter of our railway system and to the people who grow grain in that area that the railways are losing business because of the differential in freight rates for grain. Likewise, revenue is being lost to the railways in that area. They are losing revenue and they have had to increase their charges on small parcel freights to such an exorbitant amount that they are also losing freight. It has reached the stage where people are now able to go to Australia Post and send a parcel off much cheaper than they can send it by rail. Of course, when Australia Post gets the parcel it is put in a canvas bag and freighted by rail. The upshot of it all is that many Australian National Railways employees are losing employment. Country railways are closing. Sidings are closing down. Towns such as Tailem Bend are fast deteriorating. Tailem Bend used to be a big railway town. If the situation continues to deteriorate at the rapid rate it has in the past few years it will not be very much longer before it is a ghost town. </PARA>
<PARA> In my opening remarks I said that I hoped Senator Messner would have been present in the chamber, seeing as my informant says that he has had some involvement in the issue of the cartage of grain from that part of the south- west to which I referred.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I wish to pursue quite a few questions under the heading of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. The questions do not actually come under the responsibility of that Department. They concern the Aboriginal Development Commission. I did ask a whole series of questions during the Estimates Committee hearings. As it is just two calendar months today since I asked those questions I would have expected to have been provided with the answers. Unfortunately, as so often happens when I raise matters concerning the Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd, I do not get very much satisfaction either in this chamber or by way of the questions I have asked on Estimates committees over the years. The first question I raised is dealt with on page 744 of Estimates Committee G and the answer was included in the written replies to questions asked during the Estimates hearings. I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> May we have a list of the properties which you saw fit to investigate to ensure , to use your term, that the Aborigines were not being ripped off?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Perkins, who is the Chairman of ADC, replied:</PARA>
<PARA> We can provide you with that and the breakdown of the investigation costs for each property, as well as the legal costs. </PARA>
<PARA>However, when we received the written replies to Estimates Committee G we found his answer was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to provide the Committee with an accurate breakdown on the applications which Commission staff have investigated. Although all purchases which have occurred since the Commission's inception on 1 July 1980 have been investigated. The total number of purchases since 1 July 1980 are 16. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the amount of work which staff would need to undertake in regard to providing information regarding legal and investigation costs associated with each application investigated we are not able to provide the Committee with an accurate breakdown of costs against each property, however, the following investigation and legal costs incurred on land purchases since 1 July 1980 are:</PARA>
<PARA> 1980-81-$41,672.15</PARA>
<PARA> 1981-82-$58,286.71</PARA>
<PARA>What I was trying to establish was what ADC had expended in legal costs and investigation fees insofar as the agricultural company known as Ralkon is concerned. I was not posing questions on any others. That answer has not been provided to me. I am concerned about it. Later on during the Committee hearing I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Could the Committee have a progressive list of what court cases are still before the court, of those that have been decided and what the judgements are in each of those to this stage, and also the cost to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Perkins replied:</PARA>
<PARA> We will provide that list. </PARA>
<PARA>The reply the Committee has received states:</PARA>
<PARA> The reply to this question and questions seven and nine in relation to Ralkon Agricultural is currently being prepared by the Commission's solicitor with the assistance of solicitors representing the commission in Adelaide. Once completed the information required will be made available through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>That information has not yet been made available even though it is two months since I asked the question. I asked further questions the answers to which have not been provided. Question 9 was a question I asked about an instruction which was sent from, I think, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to the managers of Elders IXL about the amount of money Ralkon could use by way of overdraft. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Viner, when Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, gave an instruction that a stock mortgage was to be made available at a certain level. The company was concerned that it was not getting a fair deal on the sale of its stock. So it wrote to the State Manager of Elders on 9 August. Arising out of that on 13 August, without Elders IXL even asking for a lifting of the upper level of the stock mortgage, suddenly the level was lifted. The company itself did not ask for it. Somebody from some Department-I think it was of Aboriginal Affairs or the ADC-must have instructed Elders IXL to lift that level of borrowing. As I said, the company itself did not ask for it. </PARA>
<PARA>In reply Mr Perkins said:</PARA>
<PARA> From talking amongst ourselves, I can inform the Committee that we were not involved in that. Certainly according to our information here, we never formally contacted Elders about that. But we will double check that as well just to make sure. </PARA>
<PARA>I replied:</PARA>
<PARA> To make sure that nobody from the regional office--</PARA>
<PARA>I was referring to the regional office of the Aboriginal Development Commission in Adelaide. I was then interrupted but I was going on to say: 'Had instructed Elders IXL to lift the limit of the mortgage available to Ralkon'. In reply Mr Perkins said:</PARA>
<PARA> We will double check to make sure that nobody from the regional office has been given any instruction to make any contact of that nature. We will certainly double check to make sure that nothing verbal or written was given. </PARA>
<PARA>The reply I received stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Please see the reply to question six. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the reply to question 6 is that the legal officers of the Commission are at present compiling a reply. Question 10 asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Would it be possible to get a copy of the instruction that Mr Viner, when the Minister, gave to Elders-I think the company was called Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort then-on the amount that it would be allowed on the stock mortgage?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Baume replied:</PARA>
<PARA> Could we undertake to examine the matter and respond to the Committee? I just want to make sure that no issue of confidentiality is involved. </PARA>
<PARA>The reply again was:</PARA>
<PARA> Please see the reply to question six. </PARA>
<PARA>I have had some discussion about these matters with the people at Ralkon. I am disturbed about what I am told by them has been transpiring. This is not the first time I have raised this matter of the Ralkon Agricultural Co. in the Senate. I have raised it on many occasions. I am pleased to see that Senator Baume is now in the chamber. My understanding is that just recently the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs wrote to the chairman of Ralkon saying that because in years gone by his legal company had been acting on behalf of Ralkon, he did not think it fit and proper-I agree with him-that in his capacity as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs he should be involved in any matters concerning Ralkon. He said that Senator Baume would be handling the matter. As we know, Senator Baume was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs for quite some time. He is well conversant with the problems which exist with that company. He was also Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare for a long time. I had a matter referred to that Committee for investigation. As I said earlier, it seems as though every time something is done to try to get some answers to the problems that exist in this matter we run up against a brick wall. </PARA>
<PARA> On 27 May 1981 I gave notice of motion in this chamber that a select committee of the Senate be appointed to make inquires and report by 27 August 1981. Of course, if a Committee had been set up it would have reported well over 15 months ago. I will quote the terms of reference of the proposed committee. They are that the committee would be appointed to inquire into and report on:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The viability of the Ralkon Agricultural Company of Loveday Bay Road, Narrung, in the State of South Australia and the competency of the Company to successfully farm (in the interests of the Aboriginal residents of Point McLeay) the three properties it now occupies;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the relationship between the Company, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Point McLeay Aboriginal Council from the time of formation of the company in 1975 until 30 June 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, if the select committee is ever set up under the jurisdiction of this Government, that date could be altered to 30 June 1983 which would be three years after the date I designated. The terms of reference also include:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the relationship between the Company, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Point McLeay Aboriginal Council and the ADC since July 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) The provisions relating to membership, powers and proceedings be contained in a subsequent resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, I gave that notice of motion with the concurrence of the official Opposition. This matter was discussed in our Party room and it was decided that a select committee should be set up. However, the committee never was set up because the Government would not agree. I moved to suspend Standing Orders so that this matter could be brought on for debate. However, I was not successful. I hoped that the Australian Democrats would support us but for reasons best known to them they would not do so. As a result, an inquiry has never been held.</PARA>
<PARA> Since then, of course, there has been a whole host of cases in the courts. Whilst it has been said to me that it would have cost a lot of money to run the Senate select committee I feel that it has cost a darn sight more money in legal expenses in the meantime, money wasted which could well be spent on the welfare of Aborigines. The Aboriginal Development Commission is wasting Department of Aboriginal Affairs money trying to bring down Ralkon by conducting court cases. I am happy to say that every case the Commission has brought before the court has been thrown out. Ralkon has won and costs have been awarded against the ADC. Only last week another appeal brought before the Federal Court by the ADC was thrown out by three judges without witnesses from Ralkon being called. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I say that this is a sorry saga. It is time this matter was put to rest. I hope we do not have to wait until after the next Federal election when we will get a Labor Government for this to happen. Senator Thomas indicates to me that I should wind up my speech. However, this issue is of great concern to the Aboriginal people who live on Ralkon land and at Point MacLeay. I am very saddened to say that this Government is not concerned about their welfare. All it seems to be concerned about is protecting people in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs who were involved in this matter in years gone by. It may even be too late to call some people before an inquiry because a lot of those officers who were involved may now be retired from the Department. However, I am happy to say that if we get a change of Government the decision of my party is that a public inquiry will be held. The sooner we can get a change of government and have this public inquiry the better. </PARA>
<PARA> I get back to what I started on. Why cannot the answers be provided? Why have not the legal advisers to the ADC been able to come up with the answers? Why are they hiding behind a cover? I suggest they are doing so because Ralkon's lawyers have been told that they need to be paid before any further cases proceed on behalf of the ADC. They will not go on forever and a day without being paid for the legal expenses that they incur in taking cases to court on behalf of the ADC . As I have said, two calendar months have now gone by since I last asked these questions at the Estimates committee meeting. I have not been provided with an answer. It seems that something smells about the whole thing. Why can we not get this matter over and done with? If there are culprits on either side let them be dealt with, but for goodness sake let us solve the matter. Let the Ralkon Agricultural Co. and the people who live at Point MacLeay farm the beautiful piece of land to the benefit of the Aboriginal people who live there. Why should we be wasting an enormous amount of money which is provided by the taxpayers to the ADC in a continuous round of court litigation for the purpose of trying to prove a point. I say to Senator Baume: It is high time that something was done about this. I know that Senator Baume and his Government will not agree to the establishment of a select committee. Goodness knows, there have been select committees on other matters. Although they have been important, in my view and in the view of many people, nothing is as important as taxpayers' money going down the gurgler, week after week, in useless court cases-actions which are trying to downgrade those fine Aboriginals who farm that property. It is high time something was done. I will await Senator Baume's answer before I have something more to say on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think honourable senators are aware that there has been dissension for some years between the Point McLeay Community Council Inc. and the Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd. That company was set up by the Point McLeay Council to operate its farming interests. The present dispute is essentially one regarding which body should have control over the farming enterprise. That is what it is all about. There is an asset and the question is: Who shall control the use of that asset? More particularly, it involves the Aboriginal Development Commission owned portion of the farming enterprise. As Senator McLaren has told us, that part is known as Bartlett's Farm. That is what the dispute is about-who shall control that piece of property. The dispute over control has actually resulted in a number of court actions. My advice in October was that none of those actions has been decided. Senator McLaren may have some more recent information but, in any event, that would not alter the thrust of what I am saying. That is what the dispute is about and that is what the court cases are about. I have been able to bring some extra information into the chamber which may assist Senator McLaren. I can give it without a lot of shouting and yelling. This is a long-standing matter. It is not helped by all the rodomontade--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wonder whether the honourable senator wants the information or not. In relation to question No. 6 I have been advised by the Aboriginal Development Commission that all the central office files in respect of the Ralkon matter were in Adelaide with the solicitors acting on the Commission's behalf. It took some time to get to the files and to get some of the information required. Question No. 6 reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Could the Committee have a progressive list of what court cases are still before the court . . . those that have been decided and what the judgments are in each of those to this stage, and also the cost to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>As at 17 September-I am not certain but I think that is the date on which the questions were asked-the three matters that related to Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd to which the Aboriginal Development Commission is a party and which were before the courts were as follows: The first matter is action No. 3205 of 1981 in the Supreme Court of South Australia. It involves the Point McLeay Community Council Inc. and the Aboriginal Development Commission versus Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd. At the time of this brief, no judgment had been handed down in this case. It was not possible for the Aboriginal Development Commission to give me any indication of what costs it might incur as that is principally dependent upon the final judicial determination of the matters at issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter includes actions Nos G50 of 1981 and G62 of 1981 in the Federal Court of Australia-Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd versus the Aboriginal Development Commission. As at 17 September 1982 these matters were the subject of an appeal by the Aboriginal Development Commission to the Full Federal Court against a decision of Mr Justice Keely on 5 August 1982. I will not go through the grounds of the appeal but the decision was subject to an appeal at that stage. I understand that that appeal has subsequently been decided in favour of the Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd. I think that might be the case to which Senator McLaren was referring. It is not now a matter before the courts as such although proceedings under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act will no doubt flow as a result of the appeal decision. One cannot say that all of the court actions are complete in relation to that matter. It is not possible at this stage to indicate the final legal costs to the Commission in that matter . </PARA>
<PARA> The third matter before the courts is action No. 3054 of 1981 in the Supreme Court of South Australia-the Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd versus the Aboriginal Development Commission, Charles Perkins and Wayne Prior. At the time of my advice no judgment had been handed down on this matter. The action is one of alleged defamation. It is presently at the stage of discovery proceedings. It is not possible to indicate what the final legal costs of the Commission will be for that matter. In respect of the above actions I can advise the Committee that a total amount of $19,434.21 has been advanced by the Aboriginal Development Commission to its solicitors. In addition, a further account for disbursement of the amount of $458.78 is outstanding and will be paid shortly. I trust that will assist the honourable senator in relation to question 6. I understand that the important part of question 9 was whether anyone from the ADC had any consultation at all with Elders IXL about the stock mortgage and whether any officers had given any instructions to Elders IXL. The answer I have is that on or about 13 August 1982 the manager of the Adelaide area office of the Aboriginal Development Commission phoned Elders IXL seeking information as to the current level of the stock mortgage loan. No instructions had been given to Elders IXL by officers of the Commission and the Commission had no knowledge of a subsequent lift in the level of borrowing prior to 17 September 1982. Question 10 asked by Senator McLaren was:</PARA>
<PARA> Would it be possible to get a copy of the instructions that Mr Viner, when the Minister, gave to Elders-I think the company was called Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort then-on the amount that it would be allowed on the stock mortgage?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer provided is that the Aboriginal Development Commission has been unable to locate in any of its files a copy of any instruction given by Mr Viner to Elders concerning the stock mortgage loan ceiling. However, there are on file certain papers which indicate that a ceiling of $30,000 had been set, at least based on some verbal-I take it that means oral-agreement. Certain copies of correspondence allude to an 'existing agreement' but Commission files do not reveal any formal written instruction. That information is provided by the Aboriginal Development Commission in an attempt to provide the outstanding answers to the honourable senator's requests. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I sit down I will make only one further comment in relation to a matter raised peripherally by Senator McLaren. It may be a good moment to bring before the Committee the fact that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Wilson) will no longer be accepting ministerial responsibility in relation to matters affecting the Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd and its affairs. It may be worthwhile making this known to the Parliament. Mr Wilson, before he became a member of parliament, was a partner in the firm of Genders Wilson and Partners. At the time he became a Minister that company did not have any brief which would have involved it in any matters concerning the Ralkon Agricultural Co. Subsequently it did become involved. At no stage was Mr Wilson, now the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, ever involved in the matter. He has no conflict of interest. But because it might appear to some that there could be a conflict of interest or because it might appear improper that the company in which he was formerly a partner has now got the brief, it has been decided that it is most appropriate if Mr Wilson, now the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, takes no part in ministerial decisions involving the Ralkon Agricultural Co. Because some may see a conflict of interest in the situation, the Minister brought the matter quite properly to the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). It has now been decided that, although the Minister will be kept informed on the matter, any ministerial decisions in relation to the dispute in respect of either the company or the Commission will be taken by me as the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. It is proper that those details be made known. </PARA>

I was aware of those facts from my discussions with the Minister about this matter some weeks ago. I agreed with him that he should not be involved. I know that he was not involved in any discussions which his firm had on behalf of Ralkon. I accept that.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I stated that even before the Minister did. I have no illusions about that. I accept Mr Wilson's reasons for not wishing to be seen to be involved in this continuing problem which Ralkon has with the present Government . I am concerned that the Aboriginal Development Commission should involve itself in contacting Elders-IXL in any way, shape or form in the business affairs of Ralkon. The ADC at the present time is contributing absolutely nothing to the working capital of Ralkon. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs when it had jurisdiction over Ralkon, over Bartlett's Farm and Block K-I am well conversant with that-even then was contributing nothing by way of finance. In answers to many questions in this chamber, I was continually told that, unless the Aboriginals sacked the white manager, no enterprise grants would be made available by the Commonwealth to help the Ralkon Agricultural Co. So, there has been no input of taxpayer's money to that company for quite a long period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am interested to hear the Minister in reply. I am sorry that we had to wait until tonight to get the answer that trying to prove its point over Ralkon had cost the ADC approximately $19,500 in legal fees up until 13 August. In fact, Ralkon is a properly constituted public company and most of the residents of Point McLeay have shares in that company. I wish that the ADC would allow the company to get on with farming the property to the best of its capabilities. It has great capabilities. The Ralkon Agricultural Co. has some of the best cattle there now to turn off even at the height of the drought. But, of course, until it gets some understanding with the ADC or some guarantee of some form of tenure it cannot operate successfully. </PARA>
<PARA> I have never advocated, as the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) would point out, in the representations I made to him when he was the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that a complete title ought to be handed over to Ralkon. I was always of the opinion that, whilst the present directors of Ralkon have my full support, it may well be that in years to come the directorship will change. People with freehold title to land could well dispose of it to some other person . It would be lost to the Aboriginal community there. There should be some way-I felt that Senator Chaney was fast reaching that point-of determining some way of giving land tenure to that company so that it could operate in the way that it wants to operate. It was unfortunate, in my view, that he was removed from that portfolio before he had completed those proposals that he had in train. I say again, without any apologies to Senator Peter Baume, that I am very sorry that Senator Chaney did not carry on with that endeavour to help those people down there. They are genuine people. They try to help themselves. What has been going on there for years is one of the reasons why Aboriginals are ridiculed by the white people of this nation. The Government is not prepared to let them carry out ventures like this, and particularly Ralkon. The Government has given title to other Aboriginal enterprises and registered companies which are listed in this reply. For some reason or other, the Government will not give it to Ralkon. There have been many meetings of the people down there. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume raises the matter of a dispute between the Point McLeay Aboriginal Council and Ralkon. He well knows who is behind all those disputes. I do not have to repeat their names in this chamber. That is one of the reasons why I gave notice of a motion in May last year to set up a Senate select committee to inquire all aspects of this matter. I thought that the terms of reference I proposed were all embracing so that every person who had some interest-whether it be the ADC, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Point McLeay Aboriginal Council, the Ralkon directors or any other person down there- would have the opportunity to come forward to make a public submission. I did not want to be on the committee because it could be said that I would be biased. I wanted to see a Senate select committee set up to examine the evidence put before it and then come up with a finding. I have said on many occasions that the people there and I would be prepared to accept whatever recommendations were made by that Senate select committee. But it appears that the Government, in its wisdom, is not prepared to let that inquiry take place. What it wants-this is not only my view but also the view of many other people-is to let the thing drag on and on until many of the people who could be well criticised for creating this problem are gone from the Aboriginal Affairs Department and it is not possible to call them before a committee of inquiry. I say to Senator Baume that if I am still a member of the Senate during the time of the next Parliament I will be pushing for that Senate select committee to be set up and undertake a full inquiry into the problems that exist. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said also for the public record that if I am proved wrong in what I have said I will be quite prepared to apologise if I have offended or humilated any person in any way. I am very concerned about this problem. Constituents bring many problems to me but this is the only one about which I find myself waking up in the middle of the night wondering what I can do to help the people concerned and wondering why we have a government in Canberra that has no concern at all for the welfare of these people, who have proved themselves to be good farmers. They can be a success. It might well be that the Government does not want them to be a success and have these projects, which it has delayed for so long, thrown back in its face. It is not only Senator Baume who has been the Minister responsible for this problem. Before him we had Senator Chaney. As I have said, I have given full credit to Senator Chaney for what he tried to do. I give no credit at all to Mr Viner for his actions when he was Minister. I even made a trip to Perth to plead with him to visit the place, to talk to the people and listen to their problems. Of course he could not even go and see them. That is the way that these people have been fobbed off, year after year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a long time since I first raised this matter in the Parliament. I think I first raised the problems of these people long before Senator Baume came into this place. We then had only one farm there, know as Block K, which was under the jurisdiction of the South Australian Aboriginal Trust. That was when I was first asked to go there. It must be all of nine or 10 years since I first became involved and tried to do something under the previous Liberal Government, before Labor came to power, to get these people assistance, to get superphosphate to put on the land so they could run their sheep. They had no cattle, although they do now and the farm is a credit to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing about which I am concerned-no answer has been given to my questions-is why the ADC still insists that paid agricultural consultants be sent to the farm. Only a couple of weeks ago they drove through the farm and cut the locks on the gates to get access. They never went to the director or the manager of the company; they just drove in and, with a bolt cutter, cut the locks to the paddocks. The chairman of directors had to follow them and ask what they were doing. So a lot of things are being covered up. I am very concerned about these matters and I make no apology for getting emotional, because human beings are concerned. They are human beings who are downtrodden. In many cases they are Aborigines. In this instance we have a group of Aborigines who have the ability and the desire to prove themselves as worthwhile citizens as other farmers so that they can farm a property which was bought for them under a Labor Government. Every impediment has been put in their way to prevent them from showing that they can be successful farmers. </PARA>
<PARA> I could talk my head off about this but I know that Senator Baume will take no notice of me. All he says, as he said a while ago, is that there is no need for me to shout and rant and rage and get emotional. As I said, I make no apologies for that. I believe that the people I am speaking for and the people who have made representation on their behalf are genuine people and if the day does not soon come when they are able to prove their worth all will be lost. They will lose hope and the place will go to the pack. Then the Government will come forward and say: 'Look, we told you so; we knew it would be a failure'. At this time I do not think it is a failure. I plead with Senator Baume tonight to do something about it, to prevent Charles Perkins, the Chairman of the Aboriginal Development Commission, from continuing these court actions and continuing this persecution of the Ralkon Agricultural Co. Goodness knows, it is taxpayers' money that this man is using and it is time that he was removed from the position that he holds. I am sure even the Government is of that opinion now. It is time that someone else took over the job as Chairman of the ADC. The Government, if it likes, can put him back as the Deputy Secretary of Aboriginal Affairs and let someone who has some heart and some feeling for these people at Ralkon take over this job and help prove themselves as a worthwhile Aboriginal company in this community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer particularly to Ralkon Agricultural Company, whose situation has been adequately covered by my colleague, Senator McLaren. I want to endorse a number of things he has said and point out a couple of other facts that ought to be taken into consideration. It is true that Block K goes quite a long way back in the history of the South Australian Aboriginal Trust but in more recent years, particularly the last six or seven, the acreage has been extended. It is the type of property which is well worth developing and with which the Aboriginals themselves have done very well indeed. The cost of the court cases in relation to this matter are quite alarming and I have no doubt that it will be much higher when all the figures have been added up. What amazes me is that, although a question was asked about this in September, it is only now, on 17 November, that any figures can be produced at all. I challenge the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) in regard to the figure quoted and suggest that it is nowhere near what the total cost will prove to be. That money, as Senator McLaren has pointed out, could have been well used in the area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I became concerned about the Ralkon matter in 1976. As far as I could ascertain at the time, the problem had been caused by an officer or officers of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. There was present a personality cult, and a determination by white people to even old scores and let the blacks cop what was left. That is the way the system operated. When the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Viner, was asked to intervene by both myself and by Senator McLaren, he was reluctant to do so and in fact helped further to inflame the argument that was going on. Again the pawns in the game were the local Aboriginal people. Senator Chaney tried to help while he was Minister, but overall I suggest that he condoned some of the things that were going on without trying to make any attempt to rectify the situation, so the problem went on and on. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume then became involved in the case. He followed the Viner line. He inflamed the argument and helped to create an even worse crises in the Aboriginal community. He did that quite deliberately, probably at the behest of other white people or of someone inside the Department. The Aboriginal Development Commission, at the end of the last financial year, was overprogrammed by some $7m. I could be quite critical of a number of aspects of the work of the Commission. I am not blaming the Board members. I am blaming people associated with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs who have used the method of washing their hands of responsibility, particularly in relation to the spending of cash. </PARA>
<PARA> In my area of Mackay a very successful fishing enterprise has been ruined because of this attitude and even the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Wilson) is not game to intervene. A boat was destroyed and insurance paid. The person who owned the boat was told that the loan money would be set aside and when he found a suitable boat it would be made available. It is no longer available. Another successful business enterprise has been sent to the bottom of the ocean, in the same way as Ralkon will go to the bottom of the harbour unless the Department has enough intestinal fortitude to stand up and do something about the whole situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I challenge Senator Peter Baume to go back to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Wilson, who I do not particularly blame. He has held his portfolio for a very short time and does not really know what it is all about. As far as this particular incident is concerned, I heard Senator McLaren say that his legal company was not involved in the matter. That was the story that was told. As I said to Senator Baume across the chamber a while ago, I am telling it now for the fourth time. A letter that came from the Minister today contains two glaring mistakes. In paragraph 3 it is said that the National Aboriginal Council was established by the Commonwealth Government in 1977. That is a complete misstatement of the fact. It might have 36 members under that title. If these inaccuracies are coming out of the Department they ought to be corrected at the departmental level. A Minister who is new at the game and does not really know when things were started can be used by a letter being drafted for him and his being made to look an idiot. It was started before the Labor Government went out of office and continued after that, with certain alterations. I think there were 42 or 43 in the original Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is an appeal for members and senators to talk to NAC representatives . In a far northern district the Minister is really helpful-or his advisers are- in saying: 'If you want to see the representative of QED you will find her office address at 159 Flinders Street, Hermit Park'. The street number and name are right, but that suburb is several miles from Flinders Street so a letter posted to that address would not reach her. They say: 'If you want to contact the NAC representative at home you will find her at 6 Surrey Street, Townsville' . Surrey Street is the right address but, without the suburb being named any letter posted to that address would not reach her. There are probably other mistakes. Those were made in my own area and I know the two addresses concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what is happening to the DAA. It has been reduced to a stage at which it is in bits and pieces, as it was in Peter Howson's day. So many things are tagged on. Nobody cares-the Government least of all. It is hiding money under various cases in an attempt to prove that in real terms it is spending as much or more than it did in the past, and it is not. The Aborigines are suffering. The legal service has been denigrated. It has been reduced to little more than a plaything of the Minister. Minister Baume is aware of the arguments I have had with him over the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Legal Service and the new so-called committee system. The only people who are suffering are the Aborigines who need urgent legal advice. They can no longer get it. They are going into the courts in country districts now without any legal advice at all. Today I had a phone call from the far northern parts of Western Australia, where somebody is in serious trouble. The Aboriginal legal service did nothing at the start because it does not have the necessary money or personnel; its personnel are scattered all over the place-thin on the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Minister to say that this Government has done more than any other government to look after Aborigines is a downright fabrication. Minister Baume was the man who said here one day: 'We guarantee that the new land rights system in Queensland will be adhered to'. Now, of course, the exponents of democracy and justice in the Queensland Government are taking thousands of acres of ground off every one of those reserves and saying: 'This was not in it in the first place'. What is this Government doing? It is sitting back and saying: 'Good on you, Joh. Take it off the blacks. They do not need it anyway.' That is exactly what the Government is doing by agreeing with what is happening. I hope this matter is properly investigated. I also will support the establishment of a select committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that in the Committee of the Whole we should not have to seek answers to questions; we should debate the matters referred to in the Estimates committee hearings. It is disturbing if the information we ask for in those committee hearings is not provided, particularly if it should come from departments. I was disturbed at the number of times during the day that I heard colleagues say: 'I asked for this information and do not have it'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come now to a question I asked in the hearings of Estimates Committee G to do with the review of electoral boundaries. When I raised the question in the Committee hearings the departmental officer said that the size of the National Aboriginal Conference was determined by government decision; the Government would make its decision on the size of the NAC on the basis of the amount of business and the nature of the business that the NAC had to consider. The Committee report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, it is somewhat confusing to the Committee as to the real purpose of this review of existing electoral boundaries. It would therefore appear to the Committee that there is a lack of clear guidelines associated with this review and in fact the general comments on this item in the explanatory notes are misleading. </PARA>
<PARA>We have no further information, although further information was promised. I now ask the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) the following questions: What are the reasons for the review of the boundaries for the NAC? Why was the decision made that the boundaries needed to be reviewed? Was it that the Aboriginal people themselves asked for this to be done, or was it a Government decision based on other information in front of it? What was the amount of $173, 000 going to be spent on? Will it be used for the commissioning of a consultant, for transport or what? The last question I ask is: Who will carry out this review of the electoral boundaries of the NAC?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was when I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that the need for a review of the electoral boundaries became necessary. It was partly as a result of requests put to us by Aboriginal members of the National Aboriginal Conference at the time. It was in the year leading up to the last NAC election. In one of my first meetings with the NAC a number of the members told me that they thought the boundaries were unsatisfactory. They were unsatisfactory for a variety of reasons. Some of the members representing Queensland electorates wanted, I remember, minor adjustments to their boundaries. I think they are like politicians everywhere-some of them had electoral reasons for wanting these changes. But requests did come from members of the NAC at that stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seemed inappropriate, impossible in fact, to review the boundaries before that NAC election. For one thing, the qualifications needed to become a candidate for the election required people to reside in the electorates for a certain period. If we had undertaken an exercise to review the boundaries and had not had it in place in time we might have disfranchised a lot of people who might have wanted to be candidates. So there were good reasons why it could not be done when the requests were first made. </PARA>
<PARA> There were other reasons why the review looked appropriate. There were concerns from some of the people who for broad kinship reasons thought the boundaries were inappropriate. One area that obviously needed another look was the area in central Australia where State and Territory boundaries have created boundaries to some NAC electorates. Other considerations-such as reasons of Aboriginality, which Senator Robertson will appreciate-suggested there might be a case for some of their electorates going across our administrative boundaries. Those decisions are very major ones and obviously required a fair amount of examination as to what the issues were. I remind the honourable senator that there have been a number of reviews in the past which have been used to assist in determining whether there should be a review and how boundaries should be determined. I think Dr Hiatt did a review some years ago. I think Senator Keeffe referred to the first committee that was formed. The Hiatt review at that stage helped determine boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government agreed in April 1981 that an independent review of NAC electorates should be conducted in consultation with the Australian Electoral Office. The difficulty was that we needed somebody who was experienced in electoral matters and Aboriginals who were experienced in Aboriginal matters to work together to carry out this review. The cost of this was to be met from the global funds allocated for Aboriginal advancement programs. As Minister at the time I can say that there was no difficulty with that. We could accommodate that . It had been requested from Aboriginal people and it seemed reasonable. The proposals had come to us from the NAC which had proposed not only that the boundaries be reviewed but also that the membership itself be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot answer from the information I have available to me at the moment some of the detailed questions which Senator Robertson has asked about the allocation of money. I think there is no difficulty in obtaining that information. I can seek to obtain the detailed information from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs , Mr Wilson, and let the honourable senator have it. But I think the Minister will agree that, in light of the representations that have been made about the unsatisfactory nature of the boundaries and in view of the fact that we had to get the NAC election out of the way first, a review should take place as quickly as possible. When that is in place enough time will have elapsed before the next NAC election for candidates to emerge and for people to organise themselves. To the extent that Senator Robertson's questions have not all been answered I will undertake to try to get the information and to get it quickly for him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point I wish to raise tonight is probably in a different vein from the points raised by the previous speakers, but it is in relation to the National Aboriginal Sports Foundation Corporation. The reason I raise this matter is that the Committee is looking at the estimates of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. The report of the Corporation was brought down . When the report came before the Parliament it was one of those days when there was no time for discussion on the matters that were listed. On reading the report I am amazed to find that the Sports Foundation has been in existence for approximately 10 years. When one reads through the report one finds that the Aboriginal Sports Foundation has done a number of reasonable things for Aboriginal sports participants in the States throughout Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the moment I wish only to deal with Queensland and then move on to what is being done for the Aboriginal sporting groups. If one looks at the 10 years that the Sports Foundation has been in operation, really a great deal has not been done. If one looks at the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, one would have to ask the question why more Aboriginals were not participating or representing Australia at the Games. When one looks at Britain and a number of other countries one finds that a number of coloured people represented the various countries throughout the Commonwealth. I think the only Aboriginal sportsman-I stand to be corrected on this point-who represented Australia was in boxing. I did not see any Aboriginals in athletics or the other field sports in which we were participating at the Commonwealth Games. If the National Aboriginal Sports Foundation has been doing the job it has been set up to do-I believe there is enough talent amongst the Aboriginal community within Australia-some of those people should have been brought to a level where they could have been participating in international sport and could have represented Australia at the Commonwealth Games. Perhaps that is not the fault of the people who have been participating in the sports. Perhaps it is because of the facilities which were available to the Aboriginal community generally through the National Aboriginal Sports Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is reasonable for the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Wilson) to give some consideration to this matter in the future. If Aboriginals have not reached the level of international sport at this stage some sort of training facilities should be set aside at the Australian Institute of Sport so that the trainers can go to school and be trained. This would mean that there would be a lifting of the standards of Aboriginal sports people participating in sport and this would give support to the National Aboriginal Sports Foundation Corporation . It is worth while considering that trainers should be trained at the Institute of Sport even if the people they are training do not meet the requirements to enable them to attend the Sports Institute. This certainly means that if the trainers were trained the general standard of the sport of Aboriginals throughout Australia would be lifted, particularly those who are being looked after by the National Aboriginal Sports Foundation Corporation. It is worth while quoting a letter that was written to the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> I have much pleasure in submitting the 1980-81 Annual Report of the National Aboriginal Sports Foundation Corporation, incorporating the audited accounts for the year ended 30 June 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The report outlines the efforts and activities of the Foundation during the year under review. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Aboriginal Sports Foundation Corporation firmly believes in the valuable role sport can play in the social and cultural development of the Aboriginal and Island people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Anything that goes towards developing sporting activity within the Aboriginal community should be undertaken. I only make the suggestion that the Minister take this matter on board and give consideration to what has been said. </PARA>

The honourable senator may be interested to know that the National Aboriginal Conference, as the elected body representing Aboriginal people, was asked to address itself to questions such as this, how sporting arrangments should be made and whether the National Aboriginal Sports Foundation Corporation was or should continue to be the appropriate body.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the Estimates Committee hearings , in response to a question from Senator Ryan, it was agreed that the current allocation of funds for family planning included a factor of only 8 per cent to allow for inflation in the 1982-83 period, despite the fact that the Government' s own estimate of inflation during that period was 10.5 per cent and, as we have seen, it is likely to blow out to considerably more than that. On asking what the effect was likely to be on family planning services, whether there were to be cuts in education programs or publicity or whether the level of services was to be diminished, we were unable to receive any very firm information. We were assured that the decision had been taken by the Government in the Budget context , so it was to the Government that we should look for a response to that question. In view of the fact that there is to be this shortfall in real funding and an increased number of patients to be dealt with-for many no return would be received; the people known as 'unbillables'-I thought it might be of interest to quote from a statement made recently by the National Health and Medical Research Council at its 93rd session in June 1982 concerning adolescent pregnancy. The statement read as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Council noted that there had been a decline in childbirth confinements among teenage girls, less marked among the age group under 16 years where the rates declined more slowly. The Council considered that this decline may have been associated, among other things, with increased community acceptance of the need for teenagers to have access to contraceptive advice and with a positive response by teenagers themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council recommended that efforts should be made to further promote the availability of the access to family planning information and the provision of advice for sexually active teenagers and that support continue for initiatives of this type. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, Council recommended that in order to promote responsible attitudes to sexuality among teenagers, training programs at post-graduate level should be available for teachers, health professionals and other resource personnel involved in health education programs for adolescents and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council approved in principle the need for special emphasis on antenatal care for pregnant teenagers. However, it recognised that the limited experience in Australia, the scattered nature of much of the population, the mobility of teenagers and the decline in births among teenagers meant that it may not be feasible or practicable to establish facilities directed solely to unmarried teenagers. </PARA>
<PARA> It therefore, recommended that antenatal departments in hospitals undertake reviews of their procedures and approach to pregnant teenagers in order to encourage better use of the existing facilities. Because of the high risk nature of teenage pregnancies, the Council considered that a comprehensive range of social and medical support systems are required. </PARA>
<PARA>The really significant part of that statement in relation to family planning is, of course, the emphasis on the need for preventive advice for young teenagers, access to contraceptive advice, and promotion of the availability of that access to sexually active teenagers. There was also emphasis on training programs at the post-graduate level and a comprehensive range of social and medical support systems. I suggest that this, plus maintenance of the current levels and activities, are expected to be achieved on a less than inflation increase of funds of 8 per cent for the current year. It seems bizarre to me that the family planning services of this country-overstretched as they have been during the last few years, being forced to cut back on crucial education programs and on their publicity and unable to keep up with the immense demand on their services at a time of financial and economic stress amongst the poorer people in our community-are being expected to further stretch their funds to keep up the level of their services. Apparently the Government is unprepared even to maintain the services at their current level. </PARA>
<PARA> I would be very grateful to have some indication from the Minister about whether the Government has an awareness of this state of affairs and whether it would be prepared, if given evidence of the need for extra funds, to give further consideration to maintaining the funds at least at their real 1981-82 levels. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise a matter with regard to health services research and development grants. Application forms for the health services research and development grants were apparently circulated by ANZSERCH and the Australian Private Hospitals Association in December of 1981 . The accompanying leaflet stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Department of Health invites applications for grants for investigations into health care services from individuals, organisations and government authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>The purposes of the grants were to improve through research, amongst other things, the evaluation, planning and delivery of health care in Australia and to provide information which would assist-presumably the Department-in the development of health services policy. The pamphlet went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The research should have some unique elements and be relevant to the Australian health care system. </PARA>
<PARA>The pamphlet listed amongst some fields of research which it said were of particular interest and relevance 'research into rehabilitation services'. At the bottom of the pamphlet was the additional comment that further information could be obtained from the Director of Research Grants Section of the Department of Health. It gave a post office box number in Woden and also a telephone number . In January of 1982-that is, a month after this leaflet was circulated-a constituent of mine applied for a grant to research morbidity and mortality characteristics of Australian veterans. As I have said, that was in January of 1982 in response to an application form which was circulated in December of 1981 . In September of 1982 this constituent received a letter which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Your application for a research grant to conduct this study was considered by the Health Services Research Grants Task Force at its recent meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>I have no idea whether that recent meeting which was referred to was the only meeting the task force had held or whether it was dealing with applications over a period. The letter went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Although your application was received in January this year, there has been a freeze on funds for the Health Services Research and Development Grants Program, which has only recently been lifted. This accounts for the apparent delay in processing your application. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought nine months was little more than an apparent delay, but I dare say the Department of Health knows best. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> In view of this delay the Task Force felt there was no point in considering your application at this stage, in view of the possibility of funding in 1983 by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, the letter does not say whether the doctor concerned had to apply separately to the Department of Veterans' Affairs or whether in its wisdom and mercy the Department of Health was going to pass on the original application to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The Director, Grants and Evaluation Section , said in the last sentence of his letter that he was writing to the Secretary to the Department of Veterans' Affairs to inform him of this decision. But again , it does not give any indication to the doctor concerned whether the information from the Director was going to be sufficient for the grant to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this raises a number of questions. First of all, it raises the question why, if a freeze were applied early in 1982-I presume it was early in 1982 since the freeze was lifted recently and the word 'recently' was used around September 1982-applications were circulated in December of 1981. One would have assumed that the Department of Health would have known in December-presumably it is a normally efficient government department-that there was going to be a freeze early in 1982 and would therefore not have bothered to ask people to go to all the trouble of coming up with an application, giving justification and so on for what are in effect fairly esoteric research requirements. Why did it take so long anyway for the Department to reply to this doctor's application? I say again that I find it odd that the Department of Health refers to the delay as an 'apparent delay' when there was a nine-month period between its receiving and responding to the application. Could the Department give me a little more information about when the freeze was lifted because 'recently' is rather a vague term, for how long it is going to be lifted and why the decision was made in the first place that having lifted the freeze it considered that the grant applied for on the topic of morbidity and mortality characteristics of Australian veterans did not qualify, apparently anyway, for a grant under the health services research and development grants? Furthermore, since the latest information I have is that nothing further has come from this, could the Department say what decision has been made by the Department of Veterans' Affairs with respect to the reference that the Department of Health made to it concerning this grants application?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An education kit for family planning, which was prepared by the Queensland Department of Health with the assistance of the Family Planning Association, was the subject of a question during the hearings of Estimates Committee G which was very adequately answered by the Department of Health. This matter concerned the use of a drug known as Depo- provera about which there has been a fair bit of discussion, some of it not particularly well informed, in the Australian Press over the last few months. I thought I might take the opportunity to refer to some of the material provided by the Department and some other information that I have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> An immense literature amounting to more than 800 references has now accumulated on the subject of injectable steroid contraceptives in general and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate in particular. The concept of long acting contraceptives has continuing appeal to many groups of women in all walks of life and to their medical attendants. It is estimated that one and a half million women around the world are currently using them. Injectable contraceptives have been used widely in many developing countries and in a smaller number of developed countries. Continuing controversy surrounds several unresolved problems. </PARA>
<PARA> There is considerable appeal to injectable contraceptives on a number of grounds. They are highly effective and long acting. They are simple to administer and independent of coitus. There is no suppression of lactation. There is a minimal degree of gastro-intestinal disturbances. They have the added advantage not only in developing countries but also in developed countries of requiring a regular one monthly to six monthly contact with health personnel which may be highly desirable. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of incompletely resolved issues and some of them are quite worrying. The menstrual side effects of Depo-provera have been the subject of a three day World Health Organisation experts symposium. Injectable contraceptives almost invariably produce major disturbances of the menstrual pattern. Their disadvantages include the fact that, once injected, they cannot be quickly removed from the system. As I said, menstrual disturbances can be very unpleasant. They vary from heavy prolonged bleeding to very infrequent bleeding. Some of the side effects are common to the whole range of oral contraceptives and include weight gain, headaches, bloating and mood changes including unpleasant feelings of dizziness, fatigue and loss of libido. These are all common to the symptoms reported by users of a wide range of oral contraceptives.</PARA>
<PARA> More serious effects however-these are the unresolved issues-are variability in duration of action, unpredictable return to fertility and possible foetal effects. There have been reports of congenital abnormalities and virilisation in experimental work with animals-a risk calculated by the Population Council at something like seven in 10,000 births. The blood levels of these drugs also may persist long after the last dose. These are serious questions but they are always addressed by responsible practitioners. There may be an increase in the risk of cytological abnormalities of the cervix, including carcinoma in situ. At present there is no evidence of this in humans despite 15 years' use. An estimated 10 million women have used Depo-provera. </PARA>
<PARA> In countries where maternal mortality and death from illegal abortions are high , several million women will die from unwanted and unplanned pregnancies in the final two decades of this century unless family planning and health services improve a great deal more rapidly than in the past. That information is contained in documents from the International Planned Parenthood Federation which discussed this matter. It is a matter of enormous concern to us here in Australia that every person who needs family planning advice and contraceptive advice receives the best advice possible. It is also a matter of considerable concern that the individual who is requesting that advice is given the full range of information, including indications for use and contra-indications. We want to be absolutely assured that, if the drug is to be used in Australia, the people who are using the drug-the practitioners-and those on whom it is being used are aware of what the consequences may be. </PARA>

<PARA>I am not sure whether the article is correct. But there has been a recognition by the Department of Health that there are some problems with dioxin in relation to the causing of cancer. The article goes on:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In considering the appropriation for the Department of Social Security I wish to raise just how the Department goes about deciding whom to fund and whom not to fund in relation to the various projects that come under its auspices. I wish simply to catalogue some of the problems that a voluntary association has when dealing with government departments to see whether this matter can be expedited as rapidly as possible and to see why an association in my State has been placed in the position it is in. I inform the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) that I contacted the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) to tell him that I would be speaking on this matter. Doubtless, therefore, her advisers will have information on it. I refer to a letter of August 1977 received by the Intellectually Handicapped Persons Association of Queensland from the Department of Social Security. To make sure that the situation is put as clearly as possible I quote from the letter in which Mr Lanigan, the then Director-General of the Department, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . you are aware of the current three-year funding program for projects that qualify for assistance under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act. Further, it is understood your Association has been advised that the funds available for expenditure on new or additional services under this program have now been fully committed until at least July 1979. </PARA>
<PARA>I come to a letter signed by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle when she was Minister for Social Security in which she also refers to the fact that money under that particular Act had been used up. The Association waited patiently and then reapplied. Next we have a letter written in 1981, four years after the Association first put in a submission. It was told that under the Act it would have to wait for three years. Senator Chaney, who was then the Minister for Social Security, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> I understood that your Association has been advised that the project would not be eligible for assistance under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A letter from Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle had indicated that the Association would have to wait and a letter from the Director-General had indicated that it would have to wait until the moneys were available at the end of the triennium. Having got to the end of the triennium the Association discovered that it was not even eligible under that Act. It was then told that it should seek assistance under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act. It did so. That was in 1981. There has still been no communication on whether the Association would be eligible for such a grant. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Association has been excessively mild in its remarks. I raise this matter because, as a voluntary association dealing with a government department it is, indeed, at the mercy of the advice that it receives as to what it should do when it seeks advances which are provided for under this appropriation. Surely in this case the Association has been grossly misled. Those whom they are seeking to assist are the intellectually handicapped left at home in the care of parents who have now reached such an advanced age that they are no longer able to care for them. Therefore, we are looking at a range of people-not children-who are probably in the 30 to 40 years age bracket. Their parents are now in their seventies or eighties and no longer able to look after them. They have cared for them in some cases for 30 or 40 years and do not wish them to be put into an impersonal institution. They wish them to continue to receive some type of home care. </PARA>
<PARA> The Intellectually Handicapped Persons Association of Queensland has been seeking to provide this. For that worthwhile task this voluntary association not only set about raising funds-it does so constantly by way of a whole range of programs, as do many of these voluntary associations-but also, as was sensible, approached the Government. But the Association was at the mercy of the Government and of the responses that it got from the departments. Correct advice should have been given to it in the first instance. It should not have been advised as it was in the letters that I have detailed. I repeat, after it had waited for the time that it had been told to wait it was informed that it was applying under the wrong Act. I ask the Minister what is now the situation concerning that Association. Since I have not previously put this question to the Minister for Social Security I do not expect that advice now. However, I would like the Minister to make available as soon as possible to these various voluntary associations the criteria for the provision of assistance. I have raised this subject before in relation to other matters but have not yet been able to get satisfactory advice as to how an association approaching the Government is actually judged in relation to these grants. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, I ask the Minister's advice on whether the Department of Social Security has available a brochure that sets out in clear and explicit terms what is available, not only under the various Acts that that Department administers but also elsewhere, to such groups as the Intellectually Handicapped Persons Association that would be of benefit to them in their work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise tonight the appallingly strict application of section 113 of the Social Services Act, which has been discussed before and which, for the first time since the provision was introduced in 1945, has been used to refuse otherwise eligible persons the sickness benefit. I raised this matter a couple of weeks ago and I have just received an answer to Question on Notice No. 2727, in which the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) stated that an average of 57 claims for the sickness benefit are being refused each week due to the claimants' failure to establish loss of income. These figures differ widely from the figures that I and others have been given. For instance, we were led to understand that in Victoria alone there were some 100 of these cases a week until the new special benefit provisions-which mean that eligibility can be determined by a Class 6 officer in the Department of Social Security rather than being referred to Canberra-were brought in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The new sickness benefit provisions, which honourable senators will know some genius in the policy section of the Department thought would affect very few people, obviously are still a nightmare for claimants and Department of Social Security staff, particularly counter staff, alike. Under the instructions the sickness benefit is not payable to those who, for instance, have been on invalid or other pensions because they are not considered income. In some places there is no doubt that the Social Security staff are so appalled by the severity of the instructions that, rather than put people on special benefits which are difficult enough and which lose for beneficiaries a dollar for every additional dollar they earn above their benefit, they are suggesting to sick people that, if they can, they should stagger across to the Commonwealth Employment Office to register for work so that they can then claim the unemployment benefit. At least that will allow beneficiaries to earn $10 above their benefit without penalty. As a result, they receive less penalty than they would if they received the special benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that Senator Chaney will not immediately instruct his officers to try to prevent this. I am sure that not more than a handful of sick people who are entitled to the sickness benefit are now drawing the unemployment benefit rather than the special benefit. He and his colleagues need not worry; these people are still below the poverty line. They are still unable to claim the supplementary allowance or fringe benefits, so I am sure the Minister and his colleagues, who seem to be determined to cut down in this area, can rest easy.</PARA>
<PARA> The interrelationship between the invalid pension, the sickness benefit and the unemployment benefit which we all became so aware of during the crack-down some time ago on the payment of the invalid pension is now showing up again. A great degree of trouble is being caused by the differential rates, the differential criteria, in the fringe benefits, if any fringe benefits are available, which are associated with each of these payments. Until this discrimination between pensions and benefits is abolished there will be this trouble with variable treatment in the application of the rules and regulations in various Social Security offices and the desperate anxieties caused to the poor, the disadvantaged and the sick who cannot provide the conditions for themselves to hit the jackpot, if you like, and to get the pension or benefit which pays the most. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), who is representing the Minister for Social Security tonight, to look at the answer to Question on Notice No. 2727 and to say how she or the Government can justify paying at reduced rates thousands of sick people without other forms of income, with no eligibility for the supplementary allowance and fringe benefits which other sickness beneficiaries receive. How does the Government justify the total exclusion of sick people from benefit eligibility due to the accident of their not having current earnings prior to becoming sick? Given that according to the answer of the Minister the cost of repealing this anomalous provision, which has arisen out of a decision by the policy section of the Department, is estimated to be about $10m in a full year-only 3.6 per cent of the estimated total cost of the sickness benefit this year-is the Minister trying to expedite the decision by the Government to rectify the injustice, an injustice that I think he recognises?</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I can assure the Minister, certainly on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, that if he is considering the amendments to the Act which he alluded to in previous answers and if he is considering in the amending provisions of the Act an eligibility for full time housewives and full time students who are not normally members of the work force, he will get no argument at least from the Labor Party. If they are sick or pass an income test then they must have had an income from somewhere. I believe a very difficult situation has arisen in this area. I think it is a matter which should really be dealt with much more promptly than it has been. I hope we can get some idea of the progress that the Minister is making in his considerations in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) was not in the chamber at the time Senator Macklin raised the matter about grants either under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act or the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act but I took note of the matters that he raised and I will have them investigated. He mentioned a particular organisation and that it was seeking a grant, I presume for a hostel for disabled persons. Funds have been set aside in the Budget before the chamber for handicapped persons assistance and for aged and disabled persons homes. The grants are made as ministerially approved grants in accordance with a number of factors that are taken into account, usually in the first instance by the regional offices of the Department of Social Security. There is a knowledge within the Department of the availability of services within the different areas and regions of Australia and it is usually at this stage of the development of both of those programs that the matter of filling in gaps in the services occurs . When all of these matters are placed in priority they are put before the Minister for Social Security and decisions are made with regard to approval that is given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that a particular organisation was advised that under a triennial program all funds had been allocated is the normal way in which that sort of application would be dealt with. The fact that it now finds that it was seeking assistance under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act when the matter would more appropriately be able to be dealt with under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act I think is something that can be dealt with by the departmental officers. Organisations such as the one mentioned by Senator Macklin-in particular the established voluntary organisations-usually have a very close relationship with departmental officers. If funds are available and they are within the list of priorities for which funds can be approved, that is how the decisions are made. There are criteria. There are leaflets and brochures on the programs carried out by the Department of Social Security. I think the organisation concerned or any person representing it would have free access to these through the closest office of the Department of Social Security. As a particular organisation was mentioned by Senator Macklin I will see that the Department looks at its application and gives it some advice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now that Senator Chaney has arrived, perhaps I can have a crack at getting some answers on some other subjects. I first raise the matter of the unemployment benefit pay-out and the present status of the amended figure that we have been dealing with in the weeks since the Budget was put down. On Budget night it was clear to everyone-at least on this side of the House-that the Budget estimate for the unemployment benefit pay-out was some $ 300m too low. Incidentally, I must say that when I suggested this in my speech during the Budget debate it was greeted with great derision by Senator Walters and others on the other side of the chamber. However a couple of months later the Treasurer (Mr Howard) admitted that there was this $300m underestimate. We made a rough calculation that the pay-out was 50 per cent up on the previous year, with larger than usual increases in unemployment benefit payments to come during the year, and yet the estimate in the Budget Papers was in fact up only 28 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was becoming clear some weeks ago, and it is certainly patently obvious now, that the $300m underestimate would have to be revised again. For instance, the October 1982 unemployment benefit pay-out is over 60 per cent higher than the 1981 October pay-out, and that was before the increase in unemployment benefits came into effect. I ask: Has the Department of Social Security given the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) a revised figure on the unemployment pay-out since the Budget? More particularly, has a revised figure been calculated since the Treasurer agreed with the Opposition that in fact the Budget figures on Budget night were some $300m underestimated? It is very hard to see how a reasonable estimate of the unemployment benefit figure for the coming year can be less than $2.1 billion instead of the estimated $1,567m which originally was in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also like to ask the Minister about the current advertising campaign concerning the Budget. I think the campaign refers to a family budget, and is allegedly an unbiased source of information for those in the community who seek social security benefits. I ask the Minister whether any of the money for this advertising campaign has come from the Department of Social Security or has it all in fact come from the Department of Finance. Is there any social security financial input? If so, how much? I think we had better ask the Minister to supply the Committee with a list of the newspaper, radio and television outlets in which the advertisements have figured and the cost of each advertisemnt in each newspaper and on each station. I note that while I was absent the Minister took my name in vain and claimed that this advertising campaign was partly the result of my urgings that in fact the Government use radio and television to provide information to social security beneficiaries and potential beneficiaries in the community because in fact this is the most effective form of advertising.</PARA>
<PARA> I point out, as the Minister obviously knows, that my concern was that this advertising be continuous, be concerned with ensuring that people know just what benefits, pensions and other payments they are eligible for and under what circumstances, and be able to do this more effectively than the present method, largely that of handing out pamphlets through post offices or offices of the Department of Social Security. The sort of advertising I and other people, including the various inquiries that have been conducted into this matter, have recommended for some time is certainly not the sort of advertising which, I understand from reports today, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal quite rightly says is political advertising-therefore the Government has to have authorisation-and was quite clearly designed for an early election campaign. The smiling faces and references to family budgets in the present advertising is no more or less than political propaganda and is of very little assistance to those people in the community who need more information on the sorts of benefits, allowances and pensions which are available. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I raise a matter concerning another group of people in the community who are in a difficult situation. I refer to unemployed school leavers and their families. In 1976, the present Government, then obsessed with a war against what it called dole bludgers, decided to stop the payment of the unemployment benefit to school leavers who could not find jobs. It decided not to pay that benefit until six weeks after the final examinations had been held or when they left school, whichever was the later. At the time, in spite of promises made by the then Minister for Social Security, now the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), who is sitting with the present Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), family allowances and student allowances were also stopped over this period. This year family allowance payments finish on the first or the third Thursday in December. In a time when unemployment is increasing-in some States the unemployment rate for young people in this age group is at a level of 33 1/3 per cent-and when, in an increasing number of cases, parents are unemployed, I wonder whether the Government has given any consideration to looking at this decision. Parents at this time have to feed growing young people with no less than average, or even more than average appetites, as Senator Chaney will learn as his children grow up. The Department of Social Security which has paid an allowance for those children since birth, cancels all of these payments at the very time when they need money for new clothes and transport, telephone money to hunt for work and food to sustain them . Government members, senior public servants and others have no problems with this policy. They manage to provide for family holidays and for this sort of expenditure. My concern is that it is the very poor families and, in particular, the unemployed parents-the parents who have been recently laid off in the considerable labour shedding that has occurred in all States in recent times-who not only have to explain to their children the difficulties of their present situation but also must do so when their family allowance and other allowances have been stopped and they are ineligible for the unemployment benefit. For the few thousand dollars saved by leaving these teenagers and their families stranded without assistance, this is a fairly cruel and harsh thing to do. Can the Minister not provide that payments of this type be made until the end of January, in light of the fact that such children are not eligible for the unemployment benefit, so that these families and children can have a marginally less bleak Christmas? I make the comments in view of the desperate situation on the unemployment scene and the labour shedding that is occurring in the community at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of matters have been raised. The Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, has responded to the matter raised by Senator Macklin. I did receive notice from Senator Macklin that he wished to find out about the position of a hostel for the intellectually handicapped at Burpengary in Queensland. On that basis I made some inquiries and ascertained that this is one of the outstanding applications. There are 49 applications currently outstanding in Queensland which will be considered when I am considering the allocations for 1983-84. I anticipate announcing details of projects approved for funding in 1983-84 before the end of this year. I do not propose to pre-empt that until I have had a chance to consider all of the applications. I thank Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle for outlining the normal arrangements which apply, and which apply in this case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Grimes has raised the matter of the sickness benefit and its administration. I will examine the matters which he has raised. As I indicated earlier in this chamber, the matter is one which I put before the Government in light of the interpretation of section 109 which was provided to the Department of Social Security some time ago by the Attorney-General's Department. The present estimate of the number of people on unemployment benefit is 460,000 as was announced by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) some time ago when he revised the estimate on which the Budget figuring had been based. That is a matter which, can vary and has, over a period of years, varied annually according to fluctuations in economic circumstances. So far an additional $300m has been mentioned as being required. What amount is required is, of course, automatically available under the special appropriation. There is no question about payments to which people are entitled being made whatever numbers might appear, but the estimate on which we are working at the moment is 460,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of advertising which has been raised by Senator Grimes is one on which, whatever line is taken by the Government, there will be criticism from the Opposition. Indeed, one consistently gets totally contrary views put by different Opposition spokesmen according to which argument they are putting. Senator Grimes criticised on radio the fact that we do not have adequate advertising campaigns. He said what is needed 'is a proper advertising campaign' . He referred, in the same statement, to the use of radio and television. My Department is contributing to television and newspaper advertising which is aimed to provide more information to the great range of people who are entitled to benefits from my Department. Income maintenance alone involves somewhere near two and a half million people with a considerable range of programs, but of course there are many other programs as well. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a very real difficulty in terms of knowing how to target to the various groups. I can assure Senator Grimes and the Committee that there will be a continuous program of advertising using various forms of advertising in the course of this financial year to draw the attention of beneficiaries to what is required. For example later in the financial year we will introduce new programs with respect to mobility allowance and the family income supplement. It will be necessary to mount specific and specialised campaigns to draw to the attention of the potential beneficiaries of those new benefits that they are available. It is proposed to use a mixture of media. </PARA>
<PARA> The current advertising is aimed to attract the attention of the wide range of people who may be entitled to assistance under variations in programs effected by the Budget. If one looks at the advertising in the newspapers, to which attention is drawn by the advertising on television, one will find a great list of categories of people who may be affected by changes in programs and who may need information. The advertisement in the newspaper includes a coupon which can be sent to the Department with an indication of the area of particular interest. Material is available on the specific areas of benefit. These can be mailed out to people making inquiries. In addition, we are using other forms of communication such as cheque inserts. For example, the Department proposes shortly to send out a cheque insert to all of those people who are newly entitled to the new pharmaceutical benefit by which they can obtain pharmaceuticals for $2. </PARA>
<PARA> A conscientious attempt is being made to get the information out which can affect people's claiming entitlements. We are using television, as has been mentioned. Television cannot be used to target to every specific benefit and category. It would simply not be possible to do that. Rather, the television advertising is in general form, directing attention to where information can be obtained. What is in the newspaper is more specific. Again there is so much detail, as all honourable senators who have received Budget kits would know. That has to be broken down in turn and mailings are available for people who respond to those advertisements. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, there will be a need for specific targeted campaigns in April and May with respect to the family income supplement which, as Senator Grimes has pointed out, is a benefit for which take up is a problem. We will be anxious to identify the target group there and to get information into its hands. The mobility allowance is something that we will have to specifically target to the potential beneficiaries. In the face of continuous complaints from the Opposition and in particular Senator Grimes on our failure to spend enough on advertising the programs of my Department and our failure to use a wide enough band of media, I can only say that in 1982-83 we will use a combination of media and means to try to ensure that the benefits which are available from my Department are known to those who are entitled to benefit from them. </PARA>
<PARA> A further point was made with respect to the family allowance. That is a matter to which my attention has recently been drawn. I am currently examining the position. The fact that children are not eligible for the unemployment benefit at the time when their entitlement to the family allowance cuts out was the point made by Senator Grimes. I will undertake to examine that further to see whether some change might be effected. </PARA>

I make the point in response to the comments of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) that this Association did not find it was ineligible to receive assistance under a particular Act. The Association was told initially that it was eligible under one Act and three years later it was told it was eligible under another Act. It was not the Association's problem; the problem concerned the advice it was given. The Minister at the end of her comments said that associations such as this normally have a close relationship with the Department of Social Security. The officers of this Association spoke most highly and warmly of the officers in the Queensland branch of the Department of Social Security with whom they have dealt recently. They found that the officers were most helpful and most concerned with their situation. Their concern all along has been that they have had to wait for five years to get to this point. I think that it is a genuine concern on their part. We should look at the procedure of how these applications are made so that no other association of this kind has to wait quite so long.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the remarks of the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, I indicate that I have advocated for many years a more adequate advertising campaign to make people aware of the benefits which are available from the Department of Social Security, and in particular to improve the take-up of many of the benefits, especially amongst migrant groups and some less literate people in the community who have been unaware of their benefits and who were not going to be made aware of their benefits by a few pamphlets thrown around in post offices and the Department of Social Security. I am glad to hear that the Minister and his Department intend to continue advertising on radio and television and intend to target the information to people who are unaware of their benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have some misgivings that the advertising might continue to be of the type that appears in the newspapers and has appeared on the radio, as I understand it , and certainly on television, and which has been recognised by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal as being political advertising. It should be recognised as such when the advertising consists of two, four, six or eight smiling people who are obviously paid to smile-very few people on benefits and pensions in this community would smile spontaneously-and which starts off by saying that as the Commonwealth Government's family budget is now taking effect the picture is changing for all sorts of people needing social security benefits. I believe this sort of advertising is aimed more at boosting the Government than assisting people. </PARA>
<PARA> I did ask the Minister who was paying for it. Is the money actually coming from the budget of the Department of Social Security or from the Department of Finance? If the money is coming from both departments, just what contribution is the Department of Social Security making? How much is it intended to spend on this sort of advertising or on the advertising which it has been inferred by the Minister will continue in the next year? How much more than the amount given to us in the Estimates Committee is the amount? How much more is likely to be needed if we are going to have the comprehensive sort of advertising campaign about which the Minister talked?</PARA>

The Bill is a serious and constructive measure intended to amount to a realistic middle-of-the-road solution to a number of constitutional problems that have been haunting both sides of politics in recent years. I hope that the Bill will be treated seriously and constructively in the House of Representatives after its passage tonight and I hope that it will find its way through the House of Representatives to a referendum of the Australian people in very short order thereafter. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I got the answer that I expected. I just want to make the point that three years ago the differential was reduced- the opposite of what is happening now-and on that occasion some $21,000 was spent on advertisements to notify the public that the differential was to be reduced and, therefore, the subsidy increased. The Estimates committee which considered the estimates of the department responsible for industry and commerce in 1979 was informed that the $21,000 was to be spent to make the public aware that the freight subsidy was to be increased. There is, of course, no necessity for the final consumers of the product to apply for the subsidy. It is paid to only a handful of oil companies, all of which are well aware of the conditions without any advertising campaign being mounted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point that I want to make is that when, on the one hand, there is good news the public will have to pay to be informed that there is what is perceived to be good news politically for the Government. The public will be forced to pay for an advertising campaign to convey that news. When, on the other hand, there is news which the Government perceives to be bad news for it electorally the public will not be informed. This is just another example of the double standards applied by this Government and the way in which it cynically misused three years ago public funds for political propaganda purposes designed to assist the Liberal Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to ask a couple of questions concerning the differential and the possible misuse of the differential by oil companies or by direct purchasers of fuel from oil companies. It has come to my notice that in Queensland fuel which was to be delivered to certain areas where the differential applied was not being delivered to those areas although it was so invoiced. It meant that fuel which was supposed to be delivered, say, to Goondiwindi and which attracted a substantial subsidy, was being delivered en route at Ipswich, Toowoomba and other places short of Goondiwindi. As this is a substantial attack upon revenue what action has been taken to prevent this from happening?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I give an example which is not an exaggerated case. The actions did occur, although I may not be correct about the actual town. Petrol was delivered to a place outside Mackay. For the sake of the explanation it could have been Mayfield outside Mackay. There is also a Mayfield outside Mount Isa. The direct purchasers claimed that the petrol had been delivered to Mount Isa, attracting a much larger differential, when, in fact, it was delivered just outside Mackay. Is this practice a practice that is known by the Department? What action has been taken to prevent it? Is it a fact that the field officers responsible for supervising this area are so limited that they cannot carry out the necessary spot checks or the paper work to prevent this malpractice? I wonder whether we could at this stage receive some general information and perhaps at a later stage receive some detailed information. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) can understand the extent by which the revenue can be affected by such false claims. If this is occurring one must add it to a number of other ways in which the taxation revenue has been affected. I ask also: To what extent is there supervision, if it is the responsibility of the Department, of diesel fuel to ascertain that those who claim the rebate are those who actually use the fuel? I know that under the new arrangement it was possible for a person to claim the rebate for the distillate and for that distillate to be sold through the normal channels allowing for substantial discounting in areas using this differential, discounting that would not be possible unless the differential, or the subsidy in the case of distillate, was being misused. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can respond only in a general way. To take the latter matter first, which related to diesel fuel, there was considered to be abuse of the arrangements that existed prior to this Budget. It was for that reason that the legislation has been changed and it is believed that the change will abolish or minimise the abuse that could occur. With regard to the other matter raised by Senator Georges, I cannot give any detailed information on the differential relating to oil companies and the claim by people about the places to which oil has not actually been delivered. Senator Georges mentioned one matter that had come to his notice . If he could advise me on that matter I could have it checked by the Department of Industry and Commerce for him. I think he has asked also for general and detailed information, and if I could leave it that I will seek that information from the Department, I will see that Senator Georges is advised.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I briefly make one further point. When the information is provided can the Committee be assured that sufficient personnel will be available to carry out the necessary spot checks in order to keep the matter under control? The real problem in many areas of public administration these days seems to be that staff ceilings and other limitations on the availability of skilled staff make it impossible to provide the supervision needed to prevent malpractice. When obtaining the information, will the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) look at this area to see whether or not the same problem which faces the Australian Taxation Office and other departments faced with revenue gathering exists in this case?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to follow up two or three matters which were originally raised in Estimates Committee H but which were not finalised. The first concerns a question regarding the date on which the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) was told at a meeting of the Australian Dairy Corporation on 4 and 5 May this year that a number of dairy companies had been misusing funds provided for stock holding by the Rural Credits Department of the Reserve Bank. The officer present at the Estimates Committee hearing on 16 September, Mr Nicholls, said he believed that the Minister was told on 19 May . He was then asked:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I find it strange that, in relation to a quite specific question asked at a hearing of Senate Estimates Committee H two months ago, to which the Committee Chairman replied 'We note the question and we will make the approach', no answer can be supplied to the Committee of the Whole. It is pretty clear that consideration of the estimates for the Department of Primary Industry will not be completed before the Committee adjourns tonight and I trust that the Minister will be able to provide an answer tomorrow as to whether there is a memo on file and whether it confirms the recollection of the officer as stated before the Committee two months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was moved by Estimates Committee H on 16 September that the Committee write to the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) asking whether he had been warned by the Chairman of the Australian Dairy Corporation that the Corporation' s equity in PT Australia Indonesia Milk Industries was eroding because the proposed sale of that equity to Kepum Bunga, an Indonesian firm, had been blocked by the Australian Minister for Primary Industry. Senator Archer, who was the Committee Chairman, very negligently in my view, but quite deliberately, did not write the letter in accordance with the motion carried by the Committee until 14 October--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will withdraw that. I will just state the facts, Mr Chairman. It is a fact that Senator Archer, the Committee Chairman, did not write the letter until 14 October, the day before the Estimates Committee report came back to the Senate. At the brief meeting of the Committee that was held on, I think, 15 October I asked Senator Archer the reason for the delay, and he said that he was away. I think he was at the Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. He was, as far as I know, in a position easily to have written that letter within a day or two of 16 September when the Committee resolution was carried, and likewise at any time within the next couple of weeks. Senator Archer has yet to give an explanation as to why he took four weeks to follow through a clear instruction of the Committee. Again since it is clear this matter will not be finalised tonight I trust that Senator Archer will come here tomorrow and give a more convincing explanation as to why it took him more than four weeks to do the bidding of the Committee which he was obliged to do as the Chairman.</PARA></TALK.START>

No doubt his staff are quite capable of compiling a letter, and probably did. I do not think it is usual practice for a committee chairman to wait for more than one month before signing a letter and thereby discharging his duties as chairman.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to delay the Senate but I wish to raise a matter which I first brought to its attention almost two years ago. It is a case which Senator Chaney, as the new Minister for Social Security at the time, took in hand. He undertook to give a firm and final response. We certainly then got a prompt response from the Minister for Social Security. The history of this case concerns Mrs Kathleen Beattie, who is a Canberra resident. Every time there appears to have been a decision in Mrs Beattie's favour the Crown, specifically the Department of Social Security, has refused to accept it. Nothing has been achieved for Mrs Beattie since Senator Chaney offered to take over the tangled bureaucratic mess and she is back in the same position she was in two years ago, facing large legal bills because the bureaucracy regards her case as a test case which she must not win. That is my reason for bringing up the matter again before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The background of Mrs Beattie's case is as follows: In 1978 she suffered an injury while on leave and later that injury was aggravated by her work in the Department of Housing and Construction. On 28 June 1979 a delegate of the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation ruled against her claim for compensation, but on 10 January 1980 the Commissioner reversed this decision and Mrs Beattie was declared eligible for compensation. The Department of Social Security appealed against Mrs Beattie's successful decision to the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Tribunal. The Tribunal ruled in Mrs Beattie's favour, so she had had her claim confirmed twice. The Department of Social Security again appealed against Mrs Beattie, lodging an appeal with the Federal Court of Australia on 1 May 1980. I repeat that the reason the Commonwealth has persisted in appealing again and again to frustrate Mrs Beattie's favourable decision being put into effect is that it regards her case as a test case. I certainly do not argue with that. </PARA>
<PARA> Mrs Beattie initially brought the matter to my attention not only because of the Commonwealth's determination to prevent payment of compensation to which the Tribunal said she was entitled but also because the Department of Social Security, in taking her to court endlessly, was landing her in extensive legal costs. At that stage her requests for legal assistance had been passed from one government department to another. It seemed to me at the time totally unfair that Mrs Beattie should have to bear costs in a High Court of Australia appeal when she had already won her case three times, and only because she was the innocent ex-public servant in a case which certainly had ramifications for the definition and application of what was called 'aggravation of injury'. For that reason I brought the case directly to Senator Chaney's notice in the Senate. He offered to pull the threads together to clear up the question of whether the Government would pay Mrs Beattie's legal expenses, as it was the Government that was keeping the case in court. In a phone call from Perth to Canberra on Christmas Eve in 1980 he assured her that she would not be up for those legal expenses. I certainly welcomed this clear and quick treatment of this difficult case but it was not, as everyone but the Department of Social Security hoped, the end of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The case went to the Federal Court and Mrs Beattie won again. The Department of Social Security gave instructions that Mrs Beattie was to be paid to 18 September 1980, but not after that. This further rejection of what Mrs Beattie claimed was her entitlement to compensation was then taken to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which listed it for hearing. After further points of order from the Compensation Tribunal which was now within the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as to whether the previous Tribunal's decision could be varied, the matter was relisted on 1 March 1982. On 5 March the Commissioner's office advised the Department of Social Security that the evidence supported the submission by Mrs Beattie's solicitors that she had been and still was totally incapacitated for work on and from 19 September, the Department previously deciding not to pay her from 18 September 1980. In fact, the evidence suggested that the incapacity was continuing. Because this was unacceptable to the Department of Social Security it decided to call the Deputy Crown Solicitor in to lodge an application for review within the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. That is where the matter rests at present, some four years after she first claimed compensation and some three years after she first successfully won her case. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past three years, as I have recounted, the Government particularly the Department of Social Security, has in fact fought her every inch of the way. I believe this is an extraordinary treatment of a former public servant and may be indicative of how little regard the Government has for its public servants. Mrs Beattie is wise and generous enough to acknowledge and accept that the Government has a problem with the concept of 'aggravation of injury' and it is entitled to seek a ruling which it believes is efficient and workable. I believe the bureaucracy has gone well beyond the bounds of what is reasonable in this case. For three years, as soon as the decision began going Mrs Beattie's way, the Government has put every obstacle in the way of allowing her to be paid compensation, compensation to which every tribunal in fact has agreed she is entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> This has been a time of anxiety for Mrs Beattie and her family. Not only has each victory been a hollow one because the Department has come back to attempt to reverse every favourable decision, but also the Department of Social Security has carried on not an equal fight but in fact what to many would seem a war of attrition against Mrs Beattie in the way in which it has used the endless resources of public servants, lawyers and finance. Mrs Beattie, on the other hand, has had only the resources of her husband's income and the family home apart from her own obvious spirit and perseverence. It is not, I suggest, a wilful perseverence but an honest struggle to obtain the right to compensation which the tribunals and the courts have consistently awarded her.</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that the matter is before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Nowhere in this speech have I canvassed the particulars on which a determination will be made. I am bringing the matter up tonight essentially for the same reason that I raised it two years ago; that is, the inequity of resources in a legal battle which is being fought by the Department against Mrs Beattie. There are cases in which it may be reasonable to expect costs to be borne by a person taking on government departments, but I suggest this is not such a case. I repeat that it is a test case which the Government has brought again and again against a former public servant who has received four favourable verdicts from the appropriate tribunals and courts. </PARA>
<PARA> The principle the Government wishes to establish may well be legitimate but it is not legitimate, I suggest, to put someone like this through three years of anxiety and litigation in what could well be construed as an attempt to wear her down. In particular, she should not be put in a position of being potentially bankrupted by legal costs in an adversary situation in which the Government has unlimited funds against an individual of modest means. I ask the Minister for Social Security to reconsider the situation in which his Department has placed Mrs Beattie. I ask him whether there is any justice in the refusal of the Government to give Mrs Beattie legal aid so that she can be properly represented before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and have some kind of an equal chance . I know that I raised this question some months ago, but I have not received a reply as yet. I think this is an important matter as I thought it was two years ago. We have a situation in which someone has taken on the Department legally, through the tribunals and the courts, and has persistently won. I admit that she has won decisions which have raised difficulties for the Department. I think at this stage, as I believed two years ago, that she or her family should not be faced with potential bankruptcy or put into any sort of financial difficulty in pursuing what she and others have seen in the past as the justice of her case. I ask the Minister to take up this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to express my shock and indignation at the treatment which the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills has received this week at the hands of the Standing Orders Committee which has failed so far to approve the new Standing Order which would enable that Committee to be put now on a permanent basis. I received your letter only today, Mr President, which indicated that this matter apparently has been deferred and has not been approved. I am amazed as to what has happened regarding this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The position is that the Senate approved the setting up of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in permanent form some few weeks ago. The Senate had debated that matter and it had a Government response. The Committee's ninth report set out in detail the Standing Order which we proposed. The report set out the various arguments why we felt that the Committee should operate in certain ways. Nobody in this chamber criticised any aspect of the Standing Order or the proposals of the Committee, which were adopted unanimously by the Senate and which so far have been frustrated by the Standing Orders Committee of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week, I learnt that the matter was to come up before the Standing Orders Committee on Tuesday of this week. One of the Clerks expressed a view that there might be some criticism of the terms of the Standing Order. I pointed out that the terms had already been approved by the Senate and it was a matter surely of technical detail only. I said to the Clerk that, if any problem arose, I would be in the chamber or in Parliament House last night and would be ready to go into the meeting at any time to explain anything that was required. It is important to remember so far as this Committee is concerned that it has now been hanging on for some months without being put on its final and permanent basis. It is important that a new chairman should be appointed to the Committee and that its new membership be appointed before the Senate rises for the Christmas recess so that the Committee can start off the next year in its permanent form. </PARA>
<PARA> In your letter to me of today's date, Mr President, you said:</PARA>
<PARA> At its meeting last night the Standing Orders Committee considered the question of the adoption of a standing order to establish the Scrutiny of Bills Committee on a permanent basis, referred to it by the Senate on 28 October 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>There is something which is a little incorrect about that. The Committee has always been on a permanent basis. There has never been anything tentative about this Committee. What has been tentative has been the separate membership of it. The Committee has the same membership as the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in this trial period. That is unsatisfactory. Some members on that Committee are not able to devote their time to the business and want to get off the Committee. It is altogether very unsatisfactory to wreck a committee such as the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee because of the week by week requirements which the Scrutiny of Bills Committee imposes. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, in your letter you go on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> During discussion on the matter members of the Committee drew attention to a number of provisions contained in the proposed new standing order, as recommended by the Ninth Report of your Committee, which were not contained in the original resolution of appointment on 19 November 1981 and appear to be taken from standing order 36AA relating to the legislative and General Purpose Standing Committees. Members referred to what they believed had been the original expectation, as implied in the 1981 resolution, that the Committee would operate in a manner similar to the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, rather than those Standing Committees, and queried the necessity for the expanded provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know where the members of the Committee got that interpretation from. In my opinion the Standing Orders in regard to the Regulations and Ordinances Committee are fairly outdated and are unsatisfactory. The Committee has been operating for over 50 years. That matter needs some review. What the committee for the Scrutiny of Bills is doing is very much in accord with the types of inquiries the standing committees now undertake. We thought that the powers we recommended which were adopted by the Senate, were appropriate to this new Committee. I have no idea why it was thought that the Committee would operate just like the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Mr President, you finished your letter by stating:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has asked me to ascertain whether the Scrutiny of Bills Committee , in recommending the proposed standing order, had any particular reasons for adopting those particular provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>I think we had good reason for that. But at all stages we were adequately ready to explain those matters to the Committee. It was absolutely vital that the standing Orders be set up this week so that the Committee could, thereby, have the opportunity of getting a new membership, so that the various parties could nominate their members and so that the Committee could operate from next week. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that I am absolutely fed up with this treatment from the Standing Orders Committee. I insist that the Committee should meet again before this week is out and that it should hear from members of the Security of Bills Committee. If the members of the Standing Orders Committee wish to revoke the decision of the Senate-the Senate has approved of the ninth report and the recommendation we made-we will face them on the floor of the Senate. I think we should know the reasons for their actions. I do not know why the members of the Committee did not raise these objections when the matter was being debated in the Senate. They choose to do it now at the end of the session when it is impossible to make other arrangements. It is clear that unless my plea gets somewhere in this chamber the matter will be left over to the new year. Frankly, as a matter of protest, I will probably resign from the chairmanship of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee if I do not get some satisfaction in this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Grimes has raised in the adjournment debate tonight the case of Mrs Beattie and, in particular, her request for further legal aid. Like Senator Grimes, I would wish to avoid canvassing the facts of the case because, as he indicated, the matter is before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. I think it would trespass against the rules of this place to go into the facts of the matter and, in any event, I think it would be generally undesirable to do so. The grant of legal aid is generally a matter for the Attorney-General's Department rather than the Department of Social Security. The provision of legal aid is usually a matter which is determined according to the means of the person who is seeking the aid, although there are exceptions to that. There are circumstances in which, irrespective of means, aid will be granted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When Senator Grimes intervened some time ago and when I also, as a result, was involved in the matter the aid granted at that time was granted on the basis of an exception which was defined in, I think, the early 1970s or probably the late 1960s in relation to taxation cases but which has been applied more broadly- namely, that if a case is being fought, in part, because of its test case nature legal aid should be extended. Although I have not refreshed my memory on the statement on which that was based-I think it was a statement of then Treasurer McMahon-Mrs Beattie's case was considered and thought at that time to be a test case. I should make it clear that in the very lengthy series of proceedings in which Mrs Beattie has been engaged there have in fact been different periods under consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it would trespass against my opening remarks to say that Mrs Beattie, having fought and won a series of legal engagements in the course of which she received legal aid assistance, as I have just indicated, was paid what she was entitled to and her costs. There were then subsequent proceedings which relate to a later period. It is with respect to those subsequent proceedings-the current proceedings-that legal aid is now sought. I understand that it has been refused because the applicant does not come within the means tests which are applied. In addition, it is not considered that the current action, relating to a later time, is in the nature of a test case. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to Senator Grimes, and in response to the direct representations I have had from Mrs Beattie, I propose to seek some guidance from the Attorney- General's Department on the issue of whether Mrs Beattie is still engaged in a test case or is simply engaged in a dispute over a set of facts. In other words, I will seek further advice and will further examine her present entitlement to legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that, for most Australians, involvement in litigation is not without difficulty. I am aware that the provision of legal aid generally means that people of only very modest means receive assistance. So, on the one hand I can understand that Mrs Beattie has some difficulty. On the other, I believe that difficulty is not unique to Mrs Beattie and her case should be judged according to the same sort of criteria as would be applied in any other case. However, I will seek further advice and in the light thereof further examine the matter to ensure that she is, within the currently applicable rules relating to the availability of aid, given fair treatment. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) For immigration purposes only an Incoming Passenger Card is required.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. Until 1980 the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs made available separate leaflets in a number of languages to help travellers complete the cards. Printing of these leaflets was discontinued because the Department found there was little demand for them.</PARA>
<PARA> If a demand is now shown to exist the Department is prepared to review the content and format of the Incoming Passenger Card and the possible reintroduction of the instruction leaflets in a number of languages.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. Details must be entered in the manual and computerised records in English must be examined by officers involved in clearing passengers. With nearly 5 million passenger movements per annum at seaports and airports throughout Australia, it is not feasible to provide immediate translation facilities at every point of entry in every language that could be encountered.</PARA>
<PARA> It might be useful to point out that the number of words required to answer questions on the card is kept to a minimum.

<PARA> (1) and (2) No surveys have been undertaken to assess, for any year or point in time, the proportion of the Department's total outlays on social security attributable to fraud.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1979 the Department established a Benefits Control Branch to develop systems for the identification, investigation and prevention of incorrect payments; incorrect payments may, of course, arise though fraud, unintentional factors or administrative factors.</PARA>
<PARA> In the course of this work a number of studies involving incorrect payments have been undertaken. These studies do not, however, provide a sufficient basis to estimate the incidence of fraud in the Department of Social Security.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Employees of the Australian Shipping Commission have been given a choice either to remain in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme or to transfer to the proposed new ANL Staff Superannuation Scheme. The details of the ANL scheme are still being developed. Any deadline by which ANL staff must make the election is a matter for the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) to (4) ANL has provided its employees who are contributors to the Commonwealth scheme with comparative information on the two schemes so that those employees may make an informed choice. ANL staff who decide to remain in the Commonwealth scheme will be treated no differently from other members of that scheme. The questions appear to imply that the level of benefits payable under the Commonwealth scheme to employees of particular authorities is dependent upon the adequacy or otherwise of the contributions paid by that authority. This is not the case. The level of benefits under the scheme, and the circumstances in which they become payable, are defined in the Superannuation Act 1976. They do not depend upon the rate of contribution (if any) paid by particular employing authorities. The Superannuation Act provides that the Government-financed element of all benefits shall be met from the Consolodated Revenue Fund at the time the benefits become payable, and that employee-financed benefits payable at that time are confined to the amount of each member's contributions accumulated with interest earned, or the equivalent unindexed pension. There is no guarantee that employee-financed benefits will be of any particular amount, or will bear any particular relationship to the employee's pre-retirement salary.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 19 August 1982 (Hansard, page 283) Senator Martin asked Senator Durack, as Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, without notice, the following question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Has the Minister seen an article in the 16 August 1982 issue of the Newsweek magazine headed 'The Mail Order Brides' which refers to the growing number-1, 500 in 1981-of marriages between Philippine women and Australian men arranged through marriage agencies? I am sure all honourable senators have seen these agencies' advertisements in major Australian newspapers. Does the Minister share my concern at the allegations in the article that Philippine women reportedly have been beaten, have been given little or no money, and have kept virtual prisoners in their husbands' houses? In view of the particular nature of this section of the marriage industry that is specific to the Philippine women, will the Government consider legislating to require that these women be given, in advance of migrating to Australia, a full description of their legal rights in Australia after marriage?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I have seen the Newsweek article headed 'The Mail Order Brides'. There is, however, little reliable data on the extent of social problems being experienced and it appears that many marriages in fact work out quite well. Nevertheless, I share your concern about possible social problems arising from these marriages.</PARA>
<PARA> The situation has been the subject of discussions between officials of the Philippines Government, senior Departmental officers, members of the Filipino community in Australia and social workers. A study of the experiences and problems associated with these marriages is being undertaken by my Department in Melbourne in consultation with the Filipino community there. The results of the study should identify particular problems and allow them to be specifically addressed.</PARA>
<PARA> Difficulties can arise in marriages where both partners come from different cultural backgrounds. To help overcome such difficulties, officers of my Department seek to provide counselling including some advice on legal rights to Filipinos and their Australian husbands prior to the issue of migrant entry visas.</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to many of the problems which can be associated with these marriages lies in both partners understanding their position and each other's position more thoroughly. I believe that counselling is much more effective at achieving this than legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> For this reason, the Government is not considering legislation to require that these women be given, in advance of migrating to Australia, a full description of their legal rights in Australia after marriage.</PARA>

The question concerned an item on the 60 Minutes television program which referred to the 'whingeing Pom' syndrome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Officers of my Department take care to ensure that people interviewed overseas with a view to settling in Australia are fully informed about current conditions here to ensure that as far as possible they have realistic expectations of life in Australia. For those who undertake the on-arrival information program, this information is supplemented by further counselling after arrival.</PARA>
<PARA> Migration officers interviewing people overseas who will require employment on arrival advise them of their prospects in accordance with the Occupation Demand Schedule produced by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. However, people do not always leave for Australia immediately after approval and successful applicants are counselled to up-date their information about employment prospects immediately before departure.</PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the quality and thoroughness of pre-embarkation briefing, a small proportion of migrants meet settlement difficulties caused by their own personal circumstances including homesickness and emotional and domestic upsets . Mostly these are resolved.</PARA>
<PARA> In the first six months of 1981/82, a total of 2,355 former settlers departed Australia permanently within two years of arrival. This is a very small number compared with the size of the immigration intake. Of this number, some 850 would have been people returning to the United Kingdom.</PARA>
