<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That citizens of South Australia view with great alarm the removal of the Director of the Office of Child Care and fear for the future of that office and the children's services programme which it administers.</PARA>
<PARA> We believe the Office of Child Care to be inappropriately placed within the Department of Social Security, where children's services are in competition with welfare services for the aged, disabled, and other such groups.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled , should take every step as necessary to obtain immediate withdrawal of the Office of Child Care from the Department of Social Security and the establishment of a Children's Commission.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 351 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Great Barrier Reef is unique and is included on the World Heritage List.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act was to create a marine park to provide for the proper protection and management of The Reef, only 14 per cent of the total area defined in this Act as the Great Barrier Reef Region has been declared marine park.</PARA>
<PARA> The only insurance against an oil drilling blowout in Reef waters is to prohibit oil drilling in the Region and its vicinity.</PARA>
<PARA> This can only be effected by declaring the whole area of the Region a marine park under the above legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should request the Government to take action to hold a referendum together with the next Federal Elections on the question that:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The entire area of the Great Barrier Reef and its surrounding waters, defined as the Great Barrier Reef Region in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 as amended 1978, be immediately declared a marine park under the provisions of that Act'.</PARA>

<PARA> That in recent years thousands of families have lost their homes, the building industry and employment is at an all time low, with social disruption from continued increases in interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA> All this, in our opinion, is due to extortionate interest rates that have passed the bounds of all reason and void of equity and moral justification.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your House urge all politicians to unite nationally to do all within their power to reduce interest rates across the board, also in the political arena a conscience vote is essential.</PARA>

And that the Senate has already been made aware of the plight of tertiary students in the three volumes of 'Studies of Tertiary Student Finances' , tabled in the Senate on 15th October 1981.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That it is clearly apparent that Australian society is becoming more polarised- that the rich at home and abroad are becoming richer, profiting from Australia's mineral wealth, whilst, pensioners and the disadvantaged, some three million people, are becoming a race apart.</PARA>
<PARA> That, of necessity, the Federal Government take action that all Australians share the wealth of their country by the transfer of resources to income security, health care and housing and therefore, your petitioners urge that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) All pension and benefits be raised to at least 30 per cent of the national average male earnings seasonally adjusted.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Removal of the means/income test on the Pensioner Health Benefit imposed by Federal legislation 1973. Reintroduction of Medibank in so doing restore all Australians to equality of citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) To alleviate Australia's shortage of housing stock within the capacity of people to pay (rental and ownership) the Federal Government immediately inject $ 200m into State Housing Authorities, which will, in addition, alleviate unemployment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 852 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Australia has no national monument to commemorate the courage and the endeavours of our early pioneers and explorers.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. In 1976, the National Council of the Stockman's Hall of Fame and Outback Heritage Centre was formed to co-ordinate efforts to build this monument.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. A site was selected at Longreach in western Queensland in 1978 and a design by Sydney architect, Feiko Bouman, was approved two years later.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The early constuction of a Hall of Fame at Longreach will be a fitting pioneer monument as well as a major tourist attraction, boosting the depressed rural economy of western Queensland and providing the employment that is so badly needed there to stem the population drift to the cities.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Federal Government will invest whatever funding is necessary to enable the immediate construction of the Stockman's Hall of Fame and to enable researchers to collect the information, material and relics quickly, before they deteriorate or disappear forever, so that Australia can have a showcase for our national heritage and an inspiration to our national pride.</PARA>

<PARA> The students and staff of the University of Queensland express their dismay at the lack of adequate federal government funding to our University, which has resulted, inter alia, in the erosion of our Library facilities-we note that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The opening of our main Library have been reduced from 93 1/2 hours a week in 1975 to 72 hours week in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The number of new books purchased per year has fallen from over 50,000 in 1976 to under 23,000 in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The number of books in storage and inaccessible to students and staff has risen from none in 1977 to over 40,000 in 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The number of books discarded in 1976 was over 6,000-by the end of 1981 over 70,000 had been discarded.</PARA>
<PARA> We believe this to be educationally retrograde and economically wasteful. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Senate urge the Government to increase funding to a level sufficient to allow the University to restore our previous Library facilities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 408 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 provided that a precisely defined area, which included the coastal low water line, called The Great Barrier Reef Region should be proclaimed a marine park in which mining and oil drilling specifically would be prohibited and that management plans would be prepared for each zone, allowing for normal uses consistent with the preservation of the natural environment.</PARA>
<PARA> Only a small percentage of the area has so far been proclaimed and in the Cairns section a 5 km wide region for most of the coastline has been excluded. This seems to provide an opportunity for oil drilling and beach mining (causing silting) to take place. We fear that the granting of mining or drilling leases or other harmful developments, here or in the rest of The Great Barrier Reef Region may prevent the object of the Act from being achieved. We believe that most citizens share our fears.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should request the Government to take action so that a referendum will be held with the next Federal elections on the question that the entire Great Barrier Reef Region be immediately declared a Marine Park as defined in and provided by The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 and amended 1978 which included the coastal low water line.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That we believe that a recent archaeological discovery has been a cave along the Franklin River containing artifacts and other indications of human habitation during the last ice age. It has not been studied yet and there could be similar sites not yet located. The remains are equivalent in age to the remains in the famous caves in France and similar world wide scientific interest can be expected to develop. It is inconceivable that these sites of world wide importance should be lost forever by being flooded.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition there are very few wilderness areas left now and the retention of what remains is necessary to provide biologists with continuously available scientific reference data for more skilful use of our cultivated areas and as a storage for species, including river borne species, that may become of practical use in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> Also it is important to keep some areas in their completely natural state to maintain some balance in nature and in this case because of its inspiring beauty and grandeur.</PARA>
<PARA> We understand that the cost of constructing a dam will fall mainly on taxpayers of the mainland States and that it has been shown by an independent study that other methods of power generation are much cheaper for this particular case.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that the Senate in Parliament assembled should request the Government to take action so that a referendum will be held with the next federal elections to ascertain the opinion of electors on whether the area generally known as the South West Tasmania wilderness should be kept as far as possible in its natural state, no dams should be constructed and that the Federal Government should use all constitutional means towards this end and towards the preservation of similar wilderness areas in other parts of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, relates to the provision of maintenance by the deserting partner in a marriage breakdown. What procedures are employed within the confines of the Family Law Act to ensure that the deserting partner in a marriage breakdown situation is made to fulfil his or her obligation to provide maintenance for the children of that marriage?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1110" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I respond to this question perhaps as the Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General. There are, of course, provisions in the Family Law Act which provide for the recovery of maintenance for the care of children of a marriage. Under that Act both parties to a marriage are liable, according to their means, to contribute to the maintenance of the children of the marriage who have not attained the age of 18 years or, in certain circumstances, even beyond that age where the children are still dependent and reliant for reasons of education or otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The main considerations for the court in assessing the appropriate contribution of the parties of the marriage towards the maintenance of the children are, first of all, the needs of the children themselves. That is a matter for assessment. The second consideration is the economic capacity of each of the parties and, if appropriate, the children themselves, to satisfy those needs. Once the court has determined the reasonable needs of the child, having made allowance to the extent to which it is proper to require the child to support himself, the court apportions the cost of support between the parties. There are in the Act provisions relating to enforcement. Orders can be made for the payment of arrears, to garnishee, to seize property and so on-the usual methods of enforcement of legal obligations for payment. Also, in some States machinery is provided to assist parties to enforce maintenance orders. In Western Australia this is done through an officer of the Family Court of Australia. In South Australia it is done through the Department for Community Welfare. In other States some assistance is provided by clerks of courts.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of maintenance, with other aspects of the Family Law Act, has recently been considered by the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act. In the main, it could be said that the Committee recommends an increased emphasis on the maintenance of children by parents rather than by the taxpayer. That is a matter which is still being considered by the Government. It is complicated by the fact that the Family Law Act provides that, in assessing maintenance, a court shall take into account the availability of social security payments. That , in a sense, makes it easier for the courts to make lesser demands upon a non- supporting parent than it otherwise might, bearing in mind that the Government will come to the assistance of both the spouse and the children through the social security system. Again, this is an area which needs to be examined. The Attorney and I are certainly looking at it in conjunction, but we have not come to any conclusion or put anything before the Government with respect to it yet.</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the only other thing that I should mention is that in relation to the recent Budget I indicated that we were proposing to reactivate the requirement that maintenance should be sought in cases in which a spouse seeks from the Government either a widow's pension or supporting parent's benefit; and that there should be some attempt to recover maintenance from the other spouse. I suppose that indicates some movement towards trying to shift at least some of the responsibility back into private hands.</PARA>

Is it a fact that the Minister said, in releasing the McGregor report, that 'it is important that the public have an awareness of the facts'?

The matter no doubt uppermost in the Prime Minister's mind was that it would be desirable for it to be known to the public. On the other hand, as I understand it, the report of the recent Woodward Royal Commission was made available last Friday. There was, of course, an opportunity to table it because the Parliament was sitting.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, concerns the problems experienced by the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. I ask: Is it a fact that in the early 1970s BHP provided assistance in the building of South Korea's capital-intensive, integrated steel mills at Pohang? Is it also a fact that, despite import tariffs, coal export levies and the 8,000 nautical mile round voyage, these mills, using Australian ore, billets and coal can still produce steel products landed in Australia so much more cheaply that they have to raise their prices artificially by about 15 per cent? Did not BHP management know about 10 years ago what the future competition would be?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lewis has asked a very comprehensive question--</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Chipp" NAMEID="3V4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator Chipp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A good question.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is a good question. It is a very fundamental one for Australia. I say at the outset, because there is a critical note running through the question-properly so-that nevertheless over many decades BHP provided in Australia the cheapest steel in the free world. It is a fact that in the early 1970s BHP assisted South Korea to establish what are now the modern, automated steel mills at Pohang, which use Australian ore, billet and coal. It is also a fact that those integrated steel mills are capital and not labour- intensive and employ a smaller work force to produce comparable quantities of steel products to those produced in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very difficult now to make a comparison because some, including those from the United States of America and elsewhere, allege that South Korea is heavily subsidising its steel exports for one goal-to gain foreign exchange. I have to make that point. It has been said-I have no verification of it-that that subsidisation could be as much as 32 per cent. Various countries provide hidden subsidies to their steel industries. For example, some would say that in Japan the banking system is such that it gives low interest loans to various organisations. If that is so then an answer to Senator Lewis must be tempered by those remarks. I think that BHP must have apprehended that in both Japan and South Korea the development of modern, highly integrated and less labour- intensive steel works would create much greater competition. It is remarkable that iron ore, coal and other materials can be carted 8,000 miles from here, processed and carted back and the product sold competitively. That needs this full analysis. But it is a fact that even if we look at the situation aside from subsidisation, the ratio of tonnes of steel produced per man employed is far better in Korea and Japan than in Australia. So there are fundamental lessons that we have to learn.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt in the world that Australian steel works will need to look to modernisation and to much more rapid capitalisation and cannot for- ever lie behind protection, although that protection in terms of import freezing now exists. One of the actions taken by the Government in its last Budget, as Senator Lewis would know, was to arrange for all corporations to be able to combine their trading balances so that loss companies can be associated with profit companies. It would be competent upon BHP to use significant amounts of the profits it makes from oil, and will continue to make from oil, for capitalisation of its steel works. It is a very detailed question. I will put it under study and if there are further facts I will let Senator Lewis have them.</PARA>

I refer to the French Government's refusal to divulge health statistics of its Polynesian residents so that they can be included in an internationally sponsored register for the South Pacific. Is the Minister aware that the French Government has not published the causes of death of Polynesians since 1963, or some three years before the first detonation of a nuclear device, and still refuses to do so? Can the Minister confirm that the French Government is not disclosing these statistics because they show an alarming increase in leukemia, brain cancers and other illnesses directly associated with atom bomb tests?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The French Government is well aware of Australia's firm opposition to its nuclear testing in the South Pacific. The Australian Government has also urged the French Government to be more forthcoming about aspects of its testing program which have been matters of public concern. The Australian Government is making inquiries about the most recent claims which have appeared in the Press. If claims that the tests have directly affected the health of people in the Pacific are correct, the Government would be gravely concerned. The French Government has consistently maintained that its nuclear test program does not endanger health or safety. However, as I say, there have been recent claims which would suggest the contrary view. As I have said, the Government is making inquiries. As we have noted Senator Chipp's direct interest in the matter, I shall see that he is advised as soon as we have further information from the French Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

Has the Government's attention been drawn to a report that in the last month feed corn prices in the New England district of New South Wales have jumped from about $ 160 per tonne to about $200 to $210 per tonne, while the price of oats has increased from about $65 per tonne to $110 per tonne?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Undoubtedly we have a very severe drought across most of eastern Australia, and we face a situation in which, in most of the pastoral areas in eastern Australia, there are severe shortages of water and fodder and a very considerable need either to destock or to look after the stock by the purchase of feed. In those circumstances there will undoubtedly be pressure on the feed stock market and it is likely that prices will rise. The market in those commodities is not, as far as I am aware, a controlled market. I think that it is not one in which there are monopolies or anti-competitive arrangements which would lead to the ability to raise prices artificially. However, in a situation of much greater than usual demand, it is likely that there will be very considerable pressure on prices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand the concern which lies behind the honourable senator's question. It is of concern to all of us, and, of course, to the taxpayers of Australia, that the relief measures which are properly being taken to assist this important section of the Australian community should be effective and efficient and should not be the subject of abuse by any other section of the community. I shall therefore take up the matter raised by Senator McClelland with the Minister for Primary Industry, but I believe that only very limited action could be taken to hold down prices, in any sense, when there is genuine competition for available supplies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly did see a report recently that a group in New South Wales had criticised the Budget. I am not sure how accurate that report is because I have had communications from a number of welfare agencies which have commented to the effect that the published comments have been somewhat different from their total comment on the Budget. For example, the Western Australian Council of Social Service, which was reported to have commented in a critical vein, told me that what had been excluded from the newspaper report were laudatory comments which referred with pleasure to changes brought down in the Budget which had met requests they had put to the Government for improvements in the welfare system. Similarly, I think the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled wrote to me enclosing a copy of a Press release which commented very favourably on a number of initiatives for the disabled and commented rather sadly that that sort of Press release had not attracted any coverage. I can confirm that in fact a number of organisations-the New South Wales Council on the Aging is another-took the trouble to write to me to comment favourably on the changes which had been sought by the welfare community and which were effected in the present Budget-changes such as the shifts in income limits for both pension and fringe benefits. There were expressions of disappointment at the lack of media interest in positive comment. On the other hand, it is unfortunately true that negative comments are more likely to get cover. I suspend judgment as to what the total comment of the New South Wales group on the Budget might have been. It may be that what was reported was partial only.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. Drought has long been notorious for the wider distribution of noxious weeds when grain or hay is purchased in one country or State for drought supplementary feeding in another. This week the Tasmanian Minister for Primary Industry has broadcast a timely warning to farmers who have purchased feed wheat in Hobart since 16 August that they have a good chance of having taken delivery of a noxious weed known as spiny emex. The weed has spiny fruit which cause crippling injury to the hooves of livestock and easily penetrate the soles of boots or tyres. I ask the Minister: In view of the threat this weed poses to the rural industries, what work has been done on its control? If no attempt has been made to import a biological control of spiny emex, will he investigate that possibility?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It always leads me to have a feeling of envy when a question like this is asked. I envy the long memory that we all have for Jim Webster. There was always a cry for his return whenever matters of a technical nature arose in the Senate. I cannot pretend that I have his extraordinary memory for detail or the ability to get across such difficult matters. Fortunately, I do have some information about the spiny emex; so I am not in a position where I will have to disappoint the Senate by putting the question on the Notice Paper. In fact, the control of weeds is primarily a matter for land owners or local and State governments. The Tasmanian Minister was correct to be warning his charges of the difficulties which can arise when one is purchasing feed or things which will import different plants on to one's property. The Commonwealth has some interest in this through the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation . That organisation has carried out investigations on the biological control of spiny emex over a four-year period. The program involved the testing and release of two insect predators but neither was successful. The CSIRO, which is responsible for setting its own priorities, terminated the control program approximately two years ago but I understand the work has been continued by the State authorities in Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria. I regret that the CSIRO is not carrying out any research into the biological control of the members of the Opposition. But since the CSIRO is independent, we cannot force it to do that. One can only hope that it turns its attention to those noxious weeds which occupy the benches opposite.</PARA></TALK.START>

Has the Minister also seen the comments of the New South Wales State Secretary of the Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia, Mr Joe Thompson, who said that a major factor in the retrenchments is the Federal Government's export credit facilitation scheme, that these retrenchments are a forerunner to other major retrenchments and that this, coupled with a downturn in all sections of Australia's manufacturing industries, shows a very urgent need for a change in Government policies to ensure that the current employment situation does not become even more chaotic?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the report referred to by the honourable senator. I am not in a position to confirm or deny the reports which he has read in the newspaper. But, of course, I am aware that Borg-Warner (Australia) Ltd has been an important component manufacturer, manufacturing both gearboxes and axles. Indeed, I think it is the only manufacturer of those particular components in Australia. The nature of the export credit facilitation scheme introduced by the Government is such that we try to achieve a situation whereby Australian component manufacturers are able to contribute components to vehicles being built both in Australia and overseas. It will be well known to honourable senators, for example, that engines manufactured in Australia have been sent to Europe for inclusion in cars being built on that continent and that other components being made in Australia are being sent overseas. It is important to achieve economies of scale and for Australia to be part of what is more and more a world car market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The particular effect of that policy on Borg-Warner is a matter which was the subject of considerable representation to all honourable senators at the time the car policy was before the Parliament. I think that company expressed concern that the components which it manufactures would be likely to be replaced by components manufactured in other parts of the world. I understand that that company is an important industry in Albury and that it is an important employer. I will ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to give me more detailed advice on the various matters which have been raised by the honourable senator in his question. But it remains true that any policy which involves Australia taking its place in what is essentially now a world industry will almost inevitably involve trade-offs between one part of the industry and another. It is unlikely that any policy pursued by the Government would result in all areas of the Australian industry maintaining exactly the same state of health.</PARA>

Will the Budget announced increases in the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and the Commonwealth post-graduate award bring substantial remedy to student needs as described in the report? Is the report evidence that the student loan scheme proposed by the Government would be so welcomed by tertiary students that the amount of $50m to be involved for 1983 is likely to be fully taken up?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that the Budget provided real advances for students throughout Australia and that student assistance, by way of tertiary allowances and also, of course, assistance to students in secondary education, was considerable. People seem to have forgotten in some of the debates that take place that there was a 20 per cent increase in the level of the TEAS allowance announced in the Budget; that there was an extension in the means test; that for secondary students there was an extension of 40 per cent in the means test; that for tertiary students there was an increase of almost 50 per cent in the post- graduate allowance. There is no doubt that the Government has moved very definitely to assist students and to respond in this Budget to what are students ' needs for assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed loan scheme to which Senator Teague referred in his question is, of course, an extra option for students. It would enable those students who wished to do so to take out another form of support to get them through the period of their tertiary education. It is the Government's intention that this should happen. I should like to take on notice the question in relation to the report mentioned by Senator Teague, because of some uncertainty about the exact details he requested. But insofar as his questions about the report were designed to put into context the issues related to the Government's support for students, I can give him the assurances he seeks and can say to him that the Government's contribution through this Budget has been considerable and has been sympathetic.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lajovic has asked a very long question with some five aspects to it. I am, of course, very well aware of the situation in New South Wales where in fact there have been enormous increases in the prices of electricity for domestic, commercial and industrial purposes. I think everybody is aware that despite the fact that there is excess installed capacity for electricity there has been an incapacity of the Government concerned over the years to maintain that installed capacity. The effect has been that enormous costs have been incurred. I saw an estimate the other day-I do not know how accurate it was-which showed that the costs to the Liddell power station alone for repairs will be of the order of $140m. I am unable to substantiate that figure but it is something of that magnitude. I was asked about this in terms of Mr Wran's promises. At his election one year ago he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . we have embarked upon the biggest power generation program in the history of Australia. We are determined that the needs of industry shall be met. We are equally determined to protect the householders, the ordinary domestic consumers of electricity. New South Wales has the cheapest electricity to householders in Australia. We are going to keep it that way.</PARA>
<PARA>That was his election promise. The reality is that in Sydney consumers face the most expensive electricity in Australia. For example, by July 1982 the average prices of electricity for small and medium scale industrial or commercial users respectively were 7.74c per kilowatt hour, an increase of 87 per cent since July of last year, and 6.75c per kilowatt hour, an increase of 100 per cent since July of last year. An even more graphic example of the failure of the Wran promise is evident from a recent published report by NUS International Pty Ltd which compares electricity prices in various capital cities throughout the world for large, medium and small scale industrial consumers. The table shows that Sydney was assessed as now having, in general, the highest electricity charges of all those cities surveyed. Clearly, of course, that is an outrageous situation in terms of the promises made by Mr Wran.</PARA>
<PARA> An example of the direct effects of these electricity tariff increases on a Sydney company is contained in information which it recently provided to me. This is the result: An increase in the tariff from 1.84c per kilowatt hour in December of last year to 4.8168c in August of this year, an overall increase of 162 per cent for the period, which leads to an additional annual cost of $300, 000 to that company and to the very real prospect of the loss of the 180 jobs involved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was asked a question and I am giving the answer. I was asked whether the resources boom was talked up. The Government stated that $ 31 billion would be invested. The Chemical Bank, New York-a very responsible body-has just published a report which states that no talking up occurred; that, indeed, investment of that magnitude will occur in Australia, but that there will be a little easing out of the bunching. One of the most authoritative investment bodies in the free world has said that there will be no decline. We cannot run away from the simple fact that the Wran Government published a document, which I will make available to Senator Georges, which said that $23 billion of investment would be committed to New South Wales. In contrast, the Fraser Government said that for the whole of Australia the figure would be only $31 billion. Honourable senators should decide from those figures who talked up the boom.</PARA></TALK.START>

In that report the Commissioner recommends that responsibility for all meat inspection in the Northern Territory should be undertaken by a combined service, the form of which should be negotiated by the respective governments, and action will soon be initiated to arrange for discussions on how a merged service can best be achieved. It would be well known to honourable senators that the attempts to arrive at a combined service have been lengthy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My Department has no discretion to provide a health benefit card in circumstances where the person is not qualified. If the person is disqualified by income, whether that income is derived from a British pension, from superannuation or from investments, does not affect the matter. In those cases where for whatever reason a pensioner has income which takes him or her outside the income limits for the pensioner health card, entitlement ceases. It is true that in the current situation where those limits will change in November it is possible that somebody could lose the health card for a relatively brief period. I know of no ability under the law to make the sort of concession which is suggested by Senator Grimes. I point out that any pensioner who ceases to be covered by the pensioner health benefit card because of an increase in income is entitled to seek and obtain immediate cover through health insurance. The normal period of waiting, the three-month delay after seeking insurance and getting cover, does not apply to pensioners in those circumstances and I think the appropriate course to be followed by those who are temporarily without cover from the pensioner health benefit card is to obtain short term insurance cover for themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>

The letter is addressed to the Honourable Neville Wran, Q.C., Premier of New South Wales, by Mr John S. Hubby, the President of Phillips Australia Chemicals Pty Ltd. It is copied to the General Manager of the Sydney County Council, to the Minister for Energy in the State of New South Wales, Mr Landa, to myself, to the Federal member, Mr Dobie, to the State member for Cronulla, Mr Egan, to the President of the Chamber of Manufactures, Mr Bull, and to the Assistant Secretary of the New South Wales Labour Council, Mr J. MacBean. Honourable senators will find that the precise figures that I used are included . The letter says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> My Company has just received advice of an increase in the kWh cost for electricity consumed in August, 1982, supplied by the Sydney County Council. I am astounded and dismayed at the magnitude of this increase, and earlier 1982 increases in the price per kWh. The price movements are tabulated below:</PARA>
<PARA> c per kWh</PARA>
<PARA>Per-</PARA>
<PARA> centage Month</PARA>
<PARA>Total Increase increase</PARA>

<PARA>  Total movement   2.9769 162.0</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> None of the pronouncements seeking to justify electricity price increases generally, made through the media and attributed to the County Councils, the responsible Minister and yourself, have indicated such a savage impost was to be placed on Industry in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> In a recent television statement, you rationalised that while the proposed increases in electricity tariffs appeared high, the total cost of electricity to Industry in New South Wales was only a small component of the total manufacturing cost of materials and services input. For my Company, electricity as a percentage of the total cost of production (materials, services and fixed manufacturing costs, including labour), is as follows for Synthetic Rubber, an essential material in the manufacture of motor vehicle tyres and other rubber goods.</PARA>
<PARA> % Average for the 1981 calendar year  3.01 Average for the 7 months to July 1982  4.33 Based on the August 1982 increase in electricity price  6.47</PARA>
<PARA> You failed to state in your address that the after-tax profit of the majority of New South Wales Industry also represented an extremely small percentage. The impact of the higher electricity charges in 1982 to date (and undoubtedly with further increases to come?), together with the enormous hike in New South Wales workers' compensation premiums of between 60 per cent to 150 per cent on 1981, must now surely place a significant part of New South Wales Industry in the red . Unfortunately my Company may not be an exception. The increase in kWh rate alone represents an additional annual cost of $300,000, which exceeds our profit after tax registered in 1981 and which we have no hope of recovering from our customers in the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA> My Company and its employees have been struggling to cope with the multitude of problems in the present economic climate and maintain a viable business. This electricity cost increase, obviously arbitrary and handled in a completely cavalier manner, totally negates hard won cost savings achieved this year and must place the future of our business in jeopardy. The possible failure of my Company with the direct loss of 180 jobs, and being the only manufacturer in Australia producing both Carbon Black and Synthetic Rubber, must surely be of concern.</PARA>
<PARA> I must appeal for a complete reversal of this latest increase to permit my business (and I am sure others as well) to remain viable. Your attention to the matter would be most appreciated.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I speak only to resist a precedent being created on the basis of statements made by the President on this matter. Although it has become acceptable practice to indicate to a Minister that a question may be asked of him on a particular subject, a process has developed by which a question is given to a Minister well in advance and in such a way that the answer can be prepared by the relevant Department. That is contrary to the spirit of what you, Mr President, have said. It is quite contrary to the spirit of questions without notice to have answers prepared by departments or ministerial staff. Mr President, we ought not to adopt that as an acceptable practice. From time to time I have protested on this matter. The Standing Orders Committee should again investigate the whole subject of Question Time to see whether this practice can in some way be diminished.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was encouraged yesterday by the fact that three Ministers rose after Question Time and gave considerable information on questions that they were asked during Question Time and perhaps even on the previous day. It was an effective way of giving considerable information on questions which may have been raised within the hour. Obviously, they did not feel it necessary to take up the period for questions without notice by giving lengthy answers and information of importance and interest to the Senate. That is the point that I am trying to make. There are ways and means by which answers to questions which seek detailed information can be given subsequent to Question Time. I suggest that we ought to look at Question Time because it has been diminished considerably. I also suggest that we look at supplementary questions. They have led to an abuse in this place which has diminished the rights of honourable senators to ask questions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every week Sir James Killen, the Minister for doing nothing as he is sometimes called, is asked in a question upon notice what he has done during the past week. He always answers by saying: 'I have administered my Department'. In his case, but in no other ministry in this Government, it is probably true, because he has only five people to administer. He probably does that reasonably well. One of the functions which the Constitution lays down for Ministers is quite simple; it is to administer departments. That provision is contained in section 64 of the Constitution. What we have with the Fraser Government is that, instead of administering departments, many Ministers have indulged themselves with private activities outside the sphere of government or developed to the point of irresistible genius the new doctrines of the Fraser Government of malpractice and maladministration. These new doctrines which have developed in the last few weeks compare quite starkly with the remarks made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his electoral talk on 12 March 1978 when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of my Government's first promises when we were elected just over two years ago was to restore the integrity and honesty of government. As long as I lead the Government, there is no way known that anything less than the highest code and practice of public administration will be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable senators to remember that statement by the Prime Minister as one looks at the record. What the Fraser Government is confronted with in 1982 is a sort of latter-day equivalent of the rum rebellion. Tax evaders, dishonest doctors and subversives in the ranks of the Liberal Party cry out against honest administration. Privileged groups in the community advance their personal interests at the expense of the revenue of this country. The only difference from the rum rebellion is that the Prime Minister, unlike Governor Bligh, has not yet been caught hiding under the bed. Instead he has been caught hiding in a web of deceit, changing standards and words, words, words about his Government similar to the words which I quoted a minute or two ago. </PARA>
<PARA> By way of illustration, let us look briefly at what has happened since this Government came to office. I do so by mentioning only some few of the 22 Ministers who have fallen from grace since Malcolm Fraser was elected as Prime Minister of this country. First of all, in 1975 there was Sir Victor Garland on a charge of bribing an elector. Subsequently, he was restored to the Ministry, sent overseas, knighted and later discovered to have been involved in tax evasion schemes on a significant scale. Next there was Mr John McLeay, a former Minister in the Government. He was sent overseas. He is now the subject of a civil action in South Australia, by the liquidator of a company, alleging fraud and misappropriation. Presumably he will come back to defend that action. Thirdly, we have the former Senator Webster. He was sent overseas, having been saved by the then Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Sir Garfield Barwick, from being subjected to the full benefits of the provisions of the Constitution relating to pecuniary interests. Mr MacKellar, dismissed--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Webster was exonerated by Sir Garfield Barwick. The next Minister to whom I wish to refer, going down the pecking order, is Mr MacKellar who was dismissed by the Prime Minister for petty smuggling. Mr Moore was dismissed by the Prime Minister for being an accessory after the fact to petty smuggling. Senator Withers was dismissed for impropriety, of all things, which stands out as the insect compared with all of these offences that I have listed. Mr Peacock resigned on the basis that he said that the Prime Minister had cast aside the stability and sense of direction of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then, of course, we have the next group of Ministers, the great survivors. Sir Phillip Lynch was removed as Treasurer because of his involvement in land dealings. He was subsequently restored to the Ministry, but not as Treasurer. We have Senator Durack, the Attorney-General and Mr Howard, the present Treasurer, who presided over vast tax evasion and loss of revenue to this country. Mr Sinclair, believed by a jury after six hours' deliberation as to whether it would believe him or not and disbelieved by a Senate committee, stood down from the Ministry and was subsequently restored. He and his colleague, Mr Nixon, presided over the Asia Dairy Industries scandal and the meat malpractice scandal of recent fame. We have Mr Hunt, who presided over the medifraud developments of the last few years. But the point I wish to make is that never in the history of this Government since 1975 has there been a time when there was not a Minister who was free from the taint of corruption and incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has been responsible for the loss of billions of dollars of revenue through tax avoidance. It has been responsible for the jeopardising of Australia's billion dollar meat industry. It has been responsible for massive scandals in relation to medifraud. It has been responsible for the Asia Dairy Industries scandal in which $3m just disappeared into an unmarked Singapore bank account and it has been responsible for all the petty misdemeanours, such as smuggling television sets. The Australian economy is currently in the worst mess it has ever been in. The country is facing enormous problems and what it needs, before any of those problems can be tackled, is honest, credible government, not grand deceits on the scale practised by the Fraser Ministry. There is no hope of restoring the credibility of this Government. It has had more Ministers acquitted than it has ever had tax evaders convicted. Its only hope at the next election is perhaps to seek to persuade the people that this time it will lead a tax evasion led recovery. That is the only hope this Government has because all of its other ploys have been exhausted. We even find the Deputy Prime Minister ( Mr Anthony) visiting a convicted criminal in gaol, presumably to find out about the state of the food. These are the extraordinary things which go on in connection with this Government. The whole problem arises, of course, because it has no standards and it has had no standards since its beginning. It has no standards of ministerial responsibility, it has no standards of accountability of Ministers and it has no standards of accepting any responsibility at all for the proper government of this country. I want to illustrate those points. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal first of all with the question of standards of ministerial responsibility. What we have seen here is a continual change in the standards of ministerial responsibility to fix every particular case which arises. In 1972 the present Prime Minister laid down the sort of standard which he thought would be appropriate to a government led by him. He said that the standard was that if a blunder of any real importance to Australia occurred in a department, even if the Minister were unaware of it, that Minister should take the responsibility and resign. That was the 1972 Fraser standard. In 1976, the Coombs Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration reported to the Government. The Coombs Royal Commission laid down the standard of ministerial responsibility as being that unless the action which stood condemned was the Minister's action or was taken on his or her direction or was action which the Minister ought obviously to have been concerned with, the Minister should not resign. In 1978, the Prime Minister again laid down a new standard which I have already quoted, the new standard to which I referred at the beginning of my speech, in which he said that the highest standards of integrity and code of practice would be observed. In 1982 the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, said that the standard now applying to Ministers, and in this case he meant him, was that a Minister should not resign unless there was personal fault. In 1982, two weeks later, the Prime Minister, in relation to Mr Nixon, abandons that standard set by Senator Durack in rejecting the finding of a distinguished Royal Commissioner who found personal fault in a Minister. The Prime Minister said that that standard no longer applied. A few years earlier when Senator Withers was dismissed, the Prime Minister said that the Government had no option but to accept the finding of a royal commission. This week, when it came to a National Country Party Minister, Mr Nixon, all the options were available. </PARA>
<PARA> The question that arises in respect of these matters of honesty and propriety as far as the Fraser Government is concerned is: Who guards the guardians in Australia now? If a royal commissioner of the calibre of Mr Justice Woodward is not accepted as an authority on what is proper ministerial behaviour, where are the checks and balances now? Who determines whether a Minister has behaved properly? A royal commission is not good enough any more. How can any public service be administered by a Ministry which is subject to these sorts of rafferty rules? A system has been set up by the Prime Minister to determine whether a Minister has company shareholdings and directorships from which conflict of interest arises with his duty as a Minister. In the Fraser Government that is a matter that the Prime Minister decides. He alone makes that decision. There is no public information as to what directorships and shareholdings Ministers hold. All of those matters are reported to the Prime Minister and he alone decides whether there is a conflict of interest with the Minister's duty. That is a cowardly sort of standard for a government to have. It is the sort of standard which has led to the present disarray. </PARA>
<PARA> The first defence to these charges of the present Government is to keep changing its standards on all of these matters, lowering its standards. The second defence is that somebody else is always to blame. The scapegoat syndrome has been the characteristic of this Government right from the beginning. More recently the Australian Public Service has been added to the list of scapegoats for ministerial failures and irresponsibility. Look at the massive tax evasion racket revealed in the last few weeks consequent upon the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. As a result of that three minor public servants in Perth have been charged with offences under the Public Service Act. The Crown Solicitor in Canberra is investigating himself to see whether his conduct was good enough. The Ministers responsible-the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Attorney-General ( Senator Durack)-have resiled from any responsibility at all. Inadequacies in respect of medifraud are blamed on the Public Service and not the Minister for Health (Mr Carlton). Inadequacies in respect of the meat scandal are blamed on the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry for finding the wrong facts and on public servants. Public servants again are blamed in respect of the Asia Dairy Industries scandal. The Prime Minister's latest effort is to announce an inquiry into the Public Service, if you please, to try to straighten out some of these things. The Prime Minister, in a statement made on the kerbside yesterday morning, foreshadowed a major examination to see that administrative breakdowns do not occur. He asked Ministers to give him a full and complete report on all aspects of their own administration and to give that report within a week. We hear the Prime Minister going on with that sort of gobbledegook when two and a half years ago the Williams Royal Commission into Drugs told this Government that it should do something to tighten up regulations on container cargo containing drugs which was coming into Australia. Nothing has happened two and a half years later in relation to drug importation into this country. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the statements which have been made by the Prime Minister about integrity in Government and the Public Service and we look at the decision of April 1981 of the razor gang and all the windy rhetoric which accompanied that, we see how paralysed this Government is in doing anything in terms of administration. In April 1981 the Prime Minister said very pompously:</PARA>
<PARA> We intend to establish major reviews into a number of significant areas of Commonwealth activity in order to further tighten administration and achieve a more efficient and effective service. </PARA>
<PARA>What has happened to that for goodness sake? We do not hear much about that any more. He set up a committee of senior Ministers to rein in the growth of government-it has expanded ever since-and to ensure that there was positive progress. What happened to them, or was that mere rhetoric of April 1981? What has been revealed in September 1982 is that in fact nothing has been done by Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia is to have a good Public Service of integrity and impartiality, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate implied at Question Time today, it must have trust in the people who are entrusted by the Constitution to administer it-that is, the Ministers of this Government-and it must respect them . There is no reason why the Public Service should respect Ministers in this Government any more than anyone else does in this country after what has been revealed. Of course, to say it is a matter in which responsibility lies down the line is just ridiculous. Honourable senators need not take my word for it but can take the words of Mr Peacock, a former Minister, who in resigning from the Fraser Government said this:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe you-</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister--</PARA>
<PARA>have cast aside the stability and sense of direction of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Over recent months I have regretfully concluded that the Prime Minister is fracturing Cabinet government and the parliamentary system as we know it. Our system of government will operate only if there is a responsible relationship between the Cabinet and the Parliament. Our present system has deteriorated because that relationship has foundered. It has foundered because the Prime Minister increasingly centralised power around himself. Any erosion of the Cabinet system goes to the heart of the parliamentary process. By reposing too much power in the Prime Minister, the system of collective responsibility within the Cabinet is destroyed; the responsibility of Cabinet to Parliament is abandoned; and the very democratic process is placed in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA>They are not my words. Mr Peacock knows why the Public Service in Australia is being blamed for all these things. He knows why the Public Service in Australia no longer looks to this Government and expects honest, sensible, well- administered decision making from Ministers. All I can say is that this stems right back to the Prime Minister. In the words of Mr Peacock's statement, because the Prime Minister has too much power, the system of collective responsibility has been abandoned. It is not abandoned as far as we are concerned. Ministers collectively are responsible for what has happened in this country, for the current state of the economy and for the disrespect in which the Government is held. We will continue to hold them collectively responsible until the next general election, when the people of Australia will do so too. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us talk about that. Because I want to get to the specifics of the positives, let me quote from an editorial on the Labor Government in the Melbourne Age of 6 December 1974, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the wake of the Gair affair, we-</PARA>
<PARA>That is the paper-</PARA>
<PARA>drew attention to the Governmen's smudgy reputation for patronage, favouritism and exploitation of the perquisites of office. Now, with its visionary policies fading and its vaunted competence under challenge, the Whitlam Government is once again under a shadow of public doubt about its standards of political morality. </PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate has the gall to get up here in the face of that and much more, which I will remind Opposition senators of in a moment or two, and say these things. Firstly, I want to deal with the positives because I think they are important. I deal first of all with an extraordinary statement by the Leader of the Opposition, unsupported, suggesting that Ministers have private activities outside their sphere of government which in some way deny them their administrative duties. I know of no such thing at all and nothing was said of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with the Ministers one by one. Today a very snide thing was done and some very severe infringements of the Standing Orders of this Senate happened, and happened without challenge. I will come to that-it is very important that I should do so. The first person named was Sir Victor Garland. It was said he was charged before the courts. It was said also that he has been mentioned in tax evasion schemes. What should have been said is twofold-first, that he was acquitted before the courts; and, secondly, that Sir Victor Garland has not been named in tax evasion schemes. So those two things are fundamentally wrong. The Leader of the Opposition has dealt with these matters in a snide way.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr John McLeay was also mentioned. We were told that a civil action was pending . There is a civil action pending in South Australia concerning certain companies that in prior years Mr McLeay was connected with in a family manner. He in fact has denied any wrongful pursuits in that regard. There has been no finding of any guilty action at all, yet the taint of corruption is found here. We only have to look at the way that ex-Senator Webster was handled in this Senate today and the way in which the Chair had in fact to call to account. It was in fact suggested that somehow or other, by some wrongful action of the then Chief Justice-some wrongful action of one of the highest and most respected judges in Australia-that man escaped the constitutional provisions. There is an old-fashioned rule that ought to be upheld in this Parliament, that is, that the decisions of the judiciary made in those ways should be upheld. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A royal commission, as everybody knows, is not a court of law. Everybody knows that except Senator Gietzelt. Let me simply say that former Senator Webster was in fact cleared of any kind of implication. Today in this place Senator Button said that Mr MacKellar had been petty smuggling. Mr Acting Deputy President, I draw your attention to the fact that such a remark is an offence under our Standing Orders. There is absolutely no evidence to support the allegation of petty smuggling or any other smuggling. Senator Button repeated the allegation that Mr MacKellar had been guilty of smuggling. That ought to have been an offence under the Standing Orders of this Senate. I call it such. It is an offence because under the Standing Orders nobody shall use offensive references to a person. I ask that the Senate recognise that fact. I ask that Senator Button stand condemned for such snide action. In point of fact the evidence of Mr MacKellar is that he came into the Customs hall with a television set slung over his shoulder. He was asked: 'Is it a colour television set?'. He said: 'Yes'. Nobody said to him: 'It is dutiable'. In fact, as soon as he had the slightest idea that it might be dutiable he wrote to the responsible Minister and offered to pay the duty. That shows the mean mindedness of a person who says that Mr MacKellar was a smuggler and that he ought to have been reprimanded just as Mr Moore, who Senator Button claimed was an accessory after the smuggling, should have been reprimanded because he too was in breach of Customs law. So there is no case at all against any of these people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sir Phillip Lynch was mentioned. The evidence was exposed to the community and no improperties of any kind were found. None at all were found. The same applies to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). In fact, Mr Costigan said that Mr Howard and Senator Durack could not know of the individual circumstances. This is typical of the selective judgments of the Opposition. It picks up reports when it wants to. Mr Costigan went out of his way to say that Mr Howard and Senator Durack could not know of these individual circumstances. Can there be anything more corrupt than the way in which Senator Button referred to Mr Sinclair? Mr Sinclair was tried in criminal proceedings before a jury and was acquitted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These are all words. Let us come to those people opposite who stood up and said: 'Here is a list of Ministers. You know there have been 22 changes in the Ministry in eight years'. In three years of the Whitlam Government there were 35 changes in the Ministry. And we are talking about breaches and immorality! Why should we not remind ourselves, for example, of an Age editorial which, when referring to a person who has now left the Senate, condemned his morality. The editorial stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was the senator, now Mr Justice Murphy, who wrote an improper letter-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words 'an improper letter'-</PARA>
<PARA> to the Minister for the Capital Territory-</PARA>
<PARA>And the Opposition talks about impropriety! The Opposition condemns impropriety, so it makes him a High Court judge! The editorial continues:</PARA>
<PARA>(Mr Bryant) asking that he 'at one stroke exercise your Ministerial authority' to provide accommodation for Miss Morosi. </PARA>
<PARA>And the Opposition talks about impropriety! When the Labor Government was in office we saw case after case of impropriety. We saw mismanagement. The management of the turtle farms and alligator farms provided unconscious humour for three years in this place. Do honourable senators opposite remember kicking Mr Barnard upstairs? Do they remember demoting Jim Cairns and then sacking him? Do they remember demoting Crean? Do they remember sacking Mr Connor? Now, after his death the Opposition is seeking to destroy his name. The Labor Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, when asked why Mr Connor was sacked-and remember we are talking about impropriety-said:</PARA>
<PARA> I advised the Governor-General to accept the Minister's resignation because I do not believe in the accuracy of the assurance which the Minister gave me that all communications of substance between him and Mr Khemlani were tabled by him on 9 July last. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, impropriety was involved. Let us look at some of the headlines which appeared in the newspapers. Here we have 'Unions Demand Cairns' Choice' and 'Morosi or ALP'. Do honourable senators remember that? The newspapers talked of impropriety, of improper actions. Let me help their memories a little. Another headline stated: 'Probe on Phillip Cairns'. He was the stepson of the then Treasurer. The Prime Minister of the day said that the Auditor-General was investigating aspects of the Phillip Cairns affair. Other headlines stated: '$ 600,000 commission ''plan''?'; 'Phillip Cairns denies any part in it at all' Then there was the question of Fiji. So it goes on. There was the little matter of three staff resigning from Jim Cairns's office over the difficulties. Other headlines stated: 'Senator Cavanagh loses another employee' The article referred to 'a fifth member of the Senator's staff to leave in the past six weeks'. Honourable senators opposite are laughing. Why did Senator Cavanagh lose those people? He lost them because he had his son in the office and it was alleged that he was abusing administrative procedures. Yet, members of the Labor Party get up in this place and talk to us about standards. Other headlines stated: ' Cairns involved in $9m project' and 'Aide dismissed in Morosi interview clash'. So it goes on, to the Khemlani affair, to the breach of the Executive Council situation and to the Iraqi breakfast. A Labor Minister had this to say at that time about the Iraqi breakfast, the Leader of the Labor Party and propriety:</PARA>
<PARA> Any ALP member involved in a deal for election funds from the Iraki Government should be expelled from the Party immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>That was said by Mr Einfield, a very respected person indeed. Clyde Cameron went on to say much the same thing. What about the demotion of Mr Cameron? This Opposition-whose members got up today and named, without any evidence at all, some six or eight people-stands here as the Government that the people of Australia rejected because of the Morosi affair, because of the Murphy accommodation affair, because of the resignation of the Speaker in another place , because of Mr Connor, because of the Gair affair-how could honourable senators forget that-and because of the Khemlani affair. These are the moralists. I just say to the Opposition: 'He that is without sin cast the first stone.' The story of those three years is one of the ugliest stories of impropriety and of poor morality ever heard in Australia. The best the Opposition can do today is to come before us and try to impute wrongdoing to people who have in fact been acquitted of wrongdoing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party has gone far too far with this kind of nonsense. What a mean and miserable thing it is for the Leader of the Opposition to say that there is something wrong with a member of parliament visiting somebody in gaol. His friend Senator Georges the other day defended the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. The Opposition screamed at me when I said that it should disaffiliate itself from that union. Honourable senators said: 'No, no, no, we must not do so'. But, of course, the pressure of the public was upon the Labor Party when we reminded it that the Costigan Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union said that this affiliate of the Labor Party is not a trade union; it is a gang of criminals recruiting criminals for criminal purposes. The Labor Party gets great joy from plucking somebody's name out and saying that that person is a Liberal and a tax evader. My goodness, the straw companies of tax evasion lay with the painters and dockers by their hundreds, and, no doubt, they were paid up members of the Labor Party. This kind of name calling is absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> When this Government saw that there was trouble on the docks it set up the Costigan royal commission. Illegal activities have been exposed only because we set up that commission. It is because we gave to that commission the right to inquire from the Commissioner of Taxation that this tax evasion has been exposed . The setting up of the McCabe-Lafranchi inquiry was due to a Liberal government . In other words, because we have sought these things, they have come to the surface and we are now bringing in tax laws to deal with them. We are bringing in prosecutors and a crimes commission to deal with these things. It was not the Labor Party that disaffiliated the painters and dockers. They in fact separated.</PARA>
<PARA> I have never in my life seen a more improper use of words than those used today by Senator Button when he tried to impute false motives to a lot of people whom the courts and others have acquitted. I ask the Senate to reject totally the substance of this motion, bearing in mind that the Government admits there are some defects in administration and is taking every step available to it to overcome those defects, to get reform and to bring about a better and a stronger Public Service and administration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard a remarkable speech from the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Sir John Carrick, who seems to be under the illusion that we are debating a resolution. We are in fact debating a matter of public importance put down by my colleague, Senator Button, which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The rapidly declining standards of government administration. </PARA>
<PARA>In the first 15 minutes of Senator Sir John Carrick's speech we heard his account of the history of the Whitlam Government and his complaint that Senator Button had the audacity to draw to the attention of the Senate some of the problems which have faced the present Government and some of its Ministers. He then demonstrated how consistent he was in his complaints about Senator Button's actions by casting aspersions on a judge of the High Court of Australia-a former Attorney-General in this place and a man who, in fact, will be the second senior High Court judge. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is worth while drawing to the attention of the Senate that Senator Sir John Carrick has to behave the way he does. He behaves in this way because, first of all, he has no defence against the matter brought up by Senator Button, and secondly, he is bound to defend his Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Senator Sir John Carrick is bound to defend his Prime Minister because, unlike anyone on this side of the House, he is not an elected Leader of the Government in the Senate; he is the chosen one of the Prime Minister. He would not be in that position if he had to be elected. He would be sitting somewhere near where Senator Withers is sitting now. The simple fact of the matter is that he depends on the Prime Minister of the day for his position, his power and his authority. I certainly do not envy his being in the hands of a gentleman like that. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button has raised this matter of the declining standards of government administration because anyone who reads the newspapers, who looks at television or who has attended or taken any notice of what has been happening in this Parliament in the last few months cannot help being concerned with the rapidly declining standards of government administration. We judge the present Government on what were said to be its standards, the sorts of standards which were espoused by Malcolm Fraser, the Prime Minister, in 1978, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Without integrity-without the appearance and reality of integrity-no Government can hope to have the confidence of the people, or the trust of the people . . . As long as I lead the Government there is no way known that anything less than the highest code and practice of public administration will be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA>Day by day, more and more information comes out about dishonesty, about deception and even corruption in government. The Government admits to no principles at all and admits to no precedents in the way that it governs. The precedents change day by day and week by week, depending on which Minister is in trouble and on which party that Minister belongs to. At any time, but particularly in times of economic and social crisis, the reality and the perception of an efficient, competent and honest government is important to maintain stability and progress in this country. We have increasing instability. We have a lack of confidence because at all levels of government we are faced with inconsistency and a lack of direction. We are faced with corruption and the smell of corruption. Above all we have the mentality at the highest level of government which seeks scapegoats for its failings, whether they be unions, businesses, in particular public servants and sometimes the Opposition, and now a royal commissioner, who is a distinguished judge and an ex-head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. Everyone is blamed; everyone is considered responsible for the ills of this country except the Government itself . In particular, Ministers not only fail to take responsibility for their own actions-a constitutional responsibility, as pointed out by Senator Button-but also fail to take responsibility for the actions of their departments, for which they are responsible, and blame especially those public servants for whom they are responsible for the difficulties they face. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that it is this lack of responsibility combined with the scandals, petty and otherwise, which have beset this Government, and the failure of the Prime Minister to demand responsible behaviour from his Ministers and to take a consistent line when dealing with irresponsible behaviour, which has led to the perception and reality of a lack of morality in high public office in this country. If the Government of the day acts like a pack of power hungry, irresponsible mafiosi it is no wonder that its friends in other places indulge in the tax evasion, tax avoidance and fraudulent behaviour that have been demonstrated in recent months and years. It is no wonder that members of the Public Service-or some sections of it-directionless and seeing the behaviour of those who are put in charge of them, in some cases forget their responsibilities to the people. The vast majority of officers of the Public Service are honest and conscientious. It must be hard for some of them to be so in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> On 1 April 1980 Mr N. A. Brown-now the Honourable N. A. Brown, a Minister of the Government-presented to the House of Representatives a report of a delegation which he had led to Zimbabwe, which was then known as Rhodesia. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We have the principle of ministerial responsibility under the system of government that was elected in free and fair elections in Rhodesia. It is a pity that it is not practised more often here. </PARA>
<PARA>He compared unfavourably the principle of ministerial responsibility as it applied in this country with that applied in Zimbabwe at the time. Of course, he is now a Minister and must be mute on the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. He is acting as the first law officer of this country. Those were his views only two short years ago. One wonders whether privately they are his views now. We saw the spectacle yesterday of the Prime Minister castigating the royal commissioner who, as I said, was a distinguished judge, and a former colleague of his, Bert Kelly, whose integrity, consistency and honesty have never been questioned inside or outside of this Parliament. He castigated departmental officers also, in a tedious speech which was over an hour long and tried to justify his failure to deal with the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) in the way he had dealt with the previous Ministers such as Senator Withers, Mr Moore and Mr MacKellar. The Prime Minister in the course of his speech referred to what he called 'significant breakdowns and administrative failures in areas of public administration'. It seems that when it suits him we have a supporter in the Prime Minister. He referred to the Narcotics Bureau, the Australian Federal Police and the Crown Solicitor's Office. But there have been many more breakdowns and administrative failures than theirs. They have affected not only the revenue of this country but also the civil liberties, rights and freedoms of many Australians. In these and other cases the failure to administer responsibility and to accept the responsibility attached to high public office has led to some of the more disgraceful episodes in the recent history of our public life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We should look at some of those episodes. Firstly, let us look at what should have been the petty case of the colour television set which so upset Senator Carrick. A Minister of the Crown failed to fill out his Customs declaration because he was tired. He got his secretary to do so and quite illegally sign the form for him. He then evaded duty payable for the television. If he did not, why was he sacked?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may well have been done under instructions. I point out that a public servant who at the time persisted in doing his duty was subjected to the grossest pressure to rethink the truth, to desist in his efforts, but he persisted. Eventually the two Ministers, the one carrying the television set and the other carrying the can, were retired to the back bench, where presumably they are now plotting their resurrection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What happened to the honest and persistent public servant? He was invalided out of the Public Service-a burnt-out case, a victim of the scandal as much as anybody else, and who in the Government cares? Who, including Senator Martin, gives a damn? How many others over the years have tried to do their duty in the way in which this man did and failed? How many will sit on their reports and not persist in their duty because it is just not worth the candle? How many more Customs officers, tax assessors, meat inspectors, or others, will look at the example shown to them by their Ministers and come to the conclusion that the best way to survive is to turn a blind eye; to be in it, if that is the way things are to be? We should spare a thought for the vast majority of honest, efficient public servants who, because of failure of leadership by example from the top-and from lower ranks also-and given the sorts of examples that have been shown them, must wonder why they persist in the duties that they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> I give one example which occurred in 1978. That was the year of the social security fraud case, when 178 Greek Australian citizens were subject to harassment through dawn raids. It was the year in which the Department of Health told the then Minister for Health that overservicing and fraud were costing $ 100m. No action was taken; the Minister took no notice. In 1978, it will be remembered, a tax evasion case was tangled in the offices of the Deputy Crown Solicitor, the Crown Solicitor and the Commissioner of Taxation. No action was taken and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said in a statement to this Parliament that he took no action because the public was not sufficiently concerned about the matter. In 1978 Senator Primmer made a statement to the Senate detailing allegations of malpractice in the meat industry. No action was taken; the Minister displayed no interest in it. However, the law enforcement agencies at the time, which were unwilling to take on the big targets-the doctors and the culpable company directors-and had no reason to believe that the relevant Ministers were serious about their taking any action, were eager to take on the easiest targets of all, the social security pensioners. So willing was the Government to believe its own propaganda about social security frauds that it was open to believing that a preposterous conspiracy was raging in the Greek community. </PARA>
<PARA> We all know what has happened. Ten million dollars and four years later the case has collapsed. The magistrate has criticised the Government and the Crown Solicitor's Office for believing a man whom he describes as a liar and for taking notice of a detective constable at the time whom he describes as having no credibility and whose case should be considered with a view to a charge of perjury and conspiracy against the Crown being laid. Nothing has happened in the three months since. No action has been taken by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to see what has happened to the nine people who, as a result of the evidence of this man, were charged in Greece for offences in Australia. We have a feeling at the highest level, that of the Attorney-General, that this was all a sad mistake and should not have happened but it is not his responsibility to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is that sort of lack of responsibility, lack of consistency and failure on the part of the Prime Minister to take action in cases such as these involving senior Ministers of his Government-as well as the actions referred to by Senator Button-that will bring us back again and again to this chamber to talk about the declining standards of administration and morality of the present Government. As Senator Button says, we will persist in doing so until this Government is removed by the people who have that power-the electors of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened to Senator Grimes talking about the subject before the Senate at the moment, which is the rapidly declining standards of government administration. It disturbs me that people continually draw up matters for discussion that seem to infer personal slights on members of parliament and others. I do not think that dignifies the Senate at all. In recent times I have been disturbed to hear honourable senators make allegations such as those made last week. An honourable senator cast aspersions on a former member of the House of Representatives, now the Australian Consul- General in Los Angeles. He used quite incorrect figures when he dealt with that matter. It involved the acquisition of a property by the former member's family company as a result of the liquidation of another company of the same name. That property was acquired, on the advice of the firm's lawyers and accountants, at a valuation in the order of $187,000. I think $7,000 was paid in duty, so in total $194,000 was paid for the property. Yet, an honourable senator suggested that the sum involved was $18,000.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am surprised that the honourable senator concerned, Senator Bolkus, being a legal man, did not recognise that this matter is before the courts and is the subject of a difference of opinion between the liquidator and the firm referred to. This matter is subject to a court determination. I am quite sure that if a different valuation is applied following the court determination, the matter will be resolved. I am surprised that a person like Senator Bolkus would stoop to denigrating a person in that way. He knows full well that the person concerned has no recourse because Senator Bolkus chose to do it under parliamentary privilege. It is an indictment of the whole Senate that that sort of thing should be allowed to persist. It is a pity that there is not some court of appeal within the Parliament-some ethics committee or similar committee of the Parliament-to enable people to come forward to correct misstatements that are irresponsibly made in this place. That would give them the opportunity to re-establish their credibility in the eyes of the community. Last week reference was made to this matter on the front page of the South Australian Advertiser. In my opinion, this is an example of irresponsibility by honourable senators on the other side of this chamber. I suggest that this debate was instigated by a party that for three years presided over an administration that I regard as the worst this country has seen.

<PARA>Our creed amounted to this. 'We mustn't oppose anything, no matter how extreme, that is put to us by a union official or we will be branded as 'anti-union' and then our preselectors will know we are also anti-Labor.' Those certainly appeared to be the principal guidelines governing the thought processes of the majority of Cabinet Ministers when I asked them to reject the stage-managed wage increase which the Public Service Board employees offered to their own union in 1973. </PARA>
<PARA> It was plain as a pikestaff that we were being 'mugged' for a wage rip-off. But , so what? They were unionists weren't they? And so, the fuse was lit to the explosion that occurred a few months later. And yet no-one seemed to understand the connection between salary rises in the Public Service, and the wage demands that were to flare up in the private sector from early 1974 onwards. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to talk about white collar crime:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . no-one suspected it was happening because the thieves wore waistcoats, travelled in Z cars, affected the dignity of dukes and had agents to leak Government secrets to the media in return for 'protection'. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of efficiency that prevailed in the Australian Labor Party Administration in those days. We are still suffering for it. This Government has been trying to get out of the mess created by the maladministration and poor government administration of those days. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button, in his inimitable way, chose to be rather humorous and cynical about the Honourable Sir James Killen and his department of five employees. I imagine that five employees would be relatively easy to manage and it would be relatively easy to detect whether there was maladministration in those quarters. However, we should examine the numbers in other departments. According to the Public Service Board report, the numbers in the departments of the various Ministers who have been mentioned are quite considerable. For example, the Attorney-General's Department has 2,600 employees. It is important, too, to remember that the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union went back to 1972, during the years of the Whitlam Administration. That department was then under the so- called supervision of the Attorney-General, then Senator Murphy. The Department of Social Security, administered by Senator Chaney, has 13,275 employees. The Treasury has even more. There are about 18,000 people in the Treasury under the supervision of the Treasurer (Mr Howard). How can one possibly look over the shoulders of 18,000 people to ensure that they are doing their jobs correctly? Ministers have to rely quite definitely on the advice they are given from time to time by their senior officers and the section leaders within their departments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appropriate to refer to just one or two comments made in respect of ministerial responsibility. I refer to the The Canberra Model, an essay on Australian Government by David Butler, a Fellow of the Nuffield College, Oxford, and Visiting Fellow at the Australian National University in 1967 and 1972. Under the heading 'Ministerial Responsibility', he has this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Consider first individual ministerial responsibility. Its central doctrine is that for every public act of a public servant for a ministerial department, a minister has to answer to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Individual ministerial responsibility is easy to ridicule. How can a minister take responsibility for the innumerable acts of his civil servants, many of them involving technicalities of which he could not conceivably be master?</PARA>

<PARA>I suggest to Senator Button, with respect to the Costigan Royal Commission and his criticiisms of the Government following that, that when the Labor Party was in government it identified one or two tax evasion schemes but did nothing about it. The Labor Government vaguely made the statement 'Oh yes, we'll do this', but 12 months later nothing had happened. Then the Fraser Government came to office.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We set up the Costigan Commission. We broadened the terms of reference to allow matters such as taxation subjects to be dealt with. I do not think that that can be regarded by anybody as a failure properly to administer. We showed a lead to the former Labor Government. We showed that we were prepared to seal up the loopholes with respect to tax evasion schemes and we were prepared to do something about the problem. All of us in this chamber are very concerned about tax rip-offs by entrepreneurs who promote these tax evasion schemes and suck innocent people into them. We are desperately anxious to deal with them. We have shown the Government's intention to do just that. But the Labor Party, of course, would not have the mentality or foresight to set up a commission such as the Costigan Commission, so that a Government has before it information requiring action, as it has now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Action is being carried out. Certain officers have been charged under the Public Service Act. They are extremely culpable and will be dealt with according to the processes of the law. The Government has established the office of special prosecutor, whose work will be to examine the evidence that has been presented against people who have been named in the Costigan report in order to gather sufficient evidence to enable the Government to take action against those offenders who are involved with illegal taxation avoidance or evasion schemes. Senator Sir John Carrick mentioned a Crimes commission. We recognise that major crime in Australia is clearly a growing problem. We are having consultations with the States. Some States have not agreed entirely with the proposition, but I understand that consultation is continuing. I am quite sure that the State governments will recognise the tremendous significance of co-operating with the Commonwealth to establish a crimes commission to deal with major crime in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> When the people of Australia listen to the facts associated with this matter, they will realise that the present Government is certainly on the track to dealing with the problems revealed by the Costigan report. It is quite irresponsible of the Opposition to bring this matter before the Senate today. The Opposition has a gall in doing so, because it has done nothing to deal with the tremendous problem of tax evasion. The Fraser Government has come to grips with it and is doing something about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition has raised as a matter of public importance today the rapidly declining standards of government administration. We have had a wild but insubstantial response from the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) and a rather pathetic defence from Senator Jessop. It is worth pointing out that the Government does not even have a full slate of speakers for the debate. Senator Jessop said that the Labor Government did nothing about tax evasion. Of course, tax evasion had barely begun at that stage, but even though it had barely begun, the Labor Government had authorised prosecutions in 1975. Senator Jessop spoke rather rapidly in saying that the Fraser Government came to office and set up the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, ignoring the fact that there were about seven years in between those two events.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The standards of the present Government have always left much to be desired. Those standards have gradually got worse and worse. In recent times the rate of that decline has accelerated, which has just been paralleled by the rate of the decline in the Government's fortunes. What is more, the Government knows it. It is a guilty Government. One can tell that from how its members look. The Ministers look sick, and those behind them do as well. They know that they are guilty. I suggest they are physically and mentally exhausted from running around in circles trying to plug up all their problems. I heard someone say recently: ' Gee, the Ministers of this Government look crook'-to which someone answered, ' Yes, they are not looking too well, either'. They have not done their duty. </PARA>
<PARA> The conservatives were dismissed in 1972 for being tired and incompetent. During the period of the Labor Government from 1972 to 1975, they ranted and raved at having lost what they thought was their God-given right to govern. As we all know, they took desperate and immoral actions to counter that. They are still ranting and raving about the actions of the Whitlam Government. We had the amazing claim by Senator Sir John Carrick that there had been 35 Ministers go in the Labor Government. Everyone knows that that is just a fabrication. I presume that he was including those at the end of the term who lost their positions as a result of the actions of this Senate in denying supply. One thing that can be said is that there was never any taint of corruption about our Ministers. Certainly a couple got into strife, but only because they tried to administer the country actively; it was not because of neglect and that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) came to power with many high sounding words. He promised integrity and honesty of government, so that, he said, he could have the confidence and trust of the people. Admittedly, he managed to convince the electorate that his Government was not as bad as we said it was, for a couple of elections. But now at least, as the standards have declined even further and the revelations of past slipped standards have increased, it is clearly perceived by everyone, including the present Government 's supporters, that it is in disgrace and on the slide. I do not think that anyone has any argument about that. It is only a matter of time before the Government goes. </PARA>
<PARA> That is all very good for us, as an opposition. We benefit politically and, ultimately, electorally. But it is not good for the nation that we have such a bumbling and incompetent government lurching from crisis to crisis. There are new examples daily of unacceptably poor administration. As a result of this, the whole nation loses its self-respect. Australians ought to be able to be proud of the way in which their country is administered, even if they disagree with the ideology of the government in power. Such pride is just not possible at present in respect of this Government. The Prime Minister cannot afford any more sackings or resignations, because he is already at the bottom of the barrel. Let us look at those he has lost by one means or another. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Garland has been mentioned. A point that ought to be made in response to Senator Sir John Carrick is that he did not give the true situation in his response about Mr Garland, because Mr Garland was not acquitted. The magistrate ruled that a prima facie case had been established but did not proceed to let it go to the jury. So, there was Mr Garland. There was Mr McLeay; Withers, Peacock, MacKellar, Moore, Groom and a number of others. Apart from that, others have gone and come back, such as Sir Phillip Lynch and Mr Sinclair, who are still under a cloud. Yet more have been dropped down the scale. Look at Mr Viner. Look at Sir James Killen, the Minister for nothing-although, of course, as was said earlier, how well he does it. Some of the remaining Ministers just keep their heads down. They think that if they do nothing they will not get into trouble. How wrong some of them will be proved to be. It is not good administration either. Because they believe they have a God-given right to govern, they think they need to govern only benignly. </PARA>
<PARA> The rest of the Ministry ranges from the bumbling inadequacy of, say, a Newman- it is amazing that he has survived so long-through to the mere public relations hype of a Hodgman, who provides much waving of arms but how many Australian Capital Territory residents are happy with him, to the never giving of an answer to a question without notice of a Guilfoyle, who also allowed the social security conspiracy witch-hunt, and to the continuing receipt of a 4 per cent interest loan of an Anthony, a person at Deputy Prime Minister level. Then there is the Prime Minister, the Fraser of double standards, who will not accept resignations that he ought to accept and who does not ask for others for which he ought to ask. We have Ministers who were, at the very least, culpably negligent in respect of medical fraud and in their failure to deal properly with tax evasion and avoidance. Most recently Minister Nixon has provided us with one thing after another in respect of the administration of the Department of Primary Industry. I refer to the Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd scandal, the meat substitution scandal and it now appears possibly something relating to fisheries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations ought to be working itself out of business, but it is getting more and more work. It is being overloaded with work because of Ministers like Mr Nixon. The Government, of course, answers that many of these matters involve public servants as well as Ministers. That is so but Ministers are ultimately responsible unless they did not know and could not have been expected to know the situation. In all of the cases that we are talking about Ministers either did know or could have been expected to know or to find out. What has happened is a passing of the blame to public servants generally, trying to make them the scapegoat. As the Secretary of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, Paul Munro, said yesterday or earlier today:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's intended major examination of the Public Service is an attempt to divert public attention from the hapless performances of ministers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that he:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . did not condone personal dishonesty among public servants and recognised that this may exist. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we protest strongly at any attempt at scape-goating the Public Service . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . if a Minister was soft on a matter, be it tax avoidance or protecting the meat export trade, it was unrealistic to expect the Public Service to be hard. </PARA>
<PARA> Any review or examination of the Public Service for fault should be accompanied by an even harder examination of Ministers and Cabinet, which had primary responsibility throughout including that of resource allocation. </PARA>
<PARA>As that statement points out there is no need to be a blind defender of the Public Service. Whilst the majority of public servants are conscientious and as efficient as they are allowed to be, of course there are some who damage the good name of the Public Service. It is very frustrating and annoying when this happens. But what can this Government expect from the Public Service? A low standard government can only tend to be reflected by lower standards in the Public Service. This Government preaches survival of the fittest; it encourages everyone to get what he can out of the system. Is it any wonder that we end up with the meat scandal, with tax evasion and with medifraud? No encouragement is given to people to pay tax as an honourable activity in accordance with their ability to pay. Of course the public reacts accordingly and the Public Service reacts accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of that the Government continually disparages and denigrates the Public Service. It imposes unreasonable staff ceilings and at the same time expects more activity out of public servants. This Government has tried to knock the fair and caring attitude out of everyone. There is no encouragement of a fair and reasonable attitude in the community. This Government has continually sold out those who have been involved in public administration. It has given away traditional public responsibilities to the private sector. It has reduced the effectiveness of Telecom Australia and Australia Post and dismissed staff and taken away their role. Is it any wonder that the Governmen sometimes cannot obtain full co-operation from some public servants?</PARA>
<PARA> As I have suggested the Opposition is not in favour of excess fat in the Public Service and nor does it condone poor administration. We want a tight administration and we will have it after we come to government next year or later this year. I would like to inject a positive note into the debate by reminding honourable senators about the Labor Opposition's task force on Government administration which was involved in preparing recommendations for the Caucus before the 1980 election. It was re-elected during this Parliament and has recently distributed its report to Caucus members. It provides a thorough look at how a Labor Government will efficiently, thoroughly, honestly and credibly provide a high standard of administration. The Labor Party is taking the responsibility of government seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> One ought to mention also, of course, that the present Liberal Government's administration has caused bad management of the economy and a high level of unemployment and it has taken no action to overcome them. The current mess of ministerial impropriety and lack of attention to the real work of government means that the Government is distracted from its deeper policy lapses. It also means, unfortunately, that the public is distracted from those deeper and more important policy lapses. How can Government members run the country when they are running around with their heads off as they are present? It is an appalling government. It has led to an appallingly low morale in the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> From the head of a department to the lowest clerical assistant there ought to be pride in the outfit he or she is working for, but that cannot be expected under this Government. It is unfit for government; it is just not up to the job. It is a hick government which has allowed the Public Service to risk gaining the same sort of reputation which has been attributed in the past to local government. It will take a long time and some careful nurturing to regain the proper reputation. This Government will never be able to do that. It must go so that a Labor Government, with higher standards, can be installed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with amazement to the debate this afternoon on the matter of public importance raised by the Australian Labor Party. In recent weeks the standard of debate in the Senate, as a result of the conduct of the Opposition on debating issues that it has raised, has lowered the standard of the Senate considerably. But I do not think anything is as sad a reflection on the Opposition as its conduct this afternoon. As I sat here and listened to the words of Senator Button, Senator Grimes and Senator Coates I have had a mental vision of what it must have been like when the British colonisers landed in a new country and were greeted by the ignorant savages. Those colonisers threw around coloured beads with gay abandon believing that the ignorant savages would believe them to be valuable when, in fact, they were worthless. What the ALP is doing in the Senate in debate, particularly this afternoon, is tossing around words, allegations and imputations of impropriety as though they were coloured beads and as though all those who are listening and who might subsequently read the debate will react to them as ignorant savages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have had the most extraordinary statements made which cut against all the fact on issues that have previously been debated in this chamber; matters on which papers have been tabled and made available to all honourable senators, including Opposition senators and from which statements and conclusions have been made by Senator Grimes in particular which bear no relationship whatsoever to documents publicly available and statements which are actually on the record.</PARA>
<PARA> I shall have the opportunity to pick up a couple of those issues but nobody would be able to pick up all the allegations that have been made with such rapid fire style here this afternoon. Of course there is an amount of repetition in the allegations. We are told that the matter of public importance that the Opposition believes that the other business of the Senate should be set aside for to debate, is a matter of standards of government administration. We have had what has now become a repetitive litany of statements about individuals, present Ministers and former Ministers of successive Fraser Governments. It has reached the stage where, in preparing for a debate on a matter of public importance raised by the Opposition, regardless of how it chooses to phrase it, all one has to do is to read a catalogue of previous speeches made by Labor Party leaders in this chamber and by Mr Hayden, Mr Bowen and others in the other chamber to know exactly what is going to be said. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, Senator Button. That is all one has to do. It is a waste of time to listen. The sad thing is that the same misstatements and the same misrepresentations are made over and over again. Very clearly, the Labor Party believes, disgracefully believes, that if one repeats an allegation often enough, whether it is true or not, people will believe it; that it will take on the patina of truth; or perhaps it hopes that the Government will become weary of rejecting the same tedious untrue allegations.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that. I will deal with one in particular from Senator Grimes. In his speech he made a reference to me on a subject on which I have spoken in the Senate and on which my view is on the record. If he had read the Senate debate on that subject on a previous occasion this year he would have known what was said by me, as the Government speaker, on that specific subject. But he did not, as I dare say he has not read the papers that were tabled either . What they indicate is something very different from what Senator Grimes, via the air waves, has chosen to have people believe this afternoon. The Opposition obviously also believes that if there is sufficient mud slinging some of it will stick, as indeed I dare say some of it does. But some mud also sticks to the hands of those who sling it. By making such loose and wild accusations, the Labor Party is muddied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cavalier attitude to facts was very clearly illustrated during the speech by Senator Grimes, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in this place, in statements he made in reference to Mr MacKellar and Mr Moore. He said that Mr MacKellar had failed to fill in a form, had allowed his secretary to sign it and there by broke the law. That is just not true. Mr MacKellar did not break the law by allowing someone else to fill in a form and sign it for him. If Senator Grimes will take the time to read that debate and to read papers associated with it he will find what the alleged offence was. It did not have to do with what he put in his shorthand form this afternoon. Even worse, he then went on to say that Mr John Moore either voluntarily or under pressure covered up for Mr MacKellar. With a little encouragement from interjections from his side, he then put heavy emphasis on the statement 'under pressure'. </PARA>
<PARA> The record shows that Mr Moore sought, through the Secretary of his Department, an investigation by the Department of the allegations. The Secretary of his Department subsequently told him that he had investigated the matters and that there was no duty payable on the set that Mr MacKellar brought into Australia. The record shows that in the form of a minute written by the Secretary of the Department. Mr Moore had pursued the issue, had sought an investigation, had taken it seriously and had accepted that, when the Secretary of his Department told him that an investigation had been carried out and that no duty was payable , the Secretary of his Department was telling him the truth. There is no other basis under which a Minister can proceed. To suggest that Mr Moore was responding to any sort of pressure from higher up or from beside him is just disgraceful. There has never been anything to suggest anything of that kind and facts that have been available for months have shown the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> One can only speculate on the difficulties that the Opposition Whip, Senator Robertson, had in drawing up the speakers' list for today's debate. The speakers ' list that I have in front of me shows three Labor senators-Senators Button, Grimes and Coates. In fact we have had several other Labor senators attempting to enter the debate. We had Senators Gietzelt, Walsh and Bolkus earlier and now Senator Robert Ray comes in for his shift to try to take over some of the debate . I say to Senator Ray: 'Speak more sweetly next time to Senator Robertson. In fact, practise speaking sweetly and you might be able to insinuate yourself on to a speakers' list and get a turn'. That is all I have to say to Senator Ray because he does not have anything worth responding to. There are certain principles relating to administration and to responsibility and the Westminster style of government-a phrase much quoted and much printed these days-and they have been dealt with in many publications. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall, Senator. Senator Button needs to know about them. I intend to tell him about them. There have been suggestions that the conduct of this Government and the way Ministers have carried out their responsibilities somehow is deserving of condemnation. I will quote from a document of the Australian Senate. It is a report on the Freedom of Information Bill from the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. I remind the Senate-I place this fact on record-that there are three Government and three Opposition senators on this Committee. The three Opposition senators are all Labor senators. They are Senators Evans, Tate and Keeffe. The Committee brought in a unanimous report so one takes it that this is the view of at least that group of Labor senators, and that no others have taken exception to that report, on the subject of the Westminster system and specifically on the subject of ministerial responsibility-what is owed to Parliament by Ministers and implicitly by the Government. On page 34 of that report this interesting statement appears:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this chapter we analyse exactly what the 'Westminster system' is, both in theory and practice. </PARA>
<PARA>The next paragraph starts:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no precise definition of the Westminster system in the real sense,</PARA>
<PARA>One would think that a small contradiction but it is interesting as an introduction to just some of the difficulties one can get into on this subject. However, the Committee was not deterred. That sentence continued:</PARA>
<PARA>and it is unlikely that there ever could be because so much of what is understood as essential to the system is informal, depending upon traditions, conventions and understandings that do not admit of precise formulation. </PARA>
<PARA>Nevertheless, the Committee went on to attempt a formulation. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Although we do not offer any definition of the Westminster system, we can quite easily state what have traditionally been held to be the key elements of it, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Under the characteristic features, the Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is a doctrine of individual ministerial responsibility which holds that each minister is personally responsible for all of the decisions made and carried out by the department which he heads;</PARA>

<PARA> No part of the Westminster system has been so thoroughly criticised, nor has any part so thoroughly changed, as the doctrine of individual ministerial responsibility. . . . It must be remembered that this doctrine developed in the days when departments of State were small and it was a reasonable assumption that ministers of state were familiar with everything that went on in their departments. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Political practices have changed, and the twin forces of the increasing complexity and scope of departments of State (meaning that no one believes that ministers can be 'on top' of everything) and the development of party solidarity . . .

<PARA>We remember that was the view of the Labor Party too. That sentence continues:</PARA>
<PARA>have fundamentally eroded this doctrine. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The very size and complexity of modern departments inevitably means tha the chances of these mistakes, even on a large scale, will multiply. For instance, in August 1977 the Auditor-General pointed out that the Department of Social Security had overpaid benefits to the extent of $40m but the Minister did not feel obliged to resign, and neither did anyone seriously call for her resignation. </PARA>

<PARA>I suggest to Senator Grimes that he read my speech in the debate on the incident in question and he will find that I was sympathetic to the position that that man was put into. There has been no suggestion from the Government of any contrary situation on that matter. Senator Grimes's allegations were cavalier in their attitude to the facts and the great danger is that the Australian Labor Party is showing signs of believing its own propaganda. Senator Grimes, in conclusion, said that the Opposition will persist in raising this matter in the Senate. I have no doubt at all that the Opposition will persist in raising this matter in the Senate. That is its right. I just say that I hope it will not continue to persist in misrepresentation of individuals, of events in which they have been involved, of government actions and of the facts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last hour and a half the Senate has witnessed the rather sad spectacle of the two old political parties throwing mud at each other. If honourable senators do not realise it, I can assure them that the public realises very clearly that it is a matter of the kettle calling the pot black. The unfortunate fact is that both the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party have been subjected, over the last few months, to accusations of support from elements in the community which they wish were not supporting them. I refer to corrupt big business and to corrupt trade unions. If ever there was a need for a new political party, the evidence of the last few weeks has surely demonstrated that better than it has ever been demonstrated before. We need a political party that is not supported by forces in the community which have been shown so obviously to be corruptible and to have influenced the political system of this country directly through their associations with the Labor Party and the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not intend to become involved in the mud slinging exercise. This debate relates to 'the rapidly declining standards of government administration'. When I read the topic of this matter of public importance, I was delighted, because I felt that the Senate had at last put its finger on the nerve centre of what is wrong with this country, which is, without a doubt, poor administration. I suggest that to administer this country successfully we first of all have to embrace certain basic principles of administration. These principles of administration apply in business and they certainly should apply in the business of running the country. In my very brief sojourn in this chamber I have seen these principles eroded. I have seen these basic principles torn asunder as though the country could be administered without reference to them. I intend to spend the few minutes available to me in reminding honourable senators of these principles that must be embraced if we are to get back to running this country as it should be run and getting it out of the problems which are surrounding it on every side. </PARA>
<PARA> The first principle undoubtedly, whether it applies to the running of the country or the running of business, is accountability. Where does the buck stop? That accountability must start at the top. Ministers have to accept responsibility. To suggest that a Minister, the political head of a large body of people, can use as an excuse the fact that he was not informed or that he did not know what was going on is simply to put that Minister and all Ministers, if that is to be the accepted principle, in the position of mere puppets. The Minister, as head of the department, has to accept the responsibility for what goes on in the department, as does the department itself. If there is no accountability at the top, I suggest that down the line also there is a great lack of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> We see the operation these days of interdepartmental committees. What effect do those committees have? Their operation means that departments can shelve responsibility. They collectively assess matters of policy but nobody can say clearly who was responsible for what. In the old days of Curtin, Chifley and Menzies, it was very clearly laid down where the responsibility lay within the government administration. The Minister was clearly responsible, as was the head of the department. The first area of concern, to me at least, is simply the whole principle, from the top down, of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA> The second principle, I suggest, is developing an organisational structure which allows people an area of responsibility in which they can use their human qualities, their technical expertise and their initiative. In the administration of government clearly this means that we have to have some system of measuring output. People have to understand and be shown clearly what is expected of them. This is not happening at the moment. In a company structure, unless one is prepared to state clearly to people where their responsibilities start and finish and to measure their performance, one will not get efficiency. As far as I can see, this principle applies equally to the Public Service. Why cannot small groups of people be told clearly what is expected of them and why cannot their performance be monitored on a regular basis? There is nothing more soul destroying than to be part of a large organisation where nobody is measuring one 's performance and nobody is aware of what one is doing and whether one is doing it well or badly. </PARA>
<PARA> My third criticism of government administration relates to the location of Canberra and its isolation from the business community of this country. Canberra is a delightful place to live but it happens to be just too far away from Sydney , Melbourne, and the other State capitals. About 12 months ago the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures conducted a survey of the backgrounds of parliamentarians. The survey revealed that of all parliamentarians-members and senators from both sides of the Houses-only four had a background in business. I think one of those four was a second hand car salesman and another was involved in the administration of some business associated with the trade union movement. A large number of our politicians are doctors, lawyers and farmers. Very few have had practical experience in administration. I suggest that this, in association with the isolation of Canberra, means that we have a very serious problem. </PARA>
<PARA> How do we solve it? It is interesting to note what Roosevelt said when he came to power during the 1930 Depression. He said, in effect: 'I have received all kinds of advice from the business sector. I am now President of the United States and I will call into my administration the people who gave the advice. They can now take the responsibility for trying to fix the country'. It is interesting that a President reorganised the administration by bringing in people who had practical administrative experience. I believe that if we are to do justice to our country we need people of proven administrative backgrounds. Canberra must have the best brains in the country. This can happen only if the Government adopts a new approach to administration that will allow people of experience to work in areas of responsibility involved in the running of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> At the present time, we are going through a period in which there is a scandal every second day. Accusations are flying around this chamber and the other place . As a result, the real problems of our economy are receiving very slight attention. The level of unemployment is mounting at a dangerously rapid pace. We have a dangerous balance of payments problem. But who is doing anything about that? We have just seen the introduction of a Budget in respect of which, in spite of its hand-outs, the economic approach is essentially that which we have been through over the last three years. The Budget provides for another domestic surplus and another tight economic approach to the management of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> Sooner or later we have to do something about the crisis that is around us. We must have firm government direction. I get the impression that we are riding in an aeroplane which is in a tail spin with nobody at the controls. In 1952 Australia faced a not dissimilar problem to the one we are facing today. At that time we had mounting inflation and a critical balance of payments problem. The Government of the day under Robert Menzies said that the time had come for action. He laid down a whole series of new initiatives. We must have some new initiatives for the economic management of the country if we are to solve the problems that are surrounding us. We are facing probably the worst drought in the nation's history. We are facing a period in which commodity prices are escalating. Unless we change the economic direction, inevitably we will be in a situation as bad as that of the 1930s. So the challenge is there. We have to revamp our administration. We have to bring into administration the best brains in the country, people who have a proven administrative experience. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all, we have to be prepared to adopt and embrace the very first principle of good management and good administration which is accountability. That accountability starts with Ministers. It then has to be organised to apply right down the line. I do not wish to imply any criticism of the Public Service as such in anything that I have said. I believe from what I have seen that the Public Service is a body of dedicated people who perform brilliantly within the parameters that they are given. But they are not organised in a way that allows them to come to grips with the problems that are facing them on all sides. The problem starts at the top; it starts with the Government; and it starts with the way the Government has organised and is organising the Public Service. We have to get right away from interdepartmental committees. We must be prepared to say to a head of a department: 'There is your responsibility. It is clearly laid out . That is what we expect of you'. The head of the department in turn has to pass that responsibility all the way down the line. I think the Senate has put its finger on this critical area. We must do something to improve the situation. We must in fact have a complete change of direction in the way that we have been administering this country. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; by leave-The documents I have tabled can broadly be broken into three groups. First, there is a fairly detailed chronology of the Government's handling of straw companies and the development of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act in the period 1978-1980 together with a detailed listing of other tax issues taken to Cabinet, legislation introduced and Press releases on tax initiatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Second, there is a batch of documents consisting of memoranda from the Commissioner, diary notes and correspondence between departments and Ministers, et cetera, that relate to the Government's handling of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act over the same period. Documents in this group that the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) personally did not see at the time have been identified by an asterisk. </PARA>
<PARA> The third batch consists of three legal opinions. The Solicitor-General has considered that counsel's opinions and other legal advice referred to in items 2 , 7, 12, 13, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21 and 22 of the Senate resolution should not be tabled on the ground that public disclosure of the contents would be harmful to the administration of justice. He personally examined each of the documents in question. He has stated that, in his view, harm would be caused both to those who may be prosecuted and to those who may be proceeded against civilly, or to the cause of the prosecutor or civil complainant. In many instances both sides would be injured. That injury would not, in his view, be avoided by excising names. The Solicitor-General has reached a similar conclusion in relation to the police investigation report referred to in item 15. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that it should accept the advice of the Solicitor- General on this matter. The Treasurer (Mr Howard) believes that there is no other proper course that the Government could follow, even though the opinions, if they were able to be tabled, would show that counsels' opinions were not all 'one way' on the availability of adequate and effective legal remedies in the cases that they related to. Thus, the opinion of counsel referred to in item 2 of the Evans motion advised that there was insufficient evidence to warrant criminal proceedings on a charge under section 86 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act . The Lockhart opinion referred to in item 7 of the motion, while it advised of reasonable prospects of success, recognised the difficulties inherent in establishing a charge of conspiracy to defraud or similar charges. The Attorney- General (Senator Durack) pointed out to the Senate on 7 September 1982 that this opinion did not relate to a 'bottom-of-the-harbour' scheme. He also referred to the question of further action being taken on this case and made the obvious point, now confirmed by the Solicitor-General, that the opinion should not be tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents show a number of things. These include: First, apart from the reference in the minute of 24 May 1978 which the Treasurer has already referred to in the House, no reference, directly or indirectly, was made in any document coming to the Treasurer from the Commissioner of Taxation or anyone else regarding the circumstances surrounding what ultimately has become known as the Perth case reported upon by Mr Costigan. As the Treasurer has already said, he does not believe it can fairly be said that the reference in the minute of 24 May should of itself have placed him on further inquiry regarding the circumstances of that case. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, as the Treasurer said in his reply to the McCabe-Lafranchi report, the Australian Taxation Office regularly passed on information to the Treasurer regarding straw company activity and strongly pressed for introduction of proposals which, with important changes, became embodied in the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, from very early in the piece, both the concept and scope of the proposals put to the Treasurer by the Australian Taxation Office and which were ultimately incorporated in the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act because of their unprecedented character as far as the tax law was concerned, required careful consideration by the Treasurer and the Government. There was concern not only about what represented a new approach in this area of the tax law, but also any reversal of the onus of proof in criminal matters. That concern was shared by the relevant Government members' committee and most strongly by the Taxation Advisory Committee. Concern about the nature of and opposition to the legislation continued until and beyond the time of its passage in December 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the period covered by the documents saw an unprecedented volume of political, administrative and legislative action against tax avoidance of which the area covered by the straw company issue was but one part. </PARA>
<PARA> I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers and the statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition finds itself in some difficulty having had very little more than 25 minutes to examine a bundle of documents which, in booklet form, runs to something close to 500 pages. I state at the outset that it is a matter of regret that the Government, the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), has not seen fit to observe the normal courtesies of this place and make such a tabling statement and the documents in question available two hours before they are brought down so that some reasonable credible response can be given. Under the circumstances, I propose to do no more than to make a few brief remarks at this stage and then to seek leave to continue my remarks later in the hope that we might come back to this matter at a later hour this day or perhaps tomorrow. Certainly the importance of the issues at stake and the nature of the Government's response to the request for the tabling of documents in this matter are such that debate on this matter cannot be long delayed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My initial reaction to this document is that I suppose it is comparable to the character of the scandal with which we are dealing, which I have described as the greatest scandal in the history of Australian public administration. The particular document with which we are now confronted seems to me very close to being the biggest snow job in the history of public administration in this country. What was sought in the motion which, of course, has not yet been debated in this place was a specified list of 22 documents or sets of documents relating quite specifically to questions about what the Government knew and what it was advised about as far as the existence and legality of bottom-of-the- harbour schemes were concerned from the early to mid-1970s onwards. Of those 22 documents and sets of documents requested we have been given only eight. We have been refused access to the remaining documents. Of the 14 actual legal opinions and advices that were sought only three have been provided. They are the two relatively innocuous and uninformative but nonetheless still interesting opinions of Messrs Ormiston and Spry at the end of 1978 and the opinion of Mr Arthur Webb in September, I think, of 1978. The contents of those documents already have been the subject of quite well-informed speculation. </PARA>
<PARA> We have the extraordinary state of affairs that, as the Minister made clear in the tabling statement, fully 11 opinions or advices that have been sought have not simply been presented to us in a sanitised form; they have been rejected outright as appropriate for this Parliament to look at. That is a matter which I regard as quite unconscionable and quite intolerable. The matter will not be allowed to rest there as far as we are concerned. I make it clear that we members of the Australian Labor Party readily acknowledge the desirability of there not going on the public record any document which conceivably could prejudice a genuine prosecution or legal proceeding. The cursory way in which the Senate's access to these documents is dealt with in the Minister's statement and the criteria that apparently have been applied by the Solicitor-General in advising the Government not to release these documents do not appear to be confined to considerations of that kind. That clearly is a matter that we will have to debate later in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> As an illustration of the kinds of documents which have not been made available to us, I shall list those which were mentioned in the original motion but were not given to us: The Brinsden opinion of 1974; the second Brinsden opinion dated June 1975; the series of memoranda as such from Messrs Gleedman, O'Sullivan and Massie of the Perth Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office from 1975 onwards; the opinion of the unnamed Sydney Queen's Counsel on the Norfolk Island matter early in 1976, which bore closely upon the power of the Commonwealth to act in relation to conspiracy and matters of this kind; the police report in the Perth matter; and the Lockhart opinion. None of these matters has been provided to us in the massive documentation that nonetheless now sits on our desk. </PARA>
<PARA> Counsel's advice, given in April 1976 on a matter which in fact, on the statement of Mr Howard of 27 June, may have been negative and as such may have done something to round out our perception of this, has not been supplied either . The advices that apparently flowed from the Perth Crown Solicitor's Office to the Sydney Crown Solicitor's Office in the 1977 matter and which were followed, if television reports are accurate, by dissenting memoranda from the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Sydney are not here supplied. The Traill opinion of July 1978 is not provided. The Crown Solicitor's advice-that crucial letter of April 1979 which is referred to in the report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, the Costigan report , and is quite central to the credibility of the Government's case-is not provided. The Crown Solicitor's second advice in September 1980 as to the inadequacy of the existing law is not provided in the documents made available to us. The Solicitor-General's advice of June-July 1982, the most recent advice as to the availability of legal action under the existing law against these vendors, promoters and purchasers, is not made available either in any form. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated all the way along-I have said it again this afternoon-we did not mind these documents being produced in some sanitised form with names of individuals removed from them. In fact of the three legal opinions that are supplied and a number of other documents in this 500-page book the names in fact are deleted in a number of places. It is clearly physically possible for that task to have been done. Why has that sort of exercise not been done in respect of the documents that are missing? The only conclusions to which we can possibly be led in that respect is that the Government has something to hide. It simply does not want us, it does not want the Parliament, it does not want the Australian community to know who knew what when, who was responsible for what advice that was given when. That is the very information we need to be able to attribute responsibility in this matter. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, there has been no such discussion. The only conversations I have had have been along the lines that the Government is endeavouring to have maximum possible disclosure, to be full and frank in this respect, and that the only criteria it seeks to apply ultimately, is the one dealing with prejudice to legal proceedings. To the extent that I have had any private conversations with Ministers-I do not want to be any more specific than that-they have been along those lines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The initial suggestions that the Government was going to apply some Freedom of Information Act criteria of a much broader brush kind in dealing with this, were said to be not the case and that the Government would in fact be endeavouring to be as full and frank as possible. I am afraid that those assurances I have received, on the very brief look that I have been able to give these documents, simply have not been satisfied. What we have instead of the key documents, the ones about which all the argument has debated and raged in this matter is 500- odd pages of, for the most part, entirely irrelevant documents, documents disclosing in great, elaborate detail, detail which I have obviously not had time to assimilate, a number of legislative strategies the Government pursued with varying degrees of effectiveness over the period from 1977 to 1980. We hear about a dozen different legislative schemes and the various measures that were involved in dealing with them. The bundle of documents is preceded by a 50-odd page chronology telling us again in loving and elaborate detail what the Government has done about every conceivable tax avoidance scheme under the sun, except, in passing only, for mention of the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme, which, is, of course, meant to be the nub and substance of this particular document. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course we asked for the original documents and no doubt the originals will be available, but there has apparently been an endeavour to make available the documents in this tabulated and bound form, as a once-and-for-all definitive statement of what the Government is prepared to make available. The only further thing I would add about this is that even though the Government's intention manifestly has been to snow those of us who have an intense interest in finding out what the truth is in this matter, it is nonetheless evident, even from turning the pages over, that some of the material here demonstrates matters of fact which are of profound embarrassment, or which should be of profound embarrassment, to the government of the day. I suspect a closer examination of this material will reveal a good deal more of this kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me refer simply to one such matter, and that is a letter to the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) from the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr O'Reilly, dated 7 November 1979 , which is something of a cry of pain about the Government's inaction on the legislative front, and the Government's manifest incapacity, it appears to Mr O' Reilly at this stage, to get its act together on actually drafting legislation to deal with this phenomenon of straw companies, or what have subsequently become known as bottom-of-the-harbour companies. If I may quote a few paragraphs from Mr O'Reilly's letter of 7 November 1979 I think the point I am making will speak for itself. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> I am gravely concerned to hear that there may be some question about going ahead with the planned legislation on this matter, the nature and level of penalties proposed being, I understand, a source of difficulty for some of your colleagues. May I make these points:</PARA>
<PARA>There is then a series of dotted points-</PARA>
<PARA> These activities are criminal in a nature and fraudulent-they are not merely an aspect of tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA> The potential of the practices, if left unchecked, is such that legislative action against tax avoidance (including revision of section 260) could be largely to no avail. </PARA>
<PARA> This activity is occuring on a large scale, daily. Although the full revenue implications are hard to estimate (because the parties fail to lodge returns and frustrate inquiries), I am having to write off large amounts of assessed income tax because companies have been stripped of assets. </PARA>
<PARA> One promoter has stripped over 1,150 companies in Victoria which had income tax liabilities in the year prior to the strip totalling $14m (23 being over $100, 000). The same promoter emptied 180 West Australian companies, 40 of these cost $6m in tax, and he also stripped 78 Queensland companies at a known tax loss of $1 1/2m. </PARA>
<PARA> The above figures are part of the story-in many cases it is futile to even raise assessments. </PARA>
<PARA>When we have matters of that kind some really very interesting questions arise. This was in November 1979, almost 18 months after the Government, on Mr Howard's own acknowledgment, had had drawn to its attention the general nature of these schemes and had directed that some remedial action take place. It was one full year before the 1980 Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill was enacted. During this period when absolutely nothing was happening-nothing had happened for 18 months and nothing was going to happen for another 12 months-the Commissioner of Taxation was battering on the Treasurer's door with this cry of pain about the massive losses that were flowing out as a result of the continuation of these schemes. It may be that other documents will reveal that the Commissioner of Taxation himself was less alert than he might have been about following up the avenues available to him under the existing law rather than simply waiting dolefully and soulfully for the Government to do something about new legislation . But certainly it is apparent from evidence of this kind, which does appear in this mass of tabled papers, that the Government, the Treasurer, knew and well knew the massive scale of the losses to revenue that were occurring throughout this period. </PARA>
<PARA> There is very little more that I can say at the moment about the substance of these documents, except to repeat my concern that we have not been given what we wanted and we have been given a lot of stuff that we did not ask for. The motivations for that are too obvious to need further explication. The sanitisation of the documents in order to avoid matters of apparent embarrassment to the Government has proceeded with what appears to be a very great deal of efficiency. Indeed it looks to me like this whole document represents probably the greatest sterilisation job since Nappy Wash. But what precisely there is and what there is not in these particular documents, is something that is going to take us a lot longer than the few minutes that I have had to be able to assess. What I am absolutely clear about-I became clear about it much more quickly than I expected to be when I ran through the list of the Table of Contents and compared that with the matters in the motion that has been proposed-is that the Government simply has not come to grips in any fair or reasonable way with the request for those itemised documents in that particular motion, and under those circumstances there is no question but that the Labor Party-of course the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine will have to consider their positions and speak for themselves-will be seeking the tabling of more documents, namely, the ones we have asked for in the first place. While we will be happy to try to fix upon some objective procedure for filtering those documents to ensure that the prosecution or the legal process is not prejudiced by their publication, we certainly will not rest content until we see a lot more of the material we have asked for than we see in this massive document here at the moment. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Government and the Senate for granting me leave. Senator Evans complained about having only 25 minutes in which to contemplate, absorb and understand some 500 pages of very complex material. He can consider himself lucky, because he had 25 minutes more than did the Australian Democrats, and no doubt Senator Harradine also, to carry out the same exercise. In fact, the set of documents was given to Senator Haines, the Democrats' spokesman on Attorney-General matters in the chamber, only nine minutes ago. I am genuine when I say that I cannot understand the Government's attitude on these matters. Is it arrogance? Is it simply bad manners? Is it a question of showing the Senate contempt? Why, at this stage, the Government would almost purposely and purposefully offend honourable senators on this side of the chamber is beyond my comprehension. I do not blame any officer, whether of the Parliament or the Attorney-General's Department-indeed whoever may be responsible for the situation we now face-because the Government, when it introduces these papers has control of these matters. I repeat, the Democrats received their copy only eight or nine minutes ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We join Senator Evans in expressing grave disquiet at the way in which this request, originally made by him and by his party, has been treated with absolute contempt by the Government. Let me retrace the steps that were taken. Senator Evans moved for the production of some 22 documents and in so doing was supported by the Democrats. The reason for the request, and for our support of it, was that we wanted to find out whether the Government knew of bottom-of-the- harbour schemes before the McCabe-Lafranchi and Costigan reports were submitted. If so, how long before? If it did know before, what sort of expert advice had been tendered to it indicating that prosecutions could be launched successfully? This goes to the nub of the whole question, quite apart from whatever political mileage might be gained or lost by one political party or another. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely, as my friend and colleague Senator Siddons said half an hour ago, Government accountability must be a prime requisite of this Parliament. The Parliament must hold government-which means ministers-responsible and accountable for its action or lack of action. If this chamber learns that five years ago the Attorney-General's Department, the Australian Taxation Office and the Treasury knew that the law was being broken, that advice had been given ministers or senior public servants that successful prosecutions could be launched, and that no action was taken, I suggest that it would be one of the gravest possible circumstances facing a parliament in the Westminster system. What we wanted to find out was as simple as that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was the purpose of the request for the documents. As soon as Senator Evans made his request, indicating at that stage that he thought we wanted the documents 'pronto'-which meant within a couple of days-Senator Durack saw me in the lobby. It was a day or two before he became ill. He said: 'I hope you people are going to be reasonable about this'-I believe he meant the Democrats-'because some of these documents contain counsels' opinions. If we are forced to table them prematurely it may be giving those who have possibly broken the law, and against whom a prosecution may well be launched, the advantage of having exposed the weaknesses in the Crown's case.' I saw the reasonableness and common sense of that request and said in a flash: 'As far as the Democrats are concerned, you will not have any irresponsible pressure from us to produce those documents until you have had a good chance to see whether their tabling would prejudice the Crown's case'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put that proposition to Senator Evans and, to his credit, he agreed instantly , as did the Labor Party generally, that it would be proper to wait a reasonable time. I believe, from memory, that we gave the Government a week's grace in which to table the documents. Senator Durack then had his unfortunate illness. Senator Chaney approached us then and said: 'Because of the illness of Senator Durack will you give us more time?' Both the Democrats and the Australian Labor Party agreed instantly and said: 'Of course you can have more time to consider this proposition'. In view of this, I would have thought that the Labor Party, the Democrats and, if I might say so, Senator Harradine have shown total reasonableness in the Government's predicament, caused by Senator Durack's illness and the basic question involved in immediate presentation of the documents. But what happened? At 5.37 this evening, while the debate was in progress, we were handed this massive document which, for the benefit of listeners, is at least two and a half inches thick, and given the problem of commenting on it intelligently. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), speaking on behalf of the Government, made the bland statement that, on the advice of the Solicitor -General, 14 of the 22 documents sought had not been included. The documents not provided are the very documents that establish whether or not the people involved in bottom-of-the-harbour schemes committed an offence and thus were liable for tax at the time. Those are the very documents that have not been tabled. Also not tabled are documents which may have shown the negligence or inaction of senior public servants--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, and, perhaps more importantly, the Brinsden opinions, have not been supplied. I am sure that Senator Evans would agree that they are crucial to any determination or consideration by the Senate of the basic question that we want answered, namely, did the Government know of these offences? If so, for how long and why has no action been taken to recover the hundreds of millions of dollars in tax that have been avoided? Also not included are the memorandam from Perth, the police report from Perth, the opinion of the Sydney Q.C., and the Crown Solicitor's advice, to name only a few documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I may add to the story: When Senator Evans and Senator Harradine agreed with the Democrats that it would be reasonable to give the Government time to contemplate which documents would be tabled or, to use the Government's own rather frightening expression, as seen at page 9, 'sanitised', a word which is now appearing in Government literature-for example, 'sanitised documents'-we made certain suggestions in this chamber and privately to the Attorney-General. I refer to a private rather than a confidential conversation: We said: 'Why not have a discussion between the Attorney-General, Senator Evans, myself and Senator Harradine so that the four of us can determine whether or not the tabling of a document in its naked form would prejudice a successful prosecution against any individual or group of individuals?' A self-restraining mechanism would have been at work had the Government adopted that course. For example, suppose Senator Evans, a trained lawyer, had said: 'No, I do not agree to that opinion being excised'. If the persons involved in that opinion had gone to trial, been prosecuted and had been acquitted because the document had become a public document, Senator Evans would have had to wear that responsibility. He knew that, I knew that and Senator Harradine knew that but we were prepared to wear it. There was a self-imposed caution on our actions. It was a responsible act. </PARA>
<PARA> In the statement read by the Minister for Finance today those offers made by this side of the chamber have been brushed aside with absolute contempt. The Senate has been told: 'This is what you get-eight out of 22. Anything worth while-the counsels' opinions or whatever-is not there, and that is the Crown Solicitor's opinion'. I cannot understand this. The Government and the Liberal and National Country Parties are embroiled in so many scandals at the moment and are in so much diabolical trouble with the bottom-of-the-harbour schemes, the Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd scandal, the meat substitutions scandal and the Medibank frauds which have not even surfaced yet that one would think the Government would have dropped its arrogance, that it would have at least said--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Gietzelt" NAMEID="RG4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may still have to pay a penalty for not being frank. The Democrats will not allow the matter to rest here without at least some explanation. We will not be satisfied with the explanation that in the view of the Solicitor-General the opinions mentioned on page 2 of the statement should not be tabled. I make it absolutely clear that I do not reflect in any way on the opinion given to the Government by the Solicitor-General, but is it fair to ask a senior civil servant in the position of Solicitor-General whether or not the Government ought to produce particular papers. It is not equivalent to Caesar appealing to Caesar but surely such a senior civil servant is put in an impossible situation when a government says to him: 'Do you think we ought to table these documents?' and then, replying on his advice, says: 'No, we are not going to table the documents because the Solicitor-General said we should not'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very disappointed in the Government's behaviour on this. Maybe there is an explanation but the Democrats-who have tried to act as honest brokers in this matter, who tried to assist the Government before Senator Durack became ill and have done so since his illness to avoid unnecessary embarrassment-believe, and I think that the Labor Party, which has been reasonable in its response to the Government's requests, would also believe, that we should not have been treated in such a shabby manner. The Democrats will agree to this matter being postponed to a later hour this day but in reality, because of the goodies coming up tonight, I believe we will not return to this matter today. That would be a good thing because I for one and, I know, Senator Haines, our spokesman on these matters, would like to give more attention to these 500 or more pages that have been dumped on us than we have been able to give them with the few minutes notice we have been given today. We would prefer this debate to be revived at least tomorrow. If it is not, I promise the Government that there will be no way in which the debate can be brought on in the manner in which it has been brought on tonight and then buried at the bottom of the Notice Paper. The Democrats will not rest until a full scale debate has taken place in the Senate and the reasons why those documents have not been produced have been explained by the Government .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-My remarks must be taken having regard to the fact that I have been unable to study in detail the massive documentation now before the Senate. Suffice it to say that the documentation is incomplete, as suggested by the motion before the Senate. Of course that matter will need to be determined by the Senate either later tonight or, more likely, tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me place into perspective the current situation. Almost a month ago a motion was moved in this chamber to condemn the Government. It called for the heads of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard). At that time I voted against that motion, and the motion failed. On the evidence placed before us, including the evidence of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, I was not prepared to vote for the motion. It was my opinion-my opinion was not the same as that of members of the Opposition or members of the Australian Democrats-that the information available was not sufficiently strong as to call for such a drastic measure to be adopted by the Senate. I was fully conscious of the fact that had the Senate adopted that motion it would have made the position of the Attorney- General untenable. Obviously, had a motion of no confidence calling for the resignation of Senator Durack been adopted by this chamber he would have found it most difficult to continue his functions as Attorney-General in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA> When, one week later, the motion for the tabling of the documents arose, I was prepared to go along with it provided that the documentation sought was edited in such a way that the documents, however they were tabled, would not prejudice proceedings and prosecutions against major tax cheats. That was the common view around the chamber. As I understood the Attorney-General himself, he was prepared to accede to the tabling of documents which indicated the information that was available to public servants at the relevant times and, as well, the thrust of advice to government in respect of the issues at stake-provided, of course, that the question of prejudice to proceedings and prosecutions was resolved in some adequate way. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time, I suggested to the Senate that one way of achieving that result would have been to refer the documents to Mr Costigan who, after consultation with the Crown Solicitor, could then advise on that issue. After all, as I understand it, many of the documents sought to be tabled, if not most of them, were identified in the Royal Commissioner's report. Who better, then, to consider this question of prejudice than the Royal Commissioner, in conjunction and after consultation with the Crown Solicitor? However, the Government has chosen to do its own thing on this matter. I am not very happy about that. </PARA>
<PARA> I concede that there is an argument being raised that the promoters of the resolution for the tabling of documents are seeking what may be termed retrospective proof for actions taken calling for the resignations of the Ministers. I do not see it in that way. I am sure that the public would like to know what information was available about these schemes and the thrust of advice to Ministers. As Senator Siddons has said, it raises the question of accountability, and in order for us to determine what a Minister should reasonably have done, we should have the thrust of the advice that was given to the Government and the information that was given to public servants. </PARA>
<PARA> My brief examination of the documentation before us now leads me to conclude that this is not sufficient for that consideration to be fully achieved. Therefore, I am supporting the delay of consideration of the proposition until a later hour of this day, and I expect that this will not take place until tomorrow, by which time one may have had the opportunity of ploughing through much of this documentation. Indeed, there may well be some information, particularly as the documents refer to tax information, at the Taxation Office and Treasury level, which will give us leads in that area. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I present the Commonwealth Electoral (Amendment) Bill 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the process of electoral reform in Australia has been a long and tortuous one; almost a microcosm of the whole process of constitutional change which it has parallelled. </PARA>
<PARA> As Professor R. S. Parker put it in his Meredith Memorial Lecture in 1979:</PARA>
<PARA> 'On the first day of this century the governments of the six Australian colonies, after a decade of dickering and bickering, rather reluctantly united for a very limited range of purposes: to form a customs union, to secure an integrated defence system and to speak with a single voice in the comity of nations . . . </PARA>
<PARA> 'But they wanted to conserve as far as possible the interests of their own regions and of the administrative apparatus they had built up in each colony. So they opted for a federal union, drove a hard bargain about the financial and other terms on which they united, and carefully entrenched them in the written constitution. They did not put in any frills and flourishes about inalienable human rights, codes of conduct for the rulers, or states of national emergency. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a modest document of thirty pages-little more than a contract framed to safeguard the federal compact.''</PARA>
<PARA> Of the 36 proposals for change generated since Federation, eight have been accepted. Of these, two related to electoral matters. The first ever, in 1906, provided for Senators' terms of office to begin in July instead of the January following their election. The second was one of three passed in 1977, which required casual vacancies in the Senate to be filled by a person from the same party as the vacating Senator, when circumstances allowed. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals for change have not been lacking. The Royal Commission on the Constitution appointed by the Bruce-Page Government in 1927 produced an enormous report in 1929 and made 28 specific recommendations for constitutional amendment . The only ones any government has even attempted to carry out in the half century since were a recommendation that Senators be elected by proportional representation (enacted by ordinary legislation in 1948) and a proposal for a retiring age for High Court Judges (inserted in the Constitution by referendum in 1977). </PARA>
<PARA> Early in 1958 the Parliament appointed a Joint Committee on Constitutional Review representing all parties in both Houses. Before the end of 1959 it produced an almost equally massive report. Four of its recommendations with modifications were put to referendums in the 1960s and 1970s. One proposed to break the nexus between the size of the House and that of the Senate so that the House could be expanded without increasing the size of the Senate. The second would have altered Senators' terms from the present six years to correspond with two actual terms of the House of Representatives so that elections for the two houses could always be held simultaneously. The third proposed to equalise federal electoral divisions as nearly as possible in all States. The Fourth would have made constitutional amendment itself easier. None of these proposals secured the necessary approvals at the referendums. </PARA>
<PARA> The third major review of the constitution, and particularly the laws regarding elections, was or is the Australian Constitutional Convention initiated by Victorian politicians at the beginning of the 1970s. Honourable Senators will be aware of the painful progress made by the Convention. The Australian Democrats certainly hope it will continue to make progress, although hopefully at a faster rate. </PARA>
<PARA> There have also been a number of legislative changes to the electoral law. The Representation Act of 1948 increased the size of the Senate and changed the method by which it was elected. The Senate (Representation of Territories) Act 1973 made provision for two Senators to be elected from both territories. Several amendments have also been made to the Electoral Act 1918 at various times and redistributions of electoral boundaries are also enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> Many Senators present today will recall the events of 1974 when the Labor administration of Mr Whitlam introduced a package of electoral reform bills. Some of the proposals in these Bills were not acceptable to the then Opposition and the Bills were blocked. </PARA>
<PARA> This bill takes the whole process, almost completely stymied since those turbulent days, two small steps forward. It provides for the political affiliation of candidates at Parliamentary elections to be printed on ballot papers and to provide for the rotation of names on ballot papers for House of Representatives elections. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of these hardly needs debate. Once upon a time some may have opposed it, perhaps hoping people would be confused, or that small parties would be disadvantaged because of the need to print how to vote cards. But I find it difficult to imagine that any enlightened senators could oppose this modest proposal in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> The second proposal in this Bill is designed to neutralise the effect of the donkey vote. Again I find it difficult to believe any sensible person could dispute either the existence or the effect of the donkey vote. </PARA>
<PARA> If one takes the votes of minor parties and compares their average support in cases where their candidates have the favoured position with those cases where their candidates do not have the favoured position the former averages are consistently higher than the latter. </PARA>
<PARA> Where Senate and House of Representatives elections are held together, comparison of the different levels of support in each election according to respective ballot paper position also suggests the donkey vote can be a major influence on the outcome of elections. </PARA>
<PARA> Comparisons of different distributions of preferences according to ballot paper positions can indicate the number of donkey votes cast. Malcolm Mackerras in a 1968 paper and in an earlier monograph suggested that one does not need to be on the top of the ballot paper to benefit from the donkey vote. The prime beneficiary is the major candidate more favourably placed than his major opponent. </PARA>
<PARA> The final proof is statistical: if the names of members are randomly distributed then one would expect the distribution to be similar to that in the general population; it is not. </PARA>
<PARA> Mackerras cites several examples, the most notorious of which was the 1937 general elections when the famous four As team of Amour, Armstrong, Arthur and Ashley was elected to this Senate. This cynicism led the succeeding Menzies UAP Government to introduce legislation to change the law and replace the alphabetical principle by the lot principle in determining the order of names on ballot papers for both houses. However when it was debated in May 1940 the House of Representatives decided to amend the Bill to retain alphabetical arrangements in its own election. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubt of the effect of the donkey vote. In 1964 C. J. Masterman demonstrated how the House of Representatives had become filled up with an unusually high proportion of members with names high in the alphabet. </PARA>
<PARA> Today's House of Representatives, which has 125 members is little different from earlier chambers. Based on the Melbourne telephone book 50.2 per cent of the population have names beginning with the letters from A to K, yet in the House of Representatives 62.4 per cent of members have letters in the same range . Conversely while in the general population 49.8 per cent of people have names beginning with letters from L to Z in the House only 37.6 per cent of members have names beginning with those letters. </PARA>
<PARA> I am assured that statistically it is most improbable that this would occur if there was no bias in the selection of candidates or in the success of candidates towards those who have names which begin with letters high in the alphabet. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to authorise a contribution by Australia of $A212. 33 million towards the third replenishment of the Asian Development Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will know that since the Asian Development Bank was established in 1966 Australia has been and remains a strong and active supporter of the Bank. We continue to regard it as an efficient and effective organisation for providing aid to developing countries in our own geographic region. The main role of the Bank is to assist the economic development of its developing member countries and to foster economic and social growth and co-operation in the Asian and Pacific regions. It does this by lending funds, promoting investment and providing technical assistance on a scale that bilateral donors could not achieve alone. The Bank has continued to approach its complex development task with flexibility and vigour, especially over recent years during which it has been confronted by the growing resource constraints imposed by the global economic recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Since its establishment the Bank has lent about $US10 billion for projects covering all the major sectors of economic development with emphasis on the development of transport, communications, industry and electric power as well as projects for agriculture, education, water supply and urban development. In recent years an increasing proportion of the Bank's lending activities has been devoted to agricultural development and to social development (for example in health, population and water supply projects). </PARA>
<PARA> The Bank's lending activities are divided into ordinary and special operations. Ordinary operations are financed on the basis of the Bank's capital resources and its borrowings on the international capital market at commercial or near commercial terms. Special operations involve loans made on highly concessional terms to the Bank's poorest and least developed member countries and are funded from the Asian Development Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia played a leading role in the establishment and subsequent growth of the Asian Development Fund which was set up in 1974 and first replenished in 1976. The Fund operates in the Asian and Pacific regions in a similar fashion to the World Bank's soft lending affiliate, the International Development Association. Australia contributed $A97 million or 5.14 per cent to the last replenishment target of $US2.15 billion, to cover concessional lending for the period 1979 to 1982. By the end of this year the Bank will have fully committed the resources from the (second) replenishment. </PARA>
<PARA> In July 1981 donor countries commenced negotiations for a third replenishment of the Fund, to provide resources for the period 1983 to 1986. Bank management originally suggested a replenishment target of $US4.1 billion in order to maintain growth in the Fund's annual rate of lending at around 17.5 per cent. Australia supported this target and announced its willingness to maintain its share in the Fund at around 5.14 per cent. However when it became clear that the United States intended to reduce significantly its level of contribution, the target was revised to $US3.2 billion. Agreement and donor commitment were achieved earlier this year on this level which will enable the Fund to maintain the level of its concessional lending over the next four years in real terms. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to help meet the agree target and to maintain a position appropriate to our standing in the Bank Australia decided to increase its share in the Fund to approximately 7.2 per cent. This represents about the same funding level as the previous 5.14 per cent share of the original target of $US4.1 billion and is commensurate with our share in the Bank's capital stock. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's decision to increase substantially its share in the Fund proved to be critical at the final donor's meeting in April this year at which the target of $US3.2 billion was reached. The exact level of our contribution to the third replenishment of the Asian Development Fund has been set at $A212.33 million. This amount will not be subject to future adjustments in exchange rates. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with past practice with respect to similar contributions to the Asian Development Fund and the International Development Association, Australia will make its contribution by lodging non-negotiable, non-interest bearing promissory notes cashable on demand as and when funds are actually required for making loan payments. This will limit the impact on the Budget in the next year or so, as cashing of these notes is not expected to begin before 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> The Asian Development Bank and its Asian Development Fund have a most important role to play in continuing to foster economic and social development in the region of immediate interest to Australia. Our contribution to the third replenishment of the Fund will confirm our willingness to continue helping the poorest developing countries in our region with highly concessional assistance. While Australia is fully prepared to play its role as one of the few developed country regional members of the Bank, it is a matter of concern that some non- regional donors have significantly reduced their level of support. Australia appreciates that global economic difficulties have required domestic economic restraint by donor governments, but it should not be forgotten that it is the developing countries that have been hardest hit by the economic problems or our times. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends the Liquefied Petroleum Gas (Grants) Act 1980 to extend the present arrangement under which a subsidy of $80 a tonne is paid on LPG use by certain consumers for a further twelve months until 28 March 1984. Provisions have also been included in the Bill to impose limitations on the amounts of subsidised gas available to industrial consumers after the first of October this year. </PARA>
<PARA> The LPG subsidy was introduced for three years in March 1980 with the objective of providing sufficient time for household users to adjust to rapidly rising LPG prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The extension of the subsidy is largely to help the many thousands of householders, small businessmen and other consumers who depend on LPG, to cope through a period of uncertainty in world LPG prices, expected to occur in the next year or two. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand the Government does not intend that the subsidy encourage new scale industrial use of LPG. This policy was clearly stated in 1980 when the subsidy was made available to industrial and commercial users in areas where natural gas was not readily available. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last two years the competitiveness of LPG as an industrial fuel has created a situation where large industrial consumers with heavy reliance on fuel oil could be encouraged to convert to LPG. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not wish to encourage such conversion for a number of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> First, the resulting large increase in subsidy payments could not be justified.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, LPG is a valuable transport fuel and petrochemical feedstock, unconstrained large scale industrial use of the fuel could establish a demand imbalance leading eventually to a reduction in the amount available for traditional and premium applications such as small commercial and household consumers who, by reason of their location, do not have access to suitable alternative forms of energy. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, it would be in conflict with the Government's basic policy aim of minimising Australia's dependence on imported liquid fuels. </PARA>
<PARA> The considerations that I have just mentioned led the Government to announce on 25 September 1981 its intention to impose limitations on the amount of subsidized gas to which industrial and commercial enterprise would be entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time the Government also announced that a review of the subsidy scheme would be made prior to the expiry of the scheme in March 1983. Following that review, which culminated in the decision to extend the subsidy for a further 12 months, the administrative arrangements relating to the imposition of the limitations were finalised. </PARA>
<PARA> The limits to be imposed on the usage of subsidized gas as proposed by this Bill, will apply from 1 October 1982. From that date most industrial enterprises will be restricted to the equivalent of 1,000 tonnes per annum of subsidized gas . </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does recognise however, that on 25 September 1981 some users were already using or were committed to use LPG in excess of the equivalent of 1 ,000 tonnes per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will not deprive such users of the benefit of the subsidy. For this reason the Bill provides a mechanism to permit the Minister to increase the limit if he is satisfied that certain contracts relating to the purchase of gas or equipment, or conversion of existing plant and equipment to gas, prior to 25 September 1981, would require the equivalent of an annual usage in excess of 1, 000 tonnes per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for notifications to be given by industrial and commercial users to the distributors from whom they purchase the gas, and to the Minister, when they have exceeded their limit or they are about to reach their limit. </PARA>
<PARA> Penalties have been introduced into the legislation ranging from $2,000 to $50, 000 for offences associated with failing to produce documents or failing to notify or knowingly obtaining or attempting to obtain the benefit of a subsidy payment to which the user is not entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will continue to monitor the impact of this subsidy on its energy policy and will conduct a further review prior to the new expiry date of 27 March 1984. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to address the Senate briefly on a matter of great concern to me, and I trust to the Senate as a whole and to the people of Australia. It concerns the massacre that occurred in Beirut. I take this opportunity because I wish to speak not only in general terms but also on a particular matter. The whole world has been horrified by the events in Lebanon. Words cannot express the horror that one feels at what has occurred. It is generally accepted that it is a crime not only against the Palestinian people but also against the Jewish people. Those who are responsible must accept the blame. I trust that in due course the Senate will debate a motion on this matter. The Senate ought not to be in any way limited in its condemnation of what has occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn from the general concern that I feel to a particular concern. I request the Senate to consider the case of and to ask the whereabouts of Dr Jean Calder, an Australian doctor, originally a resident of Brisbane, who worked for a number of years in Beirut. When I visited Lebanon earlier this year she was in charge of the rehabilitation of crippled Lebanese and Palestinian children. She was sacrificing the whole of her life and had dedicated her skills to the care of a small number of children-I think half a dozen-in a place far away from her home. Her action was striking and it appealed very much to one's conscience to see her at work. At the time of my visit it was difficult enough for her, but subsequent events in Lebanon have placed her in great danger and her whereabouts are now unknown. </PARA>
<PARA> A letter received at the end of August-the last communication-indicated that she was working within the area where the massacre took place. Reports which are now coming forward seem to indicate that those who worked in the hospital may have been massacred. Therefore, today I rang the secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) and sought assistance to locate Dr Jean Calder. I have no doubt that that assistance will be forthcoming. Her sacrifice and predicament underline the terror of the situation which exists in the Lebanon and which can no longer be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA> The various actions that have taken place and the various decisions that have been made by world leaders towards the restoration of peace in the Lebanon are to be supported. However I do not think that we can escape responsibility for Dr Calder's position. In the past we may have been idle and may not have applied ourselves to helping to gain a peaceful solution in the Middle East and an acceptance of the rights of the Palestinian people. What has occurred has occurred; nevertheless I think we should take some action. We should make a decision in the Senate to express our concern. I do not doubt that if Ministers consider the matter they will give us an opportunity to talk of our concern. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) has called for a statement on the issue from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and I think that such a statement may be forthcoming. I hope that the statement that is put down in the other place will be put down in the Senate at the same time, and that we will be able to debate the matter and at least send a message of concern. The tragedy is immense for the people of the Middle East, but the consequences to the whole world are also immense. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> These Bills will give effect to the Budget proposal to increase the various rates of sales tax by 2.5 percentage points. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills will increase the respective rates from 5 per cent to 7.5 per cent, from 17.5 per cent to 20 per cent and from 30 per cent to 32.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills do not alter any of the exemptions from sales tax that are conferred by the first schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications ) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Some deletions of existing exemptions are, however, proposed by another Bill that I will shortly introduce. </PARA>
<PARA> The second schedule to the Exemptions and Classifications Act identifies the goods that are to be taxed at the top rate, now to be 32.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Goods embraced by the second schedule include radio and television receivers, record players, cameras, household-type video recorders, films and photographs, non-commercial slide projectors and viewing equipment, watches, jewellery, cosmetics, fountain pens, certain goods made of precious metals and furs. </PARA>
<PARA> Goods in the third Schedule to the Exemptions and Classifications Act have attracted a rate of 5 per cent, which is now to be increased to 7.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> This covers household furniture, appliances such as refrigerators, washing machines and a range of household goods. </PARA>
<PARA> Motor cars and commercial vehicles are in the Fourth and Fifth Schedules to the Exemptions and Classifications Act and they, together with goods not coming within any Schedule to the Act, are at present taxed at 17.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that they be taxed in future at 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Other goods also now to be taxed at 20 per cent include boats, confectionery, stationery, computers, soft drinks, potable spirits and imported wines and beers . </PARA>
<PARA> It is customary for changes in the rates of sales tax to take effect on the day following the introduction of amending Bills and these Bills, when enacted, will accordingly operate on and after 18 August 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The sales tax is basically a tax on sales at the wholesale level and, in the ordinary case of sales by a wholesaler to a retailer, the increased rates of tax will accordingly apply to sales made after Budget day. </PARA>
<PARA> As usual, an explanatory memorandum covering technical aspects of the Bills and providing, on this occasion, a detailed listing of the goods affected by these measures is being made available to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1 to 9) 1982 and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1982 increase by 2 1/2 per cent the rate of sales tax on goods already subject to sales tax and extend the range of goods to which sales tax applies. It is estimated that $595m will be raised in a full year and $414m this financial year . In common with the sales tax increases which were introduced in the Budget in 1981, these sales taxes are imposed to offset partially the revenue lost to tax cheats, at least some of whom are powerful members of the Liberal Party of Australia. They have been allowed to defraud the revenue year after year under the permissive, if not benign, eye of the Liberal and National Country Party Government. A prime example of the sorts of tax cheats to whom I refer is Denis Horgan, former chairman-in saying 'former', I mean until the end of June this year-of the finance committee of the Liberal Party of Western Australia. Documents tabled and/or incorporated by me and by Mr Hayden in the last few weeks, and facts revealed in the McCabe-Lafranchi report, have so far shown that Mr Horgan--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect, Mr President, my remarks are relevant. For at least two years the Government has said that income tax rates must be reduced and that sales taxes or indirect taxes must be increased because, amongst other things, the allegedly excessive levels of income tax have been a factor which has helped to induce widespread tax evasion. The fact that revenue has been lost because of evasion and avoidance is a relevant factor-it may even be argued a direct cause- of the Government's determination to increase indirect taxes, one manifestation of which is before us tonight in these Bills to increase sales tax. So respectfully, Mr President, I submit that these factors are relevant to the Bills being discussed. If several billion dollars of income tax revenue had not leaked out of the system in recent years the compulsion to increase indirect taxes would have been less strong. The five companies so far disclosed, of which Mr Horgan was a director, are Treamog Ltd, which was registered in Melbourne, Henderson Investments Pty Ltd, Norwood Investments Pty Ltd and H.B.D. Holdings Pty Ltd which were registered in Perth and Latem Pty Ltd, formerly Du Feu Metal Industries registered in Sydney. In all of those cases and those companies, of which Mr Horgan was a director, they were disposed of to Maher and Donnelly. In every case R. W. Woss of Perth, who was also a member of the finance committee of the Western Australian Liberal Party concurrent with Mr Horgan, became a director sooner or later of those five companies. He was indeed the agent of Maher in Perth.</PARA></TALK.START>

Woss ultimately became a director of both of those companies. They were both registered in Perth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I raise a point of order. I thought that the last time you called Senator Walsh to order he said that the sales tax Bills are revenue raising Bills. It has always been my understanding that income tax is also a revenue raising matter and enables the Government to carry out its promises to the people. I understood Senator Walsh to say that both matters related to a taxation measure. Whether it is sales tax or income tax, it is a revenue raising matter which is levied on the taxpayers of this country. He went on to say that because Denis Horgan is evading income tax the Government has had to bring in these sales tax measures.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect, Mr President, the two cannot be divorced. The reason sales tax is being increased, the reason that 0.75 per cent is being added to the consumer price index this year as a result of these sales tax Bills , is that income tax which ought to have been collected has not been collected. The Government has a revenue problem. In spite of increases in sales tax, it admits to a Budget deficit of $1.7 billion and there are, to use the euphemistic expression, some rubbery estimates contained within the Budget papers. Syntec, in its publication of 6 February, suggested that the actual deficit this year would be in the vicinity of $3 billion to $4 billion and it is doubtful whether Syntec, in arriving at that conclusion, had taken account of the $356m which the Government currently seeks to have appropriated for drought relief. It is not seriously doubted in informed circles at the moment that the Budget deficit will be somewhere close to $3 billion and may even rise above that. If the income tax which ought to have been collected in the past had been collected there would not have been the compulsion on the Government to raise revenue in other ways, a compulsion which is the direct cause of these Bills to increase sales tax, to add to inflation, to levy a tax in what most people would regard as, and what can objectively be sustained as being, an inequitable way. That, I submit, is the direct consequence of the Government's failure over many, many years to collect income tax that ought to have been collected. In that context, I believe it is relevant to provide specific information about the individuals who have participated in that tax avoidance and evasion. I believe it becomes particularly relevant when the individual concerned held, until two months ago, an important office in the Liberal Party and continues to hold seven Government offices--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the question of sales taxes, directly and narrowly, Mr President, as a result of these Bills sales tax collections this year are estimated to rise by just over 20 per cent. This is a contributing factor to the estimate that total tax collections will increase from 27.5 per cent to 27.7 per cent of gross domestic product. We have it on Senator Carrick's own authority that the correct way to measure the real incidence of taxation is to express it as a percentage of GDP. This year, as a result of these Bills, total taxation as a percentage of GDP will increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) would have the public believe that he has offered tax cuts in this Budget. But taxation as a percentage of GDP-a definition which Senator Carrick says is infallible-is to go up. Taxes are an integral part of the Budget-a Budget which is not an economic document but a purely political document framed against a time horizon of, at the most, four months. It is an economically irresponsible and politically opportunistic Budget . The Prime Minister planned to have an election last Saturday. That was scuttled by a couple of things. Principally, of course, it was scuttled by the report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union-the Costigan report. The Prime Minister still lives in hope of having an election in November. He is a desperate man caught in a web of political intrigue which he himself has spun. He is faced with two choices-an election this year amid recession, widespread public disgust and scandal or an election next year amid deeper recession, the revelation of shonky Budget figures and continuing scandal. It is an unpleasant choice but not, I suggest, an ill-deserved one. </PARA>
<PARA> I say that the Budget figures are rubbery, to use a former Treasurer's euphemism, because it can be calculated from the Government's own estimates of growth and the known demographic trends that proposed unemployment benefit expenditures are underestimated by $200m to $300m. There is a facile assumption incorporated within the Estimates that $870m will be collected this year from taxes which ought to have been paid and which have not been paid-taxes which ought to have been paid by people like Denis Horgan. We have now tabled documents which demonstrate that he was involved in selling companies in three different States to tax promoters and to two different tax promoters at that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very well, Mr President. The two figures I have already given cast doubts on the accuracy of the Budget Estimates at least to the extent of $1 billion. In addition to that, straight off the top of the Prime Ministerial head three or four weeks ago we had the drought relief scheme. That appeared a fortnight after the Budget was presented straight off the top of the Prime Ministerial head, which is the origin of most of the very worst schemes that have been inflicted on this country in the last few years. The estimated cost of that is $356m, and that figure is rubbery too if it does not rain. So we have now got a total in excess of $1,300m by which the Budget deficit has been underestimated, and that is a conservative figure. This takes us up to a total deficit of $3 billion. No wonder the Prime Minister is desperate to have an election this year. Any Prime Minister who has spent seven years lecturing and hectoring the country along the lines that large and/or increased Budget deficits are the epitome of fiscal irresponsibility and the source of almost all economic woe would scarcely want to face the electorate next year with not only a Budget deficit which is large, something which he has said on countless occasions would be economically disastrous, but also a deficit estimate which by then will have been shown to be dishonest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has grave reservations about these Bills. For that reason I move :</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate expresses its concern at the Government 's actions in again increasing sales tax, which increases will have adverse consequences in regard to inflation, the equity of the tax system, and living standards'. </PARA>
<PARA>Equity in the tax system is certainly something that we need. A prerequisite, I suggest, to achieving any equity is the removal from office of this Government. In spite of our reservations, however, we will not be opposing this Bill. This Budget is the Prime Minister's Budget and the Prime Minister will have to live with the consequences of it. </PARA>

We are absolutely and irrevocably opposed to sales tax on building materials, clothes, footwear, paper, books, wrapping material for medical supplies, and food. These products are necessities of life. We stood firmly on this issue. I believe this legislation vindicates the stand taken by the Democrats in that it is not now proposed to tax those items.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1 to 9) 1982. These Bills seek to increase sales tax at the lowest rate from a current 5 per cent to 7 1/2 per cent; at the middle rate from 17 1/2 per cent to 20 per cent; and at the top rate from 30 per cent to 32 1/2 per cent . At the lowest rate it represents a 5 per cent increase over the last two Budgets. When we were discussing the sales tax Bills last year there was a great uproar about them. Tonight we hear that the Opposition has made a cosy arrangement with the Government so that the Government can get the Bills passed through the Senate tonight. Only one speaker from the Opposition has spoken against this particular measure tonight. Of course, we have heard Senator Siddons. Only one speaker is put forward by the Government to defend the increase of 2 1/2 per cent in sales tax contained in these particular Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is a far cry from what occurred last year but the principle is the same. The principle is to shift the balance from direct taxes to indirect taxes.

For example, the extensions this year will include household drapery, soft furnishings, sheets and towels. Whilst some honourable senators might be able to do away with sheets and those honourable senators who do not wash can do away with towels, I cannot do without them. Honourable senators may be able to get away without curtains in their homes but I live on a fairly busy road and I cannot do without them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Messner. It has been suggested that this measure implements some of the recommendations made in the Asprey report-recommendations which have been adopted by the Government. The suggestion has been made that it is necessary to shift the burden from direct taxes to indirect taxes for two major reasons: Firstly, it will spread the burden and, secondly, an indirect broadly based commodity tax will lessen the chances of tax cheating. As to the latter suggestion, one has only to visit some of the industries that are involved in certifications and the requirements for sales tax to see the vast problems involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One needs only to refer to the article in the Australian Financial Review this morning which indicates that there are vast problems of tax evasion in this area . Indeed, official figures available indicate that there is a substantial increase in the number of cases concerning evasion which have been detected in this area. I had the figures a moment ago but I seem to have mislaid them. Nevertheless, when this measure was adopted last year the Senate was in uproar about it. The Bills concerned were returned to the House of Representatives with requests. I, for one, travelled throughout the length and breadth of Australia campaigning against the extension of the sales tax, particularly to those provisions covering the so-called necessities of life. We do not have presented to us for our consideration tonight just how a broadly based commodity tax will operate. Will it operate with progressivity or regressivity? If the latter, how will the Government compensate those people upon whom the tax burden falls most heavily? I suggest to the Minister that if the Government is attempting by stealth to implement a policy which would change the balance of taxation from direct taxes to indirect taxes, let us have all the information before us. Let us have from the Treasurer and from the Minister for Finance a free and open statement detailing the advantages and disadvantages, and where there are disadvantages, detailing how these can be overcome and compensated. </PARA>
<PARA> In the absence of a stronger amendment, I propose to support the Opposition's amendment. I would have preferred to have seen a real battle take place on this measure in order at least to hold the legislation up so that we get from the Government some explanation of the reason for the 2 1/2 per cent increase, not on one commodity but on all of them, ranging from 5 per cent to 7 1/2 per cent in the lowest category to 20 per cent in the middle category and to a high 32 1/ 2 per cent in the top category. I should have liked to have seen the Senate hold these measures up until we got from the Government an explanation in support of them and also an explanation of how the Government proposes to compensate those upon whom the burden will fall most heavily. However, it looks as though even if I were to move a motion for the adjournment of the debate on these Bills I would not receive support. I should have thought that the opportunity is quite clearly here now to put the Government on toast on these issues, but there is no will left in the Opposition to do this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh is at it again. He really cannot help himself. He brings up the situation of when I voted for the increase in the income equalisation deposits percentages. Senator Walsh suggested I did that because I was a friend of the tax dodgers. Does Senator Walsh know why I did that? If he does not, he ought to know. I did it because I was following the advice publicly given by John Kerin, the Australian Labor Party spokesman on primary industry. What Senator Walsh is saying-let nobody have any doubt about this-is that John Kerin is a friend of the tax dodgers. Frankly, he ought to be expelled from the ALP if he is going to continue to take this attitude to his and the Labor Party' s spokesman on primary industry. I think it is a travesty of justice to see the Labor Party Whip, Senator Tate, and Senator McLaren sitting back there, letting him get away with accusing Mr Kerin, the Labor spokesman on primary industry, of being a tax dodger.</PARA></TALK.START>

I understand that they are to have passage without delay. I will not delay them except to make a comment on a matter which needs clarification.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some concern has been expressed that master originals of motion picture films may be taxed at their full cost of production. When films were previously taxable, master originals were taxed on the basis of a value per foot of film. The values were quite low, being 16c per foot for 16mm entertainment films and 7c per foot for 35mm entertainment films. The result was that the tax payable on master original films reflected the cost of making the actual film but not the cost of producing it. The previous policy will be followed on 1 January 1983 when films become taxable. Where master originals are subject to tax, they will be taxed at a sale value based on the length of the film. Of course, the previous values will need to be reviewed by the Commissioner of Taxation. They will produce an effect similar to that which existed before 1967 in respect of master originals; that is, the tax payable will be charged on a much lower value than the actual cost of production. I make that explanation because representations concerning the matter were made during the passage of the Bills. I now commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Robertson-I am not aware of what has gone on. I was outside the chamber . Let us be quite honest; at 9 o'clock we were to tackle the Woodward report. That was the agreement with the Government. I understand that the arrangement we had, which was made this morning, was that we would not go ahead with first reading debates on the understanding that the Government wanted to pass some of its legislation. The understanding was that at 9 o'clock, or as close as possible to then-now is a reasonable time-we would move on to the Woodward report.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Kilgariff-The situation is that the program for today was discussed earlier in the day and the Government requested that certain Government legislation be passed. After that legislation had been passed we were to go on with the Royal Commission report on the meat industry. I would say there has been no support for that arrangement. No Government legislation, other than the sales tax Bills, has been passed. They have been the only two pieces of legislation passed. I suggest that further Government legislation should be passed to honour the agreement made. Then the Government will bring on the debate on the ministerial statement concerning the Woodward report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding of the agreement was that at approximately 9 o 'clock we would be going on to debate the report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Australian Meat Industry. Certainly nothing was said while I was at the Whips' meeting about the passing of a certain amount of Government legislation being necessary or otherwise. I make an appeal to the Government. The sales tax Bills have been passed. The fact that the debate took the length of time it did was a matter for the Senate. That does not invalidate the discussions we had this morning in which it was decided that we would at 9 o' clock discuss the report of the Royal Commission and possibly afterwards go on to the Student Assistance (Loans Guarantee and Subsidy) Bill 1982.</PARA></TALK.START>

There was a clear understanding that the Government was to proceed as far as possible with its legislation. It is correct to acknowledge that there was a breaking of the arrangement which Senator Robertson outlined earlier, in that there was a speaker on the first reading of the sales tax legislation before dinner, and that took some time away from Government legislation. The position is that we want to proceed with this legislation. There is a necessity to do so. We clearly understood that to be the arrangement. It is unfortunate that we have come to a situation in which the Opposition is determined, apparently, to take matters into its own hands.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last two days it has been indicated that it is very necessary that a certain amount of Government legislation be passed, particularly legislation which relates to money. It is my understanding that this legislation is most necessary so that regulations can be brought into being in October. A list of legislation to be dealt with by the Senate has been agreed upon. Today there was arrangement that no speeches would be made at the first reading stages of Bills but that time would be allowed tomorrow when all honourable senators could speak to the first reading of a Bill if they wished. It was agreed that Government business would be debated and necessary Government legislation would be passed. It was arranged, as has been stated, that at approximately 9 p.m. the debate on the report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry would be brought on. There have been speeches at the first reading stage of a Bill. A considerable amount of time-debating time on Government legislation-has been lost and no reasonable amount of Government legislation has been passed. We should debate more Government legislation to honour the real meaning of the agreement and then the debate on the Australian meat industry would be brought in.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, Mr President. I was speaking to Senator Button's motion. I reiterate that we have had an arrangement. We had a clear understanding that we would conclude as much Government legislation as was required to meet the Government's arrangements by the end of this month so that new legislation could come into force by 1 October. I understood that to be the clear position. Senator Robertson in his earlier remarks referred to an arrangement not to have any speakers to the motion for the first reading of Bills. In fact that did not occur and time was lost before dinner on a first reading debate on the sales tax Bills. So we lost time on one set of Bills after that agreement. Now we find the Opposition proposing to take business out of the Government's hands without our being able to handle legislation, as is required. As we all know, tomorrow is more of less given over to private senators' time and there will be little opportunity for the Government to proceed with its legislative program. What is more, the Opposition was so determined to take matters out of our hands that, without any notice, it apparently broke the arrangements for pairs on the last vote--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak in favour of the motion moved by Senator Button. Quite clearly, what happened here, as has been said by representatives of the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats, was that today an agreement was made that at approximately 9 p.m. the ministerial statement on the report of the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry would come on for debate and that before that we would proceed as expeditiously as possible with Government legislation. I certainly agree that there was one speech on the motion for a first reading this afternoon which lasted, I believe, approximately three and a half minutes. That is how long it lasted and the urgency of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) at that time was such that he actually suggested to the President that this House get up before the dinner break.</PARA></TALK.START>

If we cannot agree to give up the right of honourable senators to take part in first reading debates in this place in exchange for such an important debate at night, then no agreement is worth while .

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the motion moved by Senator Button. I wish to refer to a number of things raised, firstly by Senator Grimes. Senator Grimes maligned a number of honourable senators on my side of the chamber and, I think, unfairly. Of course, he refused to respond to the interjections so that those people who are listening to the debate or will read the Hansard tomorrow will not recognise how he did so. The first thing is that he accused the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) of agreeing to the break for dinner in the proceedings of the Senate at 6.25 p.m. But the Minister interjected that it was at the request of the Opposition Whip that the Senate was adjourned at 6.25 p.m. Senator Grimes refused to respond to that interjection-he ignored it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. Senator Grimes refused to respond to that interjection and so endeavoured not to have it written into the record. But the truth of the matter is that the Opposition Whip requested the Senate to adjourn at 6.25 p.m. Because the Minister agreed to that at that time, the Minister is now accused of allowing the Senate's time to pass without the debate on those Bills taking place. I turn to the next point. Senator Grimes said that the Minister did not tell the Opposition of any need to have pairs. Since when has that arrangement come into force? If the Opposition wishes to break the pairing arrangements we will understand the situation. But tonight the Opposition clearly broke the pairing arrangements and the last vote taken in the chamber was 32 to 29-quite clearly a breaking of the pairs by some three senators. The Opposition is well aware that, for example, Senator Durack is still in hospital.</PARA></TALK.START>

If anyone reads the business sheet they will clearly see that preceding the words 'At approximately 9.00 p.m.', which are in brackets , are five Government measures, all of which were to be dealt with prior to approxi-mately 9 p.m., before going on with the Australian meat industry matter. It is clear that the discussion this morning was on the basis that the Senate would be reasonable and would endeavour to get through the Government measures. It is about time that the Senate applied its mind to some of the measures which are before the Parliament instead of having these political mud-slinging debates which clearly the Opposition wants to have and is anxious to have as soon as it possibly can. Let me draw attention to how some of the time has been spent in the Senate this sitting. Some figures have been taken out. The Senate has spent two hours and 16 minutes on petitions-that is, 3.83 per cent of the Senate's time.

This is all important legislation to be considered and there is no opportunity for Government Business to be put forward in the Senate. Senator Grimes, at the end of his speech, as he does on practically every broadcast day, attacked his Liberal colleague from Tasmania, Senator Walters, and made some imputation that she was not in the chamber or that she was not listening or that she would not know what was going on. He uses rude words about her on broadcast day for the sole purpose of broadcasting to the people of Tasmania some criticism of her; most unfairly using the facilities of the Senate to attack Senator Walters who, without doubt, is one of the strongest and best senators that Tasmania has ever produced.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only point I make is that there is no argument at all about the pairs. When we had our meeting this morning, as I tried to explain earlier, we made certain decisions. I refer to the notes of the meeting, which Senator Kilgariff has kindly made available to me. The notes of the meeting, which we both signed, state:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If possible, all Bills listed as Government Business today will be passed. </PARA>
<PARA>We agreed that if possible that would be done. We agreed to go ahead and try to help in this. The next line of the notes states:</PARA>
<PARA> The meat industry debate will commence at 9 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA>I asked, and this will be recalled by those who were present, that this be noted on the red sheet. Just so that there would be no misunderstanding about it we had it noted on the Red that at 9 o'clock this would happen. We said 'Well, let us put the word ''approximately'' ' and we were happy with that, because five munites before or after would be a sensible way of doing it. If we break these arrangements we will get the sorts of shambles that we have tonight. The Government has no leg to stand on in this matter. It has tried to bulldoze something through and it is foolish. </PARA>
<PARA> A comment was made earlier about the Senate adjourning for dinner are 6.25. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) rose to adjourn the debate on the sales tax Bills and then we decided that we would just suspend the sitting for dinner. It is common practice that we look across to one another at 6.25 or 6.26 or it might be 10.55 and make a gesture which suggests that both of us would be happy if we did not move into the debate. We were moving into a second reading debate and Senator Walsh would have had only four or five minutes to try to develop an argument. Quite clearly this was not done at my request at all. It was an agreement that we reached by looking across and indicating that we were both happy, which we have done many times before. We have just looked across and made sure it has suited both Government and Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Lewis and others say that we have urgent business, that we have government business which must be put through, let me remind him that the Government has the machinery to do this. But let me also remind him that he is not going to convince too many people that a matter introduced today has to be completed today. Let us face it: If this is vitally important, if the Government wants this legislation passed, why could it not have got its act together a few weeks ago and got things moving then? We will not be blackmailed by the Government saying: 'We have to have it'. This morning we fell for an approach and we said: 'Yes, we will try to help you. You need to get this stuff. We will co-operate'. I am not too sure that there is going to be a great deal of co- operation in the future if we are going to have arrangements broken like this. </PARA>
<PARA> If Senator Lewis could get down off his perch and have a look at the Hansards of 1972 to 1975 I think he would be a little less outgoing in some of the comments he makes. What is happening at the moment is not a patch on what happened in an organised way from 1972 to 1975. As Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle said in this place on several occasions, and certainly in answer to a comment I made: 'Our one task was to get you out'. I said: 'Would you do it again?' She said: 'Certainly we would'. We are prepared to act as a loyal Opposition. Apparently this principle does not apply to the other side. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis was a little bit critical of his Government, and I can understand that. But just let me finish on this point: We were talking this morning about the arrangements for general business tomorrow night and the possibility of assisting the Government get some of its legislation through. I was to go to members of my party tomorrow and say to them: 'Would you be prepared to forgo general business to allow the Government to get some legislation through?' Honourable senators can imagine what my reaction is going to be. </PARA>

Very briefly, I would like to take up a few points made by the Australian Labor Party. For Senator Grimes to talk about the debate and the performance of the Labor Party being orderly is one of the most flagrant misuses of words I have heard in this place. In no sense can the behaviour of the Opposition since dinner be classified as orderly. The main theme of Senator Grimes's approach is to threaten the Government.

When I first came into this Senate four years ago and looked at the red sheet entitled 'Order of Business' the first thing I saw was the following words in the top right-hand corner: 'This document is issued as a guide to Senators'. It is like a Queensland railways timetable which is a guide to when the train might arrive. It is not a positive guarantee at all. A guide is an indication. The second line on the top right-hand corner, since most honourable senators opposite are illiterate and innumerate, reads: ' The business listed is subject to change'. 'Change' means it can be varied. So there is nothing inviolate about that red paper. </PARA>
<PARA> On a more serious note, I would like to refer to Senator Tate and Senator Keeffe. One of the basic rules of this Senate is that a senator has the right to be heard. This is not written in Standing Orders but it is part of the ethos of this place. It is not part of the Labor Party ethos, though, if Government senators wish to speak. Members of the Labor Party can speak but Government senators cannot have their fair say. They have to be gagged and denied the right to speak. This is one of the characteristics of this totalitarian socialist belief that the Australian Labor Party and Opposition senators share. They have embarked on a policy of frustration and delay. They are trying to deny the Government the right to get its legislation through. Senator Robertson spoke about the breaking of pairs. What a load of humbug! It was a straight out dishonourable act. You have broken an agreement. To put Senator Chipp--</PARA>

I do not believe that that is the position that the Australian Democrats wish to seek in public. So the argument advanced by Senator Robertson with respect to Senator Chipp is quite untenable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that I will be opposing the motion, although that does not mean that I do not consider that the Woodward Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry is not important. As witnessed by my question this afternoon, I consider it very important. It is important also to analyse the manner in which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) handled the Woodward inquiry. However, I believe that the Government does have a genuine reason for attempting to see that legislation which must be in place by the end of this month is considered by the Senate today because, as has been said by the Government, normally Thursday is given over to reports and to private members' business to a large extent. If this motion is defeated the Bill with which we will proceed is the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Amendment Bill 1982, which is quite important, of course, for the States. The Opposition had its opportunity earlier this evening when the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1 to 9) 1982 were before us. Frankly, I think it missed its opportunity in respect of those Bills. As I said on that occasion, those Bills could have been held up and the Government could have been forced to give an explanation of the extra imposts and burden on the taxpaying community, particularly the working men. The Opposition did not do that. I propose to oppose this motion. No doubt it will be defeated and, when it is defeated, the Senate will proceed with the next business.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-We have now wasted something like an hour of the Senate's time with Government spokesmen explaining how urgent the Government's business is. The motion which I have moved, of course, seeks to bring on the matter which appears on the business sheet for the day. The business sheet indicates that at approximately 9 p.m. the report of the Royal Commission into the Meat Industry was to have been called on for debate. All sorts of points have been made about this by Senator MacGibbon and others, suggesting that the business sheet does not mean what it says. It is the clear view of two of the three Whips and about 75 per cent of the intelligence of the Whips that the agreement was that at 9 p.m. this matter would be called on. Senator Robertson, in his contribution to the debate, pointed out that he raised the question of whether it was correct that the matter would be called on at exactly 9 p.m. and that because he raised that matter the debate was listed on the red sheet to be called on at approximately 9 p.m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of debate on this motion we have heard all sorts of things from people such as Senator Lewis who oppose it. We were told that the Senate's time had been wasted in recent weeks debating matters other than Government Business. He produced statistics which I do not challenge for a moment. He might be right about the facts if not in his arguments. I do not attempt to refute the statistics he produced. I remind the Senate that we live in a country where the Cabinet, the Executive Government, spent 10 hours last week discussing whether Mr Horgan should be sacked from various government positions which he held. The Executive Government of this country, the Cabinet, spent another 10 hours on Monday considering the retrospective legislation which the Government proposes to introduce and which a number of subversives in the ranks of this Government refuse to support. It spent 10 hours dealing with that sort of issue. If the Government is carrying on like that what on earth does it expect from the Senate ? The Senate is entitled, as the senior chamber of the Parliament of this country, to consider those questions in debate. I think all that sort of statistical information is quite irrelevant in the current political context. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the clear understanding on this side of the House was that the meat industry report would be debated at 9 p.m. As Senator Robertson said, he was to go to a party meeting tomorrow morning and say that we should forgo General Business tomorrow in order to give the Government the right to debate its legislation. </PARA>

Many honourable senators came here tonight to deal with this meat industry report. My friend, the Leader of the Australian Democrats (Senator Chipp), who is subject to a matter of great pressing moment in his personal life, came here tonight to deal with the meat industry inquiry. Those are the matters which should be dealt with appropriately as they appear on the Notice Paper. Too much time has been wasted. The Government has put itself in an extraordinary position. I suggest to Senator Walters that tomorrow she should add up the time that has been wasted. The ratio of time wasted by Government senators, including Senator Walters, to that wasted by the Opposition is about 10:1.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly in relation to the Air Navigation Legislation (Validation and Interpretation) Bill 1982 because the question of air navigation charges is a very important one which has concerned the whole cost structure of the air transport industry for a considerable time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose the Air Navigation Legislation (Validation and Interpretation) Bill 1982. It is a fairly simple Bill which highlights the complete incompetence of the Fraser Administration. We have wasted well over an hour this evening ostensibly because of the importance of government business. This piece of legislation arose out of the complete incompetence of the Fraser Government when it brought about ministerial changes a short time ago. It is purely a machinery measure to correct an error that occurred when the Department of Transport was needlessly and unnecessarily, in our view, split into two separate departments-one of transport and construction and the other of aviation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As my colleague in the other place, Mr Morris, pointed out, if the Government was aware of its responsibilities, was competent, knew what it was doing and knew in which direction it was heading, there would have been no need for this special piece of legislation, which is one of the reasons why the Senate tonight was denied an opportunity, on a broadcast day, to debate the very important deficiences that exist in the Department of Primary Industry, as expressed in Mr Justice Woodward's report on the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition takes the view that the splitting of the Department of Transport , which has led to the necessity for this Bill, represents a retrograde step on the part of the Government. It represents an artificial and inefficient division of the administration of transport in this country. It will undoubtedly encourage disorganisation and an absence of planning and co-ordination. In recent weeks we have witnessed further proof of the inept and deficient government of this country. That is apparent whether we talk about tax evasion, Medibank fraud or the activities of the Department of Primary Industry in relation to Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd or the meat inspection service . No matter which part of government administration we examine-for example, the administration of the Australian Federal Police-we find that there is constant change in administration at the hands of the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser. There is a constant change of Ministers and ministerial arrangements and the transference of departments here, there and everywhere. For example, Estimates Committee C, in considering the appropriations for the Department of Administrative Services found that, as a result of the recent ministerial rearrangements, it had been obliged to absorb such organisations as the Industries Assistance Commission and the Trade Practices Commission, which hitherto had been part of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. If there are weaknesses in public administration-as has been suggested by the Prime Minister in seeking a scapegoat for deficiencies in ministerial responsibility-the Prime Minister has contributed materially to that maladministration by his constant changing of Ministers and, in consequence, of ministerial responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is concerned about the necessity for this Bill and deplores the circumstances that led to its introduction. We also deplore that tonight the Government Whip sought to mislead the Senate and suggested that there had been a breakdown on our part in regard to the way in which the Senate should operate when, clearly, it had been indicated by the Government that this was a vital and important piece of legislation. Only one other measure remains to be dealt with. Neither is important in regard to the Budget or in regard to their becoming effective before some date in October. Both could have been dealt with expeditiously without any problems at all. But, of course, the Government has set out on a course of denying the Opposition an opportunity to debate Mr Justice Woodward's very critical and awkward report concerning the operations of the Department of Primary Industry and the role of its Minister, Mr Nixon, against which the Government found that it had to defend itself yesterday in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> One would have expected that the Government, having decided upon the retrograde step of splitting the ministry of transport into two ministries, would have been able to carry out the simple procedures necessary to facilitate the transfer of powers and of delegation from the Secretary to the Department of Transport to the Secretary to the new Department of Aviation. That simple administrative step could have been taken when the division was made but the Government, in its haste and incompetence, failed to take that essential step, one so minor in terms of proper public administration. This reveals again that the Fraser Government cannot be relied upon to carry out even the simplest administrative practices within the Department of Aviation and the Department of Transport and Construction. The Opposition concedes that within those departments there are very highly skilled officers, of dedication and competence, who give of their best in service to the people and government of this country. I must express sympathy for them in endeavouring to cope with the resources made available to them. by this Government, and the lack of leadership that is given them as a result of the constant changes of Minister and of ministerial arrangements. In my view, those officers cannot be blamed. </PARA>
<PARA> This is but another example of complete incompetence on the part of this Government's Ministers-incompetence such as we find when we consider Mr Justice Woodward's Royal Commission report, such as we found in respect of Medibank fraud under two previous Ministers for Health, and such as we found in respect of the administration by the former Minister for Primary Industry in respect of Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd-but most of all, incompetence such as we found in respect of the administration of the tax laws of this country. I have in mind the grave deficiencies in the way in which the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) have carried out their duties. We have to consider the lamentable fact that the Treasurer only 24 hours after his return to this country had the audacity to suggest that there were deficiencies within the Australian Taxation Office and to attempt to shift the blame from himself to the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday we had the spectacle of the Prime Minister proposing that there should now be a public inquiry into the Public Service, one gathers at the senior level-suggesting that all of the deficiencies that exist are to be found within the Public Service rather than within the Government itself. This lack of competence on the part of the Prime Minister and his Ministers is clearly indicated in the legislation that is before the Senate. It may not provide an example that is of the order of the scandals that we have been discussing. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose we are indebted to Senator Lewis for indicating the amount of time that the Senate has spent in the more than five weeks of the Budget session so far, in considering such matters. It is true that the Senate has spent a great deal of time in discussing matters of public importance and matters associated with incompetence and Government corruption. But that is the role of a parliament. It is not something to be denigrated or criticised. That is what we are here to do. In 1973 to 1975 it was claimed that the Senate had the God-given right to play the role of a House of review, yet it is now suggested that there is something improper in using the forms of the House to debate inefficiencies in government administration. The Australian people now know of the continuous decline in public administration under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Although this Bill cannot be placed in the category of the other scandals that the Parliament has discussed in recent weeks, it too indicates yet again the gross incompetence of the Prime Minister and his Ministers in making these ministerial arrangements. It merely adds to the volume of evidence of the Fraser Government's maladministration, incompetence and inability to pursue any proper form of public administration-a task which in 1975, 1977 and 1980 it was elected to perform. This matter, which should have been the subject of a simple administrative act, has had the Department in a state of confusion in the 16 weeks since the new arrangements were made. It has taken the Government all of that time to prepare a technically simple little machinery Bill. Yet the Minister had the gall tonight to say that these were matters of major importance . If they were matters of major importance, why did the Government not present them on the first sitting day of this session? The Government knows that there is very little legislation in the first few days of sittings. This Bill has only one or two lines for consideration by the Senate and yet it has taken into the sixth week of the session for it to come to the Senate for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not have any more of this humbug that somehow or other it is the Opposition that is frustrating the affairs of the Government or the way in which the Senate is operating. The Bill is a piece of paper that contains 20 or 30 lines. That is the legislation with which the Government denied the Senate the opportunity to debate the report of Mr Justice Woodward on meat inspection. The Government has done that so it can deal with this simple Bill and the next Bill, the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill. The Opposition does not oppose the legislation but it expresses its disgust at the way in which the Government is operating in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has been set up by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs ( Senator Messner) in this way and is coming in here doing the Government's business for it. I suppose that is the sort of thing we have to expect. I, like others, expected to speak on this legislation earlier tonight. We did not get to this legislation because the Government quite clearly broke an agreement. Senator Harradine apparently is willing to go along with the Government's breaking that sort of agreement. I noticed that as usual he had not put his name on the list to speak on the legislation. Apparently he is a late convert to the importance of the legislation. However, if we have sufficient numbers to force the Senate to debate the legislation we see no reason to obstruct it. We will consider the matter while we hear what the Australian Democrats have to say on the issue. The Australian Labor Party prefers to be given notice of such changes of plan as this and to consider such changes, as it is a party that indulges in consultation between members. It does not just take the direction of Ministers.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I wish to deal with three points that were made in opposition to this motion. I refer firstly to the last point that was made. The Senate did not spend an hour debating this matter. It spent one hour debating a motion for the suspension of Standing Orders so as to bring forward consideration of the report of the Woodward Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry. At that time the Government made out a case that the States Tax (Sharing and Health Grants) Amendment Bill (No. 2) in particular required to be passed. This Bill is important for the States. The Senate postponed debate of the Bill not because of my doing but because of the doing of the Opposition. Let that be very clear right here and now. For Senator Grimes and Senator Tate to accuse me of being in collusion with the Minister over this matter and of doing the Minister's work is an utter untruth. This is a matter to which I gave consideration. I went across to the Minister and asked him whether the Government would agree to restoring this measure to the Notice Paper in the same position as it was this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An agreement was made. Can I take it then, that the Australian Democrats Whip and the Opposition Whip would prefer to debate the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill before the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Amendment Bill (No. 2)? Is that what they want to do? There is a deafening silence. Of course they do not. I say quite bluntly that Senator Grimes's allegation is totally unfounded and unwarranted. What happened here tonight was that the Opposition missed out on its opportunity to nail the Government. It did so in respect of the Bill of which Senator Walsh had charge. He and the Opposition missed out on nailing the Government. They voted for that measure, imposing sales tax on the workers of this country, without getting the Government to give some guarantees to the workers and to the trade unionists of this country that there would be some offsets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I simply suggest that my motion seeks to restore this measure to the Notice Paper, to the place that it occupied today both on the Notice Paper and on the red sheet. If the Opposition and the Australian Democrats want to oppose that, in the face of the Government, that is their prerogative; but let it be known to all concerned that they would rather that the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill come forward before the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Amendment Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bills be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>LIVE-STOCK SLAUGHTER LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964 to increase the maximum rates of levy which may be prescribed to finance the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, meat and livestock research and cattle disease eradication. Concurrently, I will be introducing a bill for parallel amendments to the Live-stock Export Charge Act 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> The two Acts to be amended raise funds from the meat and livestock Industry for the same purposes and are similar in structure and rates, but one applies to livestock slaughtered and the other to stock exported live. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed increases covered by this Bill have been recommended to me by the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation after consultation with industry groups. The Government accepts that the Corporation will need an increase in levy income in order to avoid operating at a deficit or cutting back on its activities and service to the industry and that this will first necessitate an increase in the maximum rates currently provided in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy is imposed on slaughterings of cattle, calves, bobby calves, sheep, lambs, buffaloes and goats. It has separate components for the financing of the Australian Meat and Live-Stock Corporation, meat and livestock research, meat processing research and cattle disease eradicaton. There are comparable rates for each component in respect of each class of livestock. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act specifies maximum rates only with operative rates being prescribed by regulation. Separate maximum rates already exist in the Legislation for the research and disease eradication components. In addition, the operative rates set for the research and AMLC components must not exceed a specified maximum. Hence, the highest level of AMLC component is limited by the level of the prevailing research components. Currently, this difference is insufficient to enable the AMLC component to be increased to the level considered necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore proposed to double the aggregate maximum rates which govern the size of the AMLC component. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing and proposed levy rates are:</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Maximum rates (c/Head)</PARA>
<PARA>current proposed</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Cattle and Buffaloes  150.0 300.0 Bobby Calves (40 kg and less)  15.0 30.0 Calves (40 kg and up to 90 kg)  52.5 105.0 Sheep, Lambs and Goats  15.0 30.0</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the proposed changes is to enlarge the scope available for increasing the AMLC component while preserving the existing relativity with the research components. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the changes proposed for the cattle disease eradication component which were announced in the Budget. This levy applies only to bovine animals. The current rates are at the maximum level permitted by the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Finance for the Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign has been falling behind costs. While the Government has announced in the Budget that it will write-off the outstanding industry debt of $23.5 million, it is anxious to ensure that the continuing program does not result in the industry building up a further debt. This Bill is therefore providing for an increase in the current maximum rates by two-thirds-from $3 to $5 for cattle and buffaloes, $1 to $1.67 for calves, and 30 cents to 50 cents for bobby calves. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not, however, intended that the disease eradication component be immediately set at these new levels. As stated in the Budget, the operative rate , with effect from October 1, 1982, will be raised from $3 to $4 per head for cattle, with corresponding increases for other classes of livestock. </PARA>
<PARA> This increase follows a thorough review of the eradication campaign and its financing, and must be seen in the context of the package of assistance offered in the Budget to the cattle and meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to these amendments opportunity is being taken to bring references in the Act to the Meat Exporter and Abattoir Consultative Group into conformity with the changed title of that group. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>LIVE-STOCK EXPORT CHARGE AMENDMENTS BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is a companion measure to the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill just introduced. It proposes similar amendments to the Live-stock Export Charge Act 1977. These were explained in my second reading speech on the earlier measure. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill seeks to raise the maximum rate of slaughter levy from $3 to $5. If one looks at this Bill one will see that yet again the meat industry has been taken for a ride. I refer in particular to the type of suggestions that the Government has been putting, and indeed has put to me in answer to a question I asked in relation to this matter. The Government stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The funds raised through the previous $3 per head levy have not kept pace with the actual operating costs of the campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a complete fabrication. To show that that is the case I refer the Senate to the old levy charge of $1 per head. At 30 June 1979 industry debt was just over $18m. At that time the levy was $1 per head. The following day the levy rose to $3 a head. In the 1979-80 financial year-that is the first year in which the levy was $3-the levy collected from the industry exceeded the Commonwealth's expenditure by $150,000. However that year the Commonwealth opted for the first time to levy interest charges on that debt. At that time the interest charges were $1,973,000. That raised the total industry debt to nearly $20m. Note that at that time the industry was more than paying its way with $3 a head. </PARA>
<PARA> In the financial year 1980-81 the levy raised $1,595,000. So the amount of slaughter levy raised was more than the expenditure by the Commonwealth under the Act. Again the Commonwealth charges had risen in line with the rising amount of debt. Interest payments were then $2.5m. So the actions of this Government, regardless of what the industry paid, were putting an increasing burden on the industry. At the end of the 1981-82 financial year the industry had a debt of $ 23.5m. However during 1982 the industry, again at $3 a head, contributed more than the cost of the campaign, more than the Commonwealth's expenditure. This is where the fiddle has taken place and where the meat industry and the cattle producers have been sold down the drain yet again. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Budget the Government, with largesse, said that it would waive the $23. 5m debt. But it continued to make the claim, as I stated a moment ago, that the funds raised through the previous $3 a head levy had not kept pace with the actual operating costs of the campaign. On the figures from the Bureau of Animal Health that is false. The information supplied to the Senate by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) is false. The levy has kept pace with the campaign ever since it was set at $3 a head; that is, ever since 1 July 1979. So the reason given for the introduction of this Bill is entirely spurious. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy is now to be increased from $3 to $4 a head for particular animals-not all. It is to apply to cattle as of 1 October 1982 but not to calves or poddy calves, which since 1 July 1979 have had a differentiated rate. But as of 1 October 1982 the levy on cattle slaughter, which is generally the bench-mark on which the slaughter levy is set, is to rise to $4 a head with a maximum of $5. In other words, the cattle producers are now being asked to cop an increase in the slaughter levy despite the fact that they have paid more than the operating costs of the campaign. This is in complete contradiction to the Government's propaganda. But based on the figures which have been supplied by the Bureau of Animal Health, the producers will have to pay more of the debt. The Government in its Budget said: 'We are now wiping out a debt of $23.5m. This is our handout .' Yet the vast bulk of that debt was accruing through interest rates charged by the Commonwealth because the Commonwealth had failed dismally in its brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The intent, under this legislation, is to create a further impost on the cattle industry at a time when it can ill afford it and to increase the levy charged when indeed the governments of comparable countries such as Canada, the United States and New Zealand bear entirely the costs of these eradication campaigns. This Government has introduced a Bill to increase the impost at a time when the cattle industry can ill afford it; thereby it is going backwards in its own contributions to these campaigns. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that the Cattle Council of Australia, the Cattlemen's Union and other cattle organisations have not been hoodwinked by the Government. This fact is witnessed by the Press releases relating to this matter. If the Minister would like to go out into the cattle producing country and talk to the producers who are in such dire difficulties he will find that they are not hoodwinked by the type of propaganda that the Government has put about concerning the slaughter levy. They will realise that they have been taken for a ride yet again and that they have contributed more than the operating costs of the campaign ever since 1 July 1979 when the slaughter levy was raised to $3. I hope the Minister will be able to explain why the Government has seen fit to give to me and to other honourable senators the type of information which is contrary to the figures that have been produced by the Bureau of Animal Health. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank the Opposition for its support of the legislation. I point out that the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill 1982 and the Live-stock Export Charge Amendment Bill 1982 were announced in the Budget to commence from 1 October 1982. In the event of that not occurring there will be a loss of revenue to the Government which is incorporated in its Budget figuring. I, therefore, had hoped that we would have unanimous support for this legislation as it represents a Budget measure on which the Government relies. For that reason I implore honourable senators on all sides of the chamber to support this legislation. I wish it a speedy passage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the Senate unduly but tonight I wish to submit a request to Senator Baume, the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh), regarding the bicentennial celebrations. I do so in relation to a virtually forgotten Prime Minister of Australia, John Christian Watson. He was unique among our Prime Ministers. He did not have a very long period in politics and he led only a short term minority government. Among other things, his parents were of Scottish ancestry and he was born in Valparaiso in Chile.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As recently as last Friday, I attended a function at the Chilean Sporting and Social Club at Punchbowl. The club operates in the Earlwood region. It was significant that the 16-year-old son of the club president, Mr Frank Martin, said to me very directly: 'At a time when Australia is becoming more historically conscious, at least it had one Prime Minister who had Latin American links'. He did. I feel that the time is opportune for Senator Baume to take on board consideration of some form of memorial or monument in Sydney for John Watson. If my colleague, Senator Childs were here, he would say 'amen' because Watson was a compositor and one of the early members of the Printing and Kindred Industries Union. At 24 years of age he held the leading position of President of the Trades and Labour Council in Sydney. In fact, he was Prime Minister at 37 and at 43 he drifted out of politics. I used that word 'drifted' advisedly. He had differences with his party at the time of the conscription battle, but I think that when people differ with their party there is a certain point at which they stop without necessarily joining their political enemies. </PARA>
<PARA> John Watson had a very substantial career in Sydney commercial circles between the two wars. He was one of the leading people in the National Roads and Motorists Assocation for a long time in New South Wales. I simply say that at a time when we are boasting about our cosmopolitan content in the community at large, it would be a nice gesture if this suggestion that emanated from a relatively small fledgling Latin American club, the Chilean Sporting and Social Club, could be taken on board by Senator Baume and given to the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. I leave the practical suggestion with him for implementation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to deal very briefly with a matter raised by Senator MacGibbon in the course of this evening's rather heated exchanges. I feel that, as the honourable senator reflected very adversely on my propriety and worth as a senator of a great democracy like Australia, I should respond. I was tempted to do so in the course of the night's affairs but decided not to in the interests of allowing Senate business to proceed as expeditiously as possible. What Senator MacGibbon accused me of was that I gagged Senator Lewis and denied him the right to speak, or at least was interested in doing so, and that thereby I was joining what I think he described as the worst type of socialist forces bent on the destruction of democracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All that the Senate Hansard record will reveal is that I invited the Chair to ensure that Senator Lewis indeed exercised his right to speak in a relevant manner to the matter before the Chair. In other words, I never went beyond inviting the President, who was then in the chair, to ensure that Standing Orders were observed. Of course, those Standing Orders exist to enable honourable senators in this chamber in this democratically elected Parliament to engage in the fullest and freest debate within the normal bounds of propriety and relevance. As the Hansard record will reveal, it was in that regard only that I asked for any ruling from the Chair in relation to Senator Lewis's contribution. It was never my intention, nor can it be inferred in any way that I would want to gag any honourable senator or deny him or her the right to speak . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it that there is no requirement for me to respond to what Senator Tate has said by way of making a personal explanation. Senator Mulvihill raised a question concerning the man who was, of course, the first Labor Prime Minister of Australia. He was Prime Minister for three months and 21 days in 1904. Senator Mulvihill's suggestion is not known to the office of the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh). It is not a suggestion with which the office has had a chance to become familiar or about which it has had a chance to form a view or make any analysis. All I can do is take the suggestion on notice, put it to the Minister, as Senator Mulvihill has suggested, and ensure that it is given appropriate and early attention.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am aware of media reports on this problem.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is highly unlikely that unauthorised access could be gained to information stored in computers used by my Department and Statutory Authorities within my portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The CSIRO Division of Computer Research operates a computer network called CSIRONET which is used by many Commonwealth Departments and Authorities in addition to CSIRO and the Department of Science and Technology.</PARA>
<PARA> Access to CSIRONET is limited to registered users who are able to identify themselves by providing a unique user identification code linked to a valid project code. User identification codes are further protected by a mandatory user password. The project identification code can also be password protected. These passwords are easily changed to minimise the risk of accidental security breaches.</PARA>
<PARA> Access to CSIRONET does not automatically give access to data held by the system. Password protection is available for all files by the CSIRONET on behalf of users. In addition, some systems restrict file access to a nominated list of users while others offer data encryption facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> CSIRONET security facilities rely on a mix of mandatory and elective features. The mandatory features are rigidly enforced. The elective features are available , but it is a matter for users to determine whether or not the nature of their business warrants this high level of protection.</PARA>
<PARA> Access to computer records within the Department of Science and Technology is similarly restricted. Apart from physical security, a series of user codes and changing passwords must be used before access can be gained to computer records.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) See answer to (2) above. However, even the remote chance of unauthorised access to computer records, whether it constitutes a security risk or invasion of privacy, is of concern to the Government. The Australian Law Reform Commission has before it a reference to examine and report on invasions of privacy arising from matters under the control of the Commonwealth Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) While it is not possible to give an absolute assurance, the strictest security measures have been taken to prevent unauthorised access to computer systems in my portfolio.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1), (3) and (4) It is not considered appropriate for particulars of individual purchases, including the names of parties and descriptions of properties, to be published. I draw the honourable senator's attention to the fact that, before consideration is given to foreign investment proposal for the acquisition of a rural property, it is the practice to ensure that the property has been publicly advertised or otherwise clearly made available for purchase by Australians. It is also the practice to consult the relevant State or Territory authorities on all such proposals. Further, information is prepared on an aggregated basis by the Foreign Investment Review Board, and published in regular statements by the Treasurer and in the annual reports of the Board, on numbers and area of properties State by State. The Treasurer released the most recent details in a press release (No. 175) on 23 August 1982, a copy of which is being forwarded to the honourable senator. He will see there that, of the 128 proposals for which approval was given in the year ended 30 June 1981, 51 involved migrants or intending migrants, ie they did not involve long term foreign ownership of rural land. Moreover, Australian equity participation was provided for in 35 of of the 128 proposals and in 20 of them 50 per cent or more Australian equity participation was retained.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) 81.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Six proposals were rejected in 1981-82. One was rejected against the background that an Australian wanted to purchase the property and had offered a higher price than the foreign investor. The other five were rejected because they involved neither Australian participation nor investors who intended to migrate to Australia within a reasonable period of time, and they did not offer sufficient economic benefits to warrant approval. One was resubmitted and approved in light of the financial circumstances of the Australian vendor.</PARA>

<PARA> It is the Government's general view that ratification of as many multilateral conventions as possible is a desirable objective.

The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women is now under consideration at ministerial level. The federal system in Australia means that progress towards ratification will be slower than in most centrally-governed countries.</PARA>
