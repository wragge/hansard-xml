<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy, refers to an article which appeared on page one of the Australian of Tuesday, 9 March 1982, concerning the possibility of Mount Newman Mines using steam locomotives to haul its iron ore to Port Hedland. I imagine that the locomotive referred to is the Ace 3000 type being proposed by American coal enterprises. Recognising Australia's vast amount of steaming coal, its relative cheapness and the proposed thermal efficiency of this computer- controlled, automatically-fired type of locomotive, I ask: Can the Minister have the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council look at this project and provide advice not only to Mount Newman Mines but also to the Australian National Railways and the State railways on its ability to provide a viable alternative to the current diesel electric locomotive? Besides the advantages of this type of locomotive, steam buffs would also benefit from the aura and poetry in motion that only a steam reciprocating locomotive can provide , without the backbreak and sweat incurred by the few of us left who might think that we can still fire a steam locomotive.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I saw the article to which Senator Collard refers. I am interested in it because alternatives to oil are of great importance. Sophisticated developments of the use of coal firing are of great importance indeed. The Government, as an integral part of its national energy policy, is committed to research and development of alternative energy forms. I would be happy to ask the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council , through one of its technical standing committees, to look at the project and to provide the results of its evaluation to Mount Newman Mines. Honourable senators would know that the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council was established in 1978 to provide advice in these regards . Grants totalling some $80.2m, including $19.2m in 1981-82, have been provided to support approved individual projects. The NERDDC is supported by a number of technical standing committees comprising members possessing technical excellence across technological fields. The chairman of the Australian National Railways Commission is a member of the Council's technical committees. I will bring the matter to his attention. If the honourable senator will be good enough to provide me with the details of the Ace 3000 steam locomotive, its particular qualities having escaped me until now, I will ensure that they are passed to the Council. I confirm his enthusiasm and that of many people in the community for the stimulation of steam locomotive propulsion.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is the Minister aware of the very recent reports of discoveries of seven more caves containing ancient Aboriginal artefacts on the Franklin River in Tasmania? Is the Minister aware that these new discoveries provide incredibly valuable sources of back-up information for Fraser Cave, already discovered on the Franklin River? If in the course of his answer the Minister can inform me whether the Fraser Cave was named after Eliza or Malcolm, I will be very grateful. There seems to be an area of doubt about that. I ask whether the Minister can confirm that research work on the Fraser Cave has been described by Professor Mulvaney of the Australian National University in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I am not aware of the existence of seven new caves, I am aware of some of the matters concerning Fraser Cave to which the honourable senator has referred. I am aware of the comments of Professor John Mulvaney who is very active in pre-history matters. I believe that he is a professor of pre- history. From the comments he has made on Fraser Cave, I believe that it provides evidence of the most southerly extension of Aboriginal Australia and some evidence of the existence of Aboriginals in Australia something like 25,000 years ago-a very long time ago. It is my understanding that Fraser Cave will be in jeopardy if the proposals for the dam go ahead, but I have no knowledge about the other seven caves. If there are other matters in Senator Chipp's question I will have them referred to the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment to see whether a further answer can be obtained.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and it is about the export of arms by the Soviet Union. Is it a fact that the Soviet Union, during the past year, exported to developing countries nearly $6 billion in arms? Is it also a fact that the Soviet Union is supplying replacement arms and ammunition to both Iraq and Iran to enable that tragic conflict to continue? Finally, is there evidence that the Soviet Union is deliberately engaged in destabilising activities in the Persian Gulf region?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="693" SPEAKER="Guilfoyle Sen The Hon Dame M.G.C." NAMEID="6D7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I have some information on this subject. I may need to seek additional information, but the latest figures that are available for Soviet arms sales to developing countries cover 1980. In that year such sales amounted to a minimum of almost $US5 billion. I say 'a minimum' advisedly because that is the extent of the information we have. Certain amounts of military equipment are provided to socialist countries allied to the Soviet Union, such as Cuba and Vietnam, at nominal or no cost. The figure for 1980 was a record and I have no doubt that the figure for 1981 will represent an increase on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Foreign Minister also feels that arms sales are the major factor in the Soviet Union's economic relations with developing countries. The Soviet Union has been supplying arms to Iraq in fulfilment of contracts made before the Iran- Iraq war began. Iran has reportedly made purchases of Soviet weapons through eastern European countries. While there is no reason to believe that these sales have been undertaken specifically to prolong the war and weaken both countries, they will no doubt have such an effect. It is regrettable that the Soviet Union has not been able instead to assist Iran and Iraq to resolve their differences peacefully.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of the matter raised by Senator Elstob. It would be quite untrue to suggest that there was any attempt to discourage people going into tertiary education. In fact, as honourable senators will know, the document published by Professor Pollard shows that over the past six years there has been an increase in the number of students in tertiary education beyond the normal increase of population. There has been an encouragement into education rather than a discouragement, and that is the Government's policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer Senator Sir John Carrick, the Minister representing the Minister for Science and Technology, to recent media reports which suggest that the operations of the Australian Antarctic Base, Casey, are to be curtailed and that staff shortages may force the closure of the base. Australia's participation in Antarctic research and exploration, its claim to part of this vast continent and the need for an Australian presence there in the face of growing interest by many of the major nations of the world are all factors which must be considered if these reports are correct.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether Senator Kilgariff addressed the question specifically to the Leader of the Government, but I represent the Minister for Science and Technology and I think it would be more appropriate for me to provide the answer to him. The Government is not intending to close any of Australia's four Antarctic or sub-Antarctic bases. Antarctica is of strategic and scientific importance to Australia and is, of course, very important as well because of its natural resources. The Government is currently spending $58m rebuilding the bases in the Antarctic over a 10-year period. The rebuilding program is essential to ensure continued safe occupancy of Australian Antarctic territory in support of the science program. Resources will continue to be made available to maintain the Australian presence in Antarctica. As well as these programs, the Government is considering means of replacing the present Antarctic ships which re-supply the bases and which provide a limited marine science capability.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention has been drawn to the article in the Cattleman, a publication which I do not normally read during the week but which I sometimes read on a light weekend, and to the move which could be of some significance to the meat industry in Australia. A number of similar proposals-that is, proposals which would have required products containing imported meats to be labelled as such before retailing-have been put before Congress in the past and those proposals have not been successful. Some sections of the United States cattle industry continue to press for similar measures. One of those moves is referred to in the article that Senator Archer has mentioned in his question. It is not possible for me or the Government to predict how the United States Congress will react to any particular piece of legislation that might be put before it if, indeed, another Bill does eventuate, but the consistent practice of the United States authorities has been to oppose any such mandatory labelling. I do not believe we have any reason to think that that would change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Press article reports on one resolution out of a number on various subjects that were put forward at the National Cattlemen's Association meeting in late January. At that meeting the administrator of the food safety and inspection service of the United States Department of Agriculture put forcefully the contrary view and stated that the United States Administration opposed any proposals that would make mandatory any additional labelling for products containing imported meat. The Administration believes that, although American consumers have the right to be informed about the products they buy, they have a right to fair and reasonable prices for the products. Additional labelling for products containing imported meat could result in increased costs to consumers and possible reprisals against United States agricultural exports. The Australian Government, of course, will continue to take an interest in this matter and will resist any proposals of this nature, although, of course, in the ultimate decisions are made by United States authorities. But there appear to be important interests in the United States opposed to the sorts of measures which were discussed at that meeting.</PARA>

I refer the Minister to a reply which he gave to a question without notice from Senator Button on 9 March and in which he quoted the Prime Minister as saying that the Government does not know what is going to happen to oil prices. Is it a fact that he visited Saudi Arabia recently and spoke to the Saudi Arabian oil Minister, Sheik Yamani? Is it also a fact that Sheik Yamani advised him that the price of Saudi Arabian light crude oil and, indeed, world oil prices generally would stay depressed for several years? In view of the Prime Minister's statement are we to assume that the Minister did not convey this information on future oil prices to the Prime Minister or is the Prime Minister conveniently pleading ignorance because he is frightened of the potential loss of tax revenue from a fall in petrol prices in Australia?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In January I spent six or seven days in Saudi Arabia and some days in Kuwait and Bahrain. In Saudi Arabia I was fortunate to have very detailed discussions with Sheik Yamani and other members of the Saudi Arabian Government. In the course of those discussions we canvassed the whole spectrum of energy problems in both the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the oil consuming world. Sheik Yamani indicated that he had striven very vigorously to achieve stability in OPEC pricing by managing to bring down other prices to his bench mark and by Saudi Arabia moving to a price of $34 a barrel. He believed that this year if other circumstances were not to emerge there would be no rise in oil prices and that if no other circumstances were to emerge next year there might be a rise but the rise would not be as high as the inflation rate. That would be his goal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But he expressed very serious concern that extra oil would be coming into the oil stream, primarily from Iran, which has run out of foreign exchange and must earn money, and also from Iraq. Therefore, oil might come on stream at significantly discounted prices and that might exacerbate the surplus situation and might make it difficult for the arrangement reached by OPEC to be sustained. He indicated that Saudi Arabia would look towards the possibility of reducing the surplus and thought that Saudi Arabia might be able to reduce its output from, say, 8.5 million barrels a day to as low as 6.5 million barrels a day. He canvassed the effects of the destabilisation on individual OPEC countries, such as Indonesia and others that might suffer very serious economic problems should their revenue fall. We discussed at length the desirability of a stable world energy situation. We discussed the fact that the surplus had in fact been brought about by the work of the members of the International Energy Agency, including Australia, by conservation, and, of course, by Saudi having increased its volume of output. That was the background.</PARA>
<PARA> When I came home I expressed that in full detail to the Prime Minister by letter and orally; so he has accurate information regarding my discussions. There is no difference between what I was told and what the Prime Minister said. It is true that nobody knows what will happen to oil prices. OPEC meets on 19 March. It will have to make decisions about volume. Saudi Arabia will then have to make decisions about price. Nobody can tell how much oil will be forced on to the market through, say, Iran, Iraq and other countries; therefore, nobody can tell what will happen to the volume and the price of oil. Therefore, in fact what the Prime Minister said is absolutely accurate. I have said repeatedly that we have an import parity pricing device, that we are geared to the benchmark price of Saudi Arabian light market crude and that our practice has been on 1 July and 1 January to look at what has happened to that benchmark and to make adjustments in terms of the price and the exchange rate. That in fact has been the pattern, and we have in the past moved downwards as well as upwards. That remains our policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, concerns the elimination of immunology research within the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and the shortages of antivenom supplies for use in various poisoning cases. It is understood that part of the problem has arisen through internal staff disagreements but it appears also that reductions in funding to the Laboratories for the immunology research department has resulted from an attempt to have the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories pay its way as a commercial producer of pharmaceuticals. Can the Minister advise whether this is in fact the situation? Does he agree that specific funding for expanded immunology research should be provided by the Commonwealth Government regardless of the economics of the research costs compared with the revenue from the sale of various antidotes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not correct to say that immunology research at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories has been eliminated. It is not correct to say that there is a shortage of antivenoms produced by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. I am grateful to the honourable senator for the question and for the opportunity to make those facts clear. Immunology research occurs in the areas of bacteriology and virology and in the production of antivenoms. The work is generally expanding and appropriate changes are occurring to take into account current advances in science and scientific understanding. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories level of research since 1961, when it became a commission, has grown significantly. So it is not correct for people to say it is being truncated. The current level enables valuable research to be carried out in such areas as immunology and in the application of immunological knowledge. Last year two new vaccines were introduced for two new diseases which had not previously been covered. As well, two new antivenoms for bee venom and funnel web spider venom are now undergoing trial at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Each year all research projects are reviewed in the light of the needs of the community and the nation. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories pays for a considerable part of the research undertaken from its own profits together with some injection of Commonwealth funds. I understand that that annual review might involve some change in the research program-some additions and deletions. If the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories were not a commercially viable organisation, that is, a profit-making organisation, of course funds for research and development would be more limited. The Commonwealth Government has, in the past, provided significant funds to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories for its national interest activities which cover various research and development works. Budgetary limitations, of course, would determine how much would be available from the Commonwealth.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see the photograph and the story in this morning's Canberra Times. I was somewhat shocked to see that that, in fact, is the degree to which people in the United States still feel they are forced to go, apparently to draw attention to their plight. This Government has approached the problems of Vietnam veterans with a great deal of concern and has in recent times instituted special treatment programs for Vietnam veterans in urgent need. Of course, it is true that of 45,000 veterans who returned from Vietnam, some 7, 000 are currently in receipt of treatment and/or pension benefits from the Department of Veterans' Affairs whether or not those injuries are alleged to be due to herbicide exposure or other matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The facilities within our Department are offered in a variety of ways but chiefly via the new counselling centres which are being established throughout Australia. This is proceeding quickly and there will be one in each capital city by May. These centres are being staffed by expert counsellors in various areas. They will be able to direct people to community facilities if they are not available within the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Of course, they will be able to refer them directly to our normal hospital facilities available at repatriation general hospitals in each State. The repatriation general hospitals in each State have been instructed to look at the problems of Vietnam veterans in this country with a great deal of concern and have accepted cases of urgent need into their ranks where spare capacity has existed within the hospitals. That treatment has been going on for over a year and, of course, has been boosted in recent times by the advent of the counselling centre.</PARA>
<PARA> We see the major thrust of our treatment facilities for Vietnam veterans as centering on the counselling centres in each of the States with the object of focusing attention on the problems of Vietnam veterans, and by that means gaining experience and building up expertise in the treatment of Vietnam veterans and in such a way utilising the other facilities available within our Department and the community generally to assist Vietnam veterans in overcoming their problems. In that sense, I believe that Australia is doing a significant amount to help veterans. One cannot speak of what is happening in the United States of America without having a full brief on the matter, but it is clear that the Australian Government is meeting its responsibilities in this regard.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the Youth Services Scheme, the Family Support Services Scheme was a pilot project undertaken by the Commonwealth and the State governments in concert after, I think, discussions between my predecessor and relevant State Ministers. The original scheme was to be a three-year scheme. It was a pilot scheme. It was an entry by the Commonwealth into an area primarily of State responsibility and general welfare. It was a new initiative for the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Scheme was entered into by the Commonwealth under its Children's Services Program. The scheme actually commenced on a number of different dates in different States. So whilst there was a three-year pilot scheme, unlike the Youth Services Scheme, it was not neatly contained within a defined three-year period. As a result, the pilot stage of the various schemes concluded at quite different times. For example, Victoria finished its three years a full year ahead of any other State because it was that State Government, I think, which took the initiatives in this area. A decision was taken to fund the Family Support Scheme through to December of last year and that the scheme would then be extended and Commonwealth participation extended beyond the pilot phase for a further three years. In accordance with the election commitment, a further amount of $10m was committed and divided among the States. I do not have the precise figures before me; they may be somewhere in my brief but I would rather seek them and give a supplementary answer to the question at a later stage.</PARA>
<PARA> The point in respect of Victoria and, indeed, in respect of any State is that there are, of course, the States' own programs in this area. Essentially, the Commonwealth is involved in a form of supplementary activity. In the case of Victoria, the Victorian State Government announced, I think late last year or early this year, a substantial program of its own in the family support area. I think this was a $3m program. This is an amount considerably in excess of the program we are supporting under the Family Support Services Scheme. Any examination of Commonwealth funding in this area is merely an examination of a contribution towards a much wider system of welfare services.</PARA>
<PARA> I think there is a serious question to be addressed over the further three-year period that we have committed ourselves to in this program as to whether it is helpful to programs such as the family support movement that we have two governments involved in this area rather than one. I do not say that to predict a Commonwealth withdrawal from the field but I simply advise the Senate that this is an area in which there will be discussions between the Commonwealth and States because we have some administrative untidiness in having an area basically of State responsibility with the Commonwealth contributing to just a part of the activities. I think that gives rise to some confusion as to where funding responsibilities lie and as to where citizens should address their petitions and complaints when they see inadequacies in this area or want to see services extended.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the actual extension of the scheme is concerned, the scheme certainly has been extended in a very literal sense. The original Commonwealth commitment was to a pilot phase of three years. We funded well beyond that pilot phase and have now committed ourselves to a contribution in this area for a further period of three years, the contribution being the figure mentioned at election time, namely, $10m.</PARA>

<PARA>That is precisely what has been said. The article continues and draws attention to and comments upon the fact that the Australian Democrats are proposing to kill the legislation in the Senate. The fact of the matter is that the world has been in recession. The world, therefore, in coming out of its recession, with massive unemployment in western Europe, is now forcing its wage rates down. Australia was one of the best performers in the Organisation for Economic Co- operation and Development in the last five or six years but unless we can contain our wage rates and our strikes now we are in danger of being forced out of world markets. Unfortunately, there is a huge number of strikes. What a tragedy that a question should have been asked in this House this morning relating to psychiatric institutions in New South Wales which are so incapable of being managed by the New South Wales Government that there is a suggestion that it will have to get in the Army to administer these institutions. Approximately half the strikes in Australia have been centred on a Labor- governed New South Wales.

<PARA>They then went on to say that they had finally given up and they went on to admit that they had not yet seen the proposed Queensland Bill, but they were not going to wait; they were going to make a judgment. Senator Ryan is obviously of the same mind. She wants to judge what Queensland will do before it has been announced. I do not know in detail what Queensland will do. All we have to go on is a Press statement from the Queensland Government following a Cabinet meeting. What we are after is the best possible result for Aboriginal people in Queensland and the best possible deal. At this stage the details of the deal are not completely known.

Having said that, I do not anticipate that there would be particularly large changes in the direction of the program, rather that there should be a shaping of it to ensure that those social objectives are met within the limits of available funds.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The program guidelines for 1982 for the Commonwealth Schools Commission basically form a document of detail of various programs, such as special education, English as a second language, multicultural education and ethnic schools, which are detailed for the coming year. I address my remarks, however, not to those detailed programs but to some items in the introduction which give a basis upon which the programs are proposed and give some indication of the methods of funding. I draw the Senate's attention to paragraph 1.2 which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided that, from the beginning of 1982, the current retrospective adjustments for price-level changes will be replaced by a prospective allowance for price movements. In making this change, the previous arrangements for cost adjustment have been converted in their entirety to a prospective basis. </PARA>
<PARA>The problem that we have with this concerns the price movements that are currently able to be made. It is not possible, I believe, for State governments or for non-government school authorities to make those types of predictions closely enough so that their budgets, which in some cases, of course, are quite small, will not be thrown out of kilter quite dramatically. I call the Senate's attention to a similar provision which operates in relation to higher education. It was not possible, I believe, at the time when the Government made this decision to abolish the retrospective adjustments to know the outcome of the work value case that was currently taking place in relation to academics. The fact that that work value case was as successful as it was placed tertiary institutions in an extraordinary situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in response to that, was forced to make a retrospective adjustment. Although that retrospective adjustment did not cover all aspects of the costs which would have flowed to tertiary institutions, it covered the vast bulk of them. We believe that the retrospective adjustment is a much fairer and more equitable manner of funding such institutions. Under the current arrangements that are carried out according to section 1.2 of the report-I am thinking particularly of small schools systems-those institutions will be asked to make economic judgments that the Government itself has been unable to make. They will be asked to be accurate in predictions of future price movements that the Government and the Treasury have already admitted publicly they have been unable to make. I believe it is putting an intolerable burden on many of these school systems and independent schools to expect the accountant or, in many cases the principal who does the accounting, to have that level of expertise and capacity to make those types of predictions accurately. It seems to me that it is a retrogressive type of move that the Government has undertaken, obviously as an intended economic measure which will make its predictions of expenditure much better. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, the Government now will be able to predict quite accurately in relation to schools and tertiary institutions the amounts that they will spend. Unfortunately, it has moved the onus of proof, as it were, the onus of prediction, on to schools and tertiary institutions. I believe that this particular move in relation to schools which I am looking at in this report will eventually have to be abolished and that we will have to return to retrospective adjustments. I believe that we cannot ask school systems to carry that type of burden and to be so finely accurate in their economic predictions and in drawing up their own budgets. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me to the second point that I wish to raise. In paragraph 1.4 of the introduction to the report in which the Government has requested the Commonwealth Schools Commission to look at the accountability of non-government schools it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission has begun these consultations and will be proposing revised accountability arrangements, subject to Ministerial endorsement, during 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>The point I wish to raise-and I hope that the Commission will take note-is that those consultations will be as wide as possible and will be not only with non- government schools but also with government school organisations, particularly the Australian Teachers Federation and the Australian Council of State School Organisations. I believe that consultation in these areas may help us to alleviate somewhat the tension that has grown up between these schooling systems in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it has been one of the most lamentable aspects of recent educational policy that we have again managed to spark off a debate in relation to the level of funding between government and non-government schools. We were, I believe, arriving at a point in Australia of fairly general consensus on the part of all organisations about the relative levels of funding and of the relationship between those two very important systems of schooling in Australia. That has been seriously disrupted. It has been broken in many States to the point where those organisations are no longer in consultation. I believe that that has been one of the worst aspects of educational policy that has been pursued by the Government in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Commission will not add to that serious tension which is already in evidence. I hope it will seek wide consultations, not only with non- government school organisations, but also with government school organisations with a view to arranging an organisation which is acceptable to all those who are engaged in the education of children in schools. I believe to recover that lost ground and to once again have those various organisations co-operating and working together for the benefit of all children in Australia ought to be a prime objective of the Government's intention in relation to schools. The last point I wish to raise relates to non-government schools referred to in paragraph 2.4. I note that there has been a philosophical shift in terms of the way the Government intends, in future, to fund. This has not been made public, to my knowledge, elsewhere. I cannot find any reference to any public statements by the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) or to publications in which this item has been explicated in this type of detail. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that it states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government provides general recurrent grants to non-government schools on the basis of two principles: a basic per capita grant to each non- government school and additional per capita grants to schools in need. The basic grant is 20 per cent of the Standard Cost. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that is an important aspect and an important element of the Government 's thinking that really ought to have been highlighted elsewhere than in a document entitled 'Program Guidelines'. I hope that at some stage we may have the opportunity of a more detailed debate on the philosophical basis for the granting of funds to non-government schools. As I say, it is an area in which unfortunately for the whole of the schooling system in Australia there has been a great deal of acrimony and of disagreement in the Australian community. I believe that anybody looking at the Australian schooling system must accept that we will always have an important non-government school area in operation in Australia. We have the largest non-government school sector of any democracy in the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The case for prospective supplementation is linked with the case for accountability in tertiary and secondary education institutions. In the distant past when tertiary institutions had incomes, for which they were directly responsible for accumulating, there was a very real accountability in those institutions for the use of funds. In any consideration of wage cases or the effects of inflation on costs in various areas of spending in tertiary and other educational institutions, the responsible executives of that institution would very responsibly and very accountably take account of the disadvantage if those cost increases became excessive. However, as time went by, the taxpayer, through the Commonwealth Government, has become the main provider of finances for education in Australia. Private benefactions and fee income have become almost negligible. In this event there was cost supplementation in the annual grants to educational bodies by the Commonwealth Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Now, what developed in the last 10 or 15 years was that whatever increase in cost arose for those institutions the taxpayer had to pick up the tab. The executive officers of institutions did not have any direct accountability or need to exercise restraint in the determination of those cost increases. With the new way of proceeding by way of prospective supplementation there is no longer a calculation of cost increases after the event so that extra moneys can be made available to make up for that. Rather a prescription is made of expected inflationary factors that there may be in costs and prospective payments are made to account for them. That is done, as Senator Macklin described it, by way of the Commonwealth making an estimate. But once that prospective supplementation has been made institutions receiving those moneys know exactly the amount of money that will be available in the calendar year for the operation of their institutions. Knowing that exactly, they are in a position to be entirely responsible and accountable for the best use of those resources. </PARA>
<PARA> If they are able to argue, whether in work value cases before salary tribunals or in other areas of expenditure that have inflationary effects, the priorities as they see them for the spending of money they can influence the cost increases . To the extent that they can do that, there may be an increase in costs that is less than the prospective supplementation that the Commonwealth Government has made available. In the event that estimates lead to increases arising from inflation which are in excess of the prospective supplementation, that can be eased because, as the money is available from the beginning of a year, earnings through short term investment would be available to those institutions which to some extent would advantage them. I believe it is appropriate for the Parliament to expect of the Commonwealth Government that there be this transference to institutions of direct accountability. For that reason, I believe it is the responsibility of the Parliament to see the reasons for prospective supplementation rather than retrospective supplementation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding to the Commonwealth Schools Commission program guidelines I will also take into account what has been said by those who have spoken previously. It seems to me that the Australian education system suffers from a lack of competition or very unequal competition. It absorbs about 8 per cent of the Federal Budget and about 30 per cent of the State Budgets. During the past decade the education share of gross domestic product has risen from about 4 per cent to about 6 per cent. I think there are very many people who doubt that this greatly increased expenditure has led to any improvement in educational achievement. Those parents who send their children to church or secular private schools pay about twice for their child's education-once through the taxes which they contribute to a school system they do not use and again when they pay school fees. I know that there is a continuing classical argument to the effect that people ought to use the things provided by government and that they have no excuse if they do not. I think we have gone beyond that stage of argument. I think we can safely bury it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many of those people who choose a private education for their children are relatively poor. Many poorer families are locked into a particular government school, irrespective of their perception of its quality, through their inability to pay fees or by the school catchment areas. It seems to me that governments should ensure that every child of compulsory school age has access to an education that meets established standards. However, it is not necessary or desirable that governments should own and run all of the schools. Compulsory free education that does not restrict choice can be achieved either by paying all the institutions-government and private-equal per capita grants for the pupils they attract or by giving parents vouchers for a specified value of education. Children with special disabilities should qualify for a special subsidy in a manner similar to the presently paid isolated children's grant. </PARA>
<PARA> Primary and secondary level education is the responsibility of State governments rather than the Commonwealth. The States receive education grants from the Commonwealth under section 96 of the Constitution which enables the Commonwealth to make grants to the States on such terms and conditions as it chooses. The bulk of education funding is derived from State government general revenue. In any rationalisation of Commonwealth-State functions funding of primary and secondary education is likely to become entirely a State responsibility. Any policy changes to make the school system more equitable and more efficient must then be made by State governments. So long as the Commonwealth continues to fund, schooling grants should be made in such a way as to redress the imbalance in the funding of government and non-government school children. In fact, to some extent this is happening already. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only guess at the full consequences of removing present discrimination against children educated at non-government schools. Realistically, we could expect that initially taxpayers would be called upon to find additional moneys to pay the full cost of educating the 20 per cent of children not in the government school system. The children will move to those schools which provide better education and this will include some net shift from the public to the private system. In time competition will encourage the cost effectiveness which appears to have been deficient over the past 10 years. Most important, under the stimulus of competition educational standards will rise. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I will comment on the tertiary level. It seems to me that equity should be achieved simply by charging fees to those who receive tertiary education benefits so that no one is denied education that he or she is capable of handling. It seems to me that a system of student loans should be instituted, recoverable from earnings later in life. In the event of a graduate or drop-out not earning income that exceeds a designated threshold the cost of education could then be borne by other taxpayers. These seem to me to be quite reasonable responses to the program guidelines issued by the Commonwealth Schools Commission. I hope that the Government will take note, certainly of some of the things in the Schools Commission report, but from an egotistical point of view, I hope the Government takes note more of what I have had to say this morning. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate takes note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>Under paragraph 11 of the Airlines Agreement Act 1972 the airlines operating under that agreement are required to report to Parliament annually on their activities and the means by which the Parliament's decisions are put into effect in respect of the Government airline and the private airline. One can only say on the basis of the evidence that is before us that Trans Australia Airlines-the public authority-has carried that injunction out to the spirit of the letter and in accordance with the requirements of the Act. The Trans Australia Airlines report sets forth all of the activities of that organisation; the rise and fall in the level of traffic and cargo; the people and funds employed and all of the subsidiary activities of the publicly owned airline. In that sense the report is a satisfactory one. It is in accordance with the requirements of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the report from Ansett Transport Industries Ltd is a four-page typewritten document which just sets out the financial situation of that organisation with a very short covering letter by the directors. That really is a very inadequate report from the private sector airline-which always claims to be more efficient and more able to present its case to the Australian public- than the report in respect of the Government-owned airline. I have to concede in respect of the profitability of Ansett, the report shows a better financial situation than that faced by Trans Australia Airlines. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that, as a result of the philosophical attitude taken by this Government and as a result of the decisions announced but not put into effect by this Government in respect of TAA, there is a great deal of instability and lack of confidence in the organisation itself. There is a lack of morale in the organisation because it has hanging over its head the question of what is going to happen to it. Of course, that completely destabilises the organisation when it knows full well that the Government has plans in mind which will or could dramatically and drastically alter the processes of and the way in which it operates. Therefore, there is a need for the Government to make up its mind to resolve the indecision which is so much a feature of this Government in the last six months or twelve months. </PARA>
<PARA> We have only to look at the legislative program to see that it lacks any substance and content and that if it were not for the Opposition, the Parliament would almost grind to a halt. We have this unusual and unsatisfactory position where the Government has made certain statements of intent and not carried them into effect. As we know, if a definite decision were made, we could anticipate that the Australian people, the House of Representatives and certainly the Senate would have strong opposition to the sale of that very important instrumentality known as TAA. We have now a sword over the head of the organisation and this may well be one of the reasons why the report does not measure up as a success story even though in fact it gives us a great deal of information about the activities of Trans Australia Airlines. The report does say that there has been a 64.7 per cent drop in the profitability of the publicly-owned airline in preceding years. I charge that the reason for that is substantially the discriminatory policies and attitudes adopted by this Government to Trans Australia Airlines. The report indicates that the adoption of so many of the recommendations of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares has been, to a very large extent, an influence in the problems that TAA faces. I refer to that section of the report which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The new fare structure which the two major domestic airlines were directed to apply following the Holcroft Inquiry increased fares on short haul routes to levels unacceptable to the public. The cheaper long haul fares have not produced any growth in passenger traffic and short haul routes have been affected adversely. </PARA>
<PARA>The report refers to the Canberra-Sydney route, where traffic has been lost to surface transport and to another decision that has been taken by this Government -in direct contradiction of the spirit of the two-airlines agreement-when last year it provided for an additional special service to operate on the Canberra- Sydney route. I am sure that every member of parliament who has to travel on the airlines would agree that there has been a deterioration in service as a result of these changes arising from the Holcroft inquiry. There have been delays and cancellations of services and an unsatisfactory state of affairs has been created as a result of these changes. This report from our publicly-owned airline-no reference has been made at all to these factors by Ansett-states that a principal factor in these developments has been those changes made by the Executive Government as a result of the Holcroft inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not a satisfactory state of affairs when government decisions are taken and we are not in a position to do anything other than to note the comment by the Government airline which draws attention to the fact that those decisions have been an influence affecting the previous year's profitability. The TAA report similarly shows that, as a result of the Government's petroleum levy an extra $16m is being collected from TAA each year. This, of course, indicates that the profit and loss proposals in the accounting processes of TAA must be affected by the very large increase of extra revenue collected arising out of Budget considerations by the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the positive things in the report indicate that in the last year patronage of package holiday trips, which has been an innovative and very important subsidiary activity introduced by TAA, increased by 14 per cent with a similar increase in the mail being carried by TAA. If the management of TAA were released from the restraint which Mr Hunt and Mr Fraser have placed on it, I am sure that we would have a much more satisfactory picture to examine in respect of TAA's profitability. We know that the downturn in overseas and domestic air traffic is a world phenomena but that is all the more reason why the Government should have a positive policy, not a discriminatory policy, as far as TAA is concerned. We note also that, whilst a minor increase is shown in TAA's labour force in the period under review the organisation recently has taken the unusual step-a regrettable step in my judgment and in my party's judgment-of reducing staff to the tune of some 350 members. I am led to believe-of course it is not referred to in the report because the report only goes up to 31 December 1981- that 160 members of staff have already been retrenched and another 90 members either have been given leave without pay or have taken long service leave. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I will be brief as I believe a number of other senators wish to speak to a number of other reports. I was reasonably pleased to read the statement made by the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) on this matter, and to find that there have been a number of changes in trends, in the formulating of policy , and that direct Commonwealth funding for research and development has been increased from $620m in 1978-79 with a projected increase to $940m in 1981-82. That 10 per cent increase is very worth while and will benefit not only science and technology but also industry generally throughout Australia and will have ramifications for the future of industry in this country. The Minister said in this statement that these increases would include those concerned with energy research funding directed towards manufacturing objects, mining, health and agriculture. In reading this statement my attention was drawn to the point that was made by the Minister in relation to mining. It seems to me that in some ways the Minister has given away his responsibility in that area. The Minister said fairly clearly, in relation to a mine to be developed at the Redbank Plains near Ipswich in Queensland, that an environmental impact study was not required but that the conditions laid down by the Queensland Government would meet the requirements of the environment of that area. If we are to have an increase in expenditure, particularly in the area of mining, as has been stated in the report, it appears as though the Minister has given away his responsibility by saying that there is no need for an impact study on this mine in Queensland. I question the way in which the Minister has clearly negated his responsibility in the area of mining in relation to his portfolio. </PARA>

<PARA>This report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, so called, is revealing in that it confirms a number of things which Opposition spokesmen have been saying for some time about the effects, the size and the growth of the tax avoidance industry in Australia. I draw the Senate's attention to some important points in that report which are revealed in the Commissioner's comments. It is an interim report. It is an appalling document because it exposes with clarity the way in which this Government has condoned the growth of the tax avoidance industry in Australia. I just refer the Senate--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not a partnership between the unions and the tax avoidance industry; it is big white collar criminals using small criminals to serve their purposes in white collar crime. That is what it is about. Senator Baume's Government is protecting the big white collar criminals. I would not interject too much about it if I were him. We all know why that happens. Let us look at the mealy mouthed statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his State of the Nation address on this important issue of tax avoidance, which goes to the fabric of this society. All he had to say in that enormous address called the State of the Nation, which was in fact about the state of Malcolm Fraser, was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the area of tax avoidance, determined measures have been consistently applied . . . which are really biting into this anti-social industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how he could say that if he looked at the reports of the Commissioner of Taxation. This anti-social industry to which he referred now has 22,500 recognised operators as compared with some 900 in 1975 when his Government came into office. I am surprised that Senator Baume should raise this matter by way of interjection. What Professor Russell Mathews, the chairman of the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations, had to say about this Government in January was simply that if the Government devoted as much attention to collecting revenue as it did to so-called cost cutting exercises, the whole country would be better off and there would be no need to resort to higher taxation in Australia. That is an indictment of this Government from one of its most favoured sons of earlier years. I say that the Opposition's comments about this issue have fallen for too long on deaf ears. Let us look at what the Royal Commissioner says about the tax avoidance industry. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> This industry has developed . . . over the last five years, at a rate . . . in excess of any other industry and has brought with it profits comparable only to the heady days of the Victorian goldrush. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Costigan, the Commissioner, is saying that this is the major growth industry under the Fraser Government. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Sir Phillip Lynch, ought to look at that matter because if that is an industry which falls within his portfolio it is a pretty shocking state. The Royal Commissioner goes on to say that the social security and workers compensation frauds uncovered during the inquiry fall into insignificance compared with the tax avoidance industry, which is the subject of this report. I remind Senator Baume that that is what the Royal Commissioner said about the matter. He lists four specific cases which he says involve the non-payment of tax in excess of $2m. This is a matter to which the Opposition has drawn attention for a number of years. It is an area of activity which highlights starkly the way in which inequalities have flourished under this Government since it came to office. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me indicate something of the size of the industry by referring, as I did briefly earlier, to the reports of the Commissioner of Taxation. He identified 22,360 people as being connected with tax avoidance schemes in 1980-81, involving a loss to revenue of nearly $1,000m. The number of tax avoiders known in Australia is now 26 times higher than when the present Prime Minister came to office. The amount that the Government is losing has been rocketing year by year as the average gain by tax avoiders has increased from approximately $37,000 in 1978 to $43,500 last year. That was an enormous increase of 2,600 per cent in the extent of tax avoidance in Australia. The Prime Minister said in his so- called State of the Nation address that the Government is closing off loopholes, but the Government has done nothing about providing fully retrospective legislation in respect of tax avoidance and it has done nothing about increasing the level of applicability of criminal law. More importantly still, the Government has done little to improve the efficiency of the investigation section of the Australian Taxation Office which, according to the Royal Commissioner's report, is chronically undermanned. That involves an immense loss to revenue. The fact that this sort of industry can continue to flourish makes an enormous rent in the fabric of society. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time at the moment to talk of the details which are dealt with by the Commissioner of Taxation but I wish to say a couple of things about the nature of a royal commission of this kind and the suggestions which the Commissioner has made about the way in which his Royal Commission could be assisted by prompt Government action. As he points out in his report, the Government has known about the so-called Slutzkin taxation avoidance schemes for some 18 months and there is still all too little being done about them. He suggests that the terms of reference of the Commission could be changed to allow the Commission to take advantage of access to taxing information. The Opposition shares that view. The Government, I take it, is deliberating on that question which, of course, is a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA> One instance to which the Royal Commissioner draws attention is the failure of the Taxation Office to attend a hearing of the Royal Commission of which it was previously notified and in which certain people in Melbourne, the Gianarelli brothers, were being examined about concealed bank accounts. The Taxation Commissioner was not at that hearing. The morning after evidence was given to the Royal Commission one of those brothers took $250,000 in cash out of his bank account. That is not a small sum when it comes to this sort of thing. Such an instance necessitates or indicates very clearly the need for prompt and firm Government action on this issue. The Commissioner needs the quick assistance of this Government to enable him to have access to information about individuals and the amount of tax that they are paying. Of course, it is always said that this is a dangerous precedent. It is not half as dangerous as the damage which is being done to this country by the continuance and growth of this industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to say one other thing. It relates to the circumstances of the publication of this interim report. The Prime Minister foolishly got himself involved in this issue in the House of Representatives. The Australian Labor Party, federally and in Victoria, has made it quite clear that action should be taken as a result of the recommendations of this Royal Commission and of one other royal commission. I refer at the moment only to this Royal Commission. The Leader of the Opposition in Victoria has made the position quite clear as far as the Labor Government, which will be elected on 3 April, is concerned; that is, that he is not in the business of repudiating agreements relating to the establishment of royal commissions. On the day this interim report was published he announced on behalf of the Opposition in Victoria that prosecution should proceed immediately as a result of the recommendations and the findings made by the Commissioner to date and that if criminal charges had to be laid they ought to be laid straight away. I put that on the record because it is of the utmost importance that prompt, decisive action be taken by governments at both State and federal levels in an effort to deal with problems arising from this report which are of such fundamental concern to the state of the nation in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very, very selective. Indeed, Senator Button's whole speech indicated that the poor painters and dockers were avoiding tax only because they were so heavily taxed that they had no option. The idea is absolutely ridiculous . The open abuse the Commissioner spoke of was also social security fraud. Senator Button did not mention social security fraud at all yet the Commissioner said that the material already available to him indicated very large numbers of painters and dockers being involved in imposition on the social security system. Such imposition involves the receipt of social security benefits while workers, under false names, are either in receipt of workers compensation benefits or are working in other employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He then went on to refer to the tremendous abuse in the area of workers compensation, another area which Senator Button very clearly and very deliberately avoided. The Commissioner went on to talk about the tax avoidance presently being undertaken by this union, and he elaborated in that area. He indicated how difficult it is for these people, because of their reputation for violence, to be brought to justice. I believe that is an indictment of the very radical unionism of that group. </PARA>
<PARA> It appalls me that the Opposition should read an interim report condemning the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union and refer to one area alone, an area which it claims is this Government's fault. The criminal element referred to by the Commissioner was never mentioned by Senator Button. It is really typical of the Australian Labor Party and the way in which it tries to cover up every criminal element within the radical unions. It does no service to the union movement as a whole by this type of action. The majority of union members are responsible, law abiding citizens. The fact that the Labor Party deliberately indulges in this type of action and deliberately covers up the criminal element within some of these radical unions is a gross disservice to the union movement within Australia. It appalls me that it should continually do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner referred to the fact that, even though the Australian Taxation Office had been given prior notice, its officers did not turn up. The Commissioner said that the Taxation Commissioner was concerned for the physical safety of the staff of the Taxation Office and therefore he did not send them along. So they missed out on some of the extremely large amounts of money that the Taxation Office had been deprived of. I return to the emphasis that I would like the Australian public to understand. Let us have a look at the debate that Senator Button, the Leader of the Opposition, has put up in relation to this interim report. The Labor Party picked one section of the interim report and talked about tax avoidance. It blames this Government which has done more than the Opposition ever did when in government, even though we had the Curran scheme . The Opposition, when it was in government, pointed out that hundreds of thousands of dollars were being avoided by the Curran Scheme. Did it do anything about it at all?</PARA>

The Labor Party, when it was in government, acknowledged this tremendous tax avoidance area and did not do anything about it. It had to rely on the fact that the Liberal Government , when it came into power fixed the Curran scheme for the Australian people and indeed has continually fixed all the tax avoidance problems as they have popped up. I should have thought that the Labor Party would have set about making some sort of criticism of radical unionism.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to speak in this debate but I think we have to re-emphasise two or three points. Firstly, 95 per cent of the report is on tax avoidance. Therefore, Senator Button, in the time limit of 10 minutes, was quite correct to spend his time on that matter. To repeat the circumstances of what will happen to this report: Any State Labor government is pleased to act on it. I think that refutes Senator Walters's point. We are not interested in attacking any particular union. The point that has come out of this report that Senator Walters does not like is that the Government set up the inquiry and hoped for only one result out of it. The moment a second result came out that criticised the Government she tried to set up a diversionary tactic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that this Government should release the tax records to the police so that they can properly investigate the matter and release them to the Royal Commission on the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. Then we would get somewhere on issues such as tax avoidance and drug running in this country. There is no use putting up a diversionary attack and saying that we are not interested in prosecuting. We have given an undertaking that we will prosecute in any criminal involvement. The Government is dragging its feet.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a ridiculously short time available to debate a purchase of this magnitude-$478m, on the Government's own very optimistic estimates and $1,000m plus on our own-but in the 10 minutes available to me I want to try to give 10 reasons why the Invincible is a bad buy. Those reasons fall into three main categories. They are to do with strategic considerations, with the weaknesses in the ship and, thirdly, with the questions of finance and the cost effectiveness of the purchase. What I will be saying will be a prelude to a motion to be moved by my colleague Senator Sibraa in a few minutes time seeking authority from the Senate to refer this matter to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence for further and much closer scrutiny than it has received in the parliamentary process so far. </PARA>
<PARA> The first reason the Invincible is a bad buy is that it conflicts with the Department of Defence's own assessment of the nation's strategic priorities as contained in the Defence Force Capability Paper, 1981, which emerged into the public light via the Australian last weekend. That paper makes it plain that there is simply no primary requirement for anti-submarine warfare equipment of this kind. Although that was the main justification advanced by Admiral Synnott and, more particularly, by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) in justifying this purchase, the highest strategic priority for Australia at the moment is, according to the Department's own paper, air defence and the surveillance of our northern approaches. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation here is that the anti-submarine requirement has been met to some extent by other means. For example, Orion patrols, submarine patrols and sonar buoys, the upgrading of air and naval bases in the Northern Territory and Western Australia should, if that is our basic strategic priority, have higher priority than this purchase, as should fast corvette-class patrol boats. The carrier simply does not provide a quick reaction to attack situations in the north and north-west, as it could take up to five days to get there if it is not in dock, as it must be every four and a half years. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason is that the carrier is simply not needed to protect our seaborne trade. Only a super-power could effectively cut off our sea trade. No other powers have the number of submarines necessary in that respect. Any power attempting to cut off our trade in that respect would also have to be prepared to commit aggression against ships from many other countries since the overwhelming majority of our trade is carried in foreign bottoms. Again, other faster or, for one reason or another, more flexible equipment, such as submarines, destroyers, helicopters and mine hunting vessels, could, it has been argued in all sorts of sources and places, guard more economically our ports and our stricture points, as it were, for Australian shipping. </PARA>
<PARA> The third reason is that, while it is true that the carrier will fit in well enough with a United States naval effort, albeit as a relatively minor contribution, it will tie up a very large proportion of the Navy's vessels in a task force if the carrier is to have any protection or extended capability at all. Indeed, it is evident that, on any view of what the size of such a task force would need to be, between a quarter and a third of our entire Navy would be tied up in one location in this respect. An attack on a number of different parts of Australia simultaneously would make rather good sense to an attacker under these circumstances since it would stretch our naval resources in very obvious ways. The carrier, with its own task force, would become a hindrance to effective reaction in those situations. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, even in a task force situation the Invincible is, itself, undoubtedly vulnerable. Senator MacGibbon, among others, has made himself very clear. It has , in his public pronouncement, no close in air defence weapons system. Its area air defence missile system-the Sea Dart-may not be fully interoperable with the Melbourne's old radar systems and may, it seems, have to be replaced. There is the further point in this respect that its radar interrogation equipment and air navigation equipment have a limited range of about, I understand, 100 nautical miles, yet air and sea launched missiles can attack from well beyond that range. The Sea King radars are designed to find submarines and, with a radius of about 40 nautical miles, would not increase the carrier's horizon significantly in that respect. The carrier obviously will have to operate with DDG coverage and extension to give it any kind of extensive horizon. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth point-going further to the question of the carrier's weakness looked at just by itself-is that the range of the carrier is clearly less than what the Navy has said over and over again it wants; namely, something like 10,000 nautical miles. The precise figure as to the range of the carrier is unclear, but the Government has quoted its unimproved range as 7,000 miles while the bible of naval shipping in this respect, Jane's Fighting Ships, and other published sources put it as rather close to 5,000 nautical miles. Whatever the true figure is, it is obviously substantially less than what the Navy has articulated as its own requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixthly, the data link developed in the carrier cannot be used with the first three FFGs at least-those that are already commissioned or in the pipeline at the moment-since these vessels had their data link facilities removed, it will be recalled, as a cost cutting measure. For all those reasons there is vulnerability and weakness in the ship looked at itself. The final group of objections involves questions of finance. </PARA>
<PARA> The seventh point I make is that the costs associated with this purchase have undoubtedly been significantly underestimated. Just the bare bones have been presented in this ministerial statement. If one leaves aside entirely the cost of the short take-off and vertical landing Harriers-the decision in respect of it then has been postponed, but the Navy is clearly banking on getting them, as retailed at length in this week's Bulletin, and they will add at least another $ 100m to this project-the Navy's political presentation of this matter has made clear that the radar interrogation equipment and the aircraft navigation equipment are to be cannibalised from the Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sea Dart area air defence missile system may also be removed. These systems , however, will need replacement-the Sea Dart possibly very soon; the radars at least when, if ever, fixed aircraft are provided. There is also the extra costs associated with modifying the ramp in the case of fixed wing aircraft ultimately coming aboard. The Sea King helicopters have a high attrition rate. It seems pretty clear that the eight helicopters that have been estimated by the Minister for Defence are simply not enough to create a workable operational environment. Many other points could be made in this respect. They are the kinds of points which justify our assertions that very much more than this expenditure announced by the Government of $478m is, in fact, involved in this purchase. </PARA>
<PARA> The eighth point I make is that, whatever the precise final figures turn out to be, the order of magnitude involved in this purchase represents one which is simply not cost effective to the extent that it is directed to meeting strategic threats, such as major attacks on our sea trade, which have, on the Defence Department's own assessment, a very low probability. Ninthly, the expenditure will unquestionably impose quite extraordinary strains on present defence budgets which are already under very severe strain from the recent pay rises and the cost escalation of a number of present equipment purchases. The Defence Force has already been issued with directives cutting training time and overtime and ordering the payment on various goods that have been delivered to be strung out for as long as possible. There has already been a slippage of up to two years in the purchase of a number of necessary items of equipment, such as 105 mm artillery and mine hunting vessels. It looks as if this is likely to get worse. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there are very real doubts as to whether this Government, possibly any other government, can meet the targeted overall defence procurement expenditure in the future if this purchase proceeds. It is clear that the Government will not meet its present targeted figure of 3 per cent of gross national product on defence, of which 25 per cent of that, in turn, is to be on capital expenditure. That is clear in the present environment. If one takes into account, in addition , the fact that all the projects presently on board are over budget, adding to that the carrier situation, it will clearly be impossible without a massive strain on Budgets of the future to support a purchase of this magnitude. The obvious need is for more flexible equipment rather than a major one-off big ticket cost number of this kind. </PARA>

<PARA> That all words after 'that' be omitted and the following substituted in place thereof:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Senate refer to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence as a matter of urgency the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The relevance of an aircraft carrier to Australia's current and perceived strategic environment;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The role of an aircraft carrier in the Defence Force structure of Australia ;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The effects of the purchase of an aircraft carrier on the future defence procurement program;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Committee be requested to report not later than 1 September 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not my intention to prolong the debate today. We have a time problem if we are to get a decision on this matter. It is certainly not my intention to argue the merits or demerits of the aircraft carrier. I do not intend to go into any of the technical aspects of why we should or should not purchase the aircraft carrier. We have had excellent speeches on the reasons why this should not be done by Senator Evans this morning and by Senator MacGibbon when he spoke for some time in a debate quite recently in the Senate. His speech should be read by all honourable senators before they vote on the amendments that I have just moved. I have moved the amendment for a number of reasons but I will give an example for each of the three points I have made. The Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) in his statement said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no single scenario or contingency for which this ship is being acquired. </PARA>
<PARA>We of the Opposition find that to be an extraordinary statement and, as a result of the statement by the Minister, we have moved that we should inquire into the relevance of an aircraft carrier to Australia's current and perceived strategic environment. There has been no explanation at all as to how the aircraft carrier will fit into our Defence Force structure. That is why we have included paragraph (b) in this amendment. If, as an example, we take the purchase of the F18 aircraft, I think we are entitled to ask: What is its role? It is a carrier aircraft and apparently it cannot use the Invincible. That could certainly be inquired into under item (b) of the amendment. Item (c) calls for an inquiry into the effects of an aircraft carrier on the future defence procurement program. I believe the Government has already given an undertaking that it will investigate that reference. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence at the moment already has a Sub-committee on Defence. Its current reference is 'Australian Defence Force Structure'. This Sub-committee has put out a number of reports. It has acted in a bipartisan manner. All of its reports have been unanimous; there have been no dissenting reports. The Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Sub- committee will be able to look at the whole matter of the purchase of the aircraft carrier in a very calm and efficient way. It will have the guidance of experts. Its members will be able to cross-examine experts and to acquire much more knowledge than we would be able to acquire here in any debate, no matter how long it goes on in this place. For those reasons I support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans has stated at some length on behalf of the Australian Labor Party the many arguments that have been put forward by many areas of the community, including the Australian Democrats, in recent weeks against the purchase of the aircraft carrier. These arguments have been posed, I think, in many ways as questions. The thing that concerns the Australian Democrats more than anything else is that there have not been adequate replies. In other words, in response to detailed questions asking for information, both the Royal Australian Navy and the Government have tended to come back with vague, blurry statements which do not really answer the specific points of criticism. It is not the role of the Senate in our view to set itself up as the decision maker in the purchase of major defence materiel-far from it; let me make that clear. But it is very plain to the Australian Democrats that in this proposed purchase of HMS Invincible there is a major need for further investigation of the whole issue by the appropriate committee. It is clear to us that it is the role of the Senate, if the other place does not do so, to see that that happens with some urgency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I briefly mention two points that worry the Australian Democrats about this purchase which we would like to see investigated more fully by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. One is this basic question of the vulnerability of Invincible. What will happen to her in time of war? That seems to us to be the key issue. What would happen to this ship if she were at sea in war time-possibly as a single ship, not heavily escorted at best- and was subjected to a determined missile assault from a large number of missiles either from the sea or from the air? I have asked a number of questions on this matter. I have had no replies to questions such as: Would this not mean that the ship would be sunk? People have talked to us about the Phalanx missile system. Everybody who has studied this knows that the quick-firing Phalanx would stop one or two missiles but would not stop missiles fired in salvos. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1980 I asked the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) and hence, presumably, the whole expertise available to the Department of Defence, if there were any defensive system in the world that could prevent some missiles arriving at their target if they were fired in salvos. As I said, the single word answer to that was no. I think this poses some very interesting implications for Invincible if she goes to sea in time of war. Possibly there are answers. If so, let us have those answers. We have not received them so far. We ought to have them. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I raise concerns the huge cost-well over a billion dollars-of this project. Again we have never had a final costing given to us by the Government of what this would cost Australia once Invincible were armed adequately with aircraft-I stress the word 'adequately'. This huge cost would limit the ability of the nation to buy more modern, effective and cost-effective weapons systems, such as fast, lightly-manned missile attack ships and small, high-speed vessels which are nonetheless excellent missile launching platforms. Of course, they are being used by virtually every navy in the world, including some of our closest neighbours, for that purpose. Why have we given this aircraft carrier project priority? For those reasons, among others, the Democrats will support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some worries about this program. I do not see the issue of buying HMS Invincible in black and white terms. I think one can make cases for its purchase. My worries stem from the inherent risks that come from the very limited operational role of this ship. I have been seeking reassurances on these points as carefully as I can for quite some while. At the outset I make it very clear that I am not against the concept of a full- scale aircraft carrier for the Royal Australian Navy if the case can be made that it can defend itself, as I said in a speech a couple of weeks ago. The power of that type of ship is considerably greater than the type of ship we are talking about in the Invincible. It does have the means through an airborne wing to range out to the launch platforms for missiles which are the major threat to a ship of this nature. I think that until these worries are resolved we are risking the security of the nation in a way that I personally am not prepared to accept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am reassured by the statement that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made last week that there will not be any short take-off and vertical landing aircraft bought for this ship. Those aircraft, as I pointed out in some detail, are operationally useless. They are not fighters. They have limited strike ability. They do not have reconnaissance capabilities. They have no ASW and AEW capacity. As a consequence of that, if we are not going to have any fixed wing aircraft, then the Navy is morally bound immediately to close down HMAS Nowra and get rid of all the assets it has in fixed wing aircraft-the A4s, the Trackers, the HS748s, the Macchis-all the fixed wing aircraft that it has. There is no longer an operational role for them with the retirement of HMAS Melbourne. That would go some way towards meeting the great costs that are involved in this program. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a little concerned with the public dissembling about the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation exercises and the way the ship was appropriate in that role. Goodness me, of course the ship was successful in NATO exercises. That is what it was designed for. It is a purpose-designed ship, built for a specific role. There are all these stories and pictures of Sea Harriers being photographed beside Russian MR aircraft. The aircraft flew over the ship. Even a slow aircraft like a Sea Harrier could formate upon them. That does not prove their operational role at all. I am worried about the way the Navy at its senior officer level-I differentiate between its senior level and the middle range of officers, some of whom are particularly competent-does not appreciate the vulnerability of large capital ships in a missile age. This is the reason the British Navy is selling the Invincible. It knows that it cannot live in big ships on the surface of the water. The British Navy cannot say in public: 'Look, we are going to sell the Invincible because it is too vulnerable'. The British Navy would never get sailors to go to sea in the rest of its ships. It has to be a little quiet about this. There are enormous risks here. These risks, as Senator Mason has said, have not been resolved to the satisfaction of this Parliament. If those risks cannot be coped with, one presumes that if we are involved in a war situation here we will have that war at a much lower technological level. Frankly, as a technologist, I do not believe that. </PARA>
<PARA> We have worries about the selection process, the way it was rushed through. We went through a process that lasted 13 years with the new tactical fighter. At every stage the position could be justified by the Government and by the Services. In this case we had a great rush to get things through. Life cycle costs and operational needs were not developed as fully as they should have been . People all over Canberra are talking about the closeness of the Defence Force Development Committee decision and the closeness of the Cabinet decision. Those two points in themselves do not mean necessarily that it was a bad decision but they do mean that there were powerful arguments against the purchase. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had reference to the matter of cost. The cost is very worrying because this is an unplanned purchase. We all know the difficulties that the Department of Defence is in at the present time. It means very probably that the Navy will not get the other essential things that it needs. It means that the Army will not get the things that it needs. It means that the Royal Australian Air Force will not get what it needs. I am very worried that we might see as a consequence of this some cut in the number of people in the Services. The Service that is likely to be cut, of course, is the Army. I do not think we can get away with a smaller number of Army personnel than we have at the present time. Of course, this would fit in with Navy philosophy. The Navy always states at public seminars: 'Well, we don't need an Army in Australia because if you need an Army it means that you have been invaded and you have lost the war.' It just so happens that historically in this century we have needed an Army more than any other Service-in World War I, World War II, Vietnam, Korea. It has always been the Army that has been the major Australian component in the Services. So the Navy's argument is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The biggest risk of all, I think, relates to the fact that the Invincible is an alien ship and that ship is supplied from Great Britain. When we went to war in Vietnam the British Government cut off military supplies to Australia. I cannot conceive that one can say for 20 years that this ship with its hundreds of thousands of components-short life components that need full scale spares backing-will be guaranteed supply in the future by a British government about whose political nature we simply have no idea. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Labor Party makes no apologies for again bringing before the Parliament the critical situation in the home building industry as a consequence of the Government's economic policies. We have done this time and time again in recent years only to have the Government defend the indefensible and to have the Government say that there is no problem in the industry and that market forces have to be left to sort out the difficulties facing an ever increasing number of the Australian people. Despite the Government's position, I think it has surely to be accepted that the housing crisis and housing problems become front page news in practically every newspaper in the country in more recent times. The problems of interest rates, the problems of increased rent and the problems facing young people anxious to obtain accommodation are clearly manifesting themselves and need to be accepted and understood by the Australian Parliament. But, of course, the Government still maintains its obstinate and obdurate position that it will not take the necessary steps to ease the crisis that exists in the Australian housing industry. For example, last Wednesday the Treasurer (Mr Howard) sought to play down any talk of a crisis in the housing sector. I will quote what he had to say :</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We don't in my view have a situation which merits the description of crisis. That is a grossly exaggerated way of describing it. </PARA>
<PARA>Just two days later Mr Howard followed up that outrageous statement with a suggestion that interest rates were not a problem for home buyers, but that the real trouble was with house prices. That just shows, of course, how out of touch our Treasurer and our Government are. There have appeared recently in a number of newspapers very interesting articles by journalists concerning themselves with the question of housing. I refer to only one of those articles which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald at the end of February. In part, it stated :</PARA>
<PARA> The problem of housing finance in Australia is not-as the Fraser Government suggests-to make more money available for housing. It is to make the money that is available sufficient to cover the cost of buying a home, and to make it affordable for most people. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Government still pointedly refuses to accept that fact. We do not deny that home prices are a problem, especially for the first home buyer, but we believe that the other problem, interest rates, is the matter with which we should be concerned. The Opposition takes issue with the Treasurer and the anti- social Government headed by Mr Fraser on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe-and I state it firmly on behalf of the Australian Labor Party-that there is a crisis in the provision of housing for the Australian people. We make no bones about it. There is in the housing sector a crisis of the proportions of the crises in unemployment and health care. We can quote so many eminent people in the housing industry. The Housing Industry Association, the Master Builders Association of Australia, and the Australian Council of Social Service have said that, as have the numerous building societies in our country. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the people of Australia perceive the current situation in housing as a crisis and that the coming elections in Victoria and Lowe will show the contempt they feel for Liberal mismanagement of the housing crisis. I remind the Senate that Mr Kennett, the Victorian Housing Minister, was very vocal about that matter following the last Budget which confirmed a 72 per cent cut in real terms for public housing since 1974-75. Last evening, Mr Thompson, the Premier battling to hold his rein in the State of Victoria, promised to make $60m available for home ownership in that State. If Mr Kennett was correct in his criticism and Mr Thompson was correct in his, why have they not been able to persuade the Australian Government to come to the aid of the States in respect of building houses? The fact is, of course, that at this late hour, as an election gimmick, Mr Thompson is now making promises.</PARA>
<PARA> If there is not a crisis, how does the Treasurer explain away figures of the following dimensions? Welfare agencies estimate the number of homeless people in Australia conservatively at 200,000; that is, 200,000 people living out on the streets, sleeping in Brotherhood bins or squatting in unused houses, and many others living in substandard accommodation such as caravan parks and the like. Rental accommodation across Australia is becoming harder and more expensive to get according to the Real Estate Institute of Australia. According to that Institute's figures, there has been a massive tightening in the rental market in every capital city. It is estimated that a vacancy rate of at least 4 per cent is needed to maintain a flow of rental accommodation, yet in Sydney, for example , the current figure is only 1.8 per cent vacant of total rental space. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an increasing cost of housing finance and a decreasing amount of money available for mortgage loans from banks, building societies and finance companies. Bank interest rates, for example, were about 5 per cent in 1968. In 1975, they had risen to about 9 per cent, for which the Labor Government was criticised by this Government. They now range from 11.5 per cent to 13.5 per cent and are obviously scheduled to go even higher. Building society rates have seen a similar surge from around 10.5 per cent in 1975 to about 15 per cent in 1981. In the last 12 months alone interest rates on bank and building society loans for housing have risen by some 2 per cent-an increase of about $50 a month on the average home loan repayment. Not only has finance for home purchases become more expensive; it has also become scarcer. </PARA>
<PARA> Funds for housing available from traditional sources are drying up, a trend reflected in the decline in new dwellings being built. Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics recently reflect this trend-that high interest rates combined with low loan approvals force a downturn in the housing construction industry. The number of loan approvals for new dwellings has fallen by over 4,000 in the past year. That is a drop of 17.3 per cent in approvals in just 12 months. Yet the Government says: There is no crisis; there is no problem . Recent reports in the Australian Financial Review suggest that the slump in housing construction for the December quarter was the worst ever recorded by the Cordells survey group. The Government often trumpets the fact that Australia has the highest rate of home ownership in the world, but we all know now that that rate has fallen from something like 74 per cent to 71 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> How can the Treasurer and the Government of which he is a part explain away these stark realities of the housing sector in any other terms than a crisis? Yet he does, and he ignores the high and rising interest rates, blaming everything else but the Government's own lack of economic understanding. The flow of funds away from housing and the dramatic cutbacks in Commonwealth funds for housing are at the crux of the problem with which we are concerned. The Treasurer also ignores the claim of the Real Estate Institute which has in recent days called the situation a crisis in no uncertain terms. We surely have to recognise that the downturn and the stagnation in housing are a direct result of the Government's economic policies. Housing has been deliberately downgraded, and suggested as such by the Department of the Treasury, to make room for private sector investment-often foreign investment and largely resource-based investment. Housing is the victim of the Liberal-National Country Party thesis that the public sector must be cut back to avoid the so-called 'crowding out'-to use their term-of the private sector. This is central to the Fraser Government's economic policy and Australians in need of housing are the victims. The fact that this economic policy is failing, that capital inflow has not occurred at the rate expected and that resource development is not as rapid as anticipated and boasted about has not led the Government to change tack. </PARA>
<PARA> The State of the Nation speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) showed that he has not learnt a thing and that he has no real basic concern for this problem. It showed the determination of this Government to press on doggedly, blindly and dogmatically regardless of who is hurt. In the past few weeks as the housing crisis has come to a head and as the elections loom, some State spokesmen and the Federal Minister for Housing and Construction, Mr McVeigh, have grasped at straws as they hope that by coming up with some gimmick or ad hoc scheme they will solve the crisis and convert it into solid short term political capital in the meantime. Interest tax deductibility, interest rate subsidies, granny bonds for pensioner investors and the revitalisation of the now-discredited Homes Savings Grants Scheme have been mentioned as palliatives to solve this problem. This sideshow approach, egged on by sensational reporting in some newspapers is, unfortunately, not the way to deal with the problem at all. </PARA>
<PARA> There may be some merit in some of these schemes and we do not dismiss them, but they cannot be just tugged out of the hat and put to work with the expectation that they will solve the crisis. It is more fundamental than that. Mr Fraser's departmental advisers have suggested this and yet Mr Fraser refuses to change his approach. He persists with a search for election tricks to save the doomed Thompson Government in Victoria by trying to suggest that this problem is on its agenda. Back in September and October last year Mr Fraser said that the Government would persist with its policies even though it was recognised that there were problems in the housing sector. If gone about in a piecemeal, ad hoc way, some of these proposals may run counter to the development of a suitable and equitable housing plan. The effect of solutions, such as tax deductibility and interest subsidy schemes could, if used indiscriminately, cost the average taxpayer in foregone revenue and effectively benefit only those at the top end of the market. There would be a negative redistribution of resources away from broadly beneficial and productive areas of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators have to accept that the growing importance of the private and public rental market needs to be addressed. The current financial squeeze is having a dramatic effect in this sector of housing. Firstly, interest rate increases are encouraging private landlords to increase rents in order to maintain high returns on their investments. Secondly, as other forms of investment become more attractive, decreased investment in the housing market will result in a further decline in the supply of private rental housing. The growing shortage of rental housing leaves tenants fair game for increasing rents . It is particularly bad in my State of New South Wales. Recent predictions of an expected private rent rise of 20 per cent this year in Melbourne will probably confirm the same sort of trend as is occurring currently in New South Wales. In the public sector already facing strain as a result of the 72 per cent cutback in Commonwealth funds since 1975, rents will be forced up. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to look at the regional issue as well. The Prime Minister has sought to palm off responsibility to the States and score cheap political points by claiming that the cost of housing is higher in New South Wales and that this is the fault of the Wran Government. In fact, it is a situation closely linked to a long process of development in New South Wales. This development is continuing as last Thursday's Australian Financial Review pointed out. It stressed the continuing building and property boom in the coal-rich Hunter Valley. The Reverend Mike Nelson, chaplain at the Newcastle Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd steelworks, explained the social effects of this development on the Australian Broadcasting Commission radio in October last year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the rental situation is out of hand and home building costs in the Valley have gone up 55, 60 per cent in the 12 months and home buying although it appears to have plateaued at the moment, has plateaued at a level where the normal sort of person in the Valley can't get into the market . . . for a three bedroomed house in Maitland, you're looking at between $80,000 and $100,000. Twelve months a go you were looking at perhaps $50,000 or a little less for a weatherboard. Now that's getting pretty close to 100 per cent escalation in many cases. Really we just don't have the economic capacity to cope with that, it's pitched at a particular segment of the population and the rest miss out. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we need to consider the economic impact of the current squeeze. In an economy where loan approvals for housing are falling, building approvals are falling, and Commonwealth funds are drying up, there can be no growth in employment or wealth. Yet, if funds were directed into the housing sector, working on the Bureau of Industry multipliers, they could be put to use creating jobs and wealth as well as providing socially needed housing. Surely, no one would argue that the housing industry is one that has a multiplier effect. None of the gimmicks and tricks dreamt up by Mr McVeigh or the Prime Minister's statement, vague as they are, confront these problems. Neither does Mr Howard's obsession with de-regulating interest rates which would just let loose chaos into an already weakened market so that people would pay still more and more for housing loans. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal and National Country parties, of course, have shown in debates in the past, and as debates continue, that they have no worthy solutions. They do not know what to do, so some of them act like Mandrake and try to conjure up new potions and formulas while others completely wash their hands of the whole sticky business leaving the free market forces to have their day. On that basis we know that there will be more casualties among the young people in our country who seek better and adequate accommodation. What is needed is a planned and co- ordinated approach to the general problem of housing that will address the social crisis caused by the current shortage and slot the housing sector into an overall approach to the economy that seeks to stimulate production, consumption and employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a housing policy would take some time to prepare and carry out. It would not be pulled out of the hat merely at the scent of an election, but would be planned at least along the following lines. Firstly, in the public sector arena of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement there needs to be a real stimulus. The Australian Labor Party pledges support in that area. Secondly, there needs to be a program of genuine assistance to the first home buyer. The Labor Party pledges its support for that concept. It needs to be one that would help the buyer jump the deposit gap between home prices and home finance available. The program needs to direct its funds to the needy, not the well-off home buyer. Thirdly, we need a policy of interest rate controls which ensure that those living in and paying off their home do not face massive repayment problems. Fourthly, we need to ensure an adequate and stable flow of funds at an affordable price in the private housing sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor is working towards these programs. We will be presenting, at the appropriate time, a revitalised housing policy that will seek to address itself to and redress the problems facing the average citizen in our country who requires accommodation. It will be a policy that will help to house Australians, encourage broad-based growth in the Australian economy, provide stability and employment in the housing industry and begin to meet the social and economic needs of our country. Mr Fraser's policy, the lack of policy, the Minister for Housing and Construction and the Government's lack of policies, all pay no more than lip service to this problem. They do not provide solutions which are fundamental to growth and development of a decent housing sector in our country. This Government stands indicted for its failure to accept its responsibility as a national government, as a government which claims to represent all of the people, and as a government that should accept its responsibilities to provide leadership to the private sector and leadership to the States so that each can play its role in providing decent accommodation at an affordable price to the majority of citizens who still want to become home owners in our country. We make no apologies for again raising this matter. </PARA>

I can assure him that honourable senators on the Government side welcome the opportunity to discuss again this Government's housing policies in order to point out clearly the success of those policies over the last few years and to demonstrate our concern for those in this community who are in the greatest need. Senator Gietzelt in his earlier words made what seemed to me to be some very curious statements. One statement clearly related to his total misunderstanding of the way the Australian free market economy operates. It was not a deliberate dissembling of that information, even if he did properly understand it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One can only assume from those opening words that he was just going ahead with the same old politicking that we have heard in this place for some time. All he sought to do was to scare the wits out of people who might be contemplating the purchase of homes, without demonstrating any proper concern and without telling us what those Australian Labor Party policies are which will suddenly solve the problem. An election will be held this Saturday in the Federal electorate of Lowe in Sydney, but it is noticeable that not even that will provoke the Opposition to state clearly what its housing policies are. Perhaps we can return to that point a little later. All we hear from honourable senators opposite is unadulterated, sheer, deliberate politicking and we hear no suggestions of any kind about the solutions to the problems which really face this nation.

<PARA> On many occasions he has sought to cover this up with a concern for those who are in rental housing situations. Naturally governments, particularly governments of our complexion, have concern for this matter. Some difficulties are clearly arising in rental market areas throughout Australia. What is Senator Gietzelt's solution? What do we hear? We hear a plea for more government controls, more government finance and more government borrowings which lead to higher interest rates, more inflation and higher prices for real estate, as demonstrated during the Labor Party's period of office from 1972-75. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from that, what is this Government's past record on that matter? To take the most recent example, let us look at the Budget of August 1981. There we can see quite clearly that the total amount of money being made available for those in the greatest need in the housing area is $666m this financial year. That figure represents an increase of 18.9 per cent over the figure for the previous year. That shows clearly this Government's concern for those who are in the greatest need and, of course, it is totally consistent with the policies of delivering care to those who are in that need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before discussing interest rates, and just to set Senator Childs' mind at rest perhaps we should discuss some of the real issues behind the housing situation in Australia. For instance, the number of buildings expected to be commenced this year-1981-82-totals 138,000. That does not compare too badly with what has happened over recent years. In fact, it compares reasonably favourably with the figure for the previous year of just under 150, 000 buildings. It is the highest number of building commencements-with the exception of 1976-77-for some eight or nine years. That clearly demonstrates that this Government's policies towards housing have not diminished in any way and that, in fact, the policies implemented since we came to office in 1975 have worked very successfully. Those figures clearly demonstrate the resilience of the industry and its ability to move with the needs in the market and the demands placed upon it by the market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the number of loans approved for dwellings during last year-I will come back to this later-has increased by 1.5 per cent to 109,917. Quite apart from the very real and solid facts which demonstrate the success of this Government's housing policies, there is the general question of the degree of private home ownership in Australia. Clearly, that figure remains at about the 70 per cent level to which it has risen in successive years since 1947. There has been no demonstrable decline in the rate of private home ownership. The Opposition would have us believe that there has been some dramatic collapse and that suddenly everybody has been thrown onto the streets or has to live in tents . I think Senator Haines has used that very phrase in this place. Of course, that is not true. The degree of private home ownership in Australia-something for which this Government stands strongly-is being maintained at its high level of around 70 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will come to that in just a moment and perhaps we will be able to set the honourable senator's mind at rest, if he is prepared to listen. With regard to the general growth of the economy, which is the factor underlying all housing policies, there is clear evidence that the growth is continuing in this economy at rates above those of our international competitors. Clearly, there is growing income availability for those on average weekly earnings as measured by that number. In fact, in the last year we have seen a rise in real average weekly earnings of 5 per cent. This clearly rates far and away above the increased amounts which people may have to be meeting for increased mortgage payments by way of interest increases over the last 12 months. But a deeper point is involved and Senator Childs mentioned it. While we are talking about those people on average weekly earnings, the fact is that there are some people who earn below that. They, being in the more needy category may need special assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proof of this Government's concern-I reiterate it for Senator Gietzelt's interest-has clearly been demonstrated by the commitment to increase the total amount of welfare funds available in the last Budget by some 18.9 per cent. It is clear that we are aiming our policies at helping those who are in the greatest need. Those factors, combined with the general economic policies, are leading to satisfactory home ownership in this country and will continue to do so in the years ahead. The fact is that in the six months ending in September 1981 gross domestic product increased at the annual rate of 3 per cent and private business growth, fixed investment, expanded strongly at the rate of 22.2 per cent in the same period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Non-dwelling construction investment increased by 31 1/2 per cent over that period. The value of private non-residential approvals rose by nearly one- quarter compared with the growth in the same period of 1980-81. Does this evidence a decline in the level of economic activity as stated by Senator Gietzelt? Is this what is perhaps leading to a decline in home ownership in this country? Of course not. Those sorts of figures demonstrate that this country is committed to economic growth and will provide for greater home ownership while we maintain the kinds of policies that have been so successful in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, most significantly real disposable income has increased by 3.2 per cent over the six months to the end of September. This again evidences the ability of people in the community to meet their commitments and to increase their standard of living. No doubt every honourable senator is concerned in the short run for those people who might find it difficult to meet their repayment from current earnings. All of us know perhaps of situations where individual families may have had that kind of problem. Of course, the Government has made its position and its views on such matters clear to the banks and to other lending institutions. It has asked the banks to take note of that and to ensure there is an increasing flow of funds into the hands of borrowers so this will improve their ability to make repayments. Of course, the increased flexibility of banks to look at alternative financing arrangements is fundamental to that point. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite apart from the fact that there is a degree of concern in the community and certainly within the Government about these matters, loans approved by trading and savings banks have increased in recent times, particularly in December. Lending by permanent building societies recovered in December and January to reach the level of early 1981. Total lending by banks and building societies was significantly up in the month of December. The combined figures for number and value of loans approved by banks and permanent building societies rose respectively by 6 per cent and 5.3 per cent to 16,838 approvals and $462m in loans during that period. If we compare that with even more recent figures, we notice that in the last three months to the end of January building society approvals in fact improved by some 7.8 per cent. Apart from that aspect the building societies in their recent bulletin have indicated to us that the amount of funds flowing into them is rapidly increasing. Their liquidity positions are improving; consequently they have more funds available for lending. </PARA>
<PARA> Does that not clearly demonstrate the success of this Government's policy in managing the money supply and ensuring a flow of funds into the traditional building finance areas, particularly building societies? These are the areas where money traditionally has been available at rates cheaper than those from other institutions. Clearly the Government's policies are bearing fruit. We can see in the months to come opportunities for increased building society loans which can enhance the opportunities for people to buy their own homes and to take part in the great Australian dream. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that in contrast with this, there are some policies mentioned by some spokesmen of the Opposition. I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Lionel Bowen, said on television on Tuesday night that one of the things he would like to do is to subsidise those who are lending money to borrowers for houses. Presumably what he means is that money will be paid by the taxpayer to lenders of money in order for them to reduce the rate of interest charged to borrowers. If anything smacks of political opportunism and a misunderstanding of the way the free market operates, it must be that kind of statement. Clearly, as I have just demonstrated, the sorts of policies relating to interest rates followed by this Government for the last year or two-as shown by figures-have led to increased moneys becoming available to the permanent building societies. More moneys will be flowing into the community in future. These are the ways in which the Government is succeeding in housing. Obviously its policies are working in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt refused to address himself to one other issue, the significance of which he tended to denigrate totally. This matter concerns the increased cost of housing, particularly in Sydney. He claims that the Treasurer, Mr Howard, said that this difficulty in the market is, of course, only a very minor part of the problem and that really the whole problem rests with interest rates. I ask honourable senators to tell people who live out in the western suburbs of Sydney and who pay $25,000 and $30,000 for a block of land whether that is the key issue. Let us hear about the person who has to pay $80,000 for a house in Sydney compared with the person in Adelaide who pays $40,000 or less and see whether that is a relevant issue. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the factors affecting this situation, it is pretty easy to analyse where Senator Gietzelt's real interests lie. We all know of some of his connections. The fact is that we hear of increases for trade unionists working in the building area which will significantly boost the cost of housing in the next few months. We know of a $29 a week increase for tradesmen which will be followed in July by a further $14. All this is capped off by a reduction in the working week from 40 hours to 38 hours. That clearly demonstrates the increasing cost pressures in this industry. That, coming on top of other matters which obviously will drive the cost of housing higher, means that more and more finance will be required in order to get the average person into a suitable home . Those are key factors. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are talking about an increase in the total cost of housing-as demonstrated by these statistics I have just cited-flowing on from wage increases in the future into the building supplies area, this may indicate a rate of inflation which might be in the order of, let us say, 10 per cent or 12 per cent. Now, for the average person trying to buy or build a home in Sydney, a 10 per cent or 12 per cent increase in the cost of a home of $80,000 adds up to a further cost of around $10,000. How does that compare with the very puny amounts of money that might be required to finance or to service each year a loan of say, $30,000 with increased payments of, let us say, 2 per cent arising from interest increases which amount to some $600 a year? We have an increase of $10,000 by way of inflation and an increase of perhaps $600 arising by way of increased interest rates. I ask Senator Gietzelt to tell me the real matters about which the people of this country are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that we need to control inflation. This Government's policies are designed to that end. It is with success that we can point to the record of the last six years where inflation has been brought down from the Labor Government's high of 1975 to very respectable figures-on international standards-of today. It is those figures which are really showing the success of this Government's policies. This is why there are as many people in private housing today as there have been in the last four years or five years. This number is continuing to grow in absolute terms and that is why this Government's policies are succeeding . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps one of the most perplexing issues when we are talking about housing the Australian population is that this Government really cannot even make up its mind whether there is a crisis in the housing industry. The Minister representing the Minister for Housing and Construction (Senator Messner) has not helped the predicament one little bit. He has chosen to turn a blind eye to a very real problem in the Australian community. As one of my honourable colleagues said: 'If ignorance is bliss, he must be a very happy man'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the last few days we have seen a conglomerate of the most extraordinary statements being made by Ministers such as the statement made by the Treasurer ( Mr Howard) who said that he did not think there was a crisis. One would have expected that if any one should know the direct result of this Government's monetarist policies it should have been the Treasurer but he said that he did not think there was a crisis. He was followed fairly promptly by his Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who said that he thought there just might be a crisis. Then, of course, there was a quite categorical statement from the Real Estate Institute of Australia which ulitimately made this Government realise that there was indeed a crisis but, of course, that was tempered on Friday of last week when the Treasurer made the following statement: 'Interest rates are not really the problem for home buyers. The real trouble is with house prices'. I wonder how he applies interest rates to house prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact remains that this Government just did not know whether there was a crisis. It still does not know whether there is a crisis. I suggest that the people know that there is a crisis. One has only to look at some of the petitions that have been presented in this place by my colleague, Senator Giles, from Western Australia, petitions signed by 42,000 people which is almost a record for petitions presented in this place. Forty-two thousand people signed petitions to the effect that they were feeling the crunch of this Government's monetarist policies in relation to housing. I think it is important to point out that that 42,000 represents something like 6 per cent of the voting population of the State of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I direct most of my remarks in this debate to the situation which applies directly to Western Australia. The Minister spoke about the politicking on this side of the House. I question what he would call the politicking of the Premier of Western Australia because the State Government in Western Australia has condemned the Federal Government over its policies, if one can say that it has a policy on housing. If there are any doubting Thomases in this chamber I refer them to a lovely little book published by the Liberal Premier entitled: 'The Fight for Fairness. Western Australia's Case for a Square Deal for Housing', dated January 1982. Of course, one of the reasons why this booklet was published by the new Premier was that he could not bear the odium of being a Liberal Premier when the Liberal Commonwealth Government was doing such terrible things to the people in this State. He felt that, as housing was the most important issue, he should bring out this publication. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote some of the things contained in this delightful document. In the introduction, for instance, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> The State Government has prepared this booklet to set out the facts in its struggle with the Federal Government over housing policies. </PARA>
<PARA> We are concerned to show that home buyers, people seeking low-cost housing and the building industry are all suffering because of the Commonwealth's failure to take action to relieve the present situation. </PARA>
<PARA>The State Government knew that there was a crisis. Only the Federal Government did not know that there was a crisis. As I have said, on the one hand we have the Federal Liberal Government stating that it does not think that there is a crisis, or perhaps agreeing that there is a sort of a crisis but that it has nothing to do with housing or with interest rates; it is the cost of houses that are creating the problem. On the other hand we have the State Liberal Government stating quite categorically that the Commonwealth has failed to take action to relieve the present situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian Premier, Mr O'Connor, continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The State Government is very concerned about the effect of increasing interest rates on the home purchasing public and the building industry. </PARA>
<PARA>It recognises that there is a relationship between high interest rates and house prices but the Federal Government or the Treasurer does not. Mr O'Connor continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The rapid escalation in interest rates is hurting home buyers in Western Australia more than in the other States. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to give his reasons for that statement. They are:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . building societies are much stronger in this State and have provided the bulk of funds for home purchases. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, a greater proportion of people in Perth are buying their homes, as compared with the other State capitals. </PARA>
<PARA>Those honourable senators who listened to the radio this morning might have heard the Victorian Premier, Mr Thompson, claiming that there are more people in Victoria endeavouring to buy their own homes. I do not think that is an argument in which we need to involve ourselves. That is something for the two Liberal Premiers of Western Australia and Victoria to argue about. It is interesting that both of them right now-particularly Mr Thompson coming up for an election in April-have suddenly discovered that they have to do something about the housing crisis that has developed in their States. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr O'Connor goes on to say in this booklet:</PARA>
<PARA> Housing is an important industry in any community. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely no Government member would deny the truth of that statement. He states further:</PARA>
<PARA>Good housing is a fundamental requirement for a vigorous and stable society. As well as providing the basis for family life, a house still remains one of the best forms of investment. </PARA>
<PARA> For many years, Western Australia has had one of the best housed communities in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> With some 416,000 households for our population of 1,265,000-one dwelling for every 3 people-about 70 per cent of all Western Australians live in their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA> We aim to maintain these high standards. </PARA>
<PARA> The State Government has introduced initiatives to help attack the problem, but we cannot do it alone. </PARA>
<PARA> We need community support to change the Commonwealth's housing policies so that Western Australians get a square deal. </PARA>
<PARA>I have said before that the Commonwealth does not appear to have a housing policy which will enable people in all States to be able to afford to purchase their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested in the Minister's statement about welfare housing in his contribution to this debate because Mr O'Connor has very kindly placed some very interesting information before the people, not only of Western Australia but also, because of this debate, before the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at page 9 of this booklet, under the heading 'Payments to Western Australia for Housing 1977-78 to 1981-82', we find that these payments have dropped by $13.5m. </PARA>

<PARA>This is in black and white and I am quite happy not only to have the whole booklet tabled but also to incorporate it if that is the wish of the Minister and he can then argue this matter out with Mr O'Connor. I assure the Minister-I repeat-that he says:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister said that he did not believe that home ownership was falling. He said that we had no actual figures that we could place before this chamber or before the Government to indicate that this was so. In my State of Western Australia-I did say that I would be relating most of my speech to the situation that applies there-any number of people already have their homes on the market. There is very little value in saying that we do not hear of these people losing their homes because most people, recognising that that situation will develop, actually get rid of their homes before it develops but then find that they have a deficit that they have to pay off either to a building society or to a bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr O'Connor claimed that Commonwealth funds for welfare housing are down 50 per cent in real terms in the past five years and that this has resulted in an increased waiting list for State Housing Commission houses and has saddled State governments with the crippling burden of such schemes as rebated rentals. In the document that he has put out he stated that 6,000 people are on State Housing Commission waiting lists. Here I take issue with him. In part of this documentation he acknowledges that an amount for Aboriginal housing has been included in one figure but he makes no acknowledgment whatsoever whether, included in that 6,000, are those people of Aboriginal descent who are on the waiting list. I doubt that is so. The number of people who are on the State Housing Commission list in Western Australia, which is presently 6,000, would be considerably higher if the Aboriginal people were also considered. But Mr O' Connor says that the building industry is suffering. I understood the Minister to say a little while ago that the building industry was suffering because of these terrible people who wanted extra wages. Of course, they want extra wages because they have to pay these extra interest rates. They have to make these extra payments each and every month so that they can maintain their family home. Mr O'Connor, on the other hand, says that the Indicative Planning Council has made the following forecast:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that commencements--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, commencement of home buildings-</PARA>
<PARA>will fall by 10-12 per cent in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an incredible statement to come from the Indicative Planning Council. I will repeat it:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that commencements will fall by 10-12 per cent in this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>The second reason he gives is the Commonwealth sales tax on building materials. I think there has been quite enough debate in this place on sales tax of all sorts. Let me just say that the people cannot afford any additional payments. They cannot afford to keep their families housed. I am not by any means denying the fact that incomes have increased over the last five years. I would be the first to admit it, but basically because the Government does not have a proper housing policy and because it has done nothing to curb rising interest rates State governments have had to apply additional costs in other areas. For instance, the service costs in Western Australia are astronomical. I cite my own case. Ten years ago my average electricity bill each three months was $38. At the moment, my average electricity bill under the Liberal State Government in Western Australia each two months is $90. I have not increased the members of my family unit or anything else but I still have to find the money to make that payment. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that I am trying to make to this Government is that unless it does something comprehensive about interest rates and rising prices, including sales tax on building materials, it will apply more and more pressure to the people who can least afford it. Of course, people will find that extra $700 that the 2 1/2 per cent interest rate increase means to their $30,000 mortgage. Of course they will, but they will go without something else just to maintain their house over their family's heads. It is just not good enough for the Government to say that there is not a crisis in the housing industry because of interest rates but because house prices are high. If it cannot see the relativity between interest rates and house prices then, as I said earlier, it is turning a blind eye to a matter of great concern to the majority of Australia people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In case there is any doubt about it, of course there is a problem in the housing industry. I do not think that any of us would endeavour to indicate that there is not. What is needed, however, is some discussion on the nature and extent of and the responsibility for the problem, if that is going to help. These matters seem to be open for a certain amount of discussion. Before we start discussing the allegation that the Commonwealth is responsible for all the problems in the housing industry it should be remembered that the Commonwealth Government does not provide 95 per cent of housing in Australia, in fact it provides 5 per cent. Therefore the whole context of this debate is out of kilter. The availability, cost and everything to do with housing are matters for all three levels of government. The matter of public importance submitted by Senator Gietzelt states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The critical situation in the home building industry as a consequence of the Government's economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA>Really, the word 'the' should not appear in that sentence and it should read:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . of government economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA>Government economic policies at all levels have a very severe influence on housing in general. I will deal with the levels of government one at a time. We will start with local government. Let us look at its performance in this area. How does local government get on in regard to its development and administration of the various regulations and approvals, the servicing, the facilities, the standards, the zonings and those sorts of things for which local government has the sole prerogative? What effect have local government decisions and requirements had on the cost of land and housing? Have local governments made every effort to eliminate the many unreasonable costs that were outlined in the report of the housing costs inquiry of two or three years ago? To the best of my knowledge virtually no action of any sort has been taken even though the report was directed in the many areas in which action could be taken. What about local government approvals? What about local government regulations concerning the standards of building and so on? Nothing has been done about those matters- nothing towards an improvement. Everywhere I go I find that the complaint against local government is that it is taking longer, it is costing more in interest, the standards are higher and the requirements that subdividers and developers are required to meet are higher. Funnily enough, all these things make housing more difficult and more expensive to obtain. I think we can fairly ask: How has local government helped in relation to the housing problem?</PARA>
<PARA> I will deal with the States next. In 1978 we produced a new Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement and, in 1981, further amendments were made to it. Every one of those amendments was designed to assist the States, to see that money went into newer areas, and that the States were given more flexibility and better opportunities to get the best possible value for their money. Have they done so? I do not think they have. How have the States got on with their zoning procedures, which constitute one of the big detriments to housing? Let us take New South Wales. Do honourable senators think that operations have improved in Sydney as a result of the zoning procedures there? I do not think so. Do honourable senators think that the States have a uniform attitude towards home ownership or towards providing relief from some of the costs that go with home ownership for first home buyers? Some do and some do not. Are the States more generously funding the terminating building societies, which are undoubtedly the most efficient users of money in the whole of the housing finance scheme? How much co-operation comes from the States towards the funding of aged persons homes and things of that sort? Have the States gone into competition on the open market for money? We can bet they have. Have they offered high rates, higher than housing interest rates? We can bet they have. In fact, we can ask whether it was housing money that they went out to gather. Of course it was. The States have reaped a lot of the money that would have gone into housing had they not extended their borrowings into these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall make one or two brief comments concerning some of the States. Some months ago-in 1980-the Victorian Housing Minister brought down the Green Paper, a volume of some significance, a copy of which I have before me. That document was widely applauded when it was brought down. The fact that now much of what is in the paper has been converted into action is also to be applauded. There have been times when my remarks have perhaps not been quite coincidental with the sorts of remarks that have been passed by the Victorian Minister, but I have now to congratulate him on having provided for so many of these worthwhile proposals in the election Budget. I think it has demonstrated that Victoria, like any other State, can now see its own priorities. This is the best thing about the system that we have set up. The States are getting more and more opportunities to determine their own priorities. I do not blame the States if they do not place housing high on their list. That is up to them. I think that if we give them the money they should be able to waste it on whatever they like. If they want to waste it in other areas and not spend it on housing I do not mind, providing that they do not come back to us and expect us to foot the bill for their shortfalls. </PARA>
<PARA> Each State has different requirements. Even in the housing area some see their requirements as being different. At present there is quite a wide variety of conditions existing between various States. For instance, in Victoria the market has started to pick up a little; in Queensland it is going along fairly buoyantly; in Western Australia it is doing quite well; in South Australia it looks as though it has turned the corner; in Tasmania, regrettably, it has not; and in New South Wales it seems to be on a decline. That is the way it is as the moment. In New South Wales the problem is one of land and services. The appalling job done in providing adequate supplies of land for a very buoyant market is the one reason New South Wales prices are way beyond the realm of the average home buyer. The middle income buyer has very little chance in New South Wales through totally inadequate planning. A shortage has been engineered which keeps the price terribly high. Until such time as that is changed there will be no relief for home buyers there. </PARA>
<PARA> I give full marks for the availability of land in South Australia and now for allowing the private sector to merchandise it in the manner it does. Housing is getting across to the people at a reasonable price and it looks as though there is an adequate supply for years to come. Western Australia was referred to. I would certainly be the first to concede that that State has done the best job of all the States in the use of housing money in the last few years. The construction sector is going along reasonably well. The waiting lists for government assistance are very low and proportionately are the lowest in Australia, directly as a result of that State's excellent policies. I feel very sorry for Mr O'Connor because the States that have done very little to assist the welfare group have unfortunately weighed against Western Australia. I believe that because Western Australia has done such a good job it should not be penalised, but it has been. </PARA>

We have had more assistance and have done less with it than any other State. I find that most regrettable. What has the Federal Government done? I am sure Senator Gietzelt would want to know. I think we have to refer back a bit. The first thing this Government did of any great consequence was to demolish that ridiculous housing corporation. It was a futile and inoperable creature. Having got rid of that we were then able to start to analyse what we were trying to do in order to turn people into home owners again and to make them independent. This Government has produced good and sensible legislation providing far more autonomy to the States and has encouraged a vast range of new programs for them to work on. In some cases they have worked on them and in some cases they have not. The Government's policies have gone a long way to producing a much more stable economic climate which has put inflation under reasonable control and has allowed people to know what will happen in the future as far as prices are concerned. The Government has produced a higher level of real incomes from the time it has been in government and this year it will provide another $75m for homes savings grants. Although I heard that $75m scorned earlier, it is real money, it is going into housing and it is helping considerably.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has also done a lot in its attitude towards wage explosions and unreasonable costs. This is one of the areas in which we have to take an objective view. If the Government were prepared to allow costs to go unchecked or uncontrolled in any way it would make even fewer houses available, but every effort has been made to try to keep these increases in costs to what could be regarded as a reasonable level. I regret that, since we debate this matter twice a year, and usually three times a year, some of the information put forward by both sides is inclined to become repetitious. I am afraid that is a matter of course. When referring to the States I meant to draw attention to the rental accommodation outstanding table.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The interesting thing about this table is the identification of the States that have made the greatest effort. It is significant that the peak levels in the various States are as follows: Victoria, December 1976; Queensland , June 1975; South Australia, June 1976; Western Australia, June 1977; in New South Wales and Tasmania the level is at a peak now. The other States, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia, have succeeded in adopting the sorts of policies that have brought down their housing waiting lists, in many cases very substantially. In Western Australia's case it was reduced from 16,000 to 5,000, but regrettably the New South Wales list has gone up to 41,000 and in Tasmania also it is the highest it has ever been. That too is a reflection of the sort of co-operation that has been obtained between the two levels of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We recently were confronted with a Uren doctrine on the five-point plan for housing. I should have thought that, being brought down at the time and in the manner it was, it would have been done with a view to providing the answers to some of the problems. Point one was for more Commonwealth money; point two, that the first home buyers program should provide subsidies; point three, that 250, 000 people in financial difficulties should receive protection; point four, that money should be injected into the housing sector; and point five, that the housing industry should be stimulated. What will that do to housing and to the economy in general if it is carried through in the area of all those other demands I mentioned last week on a similar occasion? In regard to any of these issues-it may be that we are to re-fund Medibank, education, the Australian Capital Territory or anything else-how will this money arrive? Mr Uren went on to say that if Labor had been in government since 1974-75 a further $1,500m would have gone into housing. Mind you, it would have been necessary because of the inflation that would have been created, but it probably would have provided even fewer houses than now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I venture to suggest that very few people in Australia, apart perhaps from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and Senator Messner, believe that the home building industry is not in a critical state. The Real Estate Institute of Australia believes it, the Housing Industry Association believes it, and anybody who has taken out a mortgage in the last five years certainly believes it. It would appear that even Senator Archer goes at least half way towards believing it. These people believe it because it is patently apparent, even to the proverbial Blind Freddie, that the situation in the industry is catastrophic both from the point of view of potential home builders, particularly young home builders, and from the point of view of those employed in the industry. Furthermore, it is also apparent that the situation is deteriorating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If it were not deteriorating we would not have the plethora of rallies and complaints about rising interest rates, the sorts of stories that appeared in the Age recently about people being forced out of their homes because of rising interest rates, or the amount of correspondence that comes into offices such as mine and to those of my colleagues, although probably not to Senator Lewis since he does not seem to get any correspondence from anybody, if his speech of last week is to be believed. Nevertheless, the situation is becoming worse and it is becoming worse not because of any fault in local government regulations or State government zoning laws, as Senator Archer suggested, but because of what the Federal Government is not doing. </PARA>
<PARA> As an ex-mathematician I am quite prepared to admit that the selective use of statistics can come up with just about any answer one wants, but it will not stop me from using some statistics of my own if only to combat the extreme selectivity of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) in his speech earlier this afternoon. I put it to the Senate that if Australia is to continue to be a country where a high percentage of home ownership is a reality and not just a dream, industry figures maintain that a commencement rate of between 155,000 and 160,000 homes is required annually. In fact, according to the figures available, in the vicinity of 130,000 to 135,000 homes are being commenced. That, I would suggest to the Minister, has nothing to do with increasing land prices or home prices; it has simply to do with the fact that people cannot afford to borrow money to build homes in the first place because they know that, within a period of three months, they will be forced into higher interest repayments than they anticipated originally. They cannot afford to borrow the money because they know that they will not be able to afford to pay it back. </PARA>
<PARA> In the decade between 1972 and 1982, the majority of which had a Liberal Party government, housing commencement rates fell by 42 per cent in Victoria and 48 per cent in South Australia. This occurred in the period when the results of the post-war baby boom were allegedly marrying and settling down, presumably settling down in a home of their own; yet that boom did not produce a commensurate boom in house building. One of the side effects at the moment, of the crash-I think we are faced with a crash-in the housing industry is the increased demand for rental accommodation, a factor, which pushes up rental as a logical consequence of increased demand. This, in turn, puts added pressure on the public housing sector. It is no wonder that Senator Gietzelt turned his attention to that matter. In South Australia alone, for instance, the waiting list for a housing trust home was in the vicinity of 21,400 as of December last year. South Australia is not an extremely large State and to have a waiting list for public housing of 21,400 is something of an indictment of Federal Government policies. This represents an increase in the figure of 19,700 for December 1980, so the position is getting more parlous. This brings about yet another question; that is, what is happening to employment in the housing industry? If homes are not being built for people to live in, clearly fewer people will be involved in employment in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first half of this financial year, housing commencements were running at a level of 138,000 but they dropped considerably-by 20 per cent-in the first two months of 1982. The effect of this on employment in the industry is fairly easily demonstrated. In this financial year, on a national basis, the shortfall of 20,000 homes meant an additional 40,000 people unemployed in the building industry. In addition of course, there is the unused manufacturing capacity for building material, which alone is worth approximately $40m. I recall speaking to the Senate late last year on the annual report for 1980-81 of the Department of Housing and Construction. I quoted a section from it. I will quote again the passage, which appeared on page 13 of that document. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics the construction industry directly employs about half a million people, some 8 per cent of the total employment in Australia. It is estimated that the jobs of a further 8 to 10 per cent are indirectly dependent upon the industry, being engaged in producing materials, parts, business, professional and transport services and so on. Altogether, more than one million workers (almost one in every six of those in employment) are dependent on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a higher component of self-employment in the industry</PARA>
<PARA>That is, in the housing industry-</PARA>
<PARA>than in many others. This reflects the prevalence of small sub-contracting firms in the industry, particularly among special trades in the housing sector. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, we can expect massive increases in unemployment figures for this industry alone in a period of limited home building. For the benefit of the Minister, let us take another look at the reasons for the downturn in building activity. Despite his inability to see what is happening in front of his face, they are not really difficult to find and have little to do with rising house or land prices. The simple fact of the matter is that people buying a home are caught in an ever tightening interest rate squeeze. Interest rates have risen four times between April 1980 and June 1981. I remind the Minister, if he needs reminding, that those were not the days of the dreaded Labor Government. In April 1980 building society loan interest was 12 1/4 per cent. It is now 15 per cent. Bank interest rates have risen in similar proportions. Every one per cent increase has added $238m to the home interest bill Australians are faced with. New home buyers are simply unable to accept the staggering burden. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be fine and dandy for the Minister to point out that building societies have record amounts of money to lend, but if the people they want to lend it to cannot afford to borrow there is not much point in them having the money. In 1970, taking out a 25-year loan of $30,000 committed the borrower to a total repayment of $63,000. That total repayment would now be $115,000 because of increased interest rates. There is no guarantee that rates will not rise further. That, if nothing else, puts home ownership beyond the scope of an increasing number of people in Australia. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, it puts increased pressure on welfare housing. I have mentioned the figure for South Australia. In Victoria in the vicinity of 60,000 families are eligible and waiting for public housing with little prospect of getting it. On a national basis the shortfall in that category, according to figures of the Housing Industry Association, is 280,000 dwellings. Again, I would suggest that if the Minister is implying that comments that I might make about people being out on the streets, or comments that Senator Gietzelt or anybody else might make about people being unable to maintain their mortgage repayments or being unable to find cheap rental accommodation are excessive, he needs only to look at articles which appear periodically in the Age and in other newspapers in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Faced with this situation, the Government has taken no positive action to assist people. The action it has taken has only served to make the position worse. Partial deregulation of interest rates, the reduction of housing grants to the State in the past year's Budget by over $24m and the attempt to introduce a 2 1/2 per cent sales tax on home building materials do nothing to assist an industry which is gradually going gurgling down the drain. Every Australian, except perhaps the most one-eyed if not actually blind Liberal voter, must be astounded at the fact that the present Government is apparently unable to come to terms with the problems that exist in the housing industry and with the problems facing those who would like to own a home. Neither the Australian Labor Party nor the Australian Democrats are at all backward in coming forward in suggesting ways and means around this. We are always prepared to offer advice. In fact, we are frequently prepared to go beyond that, coming up with resolutions and legislation to assist. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to hear Senator Gietzelt putting forward the policy of the Australian Labor Party. I suggest to the Minister that the policy put forward by the Australian Labor Party, which follows very closely that put forward by the Democrats last August, is not democratic socialism or any sort of left wing attitude to the economy but simple, plain common sense. Free market forces have done nothing to help the average Australian in the last six years of Liberal Government. Perhaps, just perhaps, it is time that this Government stopped trying to blame the Labor Government that was in power something like a decade ago, and an American Government which, I admit, is not doing great things for the American public but which can hardly be blamed for the Australian domestic problems and even the victims which is something to which the Liberals tend to stoop when they run out of anybody else to blame, and looked instead at its own actions. Control of interest rates and other positive measures to assist home buyers are not, as I believe has been described by Government members, voodoo economics. They are simply economic measures designed to help the majority of Australians. This country needs a bit of magic-voodoo or otherwise-if it is to have any hope of recovering from the mess the free market economy beliefs of this Government have already got it into. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is time we got away from some of the cant and hypocrisy that has been talked about interest rates and got down to some serious thoughts about the problem. It is a problem particularly for home buyers with large mortgages and a small equity. I will return to this problem in a moment although it is worth pointing out right away that not everyone loses from high interest rates-lenders gain from high interest rates and a reduction in interest rates would result in a drop in the value of the insurance, superannuation and savings of many small people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two things must be said again and again about interest rates. Firstly, interest rates are the price of money. Short term interest rates are governed by the ordinary laws of supply and demand-the commodity in this case being the available supply of money. Secondly, interest rates cannot be separated from other parts of the economy. Interest rates are inextricably related to, for example, money supply, the rate of inflation and government Budget policy. Why are interest rates so high? Can government policy bring them down? If they cannot be bought down generally, can and should they be brought down selectively , for instance, in the housing area, the subject that we are discussing? Let us look at each of these in turn. Why are interest rates so high? In many ways our economic situation is the envy of most other countries. Real economic growth last year was 3 per cent; it is expected to be higher this year at a time when most countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development are expecting no growth or negative growth. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The United Kingdom and the United States of America are two such countries. Of course, out of growth comes more to share. The only way this Government or any government can achieve desirable social objectives is through sustained economic growth. This being achieved by this Government; it would be destroyed by the Australian Labor Party. Interest rates are closely related also to the inflation rate. The Americans have convincing statistics to show that interest rates are almost exactly 5 per cent higher than the inflation rate. If we want to get interest rates down we must lower the inflation rate. That is the key to lower interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has firmly faced this problem and used the budgetary weapons at its disposal to cope with it. The key weapon in controlling inflation is limiting the growth in the money supply. Of course, the Labor Party would let the money supply blow out as it did in the Whitlam years when it hit 27 per cent . This sort of thing might bring about a temporary dip in interest rates but, of course, before long inflation would soar and interest rates would follow. We hear over and over in this place proposals from the Labor party for more expenditure here, more expenditure there-more expenditure all the time. Of course, simultaneously the Labor party encourages grossly inflationary wage demands. We, I am glad to say, are more responsible. To head off the dangers of increased inflation and a wage explosion, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) is aiming this year for an increase in the money supply of not more than 10 per cent or 11 per cent. So much for the supply side of the supply-demand balance which determines short term interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> What about demand? The Government has taken two very significant steps to limit the demand for money. The Budget strategy was designed to dampen down just a little the so-called resource boom atmosphere in favour of more controlled, steady growth. This will, of course, ease the pressure on the money supply and, therefore, on interest rates. Even more importantly, we are moving to reduce government demands for money market funds which come through deficits. These demands, of course, include State and local government requirements as well as ours. In fact, last year their share of the public sector borrowing requirement was almost twice as large as ours. The Labor Party and the Australian Democrats, by preventing the collection of $500m in sales tax, will increase the public sector borrowing requirement and, therefore, increase interest rates. The crocodile tears that they are shedding about interest rates are the purest hypocrisy. I suggest that it would be irresponsible and probably impossible to do more than the Government is doing.</PARA>
<PARA> The British tried to put a strait-jacket on interest rates by saying that they must not exceed a certain level which, of course, was below the market rate. Of course, the obvious thing happened; various substitutes for money arose outside the market and other liquid assets took the place of money. The British did not, in fact, succeed in reducing the effective interest rates for those who were most in need. They had to use other sources of borrowing and finished up paying much higher interest rates than they would have if the Government had not interfered in the first place. Everyone must grasp the simple fact that a government cannot control both money supply and interest rates. It can control one or the other but not both. We are committed to controlling the money supply as a vital weapon in the battle against inflation. We therefore cannot control interest rates generally although we can help to reduce them by lowering the Government's demands on the money markets-and that we are doing. I repeat: Governments cannot control both money supply and interest rates. Governments try to only at their peril and to the great economic loss of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> If governments cannot control interest rates generally, what about doing it selectively? Can it be done? The answer is yes, but probably at great cost to everyone else and quite possibly to the harm of the people intended to be helped . The trouble is that if one holds down interest rates artificially people put their money somewhere else. If banks and building societies cannot get the money in they will not be able to lend. Would-be borrowers will have to go somewhere else for their money and probably pay exorbitant rates for it. This problem was clearly recognised by the New South Wales Minister for Housing, Mr Sheahan, when approving an interest rate rise for New South Wales permanent building society home loans. Mr Sheahan quite rightly said that building society interest rates on housing loans had to go up because unless those savings institutions were competitive and able to attract their share of investments home loan funds for housing would dry up. I do not want to minimise the burden of extra costs that high interest rates can impose on home buyers. I think we all deeply regret the fact that these rises are unavoidable. However, we should not completely lose perspective about the impact of these costs. A person on average weekly earnings who took out a mortgage loan of $30,000 three years ago at a rate of interest of 10 per cent would have seen his mortgage repayments rise by about $54 a month over the three-year period. However, his after-tax income would have risen over the same period by $226 a month. </PARA>
<PARA> What about direct assistance to increase the rate of house construction? Senator Haines was arguing that the rate of house construction was too low. The housing industry is currently building about 140,000 houses a year. Approvals in the last three years were steadily rising-118,000, 137,000 and 147,500 houses were built in successive years. This year it looks like between 135,000 and 140, 000 houses will be built. This is not a catastrophic drop. It is in certain localities, but not generally across the nation. The level is certainly below the capacity of the housing industry, but it is far less clear that it is really less than the community needs. </PARA>
<PARA> In home ownership we have a remarkable record. At the moment 38 per cent of Australians own their own homes outright-no question of loans involved. This figure by the way, has risen in the last six years from 28 per cent-the figure in the last year of the Whitlam Government-to 38 per cent. Nationally we have a home ownership rate of 72 per cent. This might be compared with other countries: In the United States the figure is 65 per cent, in Canada 62 per cent, in Britain 50 per cent, in France 47 per cent and in West Germany 33 per cent. We have 72 per cent of people in their own homes. Incidentally, Victoria has the highest figure in the nation-75 per cent. As Senator Archer pointed out, the figure for New South Wales because of its extraordinarily inept housing development policies is much lower-71 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Undoubtedly there are groups who are facing difficulties with housing at the moment. The three main groups, I would suggest, are, firstly, people who have borrowed in the last couple of years, particularly those who have since become one-income families; secondly, would-be first home buyers who are finding it hard to bridge the deposit gap; and, thirdly, some families renting in the private market. Dealing with these particular problems is a matter of co- operation between the Federal and State governments. The Federal Government has taken action in the past on the problem of bridging the deposit gap. I hope we will see the scheme changed to make it more immediately available at the time of commitment to the purchase, but the State governments-or the best of them-are taking action in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> My own State of Victoria has many schemes to help these groups who have problems. For instance, in co-operation with the building societies, it has an interest subsidy scheme for low-income earners buying houses whereby they get an interest rate advantage of up to 5 per cent. There is a home renovation scheme at concessional interest rates for low income earners for repairs and renovations to their homes. There is a second mortgage scheme under which the maximum loan has now been raised to $20,000. There is an emergency housing interest relief scheme for people who are in crisis meeting their rising interest payments. They may have an interest subsidy for up to 12 months, although there are, of course, as there should be, stringent limitations on eligibility. The original loan must not be more than $35,000 and it must be shown that the new rate of repayment, after the interest rate rise, on the first mortgage is a greater percentage of income than it was at the time the mortgage was originally entered into. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night the Victorian Premier announced two new schemes which will go into operation this year. One is a scheme whereby the Government is selling land to developers under an agreement that developers will construct houses on the land for low income earners. The other is an interest subsidy scheme to assist families with incomes below about $20,500 a year on mortgages for houses up to $ 30,000. This will give these relatively low income earners-although the figure, by the way, is 130 per cent of average weekly earnings-an interest subsidy of 3 per cent in the first year, 2 per cent in the second year and one per cent in the third year. This applies to families who have bought their first home in the past three years and to those who will be buying housing in the next three years . </PARA>
<PARA> This is a business for the States, because there are different problems in each State. New South Wales has extraordinary problems, as I have said, because of the cost of housing there caused by the absurd policies of the State Government in the housing area. Different States have different problems. Victoria has targeted in on the particular problems of housing affecting the Victorian community, and the measures taken by the Victorian Government are a very sensible and effective means of helping home owners and would-be home owners in this very critical area of owning their own homes.

It is very significant that those gentlemen, along with Mr Jim Cavanagh who was here this morning and was welcomed to this place, are present with us on this occasion because today is the fiftieth anniversary of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Both Mr Wood and Mr Devitt served as Chairmen of that Committee and Mr Cavanagh served as Deputy Chairman for many years. Collectively they have made a great contribution over many years both to this chamber and to that well-established and well-recognised committee, Regulations and Ordinances. I take the opportunity on behalf of all honourable senators to welcome both of the honourable gentlemen here today.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, as you have mentioned, the report that I have just presented on behalf of the Committee represents a landmark in the Committee's operations in that today is the fiftieth anniversary of the Committee's establishment. It is fitting that we have in the chamber today three former Chairmen of the Committee, the two that you mentioned, Mr President-Ian Wood and Don Devitt-and, also sitting behind me, Senator Alan Missen. Senator Missen is currently the Chairman of the Commonwealth Delegated Legislation Committee, which was established as a result of activities on the Regulations and Ordinances Committee of this Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee has endeavoured in this report to mark this significant parliamentary occasion by reminding the Senate of the work it has undertaken over the 50 years of its history. To that end the report includes a brief outline of the Committee's origin and functions, together with a list of all former and present members of the Committee, an index to the 70 reports it has previously presented to the Senate, and a list of those reports. As part of the Committee's continuing function of examining, on behalf of the Senate, delegated legislation made before the Parliament, the report also includes details of legislation considered since the seventieth report was tabled in the Senate in June 1981. The Committee was particularly pleased that its sister committee in the United Kingdom has recognised this day. I have much pleasure in laying on the table, for the information of honourable senators, a resolution by the United Kingdom Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments congratulating the Committee on its fifty years of achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> Motion (by Senator Peter Baume)-by leave-agreed to:</PARA>
<PARA> That, on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, the Senate expresses its appreciation of the contribution of the Committee, on behalf of the Senate, to the effective scrutiny of delegated legislation, since 11 March 1932. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating these Bills cognately. They are concerned with rural exports and the quality controls which the government believes are necessary to maintain our markets for these goods. However, I wish to speak about another kind of export which does not need Government-sponsored quality control. I refer to the products of the much maligned mining industry. I wish to quote from a short article by Mr Jim Cameron , a New South Wales parliamentarian, which appeared in the Australian on Monday 10 February this year. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Economically, mining has been carrying us on its back since the sheep jibbed at continuing to do so in the 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA> The mineral industry's readiness then to fill the breach created by the slide in our rural sector was fortuitous, to put it mildly. </PARA>
<PARA> It involved more than a step into the breach-it came close to a straight gallop to the succor of our reeling economy. </PARA>
<PARA>I think some of the other things that Mr Cameron said are of enough interest for me to seek leave of the Senate at this stage to incorporate the article in Hansard. I apologise to the Opposition for not placing this article into its hands beforehand. Perhaps the honourable senator in charge of the Opposition business could have a look at this article and at another one which I want incorporated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no objections at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The article read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Gratitude to the mining industry for all it has done for us sticks in our craws like a sick boy's thanks for castor oil. </PARA>
<PARA> No winter wind that ever blew was half so unkind as our indifference here. </PARA>
<PARA> The mineral winners enjoy little relief from attacks which landslide on to them . How many of us can point to a single activity on which we depend as much yet are so sluggish to defend?</PARA>
<PARA> Like a trio of tunnels converging on a pit-head, there are three main directions of attack. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, there is the continuing saga of Greenies v Grubbers-the latter being one of many unflattering terms used to describe miners such as ''moles'', '' scratchers'' and ''fossickers''. The conservationists, or Greenies, are hostile to Grubbers for environmental reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly there are the Aboriginal lobbyists who are said to be concerned not for economic reasons but because of sacred sites. </PARA>
<PARA> And thirdly there are the most rapacious stake-grabbers of all-governments of all tiers and colors. Their reasons are economic to the core and scarcely disguised. </PARA>
<PARA> Easy pickings on a grand scale-this comes close to summing up their basic drive . </PARA>
<PARA> As far as it can be, of course, this is legitimised by fine words about protecting the public interest and shoring up the revenues. What a welcome treat many would find if these attacks were to meet one fate: unceremonious dumping in the mullock. If there is ever to be anything that could be called a fair divvying up of the lode, this really ought to happen. Mining, after all, if it can be called a lobby at all, is so unfashionable it has never known what it is to enjoy a soft ride. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times, the competing fashionable lobbies have rarely known any other kind. They have usually managed to get their own way. The mineral industry's defensive public relations stance is overdue for discard. A real attempt is at last being made to change the static and adverse perception the public has of mining, but much more needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> In the understated words of a dragline operator deep in the continent's interior: ''Money in the till, that's what mining is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> ''It represents more for the whole of Aussie. </PARA>
<PARA> ''There's also a quid or two for me, the missus and the kids.''</PARA>
<PARA> Because he is honest, the scale of his understatement brings a wry grin to his face. </PARA>
<PARA> Philosophically, he adds: ''But, like in the bloody dictionary, the Greenies think beauty's always got to come before booty.''</PARA>
<PARA> The case put by the Greenies seems often to come down to this: a panorama without scars is better than one with them. </PARA>
<PARA> So put, this argument virtually carries itself. </PARA>
<PARA> But is the environment without either scars or local jobs as good as one with a few scars plus jobs and a high living standard?</PARA>
<PARA> Greater environmental sensitivity by the miners has also caved in part of the Greenies' case. </PARA>
<PARA> First-class revegetation work on dunes by the sand-mining companies is but one example. </PARA>
<PARA> Long on emotion, short on realism-this seems to epitomise the verbal, and sometimes more than verbal, assaults made by Greenies on Grubbers. </PARA>
<PARA> Concerning the sacred sites on which the Aboriginals rely, the gently pungent comment of Sir James Foots, an elder statesman of mining, was: ''We need these to be identified now-not after a mine has been discovered''. </PARA>
<PARA> But governments remain the heaviest inert mass of overburden. </PARA>
<PARA> Thank goodness the mineral industry has a sense of humour to season its responses to the outpourings of the leading politicians about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Otherwise the unconscious humour buried in them might never be unearthed. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill Hayden's recent commitment on behalf of the ALP to introduce a resource rental levy to tax excessive profits in the mining industry is a case in point. </PARA>
<PARA> Economically, mining has been carrying us on its back since the sheep jibbed at continuing to do so in the 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA> The mineral industry's readiness then to fill the breach created by the slide in our rural sector was fortuitous, to put it mildly. </PARA>
<PARA> It involved more than a step into the breach-it came closer to a straight gallop to the succour of our reeling economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Like a surprised pit-pony asked to bring off unaided one of the US cavalry's last-reel film rescues, the industry responded. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been a sure-footed prop sustaining our living standards ever since. </PARA>
<PARA> No Lone Ranger could have asked for a more faithful Silver. </PARA>
<PARA> Its reward has been to be taxed and imposted more and more by every tier of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Now the talk is of a resource rental tax. It takes a real sense of humour to hear that, and just neigh derisively-and carry on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think everyone accepts the truth that the mining industry rescued us at a critical time. I am concerned to see that the Government helps the industry lift us to another plateau of export which will again lift Australia's living standards. This will not cost the taxpayer a cent. Firstly, governments have to recognise a basic problem which is that Australian coal and iron ore ports are incapable of handling really large and profitable quantities of iron ore from Western Australia and coal from Queensland. The iron ore situation is perhaps more longer term than is the coal situation at the moment even though coal exporters worry about the world oil price drop. Sir Russel Madigan, Deputy Chairman of Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd, a man deeply experienced in mineral exports, is quoted in the West Australian of 6 March 1982 . The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia's iron ore trade with Europe is in jeopardy, one of its founders warned yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> In an apparent reference to Brazilian miners, Sir Russel said Australia's iron ore producers could not compete now in the European market with competitors who were closer and whose governments helped them get bigger ships and deeper ports.</PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The article read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Hitachi Venture, launched in January, is the sort of ship causing concern to Sir Russel. At 272,000 dead-weight tonnes it is beyond the operating limit of the Pilbara ports, where the record shipment was a 264,591 dead-weight tonnes loaded out of Lauderdale for Cape Lambert. The Hitachi Venture, the world's biggest ore carrier, will be put into service after delivery on the Brazilian run. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's iron ore trade with Europe is in jeopardy, one of its founders warned yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> CRA Ltd's deputy chairman, Sir Russel Madigan, told a seminar on relations between Australia and West Germany in Canberra: ''Australian iron-ore producers do not make any money selling iron ore to Europe, including Germany. I don't know how long this trade can survive.'' He said the trade had developed on very favourable freight rates offered by shippers, who were then eager to get scarce backloads in the Australia-Europe trade. Somewhat ruefully, Sir Russel added: '' We were too successful,'' explaining that on a tonnage basis, cargoes to Europe soon began to exceed those consigned from Europe to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In an apparent reference to Brazilian miners Sir Russel said Australia's iron ore producers could not compete now in the European market with competitors who were closer and whose governments helped them get bigger ships and deeper ports. Speaking of trade between Australia and West Germany in general, Sir Russel said : ''Perhaps it is just as well we are having a symposium to faster economic co- operation between Australia and Germany at this time. He said that West Germany' s share of Australia's total export market had fallen from 7.5 per cent in 1978- 79 to 5.7 per cent in 1980-81. Australia's imports from West Germany had fallen from 3.1 per cent in 1978-79 to 2.5 per cent in 1980-81. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WJ7">Senator MARTYR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The article which has been incorporated includes a photograph of the Hitachi Venture which is a very large bulk carrier. As leave has been granted to incorporate the article I will not spend time reading the full caption. The important point is that it shows a photograph of a 270,000 tonne deadweight vessel which is well beyond the capacity of any of the ports in the Pilbara in Western Australia or in Queensland to handle. Concern about our lack of really efficient ports to handle big, profitably operating vessels I think is known to the people in the mining industry. I want the concern that I and others have made known to as many people in the Senate and anywhere else that I can make it known. This concern also has been expressed by Mr Lang Hancock who may not agree with everybody in this place about every subject, but he is vastly experienced in the iron ore trade. In the Weekend Australian of 27-28 February-I will not seek leave to incorporate that article, I might be in trouble if I do, but I think the article is worth reading to the Senate-he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The answer . . . is to widen the market to encompass the world, instead of being tied almost exclusively to Japan. </PARA>
<PARA> This can only be done by the establishment of privately financed, owned and operated modern infrastructure to service jumbo ships which will enable freights to be reduced to enable our iron ore and coal to be delivered in worldwide markets at competitive prices. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the comment of one who is vastly experienced. His reference to the Japanese market intrigued me. I have the greatest respect for our best customer, but the Japanese are very hard, very shrewd and long-sighted negotiators. Iron ore development in Western Australia has been largely a response to Japanese demand on Japanese terms and conditions, one of which was that the shipping of the iron ore should be conducted in Japanese vessels of a tonnage most suited to the Australia-Japan run. These ships are comparatively small by today's standards and at present the Western Australian iron ore ports can take nothing bigger than these comparatively small ships. I also understand that it is really impossible economically to deepen or widen these ports and channels. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is virtually excluded from the European and other markets for iron ore simply because we cannot ship economic quantities to those places. Naturally enough, this suits the Japanese better than it suits us. We certainly have to increase our selling options. We must have a new iron ore port on the Western Australian coast proximate to the iron ore fields. Hopefully, it will be done with willing private enterprise in much the same way as the proposed deep water port to be built at Port Clinton in Queensland, which I noted is the subject of an article appearing in a newspaper called the Morning Bulletin. I am not sure where that newspaper circulates, but it looks as though it is a Queensland paper . I ask honourable senators from Queensland to pardon my ignorance, but it is a newspaper I have not seen before. I found it to be an interesting article. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The Government is seeking a location that could be developed into a port capable of handling ships of 250,000 tonnes', Mr Bjelke-Petersen said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'We must be capable of handling the new generation of coal carriers if future exports to the European market are to be viable'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premier said the Commonwealth would not allow the State to undertake studies of Port Clinton but preliminary hydrographic and seismic surveys had been done in the area to be inspected today. </PARA>
<PARA>We have to have something like this project. The article was headed 'Port Clinton looks a goer'. Indeed, I suppose that in Queensland it would have some suitable defence aspects as well. Coal exports from Queensland are absolutely vital to the Australian economy at the moment. The top foreign exchange earner for the last two consecutive years has been the coal industry. It certainly has revitalised our domestic economy. Making comparisons between the coal and wool industries, we find that in 1979-80 the coal industry was worth $1,677m and that in the current year it is worth $1,973m. Comparing those figures with those of the wool industry, which everybody formerly believed was what this country's prosperity depended on, we find that in 1979-80 the wool industry was worth $1, 595m and that in 1980-81 it was worth $1,749m. The coal industry, of course, has met the industrial needs of many countries and is an industry with virtually unlimited expansion potential, as our coal deposits are known to be immense, with no presently defined upper limit to the reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> We have consistently let down our trading partners with interruptions to contracted supplies. There was the 10-week housing tax strike, which caused some bother in this place. Then, with port and railroad bottle-necks in New South Wales, our major customer for coal, Japan, has been actively moving over the past few years to broaden its supply base to ensure that it becomes largely independent of reliance on Australia within a few years. The New South Wales coal ports, by any standards, are industrial nightmares. Concentrated into small areas, easily controlled by militant unions and owned by one State monopoly, they do not cater for the cost-effective, largest bulk carriers which are needed to trade competitively across the world. </PARA>
<PARA> As was noted earlier, Japan, in order to protect its own interests, is currently encouraging, by contract, and investing in coal export facilities in Siberia, China, the United States of America and Canada. South Africa and Colombia, which are also on the oceanic rim with ready access to Japan, are rapidly developing their vast coal export potential. I think it is vital that we have at least one deep water port capable of handling ships of at least 250,000 deadweight tonnes on either side of Australia-one for Western Australia's iron ore and one for Queensland's coal. The ports should be developed not by government but by private enterprise. I was very gratified to see a report detailing words of Sir Charles Court, former Premier of Western Australia, who was visiting New South Wales during the weekend. He was quite specific in his remarks that governments just cannot do this sort of thing and should not even try to. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that if we intend, which we must, to develop our iron ore exports beyond the Japanese market, where we are a captive, it is absolutely essential for us to have a new and large deep water port on the Western Australian coast. If we are to hold our share of the coal market-Japan again is our largest customer-on this side of the Australian coast we need a large deep water port in Queensland. The best proposition at the moment appears to be Port Clinton. I will leave my remarks at that. It seemed to me that the necessity for these ports was an important enough reason for me to take part in the first reading debate on these Bills. We must make sure that the prospects for the future-while we look after the present rural exports-regarding essential minerals are taken care of. They can be profitably taken care of only by having bigger and more efficiently operated vessels. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to take advantage of this first reading debate on a money Bill to expose what might be called the Grace Bros rip-off. I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate a matter of blatant exploitation of the consumer. Whilst there is little that can be done about this case at this stage, my mentioning it here may alert otherwise unsuspecting consumers, particularly migrants. The case involves Grace Bros as international removalists , although it concerns a local job that company was doing in Hobart. The matter arose a few weeks ago when an English migrant came in to my office angry and concerned about being locked into a very costly situation for him and one over which he had no control. His furniture and personal effects were at the time en route from the United Kingdom by sea. He had come ahead of those goods.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After his arrival in Hobart he received a letter from Grace Bros in Hobart saying that he would have to pay $755 to have his goods moved from the Hobart wharf to the company's bonded warehouse only a few kilometres away and then to his new home in a Hobart suburb only a further few kilometres away from the warehouse. This charge of $755 amounts to more than 25 per cent extra compared to the total cost of bringing the furniture and household goods the 20,000 kilometres or so from England, that charge being #1,448 sterling. That charge was for bringing the goods from his home in England to the Hobart wharf. The goods involved amounted to something in the order of 15 cubic metres of furniture and household goods in 62 packages. If honourable senators want to visualise the amount involved, on my assessment that is about the equivalent of a bathroom crammed full of goods. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that packing costs are similar in each of the two operations, regardless of distance, but the comparison is still ridiculous. My constituent was shocked at the quotation and so was I. It did not seem a very warm welcome for Australia to give him to his new home. He and my staff went about obtaining three other quotes for the same job. While there was some difference in these quotes, none came within cooee of the Grace Bros' quote. The three quotes obtained for the same work were $235, $140 and $200. I understand that other migrants in this position, who get locked into having Grace Bros do the job, whether they like it or not, have made complaints on several occasions to the Customs Bureau in Hobart. Like me, the Customs officers are helpless in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> It was suggested to my constituent that he obtain the bill of lading from Grace Bros and arrange for his own removalist to do the job. As I understand it, Grace Bros were appointed to do the job by a firm of international shipping agents in the United Kingdom without the knowledge, again as I understand it, of the client involved. However, Grace Bros would not give him the bill of lading because, he was told, his goods were in a container shared by two other people. The firm also would not tell him the names of the other people so he therefore could not contact them for some joint action to obtain a lower price. Grace Bros did tell him he could arrange to have the goods removed from Grace Bros' bonded warehouse after they had been moved there by Grace Bros. He was told he would be charged only $340 to take his goods from the container on the Hobart wharf the few kilometres to the warehouse. </PARA>
<PARA> A member of my staff spoke to the manager of Grace Bros in Hobart who detailed the supposed costs involved. He gave a long and complicated list of costs involved including the need to write, telex and telegram the United Kingdom about the safe arrival of the goods and a charge to have the Customs and quarantine officers inspect the goods at the bonded warehouse. I will list the items supposed to make up the total cost. These were: Acknowledgement of the bill of lading to the shippers in England, shipping agency fees-remembering that , of course, these are goods that have already landed in Hobart-and a $125 fee to receive the shipment into the terminal. There is other correspondence between the shipping agents, et cetera, a container lift fee on the wharf, cartage to the bond store, another cartage lift fee, unstowing the container, acknowledgement of the safe arrival of the goods to the United Kingdom shippers, de-hire of the container, storage until Customs officers clear the goods and then, before the goods are removed, a checking of each package. There was also another receipt to the UK and return of documents to the UK, Customs and quarantine inspections which include the transportation of these officers and providing an attendant to go through the goods at request. The quote for that was $85. There was to be an additional fee if quarantine officers decided to fumigate the goods. That cost would be only about $18 extra for the amount of goods involved. A fee of $300 was therefore charged to deliver the goods from Grace Bros store to the suburban home. </PARA>
<PARA> The manager said that there were no unreasonable charges. When the amounts of the other quotes were mentioned to him, he said those quotes would have been given because the competitors knew that Grace Bros were involved. In fact, that was not the case. The quotes were sought without any mention of the name of Grace Bros to any of the companies spoken to. When my constituent tried to engage another firm to move the goods from Grace Bros warehouse to his home none of them was happy about doing it when Grace Bros involvement was discovered. My constituent had to pay the full $755. The letter sent by Grace Bros to him in which it was stated that the quote was $755 also stated that that charge covered Customs and quarantine clearance, port landing, depot handling and delivery, et cetera. A new arrival could be forgiven for believing that the Customs and quarantine clearances referred to are fees imposed by the Commonwealth. In fact, there are no such charges in this regard. As I said, the only charge would be the cost of fumigating the goods, if indeed that were necessary. That would have cost only about $18 for the size of the consignment involved. My constituent was trapped and had to go along with Grace Bros. To add insult to injury, the day his possessions were actually dispatched from the warehouse, the removalist would not take them into his house until he had been paid the full $755. </PARA>
<PARA> It strikes me that this is a clear case of exploitation and greed. Obviously, Grace Bros charge excessively. Some of us have always thought that. In any case, that company's quoted rates are hardly competitive. What is worse is that because of the container system where several clients share a container, that firm is able to tie people up and prevent them from obtaining more competitive prices in the market-place. To me it seems that effectively this is a restrictive trade practice that should be investigated. I hope the public has been warned by this. Unfortunately my warning will have little effect on potential migrants still in the United Kingdom or elsewhere who may never have heard of Grace Bros until they get a letter demanding what appears to be an enormous amount of money for a simple transportation job. </PARA>

So as not to disappoint our former colleague, Jim Cavanagh, I will continue my emotional stance.

The matter that I want to raise is not unknown to those who sit in this chamber. It is not unknown to many people throughout Australia. It is the matter of the reserve lands of the Aboriginal people in my State of Queensland. This matter has been going on ever since a statement was made by the Premier of Queensland some 12 months ago. He stated that the Queensland Government intended to abolish the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Queensland and that the Government intended to have a second look at the reserve lands. He said that the Government would be looking at perhaps giving the Aboriginal people living on those reserve lands tenure of 50 years, in other words, a 50-year lease. He said also: 'We will have to keep very tight control of these areas. We will not allow them to become black enclaves' and all those kinds of statements that he has made on a number of occasions when Aboriginal people have started talking about land rights in the State of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think we are talking about land rights in the sense in which that matter has been spoken about on so many occasions. What we are talking about is the return of the reserve lands in Queensland that have been set aside by governments, as I have said here before, for over 100 years. These reserve lands were set aside because it was felt that they were not good for agriculture and for all those other purposes for which non-Aboriginal people want land. They were set aside for Aboriginal people as an administrative convenience to keep the Aboriginals all grouped together so that the Government would know where they were. In this way it would protect the graziers, the waterholes, the sheep and the cattle and would keep all the aboriginals segregated and perhaps away from the prying eyes of the world at large. </PARA>
<PARA> A further statement was made by the Premier of Queensland in a media release on 1 March 1982 in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . title to Aboriginal and Islander reserve lands would be vested in the elected councils through Deeds of Grants in Trust under existing provisions of the Land Act. </PARA>
<PARA>When I read that first part of the statement, I thought: 'Jolly good'. The Premier also said that there would be a type of limited freehold in the sense that the lands could never again be sold, disposed of or alienated from the Aboriginal people. That is exactly what I would like to see. I would like to see those lands handed back to the Aboriginal people through their elected councils but in such a way that they could never again be capable of being alienated from the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> I was elated when I started to read that statement. But a little further in the statement we find that the deeds of grant are to be held by the Government, in one of its offices in Brisbane, and that Aboriginal councils would be able to lease the land to individual Aborigines or groups of Aborigines. The councils would not have the power to do that themselves. They would then have to go cap in hand to the Minister for Lands and Forestry who would have to give his approval. If we are talking about giving people something with security of tenure, something with which Aboriginal people can work and with which to progress themselves and their own people, I do not believe that the proposition that has been put forward is giving any sense of security or is any way different from what the Aboriginal people in Queensland already have. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not alone in what I am saying. Perhaps at this juncture I should make it quite clear that whatever I say here today and the propositions and arguments that I put forward are in no way to be taken as a criticism of my colleague, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume, with whom I have worked ever since he came into this place. I have worked with him on a number of committees and he has shown great understanding of and empathy for the Aboriginal people. I do not want my remarks to be taken in any way as criticism of his efforts and those of his Department on this very issue over the last 12 months-they have worked consistently behind the scenes trying to bring about a better deal for Aboriginal people in Queensland-nor should it be taken as a criticism of my Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser as, in my opinion, he has done more for Aboriginal affairs than any other Prime Minister. I wish to get that clear at the outset. </PARA>
<PARA> I said a moment ago that I was not alone in what I was saying. I do not think that I am alone. A letter which I have before me states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> We, the Anglican and Roman Catholic Bishops of Queensland, met in annual conference last Friday. Among other matters we discussed the announcement concerning the transfer of title of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Reserve lands to the respective Community Councils. </PARA>
<PARA> Like many in the community, we are asking what security is offered to the Councils and residents of those reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> Our hope is that the security offered will be guaranteed by an Act of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I will elaborate on that part of the letter later in the debate. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed use of 'Deeds of Grant in Trust under existing provisions of the Land Act' would not seem to be sufficient to provide adequate security of title.</PARA>
<PARA>I make these points very strongly. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> If Deeds of Grant in Trust are appropriate legal devices for the transfer of title (and that is for others, expert in the law, to determine), they should surely be created so that they might never be varied or terminated except by Act of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>This does not appear to be the case when we read the statement from the Premier of Queensland. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Otherwise would not the tenure for those living on the reserves remain as at present, that is, subject simply to the Queensland Government's discretion?</PARA>
<PARA> We note in the Press Release the Government's assurance that consultation has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA>I will talk about that a little later on. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>We should like to renew the appeal made by the Moderator of the Uniting Church and our two Archbishops in July last year that such consultation should be ' widespread, lengthy, and in conformity with the particular character of the Aboriginal people'. </PARA>
<PARA> We hope that the tenure bestowed will give the State's Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders all the security and powers they need to choose between life on their lands of historical significance and life in the cities and towns. </PARA>
<PARA> The same tenure needs to be assured to thousands of other Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders living on Country Reserves. This emphasises the need for the widest possible consultation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is our hope, therefore, that the Queensland Government will legislate in Parliament for security of tenure after due consultation with the people on the reserves and their elected representatives, and after concerned community groups have had an opportunity to scrutinise the proposed laws. </PARA>
<PARA>That letter was signed by John Grindrod, Brisbane, John Lewis, North Queensland, Hamish Jamieson, Carpentaria, George Hearn, Rockhampton, Ralph Wicks, Assistant Bishop, Brisbane, Francis Rush, Brisbane, Leonard Faulkner, Townsville, John Torpie, Cairns, Edward Kelly, Toowoomba, Bernard Wallace, Rockhampton and John Gerry, Brisbane. Are we now going to start saying what has been said about me and a number of other outspoken Aboriginals? Are these people activists? Are these men who signed the letter-all bishops and archbishops-now to be branded as activists or radicals as I have been branded by the Premier of Queensland because I speak out on Aboriginal affairs? Will they be branded in the same way? I certainly pray that they will not. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of support comes from the Courier-Mail in its editorial way back on 4 November 1981. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is time the Federal and Queensland Governments stopped their huffing and puffing over Aboriginal land rights. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premier, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, is not helping matters with his belligerent attitude. Too often it seems he is more interested in the wealth that comes out of the land than the people who live on it. </PARA>
<PARA>That is only part of the editorial from the Courier-Mail. I have before me an editorial from the Queensland Times dated 2 March 1982 and headed: 'Land rights offer still too limited'. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government's decision to grant Aborigines limited freehold tenure of existing reserves will not satisfy Aboriginal demands for land rights.</PARA>
<PARA> The offer from the Government continues to place a number of restrictions on Aborigines, the most vexatious of which is a denial of mineral rights. </PARA>
<PARA>Are the editor of the Courier-Mail and the editor of the Queensland Times now to join the ranks of the radicals and the activists to which I, Charlie Perkins, Steve Mann and a few others belong? Are they now to be put into the same category as we are? The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs issued a Press release some time ago on the Commonwealth Government's four point plan for the reserve lands in Queensland. The Press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the current events in Queensland, Senator Baume said that the Government has already said that it would wish to see the following four principles satisfied:</PARA>
<PARA> The integrity of the present reserve boundaries be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Secure tenure for occupants and preservation of their rights to use the land.</PARA>
<PARA> Local communities to play a significant role in the management of reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> Full consultation with Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders before any decision is made. </PARA>
<PARA>In my humble opinion none of those criteria have been filled under the present proposal. I am told at this stage that it is only a proposal to be put into the form of a Bill. As yet no one has seen the Bill. I do not think anyone will see the Bill because the constant practice in the Queensland Parliament is to bring in a Bill at about midnight, as was the case with the Aurukun and Mornington Island Bill. Not even any of the Liberal-National Country Party backbenchers had seen that Bill previously. It was introduced at about midnight and rushed through the Parliament with almost no debate whatsoever. That is what will happen if this Bill comes in. There will be no debate in the Queensland Parliament because the Bill will be rushed through in the early hours of the morning. I think one should call the Queensland Premier Mr Daylight because he seems to like to do things in the early hours of the morning. Let us look at these deeds of grant in trust. Some of the incidences of and restrictions on such title would be:</PARA>
<PARA> The deeds of grant in trust may be granted-</PARA>
<PARA>I note the words 'may be granted'-</PARA>
<PARA>by a Governor-in-Council for any public purpose. A public purpose covers all manner of things from aerodromes to cemetries and-</PARA>
<PARA>coincidentally-</PARA>
<PARA>includes Aboriginal reserves. </PARA>
<PARA>These provisions can be looked up in the Queensland Land Act. I continue:</PARA>
<PARA>The trustees (in this case, the Councils) are liable to pay any survey fees. The Governor-in-Council (effectively Cabinet) may cancel or vary the deed of grant at any time. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that my colleague on the Opposition benches, Senator Jones, would have some understanding of the kinds of things that happen in the Queensland Parliament. There would be no debate. The current Governor-in-Council-the Cabinet-can do any of the number of things about which I am about to speak. Another provision is:</PARA>
<PARA>The Governor-in-Council may declare the land to revert to the Crown for any reason that it appears desirable to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>We are talking about land that is supposed to be handed back to the Aboriginal people. this is what can happen which Aboriginal land comes under the Queensland Land Act. I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA>The Governor-in-Council may declare the land to revert to the Crown for any reason that it appears desirable to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>That covers a whole range of things. A further provision is:</PARA>
<PARA>The Governor-in-Council (Cabinet) may remove any trustee</PARA>
<PARA>In this case the Aboriginal elected councillors-</PARA>
<PARA>from office if it is of the opinion that it is 'in the public interests' and in its absolute discretion may appoint new trustees (Councillors). </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the fact that these councillors are duly elected, the Government would have the power to remove them and replace them without going through another election. The next provision is:</PARA>
<PARA>The trustees' (Councils) books of account must be open and available at all times to the Minister for Lands. </PARA>
<PARA>Why must their books be open to the Minister for Lands? Why should they not be open to an auditor? But no, the books have to be open at all times to the Honourable Russ Hinze-'honourable' in inverted commas. He can go and inspect the books at any time he wants. I understand that he will be in his present position for a considerable time. Another provision is:</PARA>
<PARA>The trustees-</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the Aboriginal councils-</PARA>
<PARA>have power to surrender the land back to the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA>Who can imagine the Aboriginal people wanting to surrender the land? We are fighting so jolly hard for it at the moment that I could never see them wanting to give it back. It is also provided that:</PARA>
<PARA>The trustees-</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the Council-</PARA>
<PARA>could lease blocks of land to particular families only if the Minister for lands gave written approval. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, the Honourable Russ Hinze has to give written approval before the Aboriginal people can lease their own land. That provision continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister may, in his absolute discretion, refuse such approval. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words 'absolute discretion'. He does not even have to give a reason. He can say: 'No, you cannot do that'. If my son Patrick wanted to set up a turtle farm or an oyster farm on Palm Island we can imagine what Russ Hinze would say to that. He would say: 'There is no way that Bonner is going to get a lease'. </PARA>

<PARA> The trustees-</PARA>
<PARA>Again, the Council in this case-</PARA>
<PARA>leasing houses or land to families must charge the highest rent which can reasonably be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA>Why is there a need for that? Why should an Aboriginal council do that? It should be trying to charge the lowest rent that it possibly can within keeping with what the people can afford, to encourage people to have their own homes and to enable them to live in decent surroundings. A further provision is as follows :</PARA>
<PARA> A lessee (family in possession of a house) could only enter into a mortgage with the written consent of the Minister for Lands. </PARA>
<PARA>If an Aborigine who wanted to build a house at Doomadgee or Hope Vale or somewhere like that after this legislation comes into being wanted to borrow some money from the Aboriginal Development Commission he could not do it without the written consent of the Minister for Lands. It is provided that:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Lands (and not just the trustees) may cancel any lease if he is satisfied its conditions are not being met. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, the Minister-not the Aboriginal councillors and not the owners of the place-has authority to cancel. So the people do not own the land under the proposal that is being put forward. The next provision is:</PARA>
<PARA> Any person whose lease is so cancelled is not entitled to any compensation for any improvements made to the land by him. </PARA>
<PARA>That is provided for in the Land Act under which the Queensland Government is going to give this deed of grant to the Aboriginal people with all these powers vested in the Minister. Let us take the situation of a group of Aboriginal people on, say, Bamaga, who decide to have a banana plantation, work their insides out, fall the scrub, grow the stuff, and do all the improvements. The Minister, in his absolute discretion, may suddenly cancel the lease. They will not be compensated for all the work they have done, for all the banana trees that are growing there or for all the fruit that may be on them because it involves the absolute discretion of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Legislation states that the police are empowered to remove any person whose lease has been terminated by the Minister for Lands. The Minister may whistle up the boys in blue and say: 'Get this Abo out of here'-that is the type of term I know he would use-'he is trespassing because I have taken his lease back.' The legislation states that the trustees-again in this case the Council-may not allow any person to occupy any land on a reserve for more than a month without prior consent in writing of the Minister for Lands. Gosh, the Minister is a great guy! He comes in on every crack of the whip. The legislation also states that if the trustees-again in this case the Council-be in default in regard to mortgage payments relating to reserve land, the land may be sold by the mortgagee. We have been trying to prevent that land being sold or repossessed in any shape or form so as not to alienate it from the Aboriginal people. The Minister may do this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act further states that the Land Court may hear an application by the Minister for Lands if he be of the view that the area of any reserve land exceeds that reasonably required for residence, et cetera, and the Court is to exercise any excess from the deed of grant. The Governor-in-Council may resume any land needed for public purposes, including airstrips, scenic purposes, camping places, departmental purposes, experimental farms, pasturage reserves, quarries, et cetera. The Government is not letting the Aboriginal people have the reserve lands at all because under this legislation it can do all these things. It can excise the land from the lease for airstrips. That is okay because the Aboriginal people may want an airstrip. What are scenic purposes, camping places, departmental purposes, experimental farms and pasturage reserves ? It means they could take half of, say, the area of the reserve lands of Doomadgee and lease it to a pastoralist because the Act states 'for pasturage reserves'. </PARA>

I have not yet found one section of the media that has not supported the kind of things we are asking for in Queensland: Security of tenure and the right to determine our own future as far as reserve lands are concerned. We do not want something that can be taken away at the drop of a hat or at the whim of a government, Cabinet, a Minister or the Premier.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0V4">Senator BONNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think I will need to do that at the moment. What do we come to? We come to this: The criterion that the Minister said the Commonwealth would accept is nowhere near what has been proposed by the Queensland Government . What should we do? In 1967-this has been said time and again-the people of Australia overwhelmingly supported a referendum giving the Commonwealth Government the power to make special laws for Aboriginal people. The Commonwealth Government has that power. If the criterion laid down by the Commonwealth Government is not met under these terms, the Government has no alternative but to exercise that power and to resume, under Commonwealth laws, those reserve lands and do what it did in the Northern Territory. I have some statistics of the area of land held by Aboriginal people. These statistics are contained in a speech which the Minister gave some time ago. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, representing 1.2 per cent of the population, now hold title to some 9.6 per cent of the land area. </PARA>
<PARA>I take it that he is speaking of the land area of Australia. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>They hold 738,032 square kilometres. More than half of it is inalienable freehold. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note that not one solitary acre, hectare or square kilometre of that land is in the State of Queensland; it is in the Northern Territory and South Australia and a small portion is in Victoria. Another interesting fact is that it was a Liberal Government that gave the land rights to the Northern Territory. It was a Liberal Government in South Australia that gave land rights to the Aboriginal people. It was a Liberal Government in Victoria that gave land rights to the Aboriginal people. None of the other States until now, including Queensland, has given one solitary hectare. Not an inch of that land is in my State of Queensland, despite the fact that all the Aboriginal people are asking for are the reserved lands that have been set aside for Aboriginal people for over 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA> All they are saying is: Now that you are abolishing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders legislation, you are throwing us out on their own, but do not throw us off our land. Let us retain our land.' All we are asking for is pure and simple justice. We have an area comprising 9.6 per cent of the total land mass of Australia-it sounds a lot in terms of smaller nations-but Australia was once wholly and solely owned by the indigenous people. All they have so far is 9 .6 per cent. All we are asking for in Queensland is approximately 1.2 per cent, and we cannot have that. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the Senate for its courtesy in listening to me, again in my perhaps emotional way. It is an emotional issue; it is something that is burnt indelibly on my heart and I cannot do otherwise than fight the only way I know, through this Parliament to ensure justice for those of my people who live in my State of Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take advantage of the first reading of these money Bills to carry on with a matter which I first outlined in the Senate on 23 February. Some honourable senators will remember that on that day I spoke about a blatant mail order fraud which was operating out of Queensland. Although the mail order company had its headquarters in Queensland, it was doing business throughout Australia. It was advertising in national magazines. Because it was advertising in respectable magazines people thought it was a respectable firm. In fact, it is a crooked firm. The firm I mentioned in particular was operating under the name 'June Taylor' and had a post office box at Spring Hill, an inner suburb of Brisbane. I do not think that 'June Taylor' is an actual person. The manager, or the person who has a close association with this firm, is a Mr Robert Clark, who lives in one of the Brisbane suburbs. This was all mentioned on 23 February and I do not intend to go over it again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mentioned on that day that the magazines that ran the advertisement for this person should have been more careful about the firm before they ran the advertisement because those who read the Australian Women's Weekly, for instance , would have thought that it is a respectable magazine and, therefore, the company must be a respectable one. I outlined last month that the Australian Women's Weekly found out that the firm was not respectable and it will not advertise for it any more. I also mentioned on that date that perhaps Australia Post should look into whether it should continue to give this person a post office box, but I do not know whether Australia Post can, in fact, do that. I mentioned that this misleading advertisement stated that 100 dolls would be available for the price of $19.95. I outlined how the advertisement was quite enticing and how people reading it may think that they would be getting a good deal in getting these 100 dolls that were supposed to please one's daughter or the girl next door. </PARA>
<PARA> I described to the Senate a couple of the dolls that 'June Taylor', which I think is an alias for Robert Clark, had sent to me. I held them up in the chamber. I remember Senator Kilgariff saying that he needed a telescope to be able to see these dolls from the other side of the chamber. They were not dolls, they were just plastic figures. He certainly would have needed a telescope to see them. To give some indication of the size of them I have brought a matchbox into the Senate chamber. One can see that they are not the height of a matchbox, so they are quite small. In fact, I could have put two of these figures into a match box and closed the matchbox quite easily. </PARA>

They were not anything like the dolls that this person was advertising. I thought that that was bad enough, but obviously what has happened is that 'June Taylor', in sending these figures, sent something which is quite different from what is usually sent because after I spoke in the Senate on 23 February a person who lives in Canberra came to me and said that he had ordered some of these dolls and he showed me some of the 100 dolls he had received in the post for $19.95. If Senator Kilgariff needed a telescope to see the other dolls from the other side of the chamber, he would need a more powerful one to see the 100 little dolls this person received. They are just plastic figures of the type that one might get in a cornflakes packet or a packet of weeties. As I hold them up against the matchbox, honourable senators can see that they are even smaller. The dolls are actually about two-thirds of the size of the matchbox. I have only three of them, but I have calculated that I could fit 12 of them into a matchbox, not just the two I was able to fit in earlier.</PARA></TALK.START>

The trade practices people and the consumer affairs people apparently find it fairly difficult to deal with this person because of the way he structures his advertisements.

If he is able to do that the other things that he is selling are probably just as bad.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will outline some of the things that he is selling so that people can beware of getting anything from this person. He is selling the Cross of Antron. I am not quite sure what the Cross of Antron is supposed to do, but it is supposed to be pretty good. The name on the acceptance form is not 'June Taylor'; it is ' Lydia Stalnaker, House of Isis, Box 533, Post Office, Fortitude Valley'. This is the same person. Lydia Stalnaker is supposed to be an ordained minister of the Knight Federation Church. The advertisement outlines the story of her amazing experience and how it led to the Cross of Antron. I think anybody who tries to get the Cross of Antron will get the same sort of deal as he would get with the 100 dolls. The Cross of Antron costs $19.95. It is amazing how everything seems to cost $19.95. One can also buy a powerful pyramid cruciform for $19.95. This can be purchased from Astro Enterprises, Box 315, Leichhardt Street, North Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA> I have here an advertisement for something that probably should be of interest to me, but I certainly will not be sending for it because I think I would be done. The advertisement states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Pill to End All Diet Pills! Doctors agree: It's the best diet pill formula ever! With the New Dyna-Slim Fat Liquidation plan featuring a remarkable Once-A- Day Tablet-years of accumulated fat are quickly washed away</PARA>
<PARA>That would be enticing to a person like me. A customer can get a full 21-days' supply for $5.95. If one wants a 63-day supply one can get that for $13.95. Again, I will not be sending for Robert Clark's diet pills because I think they would be just as good as these little plastic figures that he calls beautiful dolls. He has also through Space Optics, Box 533, Post Office, Fortitude Valley- this post office box number came up earlier-an advertisement for a powerful spy scope. Apparently, one can see up to miles away with this secret spy scope. This spy scope costs $9.98. It is said to be the 'Deluxe Super Power Model'. At the bottom of the advertisement for diet pills the coupon reads:</PARA>
<PARA> (Cheques 14 days--</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he waits until the cheque is cleared-</PARA>
<PARA> Cash and Money Order Orders immediate.)</PARA>
<PARA>Somebody who is finding things a little bit hard might be more interested in this: The product is available also from Post Office Box 533, Fortitude Valley. The advertisement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> For you, who know the feeling: 'If only I didn't have to worry about money!'</PARA>
<PARA>Your search has ended!</PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Solve all your money problems forever!</PARA>
<PARA>A person can solve all his money problems for $15. I would think that 'June Taylor' or Mr Robert Clark is probably trying to solve all his money problems forever. I think anybody who sends for this secret will probably get a pretty raw deal. From Post Office Box 533, Fortitude Valley-the House of Isis again-one can get a good luck charm for--</PARA>

<PARA> . . . and, if you try them and your good luck report is selected for publication, up to $1,000 is yours. </PARA>
<PARA>The words '$1,000 is yours' are emblazoned across his advertisement. I ask honourable senators to imagine how many of those advertisements he uses and how many amounts of $1,000 he gets rid of. Finally, we see a different name, that of Don Jefferies of Box 533, Post Office, Fortitude Valley-another alias, apparently, for Robert Clark. This advertisement is for the 'Holy Land Cross'. So one can buy the 'Holy Land Cross' from him. It brings good luck, happiness, health and success. One can buy this for $19.95. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention Robert Clark's products because they are probably as blatantly fraudulent as his 100 dolls, a dozen of which I could easily fit into a matchbox . I suggest that, having seen these advertisements which I had not seen when I raised the matter on the first occasion, Australia Post really should have a look at the activities of this person to see whether it can continue to allow him to have a post office box. This gives him some sort of respectability. If his advertisements stated that a person had to write to such and such an address in the Brisbane suburb of The Gap, where I believe Robert Clark lives, he might not get as many customers as he does. Because he has a post office box his business looks a little bit respectable. Australia Post really should have a look at this to see whether it can do something about it. In the meantime, I hope that some of what I said gets some publicity so that people know that 'June Taylor' is a fraud and that all of these other aliases are fraudulent. I hope that people will not send for articles from him. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally I think that many of those people who have sent for articles from a person like this really cannot be blamed. Many people in country areas have said to me that they use mail order forms because they cannot get to shopping centres in the way people in the cities can. Usually they obtain what they send for. It is unfortunate that firms like this which are so blatantly dishonest are giving the legitimate mail order firms a bad name. I certainly hope to see this person run out of business so that legitimate mail order firms can continue to give the service that a lot of people in the community deserve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity at the first reading stage of these money Bills to open up for discussion the report on alcohol, cannabis and heroin called Social Policies on Drugs and put out by the Australian Foundation on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence. The three drugs chosen were treated with varying priorities. In the report 2 pages were devoted to alcholol, 8 pages to cannabis and one page to heroin. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Workshop decided to spend a greater amount of its time in dealing with one drug in depth, rather than attempt to give superficial attention to the whole field. Cannabis was chosen as the drug for detailed consideration; however, the participants were also able to discuss alcohol and heroin and the conclusions reached have been recorded. </PARA>
<PARA>I, as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare, was one of the participants invited along. Unfortunately, the workshop met between 7 and 9 April and during the Senate sitting hours; so I was able to attend on only two occasions. When the workshop met it was obvious that I was not going to be in agreement. I asked the workshop members whether they would put in their introduction that I was not in agreement with many of the opinions expressed by them. They very obligingly did so. The workshop said also that other participants did not necessarily agree with all the matters contained in the statement. However, the statement represents a consensus and is put forward for discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> There were 13 participants. They were people who covered a very wide spectrum of our society. They made recommendations to the Government. I read from their news release which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The group believes possession, use and home-grown marihuana should be legal, as for beer. All other production would be prohibited and punished by law. </PARA>
<PARA>They suggest in the report:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) That for the production, manufacture and distribution of cannabis in Australia, a feasibility study be entered into with a view to creating a government monopoly and to ensure a standard and uniform quality; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) That research be conducted to complete data gaps concerning cannabis use . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They elaborate on that. They suggest also:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) That an Act similar to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act (UK) 1974 be legislated for . . . </PARA>
<PARA> I am completely opposed to the legalisation of home-grown marihuana for personal use and to an investigation into a monopoly by the Government of the production, manufacture and distribution of cannabis. First of all, let us look at the 'legal and home-grown' question. If we say that we will allow the use of home-grown cannabis to be legal, how many plants are we talking about? Nobody has suggested how many plants would be allowed to be home grown by one person or perhaps for family consumption. Nor has anyone suggested the variety of cannabis plant which should be allowed to be used. </PARA>
<PARA> The content of THC-the intoxicant of the cannabis plant-within the varieties which have been grown in Australia and America varies between nought per cent and 14 per cent. The working party has not suggested that we grow cannabis with only a certain THC content. It varies considerably. If we allow people to grow their own cannabis, we have to tell them that they can use only the dried leaves and that they must not use the rest of the plant, because the THC content of the flowering tops is considerably greater. If we allow people to use the resin of the plant and if we allow them to 'thrash' the plant, they can get hashish and hashish oil. Of course, there was no suggestion by the working party that hashish and hashish oil would be desirable things to legalise. The working party has very bravely said: 'We will allow people legally to grow their own marihuana '. It has completely ignored the fact that, once people are allowed to grow their own, we cannot possibly control what they do with that cannabis plant- whether they use the leaves, the flowering tops or the resin. </PARA>

<PARA> Let me go on to what we know about the plant cannabis or about marihuana. The working party admits openly on page 7 of its report that it knows very little about it. Indeed, it comments on the Eighth Annual Report to the United States Congress from the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare. It quotes from that report, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the present limited knowledge is often interpreted as indicating that marihuana is 'safe'. More accurately, there are many areas in which the parameters of risk are simply unknown . . . Among the long-term effects are possible lung damage in heavy users, possible genetic and chromosomal effects . . . The implications, if any, for humans are as yet unknown. </PARA>
<PARA>But the members of the working party say that they do not know much about it. In 1980 that annual report to the United States Congress, also stated a section not quoted in the report AFADD, it also said:</PARA>
<PARA> The chemistry of marihuana smoke has commanded considerable attention in recent years. Some 150 compounds have been identified in the smoke itself. One of them, benzopyrene, known to be carcinogenic, is 70 per cent more abundant in marihuana smoke than in tobacco smoke. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the carcinogenic compounds found in marihuana smoke is 70 per cent more abundant in it than in cigarette smoke. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very glad that Senator Tate has walked into the chamber because I know his attitudes in this area. Indeed, we will be debating this matter at the University of Tasmania on Monday week. So, I am giving the honourable senator the opportunity to get all the information possible from me to make some sort of effort to combat my argument. I have no problems in that area whatsoever. I am very happy for him to be sitting listening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The working party aclnowledged it knew very little about it. It did not evidently read on in that eighth annual report to the United States Congress far enough to see that it stated that there was 70 per cent more of a carcinogenic compound in marihuana smoke than in tobacco smoke. But it ends up by saying: 'We do not believe, in present knowledge, that the effects are worse than tobacco or alcohol'. Of course, it does say: 'If you legalise it, for heaven's sake you must put a health warning on the packet'. Then we will have to go through again what we are going through with tobacco! It is a quite incredible situation!</PARA>
<PARA> There are some things that we know about THC. We know that, unlike alcohol which is expelled very rapidly from the body, THC is stored in fatty tissues. We also know that THC, taken in combination with alcohol, has not just the doubling effect but a multiplier effect. We know that if someone smokes marihuana today, because THC is stored in the body there is a slow release over some time for up to a couple of weeks. We also know that if a person smokes marihuana today and goes on an alcohol binge in perhaps a couple of days, that person will not be quite sure how intoxicated he is when he gets into a car to drive. He knows that he he has had so much alcohol but has no idea how intoxicated the slow release of THC will make him. So, we have some sort of knowledge. As people have been using cannabis for many years, why do we not have more knowledge?</PARA>
<PARA> Because of new technology and new techniques for detecting and measuring cannabis products in the blood, we are now able to do research that previously was not available to us. It is a great pleasure for me to see former Senator Cavanagh sitting in the gallery because I know from past experience that he agrees with me in this area. The report for 1981 of the International Narcotics Control Board was released only on 28 January 1982, after the working party had made its deliberations. I quote a considerable amount of that report. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> While in some circles in a number of countries there remains an erroneous belief that cannabis is harmless, mounting scientific evidence shows significant health hazards resulting from cannabis abuse including cancer. On the positive side, there is also evidence in one country that publicising such research findings among a high risk youth population has led both to a somewhat diminished appeal of this drug and to a certain reduction of its use . . . the board wishes to recall that inadequate exercise of drug control on the part of one Government can affect the situation not only in that country itself, but also in other, particularly neighbouring, countries. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Board is there warning the Government that if we relax penalties it will not be just Australia that is affected but also neighbouring countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations has appealed that we do not do that. However we come then to the recent--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a report of the International Narcotics Control Board. It was released on 28 January 1982. There was an embargo on it until 28 January 1982. The report then mentions recent developments. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Board notes that the problem of cannabis and its products (including marihuana, hashish and hashish oil) continues to dominate the illicit traffic in many countries and that the non-medical consumption of cannabis is far higher than that of any other substance subject to control. Furthermore, the drug is being used in ever more harmful forms. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . Whereas marihuana, consisting mainly of dried leaves and stems, has a potency range up to 8 per cent THC, the solvent extracts of the leaf material, flowers or resin . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I have gone into this-</PARA>
<PARA>can have a potency of up to 60 per cent THC. Consumption of such potent cannabis , unavailable 10 years ago, has risen steeply. </PARA>
<PARA> In previous Reports the Board noted that increased cannabis consumption might reflect a widespread belief that cannabis is harmless. Accordingly, the Board called for accelerated scientific research to elaborate more definitive conclusions about adverse health consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to the various studies that have been undertaken and reported in the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Diverse studies carried out in a number of countries show that heavy cannabis use can produce acute psychotic reactions, lowered resistance to disease, and adverse effects on the reproductive and endocrine systems, the lungs and even on personality. Moreover, sophisticated pulmonary function testing in many well- controlled studies concludes that cannabis smoke is more injurious to the lungs than tobacco. Its smoke contains over 2,000 compounds. These include such well- known toxic agents as carbon monoxide and cyanide and . . . carcinogenic substances . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, these studies consistently conclude that cannabis use interferes with learning, with psycho-motor functions, with driving motor vehicles, and with doing any complex task. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of the research itself and the dissemination of its findings can help to alter the drug abuse picture. This is illustrated in the case of one high risk group, when such knowledge resulted in decreased cannabis use, showing that young people themselves respond to evidence of potential hazards. Therefore , Governments should take action to ensure that such evidence is made known to the public at large. They should also conduct research to enable them to monitor changes in national drug use levels and in related public attitudes and perception. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That one party might tell the Leader of the other party of the debate in this chamber, I think, is quite proper. Having now highlighted some of the more recent knowledge regarding the consumption of marihuana or cannabis, perhaps it would be right for me to get back to the report. On page 7, as I have already indicated, the report states that the Committee knows very little about it. Then they quote from the United States Congress report saying: We don't know much about it. They then go on to say: Because there is such a grey area and we do not know a great deal about it, then policies which are to be adopted should not be such as to increase dramatically the levels or duration of marihuana use. So they say: Good, we do not know a great deal about it; there is a great grey area out there. So we really should not have policies that would increase the use of marihuana. They then throw their arms in the air and say: But let us legalise it for personal use, let us allow people to grow their own. After all, we do not know a thing about it and we think that it is not any more harmful than alcohol or tobacco. That seems to me to be quite incredible, quite illogical and quite contradictory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As you may be aware, Madam Acting Deputy President, the Senate Standing Committee did some in-depth research in the area of this drug. We brought out a report entitled 'Drug problems in Australia: An intoxicated society'. At that time we had the same sorts of things brought to our attention as this Committee presently did. Its concerns were the same concerns as were expressed by the working party. The news release states:</PARA>
<PARA> On present medical knowledge, the group believes marihuana . . . is possibly less harmful than alcohol and tobacco . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But the latest report certainly rules that out. The news release states that the committee:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . could not accept the intolerable social costs related to prohibition- criminal syndicates and corruption in particular had to be destroyed. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Tate" NAMEID="NJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay, Senator Tate. The news release continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It also attacked society's double standards in condoning, and even encouraging the drugs of the older generation (e.g., alcohol, tobacco), while severely punishing those of younger Australians' (e.g. marijuana) actions which cannot be justified either ethnically or medically. </PARA>
<PARA>So they are saying that the adult population, because of its previous lack of knowlege in the area of tobacco, has had tremendous problems and shocking problems with its health. There is no need for me to inform the Senate today of those problems. They are well known to everyone. The adult population of Australia has had its problems and the cost to society generally is enormous. I do not believe that anyone in the Senate would have deliberately introduced tobacco hundreds of years ago had we had the foresight and the knowledge of the problems and effects that tobacco would have on our health. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not have the knowledge in relation to cannabis. It is coming out. For heaven's sake, do not let us make the same mistake and say to our young: 'Look, we do not know the problems that you will face with your health. We are just becoming knowledgeable about it. Results of research are coming out about it. But we do not care; we are not particularly concerned about your health. It is fair because we are ruining our health with tobacco products which we can no longer take away just because people are addicted to it that we say to you that we will legalise cannabis for you so that your health can suffer perhaps to a far greater extent by smoking this particular weed.' That was the main concern of the Committee. I want to quote from the remarks of one of the witnesses who came before the Committee when it was inquiring into drug problems in Australia. This was possibly one of the most enlightening comments we heard from anyone. He was a marihuana smoker. When asked to tell us the difference between cannabis and alcohol, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Cannabis differs from alcohol in one very vital aspect . . . If one is asked if one wants a drink there is no implicit inference that one will or should get drunk-however with Cannabis 'do you want a smoke' means 'do you want to get stoned'. The inference is direct, precise and almost always implicit. The act of getting stoned is very deliberate. It is shared in turns and in comparison with alcohol short and quick. Getting stoned is rarely incidental to smoking as getting drunk may be to alcohol. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that this report should be debated in the community. I believe the Government should make the facts available from the international report. If the report 'Social Policies on Drugs' has done nothing else it has brought forth further discussion enabling considerable new evidence to be brought to light which, according to the International Narcotics Control Board, every government in every country has a responsibility to bring before its people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak in the first reading debate on these money Bills which seek to increase certain levies, about the problems of small business and what small business runs into in the collection of a number of taxes, particularly sales tax. I take the example of a constituent of mine in Queensland whom I asked early last year to keep a record of the problems with which he found himself involved regarding the collection of such taxes. This constituent lives in a country town in Queensland, has invested his savings in that town and has established his family there. In seeking to expand his business, he became a manufacturer as well as a retailer. In Australian Taxation Office jargon he became a retailer-wholesaler.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> His special problems are with exemptions. He said, to use his words, that ' exemptions are the stuff-up'. He works in an area which has connections with agriculture, automotive electronics. In the case of agricultural exemptions he must claim from the original supplier. He is expected, therefore, to shuffle through several cubic metres of invoices, find the particular invoice and claim from the supplier quoting his invoice number, the part number, the make and the exemption number. Because his is a small business in a country town he must keep a fairly wide range of parts but he would not have a great turnover on some of them. Some of these parts may sit on a shelf for up to two years. He has estimated in his stocktaking that he would need to label over 5,000 individual items and that would have to label them with the name of the supplier, the invoice number, the cost price and the date of purchase. That is obviously a preposterous economic proposition for a small businessman involved in his type of industry. For every exempt retail transaction he is engaged in he is expected to fill out a certificate and is expected to know the part of the relevant Act under which that exemption is claimed. He also must be extremely careful because there is no redress from the customer in this type of transaction. It is virtually between him and the Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxation Office officials do not seem to understand the problems of small business in this country. For example, the businessman I am talking about often has to go to a farm. He may go there, for example, to fix a tractor and the owner may be away. Farmers have a fair idea of the areas in which they are exempt and therefore they expect to see the exemption noted at the bottom of the bill that is sent. My constituent mails out the bills with the exemption certificate if the farmers are not there when he does the work. Often farmers fail to return such certificates and the small businessman of whom I am speaking is then under an obligation under the Act to follow it up. It is his responsibility to get that done. If he fails to do so he is in breach of the Act . Every once in a while an official from the Taxation Office visits, goes through all the files and discovers that many of these cases have not been followed up. The businessman is then issued with a stern warning with possible threats of penalties and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> This happens not only to the single businessman of whom I speak but also to thousands upon thousands of small businessmen in this country. What we are talking about adds up to an enormous cost to small business, the largest employer in this country. After the small businessman has managed, if he can, to get over that hurdle of the exemption certificate he is not yet out of the woods -not by any means. Let us take another example that came out of this man's files . I will quote from the sales tax exemption certificate that the businessman fills out, giving examples of the types of insertions of detail provided by the constitutent:</PARA>
<PARA> I hereby certify that the 3 only horseshoe nails purchased from . . . on 2.2.82 is for use as a part of a horse for use in manure farming and exemption is accordingly claimed under item 117 (2) first schedule of the Sales Tax ( Exemption and Classification) Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The form is then signed and dated. Taking another item from my constituent's files, it reads:</PARA>
<PARA> One battery retainer bolt  20 cents  Less 30% trade  6 cents  Plus sales tax 2 cents</PARA>
<PARA>This may look fairly straightforward, but how much did the retainer bolt cost? Honourable senators should not forget what I was talking about at the beginning. The tax is based on what this retainer bolt cost. Did it come out of stock bought last June or last November when he also purchased some, or did it come out of the stock he bought last week when he also purchased some of these battery retainer bolts? In the above example the businessman determined that he owed the Taxation Office the princely sum of one cent on this transaction. Unfortunately for him, he cannot persuade his staff to do the necessary paperwork when he happens to be out fixing tractors. They give such items away free. </PARA>
<PARA> Their argument to my constituent runs as follows: 'If we fill out all of those forms for you to get one cent for the Government, you will lose less than your profit margin because we have not been able to work on the cars that are in your repair shop'. Therefore, they say to him 'It makes sense to give away the retainer bolt rather than to waste your time and our time filling out the forms' . While this particular businessman sees the merit in that point he is rather disconcerted that in order to collect 1c from the Government he must lose his 6c , 14c or whatever in profit on the item. After all, he is in business and he must stay in business. He must sell his goods at a reasonable profit margin. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the particular businessman of whom I speak also is rather industrious which is partly a downfall under this private enterprise government. He was determined not only to retail a range of goods but also-he feels now rather stupidly-determined to get into the manufacture of batteries. He sought to expand his business in the town and indeed, was able to provide additional employment for two people in his business in the manufacture of batteries. For this private enterprise crime of becoming a manufacturer and providing employment in a country town, he is attacked by the bureaucracy with an extraordinary amount of paperwork. Unfortunately, he manufactures hard rubber batteries. Since most of these are for agricultural machinery and are consequently tax exempt-again, unfortunately for him-he buys his component parts free of tax and adds tax to his batteries when a normal sales transaction occurs . </PARA>
<PARA> He also sells across the counter to other people who may come to buy a particular battery. The tax payable would normally be charged on the sale price but our businessman wholesales as well and the tax applicable is imposed at the lowest wholesale rate, according to the Act. As a consequence, all the batteries have to be wholesaled since to add the necessary tax would price his product- produced locally, providing local employment and assisting in decentralisation in this country-way above the price asked by a large manufacturer. Again the small businessman suffers. The businessman seeking to provide employment and business in a small country town suffers at the hands of large multinationals in this area. Perhaps he has not supplied particular political parties with sufficient funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Would it not make sense in relationship to this item to look at alternatives which may, if the Government wishes, raise the same amount of tax but not build into the whole methodology vast amounts of paperwork and vast costs? Would it not make sense to look at some other notions-for example, some type of turnover tax collected once a year when he puts in his submissions to the Taxation Office in the normal course of events? Would it not make sense to look at other types of options which may lessen the amount of paperwork imposed on businesses which are not geared to cope with that type of work. Of course, we saw as late as yesterday that the Government wished to press ahead with the establishment of sales tax on a further range of small businesses in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am suggesting a range of possible options that the Government may wish to look at. These are the types of options that it may be able to look at, in discussion and collaboration with the people of this country, to lower the amount of paperwork and bureaucracy. There are a range of options operating around the world which would be beneficial if applied to our small businesses. I am quite sure that in discussion with small business we would find many solutions. One of these, of course, may be to collect taxes-as I just said-only upon the tax returns that small businessmen have to put in each year. While that may deprive the Government of a continual flow of funds it may also save small businessmen enormous amounts of money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will take the example of an actual sales tax return from the person I am discussing. The businessmen had to claim $5 directly from the Taxation Office as a credit for goods purchased and the tax paid thereon by statutory bodies and by various government departments. He had to put in a further claim for $28.24 previously paid and which now could be claimed due to the price shifts plus late exemptions that arrived from a couple of farmers in the previous month. The businessman then had to tally all his retails sales for the month and add to this labour and other exempt portions of the wholesale section of the business he was so stupid to start. He then added to this the retail price of manufactured goods. Then he had to take off the wholesale selling equivalent and the sales tax. After that he had to remit $231.25 to the Government in sales tax . </PARA>
<PARA> However, if he had been allowed to take out of that amount costs of collection, in particular the cost of collection for this classic piece of bureaucratic paper shuffling-which I have already set out-and if he were actually able to charge the Government for his time in the same way that he charges people for batteries and to fix tractors-or charges anybody else for his labour-he would have remitted to the Government this month $39.25. I believe that would be equitable and fair. But the Government, being a great champion of free enterprise, of course wishes to make sure that small businessmen do not charge the Government for their labours. I believe it is perfectly reasonable that he should charge the Government if he is operating as an unpaid tax collector, in the same way that he charges someone to fix a tractor. His time is his livelihood; it does not belong to the Government. If the honourable senator sitting on the other side of the chamber who is laughing about this matter would like to talk to small businessmen he might discover that they would jump across the counter-not considering it a laughing matter-and do damage to his face. Small businessmen in this country are riled indeed at being imposed upon time and again and at being imposed upon yet again by the Government's seeking to raise additional taxes in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, the cost of collection in this month for the small businessman- the record of which he kept for my scrutiny and very carefully kept for his records-on $232.25 collected for the Government was $192. He cannot recoup that from his customers in that town. He cannot pass that amount on. I am sure that the Government would say 'Look, don't worry about it; just pass on the cost to the consumer'. He would be driven out of business and have to close down his manufacture of batteries because he could not compete. There would be a subsequent loss of employment in that country town. There would indeed be a loss in relation to the types of things that the Australian Democrats believe should be done in this country. We believe that every policy brought forward by this Government should make sure that we have not yet again penalised small business and prevented proper and adequate decentralisation. The last point I raise is one which I think needed to be raised in the Senate. It relates to the various proposals which the Government brought forward in the last Budget. Indeed, it is rumoured that the next Budget will attempt to bring them forward yet again. I will read from what a principal of one of the Brisbane primary schools had to say. She said:</PARA>
<PARA> You would know that children are requested to bring money to school for activities such as cultural visits, excursions. Any monies that are collected by the school other than P. and C. money have to be entered in our Internal Account which is subject to government audit. This requires teachers to have cash collection books and every cent that is produced by any child on any day has to be recorded in that book. At the end of the day that cash collection book has to go to the office and the administrator, usually the Principal, has to record teachers collections for every day, no matter how small or how large. A receipt has to be written for every teacher. This receipt is posted in the teacher's cash collection book by the administrator. The administrator then has to enter into a large analysis book the details of every receipt issued. This means that if you have eighteen teachers with eighteen classes and they are collecting for an excursion, children as you know do not all bring their money on the same day, so on each day over a period of several days the principal could be writing eighteen receipts, and you could write as many as eighteen receipts for ten days for a single excursion, and so you have then 180 entries detailing 180 receipts in your cash analysis book every time there is an excursion. If the principal is to keep further records for payment and recoupment of sales tax--</PARA>
<PARA>Which is the Government's proposition--</PARA>
<PARA>the situation is going to become impossible. </PARA>
<PARA>I raise those two items because it is a matter of how these various taxes are collected. I seek leave to continue my remarks late. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just as a British Labour Government cut off support for any equipment of British manufacture to the Australian forces during the Vietnam conflict-a move which failed and had to be withdrawn owing to the forthright action of the Australian Prime Minister of the day-we now have the totally untenable position of having a piece of major equipment of great complexity in need of assured spares support dependent on the political views of the British Government of the day. There is no problem with the present British Government. It would sell arms to any country in the world but times and attitudes change and we want support for this ship for 20 years. It must be a condition of sale that the British Government gives an unqualified undertaking to provide full support for the life of this ship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not my intention now to go into a technical debate. I would be delighted to do so but in 10 minutes I cannot. However, I heard members of the Australian Labor Party debating the ship's radar in the other place. The move to transfer the identification of friend or foe equipment from Melbourne to the Invincible is a perfectly reasonable one. It is just adding a function to the existing radar equipment. While I have had no first hand experience of the radar in the Invincible, my belief is that it would be as good as any in the world, knowing the manufacturers and the state of the art of the British in this field. In the absence of a clear statement from the Department of Defence as to the strategic concept of operations for the Australian defence forces, one is at a loss to see the use of a ship such as the Invincible. All it provides is a platform for some anti-submarine warfare helicopters. We have to demonstrate some capability in ASW so that we are not held to ransom or blackmailed too easily by any country with a missile firing submarine. On the other side of the coin, if all we want is a platform for ASW helicopters and a ship with command, control and communications functions, then there are ways of buying this at a fraction of the cost. </PARA>
<PARA> My worries about this ship go back to its basic design. It was built for a specific role. It was to be an advanced ASW ship to operate under the protection of land based aircraft, to be an integral part of a complex fleet with all the sensors required. The Royal Australian Navy wants to use it in an entirely different role as a capital ship in a task force. In any list of worries about the decision, one certainly has to include the objectivity of the RAN and its ability to decide in the national interest. The only doubt that I do not have about the Navy's senior officers is their sincerity, for they really believe that what they are doing is correct. The purchase of this ship sets in an inflexible mould the maritime responses possible to Australia for the next 15 or 20 years. If the decision is correct, then everything is fine, but if it is not then we are in big trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> Every analysis performed by the Department of Defence of the provision of this type of ship for Australia-I instance the Naval Tactical Air Power at Sea Study- has emphatically shown that this type of ship was the least cost effective and the least appropriate option available to the forces. The greatest fear of all, though, relates to the vulnerability of this ship. For defence, it has only decoys and an area defence missile system in the form of the Sea Dart, which is quite useless against sea skimming missiles. Even if the close-in weapons system Phalanx is fitted, this is not a secure system. When it works it is very effective but it can never be 100 per cent effective and even if it could be, simultaneous multiple missile attacks would overwhelm it. Looking ahead a few years to when missile speeds will possibly treble to Mach 3, target acquisition, electronic counter measures and anti decoy features will be refined, radar stealth technology will be incorporated and the advantage which already lies with the attacker will be even stronger. This is a very high risk venture. Frankly, I do not believe in gambling with the security of the nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a fairly bland and brief report which conceals a fairly turbulent history, in particular the resignation of a former director of the Australian Capital Territory Legal Aid Commission, Mr Peter Sharkey, following a long history of conflict with the private profession in the Australian Capital Territory and a good deal of frustration within the Commission. The report makes no reference to the subsequent appointment, following Mr Sharkey's departure, of Mr Wheeler as the Director of Legal Aid in the Australian Capital Territory, notwithstanding the view that is held in many quarters that this appointment was , for a number of reasons, less than entirely just to Mr Tony Hardiman of the existing Commission. Generally, a most unhappy set of events has surrounded the operation of the Austalian Capital Territory Legal Aid Commission and that has to some extent been the subject of exploration within the Senate Estimates committees. As I have said, it is in some ways surprising that so little of that history is evident in the text of the report before us this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> Even so, the report on its face demonstrates a number of unhappy features about the operation of the legal aid system. For example, it reveals on page 2 that the staff ceilings within the Commission have been a continuing problem involving a reduction from 33 to 29 office bearers in the period between mid- 1980 and the end of 1981-approximately 12 per cent of the resources of the Commission. The squeeze is on, and with the demand for legal aid continuing to rise, cuts of this kind inevitably restrict the proportion of the work which can be done by salaried practitioners. As we have argued so often in this place, that is the only way in which a rational system of legal aid can be delivered in this country, given scarce resources and ever increasing demand. It is a matter for regret that the razor gang exercise late in 1981 further applied a cost squeeze and has produced considerable internal tension within the Commission which is not recorded-because of the chronology, I suppose-in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the membership of the Commission, which is dealt with on page 1 of the report, also justifies some comment. There have been significant changes in the composition of the Commission, notably involving the replacement of two community representatives with two nominees of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). This has created a situation of, again, some conflict of an unfortunate kind which perhaps bears further explanation, as no doubt it will receive in the Estimates Committee hearings of this Parliament shortly. There is no proposal currently on foot to ensure that a commisioner is appointed who can represent the staff of the Commission. There have been repeated calls for this by the staff, by the unions and by certain members of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly. These calls have been met with point blank refusals by the relevant authorities. That again is a matter of regret so far as the Opposition is concerned. Another aspect which justifies comment on the operation of the Australian Capital Territory Legal Aid Commission is the way in which the private profession in the Australian Capital Territory has less than gloriously continued to campaign actively against the position of the Public Defender, a full time officer, in effect, of the present Commission. I note with some pleasure that this attack seems to have been beaten off at present but it can by no means be assumed, given the history of this Commission in a whole variety of contexts, that that situation will continue. I am advised that the relationship has improved recently but that relationship, I fear, will always be a relatively delicate and volatile one, given what seems to be the prevailing attitude in the profession in the Australian Capital Territory which is one of something less than a total acceptance of the values of the purpose for which the legal aid system in the Australian Capital Territory and elsewhere was set up. There are some concerns arising from the financial aspects of this report. Approximately $ 90,000 is still outstanding from liabilities accrued in 1978-79 as at the end of the 1981 financial year. Also it is recorded on page 8 that the total liabilities, mainly in the form of commitments to private practitioners, are well in excess of the total assets of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other points that can be made in respect of the Commission, but in deference to the agenda of this chamber I will not stop to make them now. I simply repeat that the Australian Capital Territory Legal Aid Commission has been something of a volatile organisation in recent years, deservedly receiving a good deal of criticism from a variety of sources, not least from the community it purports to serve. We in the Opposition have been unhappy about it. We will continue to be unhappy about a number of aspects of it. It would help in the future, in perhaps a slightly more detailed debate than is possible tonight, were the report of the Commission to be a little more forthcoming about some of these issues that have been controversial within the Australian Capital Territory, and this one is controversial. </PARA>

<PARA> That all Bills and amendments to Bills introduced into the Senate from the commencement of the Budget Session 1982 should be accompanied by a financial impact statement which shall contain the following information for each of:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) the balance of the financial year; and (2) the following two financial years-</PARA>

<PARA>This motion provides that from the date a Bill or an amendment to a Bill is introduced into the Senate, as from the commencement of the next session-in other words, the Budget session for 1982-all Bills and amendments should be accompanied by what I have called a financial impact statement. I did not devise those words; others devised them and I have adopted them. That statement would contain financial information in relation to the Bill being introduced. I have detailed the five items which I think should be included: The estimated costs to government, if any; the estimated revenue of government, if any; the estimated savings of government, if any; the estimated financial burden, if any, which will be imposed on industry or other sections of the community; and the estimated savings, if any, which will be of benefit to industry or other sections of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the purpose of this proposal is obvious. It has been concerning me for many years that the Parliament considers legislation without any real knowledge of what the cost of that legislation will be to both the Government and to the community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Teague said, we need to know. I thoroughly agree with him. Frequently, if we ask, the information is supplied to us, but it does require someone to ask. Often the cost is foreshadowed in the Budget statements. I have no doubt that if any honourable senator wishes to know the cost to government, the estimated revenue of government, the estimated savings to government-in other words, the first three items mentioned in my proposed financial impact statement-he can obtain it fairly easily from the Ministry or by asking in this chamber at some stage during the course of the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The kernel of my proposal is set out in the last two items; in other words, those which talk about the financial burden or savings for industry and other sections of the community. We can appreciate that an assessment of the direct cost to the public of some such legislation is frequently available. For example , a taxing Bill can be assessed as to the direct cost, but my financial impact statement asks that we go further and find out the indirect costs of compliance. We now protect civil liberties. We have the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee and the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee which look to protect civil liberties within the community. We have environmental impact statements to protect the environment. But frequently, although we all-when I say 'all' I mean all parliamentarians-believe that we are here to protect the taxpayers, the voters and the consumers within the community, legislation passes through the chambers without the financial impact of that legislation being adequately understood by the legislature. </PARA>
<PARA> I openly acknowledge that the problems of assessment of a financial impact statement may not be easy to solve. I recognise that governments have limited resources but it seems to me that the best institution to provide this information is government. I am grateful to my colleague Senator Missen who suggested to me that we give consideration to adopting the procedures in the United States. In the United States there is a Congressional Budget Office which produces a budget for the Parliament in parallel with the budget produced by the Executive. The Parliamentarian, when discussing the Congressional Budget Office, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Still another support agency for the legislative branch appeared in 1974--</PARA>
<PARA>This was in the United States-</PARA>
<PARA>namely the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) established by the Congressional Budget Act. While responding to requests for specific analysis, the most important responsibility of the CBO is to prepare a congressional budget in parallel with the executive budget. A foresight provision is also included in the Act, directing the CBO to issue in each fiscal year a five-year projection of the costs of continuing current federal spending and taxation policies. For any public Bill or resolution reported by a congressional committee, a five-year estimate of cost must also be made. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators can see that that Congressional Budget Office must have a very large staff and must produce financial information which is absolutely invaluable to the United States Congress. But I must say that in these years of restraint I could not support the establishment of such a committee at this stage. I hope that if the Senate adopts this motion which I have proposed and if the Government is able to provide reasonable and adequate estimates-they are only estimates, and I recognise the difficulties of them-this Parliament may not have to go down that path. The cost of legislation and regulation and the uncosted cost of such legislation and regulation may indeed be very great. There has, in fact, been an attempt to estimate that cost by the Confederation of Australian Industry which, in July 1980, published a paper on Government Regulation in Australia. On page 76 of that paper the Confederation gave estimates, based on certain figures which are set out on previous pages. The Confederation's paper states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . then direct private sector compliance costs might be of the order of:</PARA>
<PARA> $720m for Federal regulation;</PARA>
<PARA> $1,744m for State government regulation; or some $2,500 million in total. </PARA>
<PARA>The CAI paper goes on to say that those figures are highly qualified. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> It must be emphasised that no validity can be claimed for the above figures, since we have no way of knowing if the compliance costs of survey respondents are representative of private sector compliance costs in general. However, we consider that the above figures are likely to be minimum figures for direct compliance costs attributable to the 3 or 4 Federal and State government agencies most affecting each survey respondent. </PARA>
<PARA>I have personal knowledge of a very substantial expense created by a regulatory body. During the Estimates committee meetings in April 1981, the committee that I was chairing heard from the Public Service Board about an additional estimate of some $2,400 to enable the Public Service Board to provide certain information which had been sought from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I questioned an officer, through the responsible Minister, about this matter and ascertained that staff had to work overtime to fill out this questionnaire and to obtain the information that had been asked and that the Public Service Board estimated that it would cost $2,400 in additional payments. That seemed to me to be a very substantial sum just to fill out a questionnaire and it was done by an organisation which, no doubt, has access to computers and all sorts of machinery means of obtaining this sort of information. I went on to ask how many of these questionnaires had been sent out in Australia. Of course, the Public Service Board was not aware of that. Later I had the fortune also to have members of the Australian Bureau of Statistics come before the committee. What I questioned them about that statistical report and survey I discovered that it had gone out to about 10,000 to 12,000 businesses across Australia. Based on the estimate of the Public Service Board, to complete this report and survey industry in Australia had had imposed upon it a burden of between $24m and $28m. This was for a pilot survey. This had gone through certainly without the Parliament knowing about it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, Senator Chipp, I am unable to recall, but it is recorded in Hansard of April 1981. I do not doubt that it was a very valuable pilot survey. It may well be that it was reasonable for the ABS to seek that information. I am not being critical in that sense. I am simply pointing out that industry in Australia had been confronted with a bill of, say, $25m which it was unable to meet. If we analyse the situation, that really means that the consumers will ultimately have to pay another $25m. That is one example which comes readily to mind. Unfortunately, the proposal which I have put tonight will not, in fact, cover that because I am dealing only with legislation. That was done in another way. Clearly, there are major problems in connection with costs incurred by or burdens placed on industry and the community through regulations and through the actions of statutory authorities and governmental bodies, not only just by regulation but also in some other way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has to be realised that the burden is frequently different, depending upon which body is asked to provide the information. It may well be that the Public Service Board, for example, with its access to computers and all other items, is able to provide information that is sought in such a way cheaper than it would be for a small business which does not have the staff involved in administrative and clerical work able to provide the information. Of course, I have little doubt that that statistical report and survey which went out from ABS did not, in fact, go to small businesses but went to major businesses which probably had the capability of supplying the information. I understand that at a subsequent stage that survey was not continued with but was withdrawn when it was realised how difficult it was to provide the information. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want the Senate to think that I am criticising the ABS or any other body in connection with that. I am not talking about that at all. I am talking about that purely and simply as an example of the sort of cost which the community can have imposed upon it without the legislature really being aware of this expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> I had a quick look through the Bills Digest today and I looked at some of the Bills which have come before this Parliament and about which perhaps we ought to have known something of the costs, both direct and indirect. For example, there is a Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Amendment Bill. The purpose of that Bill is to clarify the Government's original policy intention in regard to the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act 1980. It would be more than very interesting to know, I think it is probably essential that the Parliament ought to know, not only what would be the cost to government of that sort of legislation but also what might very well be the cost to industry and, ultimately, the consumer for this legislation to go through the Parliament. It seems to me to be very reasonable to ask the Government to provide some estimate of the cost. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise, as I said before, that it may be difficult to make an estimate but I suggest to the Senate that until such time as the Government starts to make these estimates we will not know whether it is extremely difficult. As it starts to make these sorts of estimates the Government's officers will become much more expert at making the estimates. I would have no objection to the Minister responsible openly saying in the Senate that this was just a best guess based on the information available; but surely it is better that the Senate knows what is the Government's best guess in relation to this matter than that the Senate passes the legislation without having any of the knowledge at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the proposal would receive wide support from industry. When I gave notice of the motion I received letters from a number of bodies congratulating me on the proposal-from companies indicating that they thought that it was an excellent idea. I had correspondence with the CAI indicating that it supported the idea. I believe that industry throughout Australia would do its best to provide the Government with the answers as to cost which it needs to make on these estimates. Of course, industries frequently lobby us and tell us what they estimate the cost of some legislation will be if they are trying to stop it. That would be, in my view, a countering measure so that we had a government estimate rather than just an industry estimate of what the cost would be. The first paragraph of the Australian Industries Development Association's Bulletin for February 1982 in relation to the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System states:</PARA>
<PARA> The philosophical basis underlying the recommendations of the Campbell Committee is 'that the most efficient way to organise economic activity is through a competitive market system which is subject to a minimum of regulation and government intervention'. </PARA>
<PARA>It is that regulation and government intervention that I am interested in analysing and having costed. I believe that public disclosure of this information would enable honourable senators to consider the financial implications in their decisions. It would provide much more effective debate in the chamber about the legislation being introduced. I ask the Senate to accept the motion standing in my name. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I congratulate my colleague Senator Lewis on his initiative in bringing forward this motion tonight covering financial impact statements which will accompany Bills passing through this chamber. I believe that should the Parliament accept the general tenor of the intent of this motion, it will, indeed, be breaking new ground and opening up new developments. I use the term 'general tenor' of the motion because I think as this debate continues it may be found necessary to develop forms of words that may have a greater practicality in implementing the whole intent of what Senator Lewis is bringing forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The difficulties that I see are basically in paragraphs (d) and (e) where we call on industry to provide estimates. In this area I think it will be very difficult even to get good guesses. I regard this motion tonight as part of a growing sophistication or our parliamentary processes whereby this Parliament demands that it be much better informed so that it can make a more informed judgment on Bills which pass through this House. All too often, I think, we have seen hasty legislation come before us based on little more than temporary political expediency. I believe that this sort of requirement could act as a check or as a brake. At least somebody in the chamber should say: 'Shouldn't we consider the cost not only to government-be it Federal, State or local-but also to the community which we are supposed to serve?'</PARA>
<PARA> At other times I think parliamentarians have a rush of enthusiasm to put into a legislative framework many of their good intentions without realising again the cost to government and the cost to the community. Not only our Government but also all governments throughout the world are finding it increasingly difficult to balance Budgets. Indeed, all governments are finding it difficult to reduce public expenditure. At the same time, because of what is known as the tax revolt that is occurring around the world, governments are finding it difficult to obtain revenue. I think this is a good check and balance process which is required of all parliaments. If we can introduce something along these lines we, and particularly Senator Lewis who has moved this motion, will have offered a very constructive contribution to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is not beyond the powers of the Department of the Treasury or the Department of Finance to be able to give us an estimate of the cost to government. I do not believe it is beyond the powers of Treasury or Finance to give an estimate of revenue to government. I think we have to try to measure what can be measured initially because, after all, this is a starting point. Senator Lewis referred to best guesses probably being better than none. But I think possibly we should start from the approach of trying to measure those things that can be measured. I think that when one analyses a lot of these matters one finds that there is a heck of a lot that can be measured that currently is not measured and which we do not attempt to measure. I think we are all looking for savings to government. We have a number of committees of Parliament, like our Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts, other expenditure committees and the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, which devote a great deal of time and attention to these matters. I believe that here is something that we can achieve within the parliamentary process before the Bills get off the ground-in other words, before the damage is done. My reservations are in relation to the fourth and fifth financial years which follow those provided for in the motion, and the estimated financial burden which will be imposed on industry or other sections of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that there will be occasions when it is impossible for Budget Bills to be referred to industry because of the secrecy provisions that are essentially required. I believe that we run into a problem here. I think it is not beyond us to devise ways and means of trying to get over this approach- possibly, this is where Senator Lewis made reference to the best estimates that may be necessary in relation to the charges which are imposed on industry. In the circumstances where there are Budget Bills we cannot really ask industry what will be the cost to industry of a matter that comes through under the Budget. At the same time, I do not think we could ask industry the savings which would be of benefit to the community or sections of the industry as a result of Budget-type measures. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we could get some estimate by approaching such bodies as the Australian Minerals and Energy Council, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Confederation of Australian Industry and these sorts of bodies to attempt to assess the costs or financial burdens of the legislation that we are likely to introduce. The community would have difficulty, I believe, in assessing the likely impact. We find this in many pieces of legislation that currently pass through this House; the Bills may have lain on the table for quite some time. It is not before the Bills are put into practical effect and have an impact on our day to day lives that the people in the community suddenly realise the costs or the savings that those Bills might generate. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that we might try to ask for this information in advance unfortunately there is not a lot of forward planning or thinking as to how these Bills will impact financially on our lives. We can take a guess but it is not really until we get into the practical reality of living it out on a day to day basis that the full cost and the full impact will come before us. the estimates will not be all that accurate initially but I think as time evolves we will develop processes whereby our sophistication in measuring these impacts on the community will develop. Therefore, I would like to see further debate on and reason brought into this matter so that we can get the right ultimate form of words which will develop, I believe, in time. This is undoubtedly a wonderful starting point and I commend the motion wholeheartedly to the Senate. </PARA>

Superficially what Senator Lewis has said is sound; I do not know whether I can assail the logic of any of the arguments he has put tonight. But there are some difficulties as far as some honourable senators are concerned, particularly those honourable senators who are not Ministers or who are not on the Government side. For Senator Lewis's system to work it would need to have the total co- operation of the Government. From the way he spoke he seemed to indicate that he was talking essentially about Government Bills. I remind him that an increasing number of Bills coming before this place are coming from private senators, not only from the Opposition side but from the Government side as well. I think this is a healthy sign. One hopes that more and more Government senators will introduce private member's Bills now. Before we vote for something like this, we would like to be satisfied that, if we produced a private member's Bill and went to the particular Minister for the information that Senator Lewis quite properly asks for, it would be readily forthcoming.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought that we were conducting a reasonably intelligent interchange, but Senator Lewis is going back to that point. I am trying to argue the substantive matters in the motion. Let me give an example of how governments do not co-operate with private members. There may be several reasons for this; it may be sheer pressure of work. My colleague Senator Mason is trying to produce a private member's Bill dealing with rainforest preservation-a Bill of some substance that would interest many honourable senators on both sides of the Senate. He went to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and asked whether he could have some assistance in drafting this Bill. This is only the drafting of a Bill; we have not even got to the stage of getting a financial impact statement. The Attorney-General was very courteous and said: 'We are busy; I do not know. But let us look at what you want to put in the Bill and if it is acceptable we will then put it in the queue for Parliamentary Counsel to draft'. That is not good enough.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Watson has just made an extraordinarily valuable suggestion. This is one of the fine tunings or refinements that could have come about had Senator Lewis's proposition been contemplated in a proper way by the various parties here before tonight. In the event, my colleague Senator Mason has had to go to a private lawyer to have a private member's Bill presented to this Senate. I am not alleging that the Government is ganging up or being beastly or unco-operative. It is simply the system that just does not work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Lewis will recall that I had before the Senate a private member's Bill for placing a tax on the advertising of alcohol to provide a fund out of which ' If you drink, do not drive' advertisements might be placed in the electronic media. Such a tax should appeal to my friend Senator Martyr, one of the most temperate and virtuous people in the place. Before such a Bill could be produced , Senator Lewis would quite properly want the estimated cost to the Government, the estimated revenue for the Government and, as Senator Watson said, more importantly the estimated burden on industry and the estimated savings. Those are vital factors and Senator Lewis says quite rightly that those figures ought to come from the Government, not from industry. I can imagine the sorts of figures I would get from the breweries. In fact I know the sort of response I would get if I went to the breweries for such information. The provision of such information would be an additional burden on the Government. If Senator Lewis's proposition were accepted, we on this side of the Senate would want guarantees that we would get exactly the same priority of treatment and the same value of treatment from parliamentary officers, as Senator Watson suggests, as would a Minister when he or she presented a Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I receive Senator Lewis's point. I do not agree with it because we would then have in this place first-class Bills and second-class Bills. A Bill that did not have a Government imprimatur or Treasury imprimatur would be wrecked. We would have that old game which is played in this place and which I denounce of governments and Ministers using the public servants for their own political purposes. If what Senator Lewis suggested happened, for example, if I estimated what this would cost the liquor industry, to use the same analogy, and if the Government, did not accept or want to accept those Bills, it would go to its officers in the Treasury or whatever department and in a flash get from them a figure that could destroy the figures that I had worked months to get. The Government could get from Treasury any sorts of figures that it wanted. In saying that I am not casting any reflection on a Treasury officer. But the Government could get any figures from Treasury on any matter depending on what criteria were put to Treasury. That is why it is a joke at election time in this country when the government of the day-no matter whether it be Liberal or Labor- can always get Treasury officials to make the Opposition's figures look ridiculous. Treasury officials and officials of the Department of Finance are all honourable, decent and honest people. They would be responding to the set of criteria given to them by the Minister. So a decent, honourable and honest Minister like Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle could well stand up and say that the figures put down by Senator Grimes on the estimates for a reform in social services are absolutely wrong because the Department of Finance officials have said so and produce the document to prove it. Senator Grimes and everybody else knows that the sets of criteria that the Minister has given to the department are different sets of criteria to those which Senator Grimes, as Opposition spokesman on social welfare might have laid down. So the compromise that, Senator Lewis puts forward about senators on this side of the House producing their own figures has it basic weakness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have nothing to add except to say that I am sorry that Senator Lewis is naive enough to believe that there will be a vote tonight. My experience in my short time in this place is that if one wants a private member's motion to get through on a Thursday night one has to pay the courtesy of approaching other senators in other parties and senators in one's own party. As I understand it, Senator Lewis has not got the agreement of his own party that there will be a vote taken on this matter tonight. I have a great deal of sympathy for him because I think he has performed a great service in doing this. But at this stage, before I sit down-I do not know whether I speak for the Australian Labor Party, but I think I do-if Senator Lewis forces a vote now he will get a negative vote, for the reasons I have given, from the Democrats and probably a negative vote from the Labor Party. If he agrees to defer it he will have our assistance. I give this guarantee to the Minister and to the Whip and ask them to restore this matter to the Notice Paper for a decision at some time in the future. Mr Deputy President, I seek your guidance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In common with other senators who have spoken, I welcome the discussion that has arisen from Senator Lewis's motion. I think in the short debate that has been held some very useful points have been made. Senator Lewis's motion is that all Bills and amendments to Bills brought into the Senate be supported by a financial impact statement that provides estimates of gains or losses of government revenue and the cost and the recurring annual costs to the Government, industry and other sections of the community in implementing the legislation. Senator Lewis has had this notice on the Notice Paper for some time. He has given considerable attention to the matter. I have had discussions with him. I remember that last year we discussed it. I think he, at one time, felt that every Bill that was brought in ought to have a clause in it with the financial implications in the Bill. We then discussed whether the second reading speech of a Minister ought to have this type of information in it. We have now heard tonight what he believes would be the effect of the provision of a financial impact statement in the form that he has suggested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A second reading speech, I think, as he said earlier, should provide estimates in the first, second and third years of operation in respect of any costs, revenue and savings to the Government and of financial burdens and savings to industry or other sections of the community. These matters were discussed between us last year on a number of occasions. I believe that as a general principle, disclosure of information concerning government costs, revenue and savings expected to arise from proposed legislation leads to more informed parliamentary debate. Where proposed legislation is expected to have significant effects on the Government, it is already common practice for Ministers to disclose that fact and to provide any estimates that can be reliably made. I think we are all aware that many second reading speeches do have the proposed anticipated costs of a particular provision in the year in which it is introduced and then the full year costs are often given. Equally, if it is a Bill affecting the raising of revenue, similar figures would be provided as reliably as possible at the time of the second reading speech. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that honourable senators will appreciate, however, that there are good and sufficient reasons for not making public comprehensive financial estimates for a series of years. These reasons were set out in detail in a statement made in another place on 4 March 1980 by the former Minister for Finance, the late Mr Eric Robinson, in response to the report of the House of Representative Standing Committee on Expenditure entitled 'Parliament and Public Expenditure'. That debate and his comments were recorded on page 581 of Hansard for 4 March 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, the Government's forward estimates are necessarily based on current knowledge and are subject to substantial uncertainties. If the figures are disclosed they could lead to rigidity in expenditure because of the implicit commitments particular interest groups tend to read into such figures no matter how much they are qualified. As a result, the Government's budgetary flexibility could be severely curtailed to the detriment of the responsible conduct of economic policy. In a few cases, there could be objections to disclosing even first year estimates, for example where a measure has sensitive foreign relations implications. In other cases, such as omnibus legislation, first year estimates may be impossible to calculate with any accuracy or only with an unwarranted allocation of scarce departmental resources to the task. Nevertheless, having said those things, I am basically in sympathy with the suggestion that government costs and revenue information be provided wherever appropriate. I do believe that the Senate has made a significant contribution to requiring that information in the Estimates committees which we hold for the Budget Bills and for the Additional Estimates each year. I think the probing by honourable senators on costs and, if applicable, the savings, does lead to a great deal more information being provided over the years by the departments as they seek the approval of the Senate for their estimates and their appropriations. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it generally would not be possible to provide information about the financial costs and savings for industry or other sections of the community. Many government measures involve costs to some sections of the community and benefits to others, often of an indirect kind. But the net impact, whether in the aggregate or for particular sections, cannot usually be measured with any precision. I think it is in this area that I would perhaps find more difficulty in being able to provide the sort of information that Senator Lewis is seeking in the motion. Undoubtedly there are costs to industry in the preparation of applications for some of the government programs. There are requirements of government, requirements of the Australian Statistician and those sort of things . I think modern government probably has brought about a fairly active form filling process in industry and community groups. </PARA>
<PARA> For me to estimate that sort of information or for the Government to estimate it would lead to a lot of assumptions that may not always provide the accuracy that it may be felt could be usefully extracted when any measure was introduced. To attempt to make such estimates which might be entirely misleading could be a costly and complex process necessarily involving consultation with bodies outside the Government. This, of course, would not absolve the Government from the need, when formulating legislation, to take account of the assessed impact on industry or other sections of the community. I recall that during Question Time in this place just a day or two ago I was asked a question regarding, I think, the collection of tax in one form or another, the administrative costs involved in collecting that tax and whether some attempt was being made to equate the administrative costs with the tax that might be collected. That could be done where an internal matter was involved but for the Government to assume the costs that industry might have in the preparation of its tax return and all that sort of thing would lead to a lot of generalisation and assumption that may not necessarily be entirely accurate. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, Senator Lewis and I have had discussions about his motion. I have written to him indicating that I will be seeking the views of the Government on a proposal that-with a view to meeting as far as possible the need he has identified-in future the financial impact of proposed legislation be included in a Minister's second reading speech where it is practicable and appropriate to do so, giving estimates that can reliably be calculated in respect of any significant costs, revenue and savings to the Government arising directly from that legislation. I think that what I have just said indicates to Senator Lewis and to the other honourable senators who have expressed interest in Senator Lewis's motion that, as far as practicable, the Government would attempt to meet the requests of the motion in future proposed legislation so that it could give an outline of the sorts of costs involved. As I have said, on many occasions this already occurs. </PARA>
<PARA> With those remarks, I just say that I welcome the debate that has been held on this motion. I hope that an active interest in Senator Lewis's motion might lead us all to having better information and more financial guidance on legislation that is proposed by government. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate requests that the Prime Minister table the statement of pecuniary interests provided by the former Member for Curtin as Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs; in particular, that the Prime Minister make public details of the financial affairs of the former Minister in so far as they relate to the disposal of the companies Stirling West Pty Ltd, Greenbank Pty Ltd and Frederic Salon Pty Ltd, and their association with the companies Hulldale Pty Ltd and Rickford Administration Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA>I gave notice of this motion more than a year ago. At the time notice of that motion was given, the honourable member for Curtin was Mr Ransley Victor Garland who at that time was the High Commissioner designate to London. He has since been knighted, an action which I might say tarnished any vestige of gilt-spelt g -i-l-t-that may have been attached to imperial honours. There has been a multitude of pious statements, particularly from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) about the maintenance of ministerial propriety in the Fraser Government. I select only one of dozens that could have been selected for mention. On 12 March 1978 the Prime Minister said in an electoral broadcast:</PARA>
<PARA> My Government has demonstrated again and again our fundamental commitment to restoring integrity to public administration in Australia. Our record in this regard is without parallel in our history. </PARA>
<PARA>The accuracy of the second sentence could not be justifiably disputed-that is that the record of this Government in the area of ministerial propriety is without parallel in our history. It certainly is. But the first sentence with its reference to a fundamental commitment to restoring integrity to public administration in Australia, as with all areas of the Fraser Government, is a piece of rhetoric which has not been matched by performance. Of course, the most frequent and spectacular breaches of ministerial propriety under this Government have been committed by members of the Country Party or the National Country Party-whatever it calls itself these days. The present Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) on his own admission is still the custodian and beneficiary of misappropriated money--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLaren</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to speak to the point of order. I have had to raise this point on numerous occasions when Senator Carrick raised points of order. During the reign of the Whitlam Government between 1972 and 1975 there was no worse offender in making false accusations against Ministers of the Whitlam Government than Senator Carrick himself. I have had to quote chapter and verse from Hansard. In his remarks not only on substantive motions but but also on loan Bills he has repeatedly-falsey and knowingly-accused members of the Whitlam Government of being corrupt, deceitful and dishonest. I think it is a great shame that Senator Carrick now in trying to protect his own colleagues raises points of order on this issue. I think it is like Caesar trying to protect Caesar. He was the first offender, in my time in the Parliament, to accuse members of the Government of being corrupt, deceitful and dishonest. When my colleague, Senator Walsh, quotes words used in the House of Representatives by the person he is talking about, Senator Carrick again tries to raise a point of order to protect Ministers in his own party. I say that Senator Carrick is stooping pretty low when he does that. He is proving that he cannot take it but can give it with all the force at his disposal, as he did in 1972 and 1975 when he tried to discredit people of very high standing in the community. He thought nothing of it when he did it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to speak to the point of order. The matters which Senator McLaren has quoted from Hansard as being my statements in the past were not in any way a breach of Standing Orders. Had they been so, the President of the day would have ruled them out of order, or it would have been competent for any member of the Australian Labor Party to take exception. Honourable senators know that one may make a statement about a government in terms of its actions but one must not reflect upon individual members. Mr President, I think you will find that that is so. I have taken points of order tonight because it is a reflection on an individual member of this Parliament. That is the basis of my point of order.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Another major breach of ministerial propriety to which the Prime Minister himself was an accessory-at least after the fact if not before-was committed by Mr Nixon some years ago and exposed at the end of last year; I think on 5 December to be precise. It was then disclosed that Mr Nixon, as Minister for Primary Industry, had made a decision relating to levies due, levies payable by and payments due to the Murray Goulburn Dairy Co-operative in which he was a shareholder. Those actions were defended by the Prime Minister on the grounds that Mr Nixon was a minor shareholder in the company and in any case the decisions that he had made were decisions financially adverse to the company. On the second point the claim was only partially correct. One of the decisions made by Mr Nixon had been financially adverse to the company and another had been favourable. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case, the Bowen guidelines, officially stated to have been adopted by the Government, make no allowance for whether a Minister is a minor or a major shareholder in a company. I quote from paragraph 8.7 of the report of the Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest where it says:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) when directing the business of the department he administers a Minister should inform the Prime Minister of any real or apparent conflict of interest that arises;</PARA>
<PARA>It can scarcely be argued that a Minister making an administrative decision to make payments to a company in which he is a shareholder is not a case involving not just an apparent but real conflict of interest, small or large. The recommendations from the Bowen Committee continue:</PARA>
<PARA>(b) the Prime Minister, unless he asks the Minister to divest himself of the interest, should either arrange for another Minister to deal with the matter or else give explicit authorisation to the original Minister to proceed with it; and</PARA>
<PARA>(c) in any event, the Prime Minister should have the matter recorded. </PARA>
<PARA>The defence used by Mr Nixon and by the Prime Minister to that recommendation and the clear breach of that recommendation, said to have been officially adopted by the Government, was that Mr Nixon was only a minor shareholder which does not account, even in the language of this Government, for the clear statement that a Minister must either divest himself of the interest or arrange for another Minister to deal with the matter. There is an obligation to do that, to inform the Prime Minister and, in any event, for the Prime Minister to have it recorded. As far as any statement which has been made by the Prime Minister or Mr Nixon reveals, none of those things was done. This led to numerous newspaper reports or judgments. I will quote just one of them. It is from the Melbourne Age of 5 December 1981-I think it was a Saturday issue-written by Michelle Grattan. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fraser argues that Mr Nixon behaved perfectly properly. He maintains the Bowen report only specifies that a Minister 'should' divest shares in a business which deals with his department-not that he 'must'. He goes on to say that Mr Nixon must hold the shares if he is to continue to supply milk to the co- operative. </PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fraser also says that Mr Nixon has no obligation to tell him he was considering matters affecting Murray Goulburn, because his decisions cost the company money. But the Bowen guidelines make it clear the Prime Minister should be informed, regardless of what decision is likely to be made. And anyway, the decision on the interest allowance, taken by Mr Nixon on the advice of the Australian Dairy Corporation-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that that was the third attempt to get the Corporation to recommend that, having been persuaded finally by Mr Al Wallace who was kicked into a supernumerary position in the Department of Primary Industry only last week-</PARA>
<PARA>involved a change of rule which did in fact benefit the company. </PARA>
<PARA>I could go on quoting from all the responsible newspapers in the country which came to exactly the same conclusions, as indeed anyone who can understand simple English must come. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Bowen guidelines were complied with in the Nixon-Murray Goulburn case, as the Prime Minister asserted, the guidelines are meaningless. As a prominent, even prestigious, member of the Liberal Party still serving in this Parliament remarked a few years ago about another matter, to wit, the acquittal of Senator Webster by Sir Garfield Barwick sitting as a Court of Disputed Returns in 1974: 'If Webster was not caught by section 44 (5) nobody can be'. If Nixon was not caught by the Murray Goulburn affair under the Bowen guidelines nobody can be. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Country Party, however, does not have a monopoly on impropriety in this Government, a fact attested to by the record of Ransley Victor Garland. I shall not canvass at any length the charges brought against him for breaches of the Commonwealth Electoral Act in 1976 when, on his own admission, he was a party to the transfer of $500 to an independent candidate in the Senate election in the Australian Capital Territory as a pay-off for the allocation of Liberal preferences from that independent candidate-I might add that two crinkly $50 bank notes had been pulled out of Mr Garland's pocket on that occasion on his own admission-and the subsequent peculiar verdict of the Canberra magistrate who said that there was a prima facie case to answer but no jury properly instructed would convict. I am told by people familiar with lawyers' jargon that this is a contradiction in terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The particular subject of this motion is the affairs of Ransley Victor Garland as they pertained to the three companies: Stirling West Pty Ltd, Frederic Salon Pty Ltd, and Greenbank Pty Ltd. I shall give the details of one of these companies as revealed by searches of the Corporate Affairs office of Western Australia, which details are replicated almost precisely and certainly in substance in the records of the other two companies. Stirling West was originally incorporated in 1961 with two shareholders, Ransley Victor Garland, usually known as Victor Garland, and his father, I. V. Garland. By 1970 the shareholders in the company were Victor Garland and Surenne Pty Ltd, a Garland- owned company. The directors were Ransley Victor Garland and his wife, L. M. Garland. </PARA>
<PARA> On 10 February 1978 the branch register was transferred to Peat Marwick Mitchell and Co. of Cavanagh Street, Darwin. The application to transfer the register was lodged by Rickford Administration Pty Ltd of Melbourne. Three days later, on 13 February 1978, Victor Garland and his wife resigned as directors of the company. They were replaced by Matthew Joseph Sheedy, chartered accountant of 2/11 Auburn Grove, East Hawthorn, Victoria and Ian David Stafford Collie, solicitor of 30 Kintore Street, Camberwell, Victoria. On the same day Victor Garland's wife resigned as secretary of the company and was replaced by Matthew Joseph Sheedy whom I have already mentioned and one R. M. Evans of 28 View Street, Peppermint Grove, who were joint secretaries. A fortnight later, on 27 February 1978, the address of the company, and the company register, was changed to Melsom Wilson and Partners of 37 St Georges Terrace, Perth, the application again being lodged by Rickford Administration of Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> On 20 March 1978 the share capital previously held entirely by Victor Garland and Surenne Pty Ltd-the Garland company-was divided into 9,950 ordinary shares at $2 each and 50 B class shares at $2 each. On 21 December 1978, some nine months later, R. H. Judson of Ferrier Hodgson Green and Co. of Collins Street, Melbourne was appointed liquidator of the company. On 9 October 1979, 21 months after the original changes of directorship, the liquidator distributed the assets of Hulldale Pty Ltd which by that stage comprised only a $4.55 dividend on 111 shares making a total distribution of $505. The public record reveals no other details of that quite long gap between 20 March 1978 when an extra 10,000 shares were issued in the company and 9 October 1979 when it was finally liquidated. Incidentally, the shareholders and directors of Hulldale Pty Ltd and of Rickford Administration are the Sheedy and Collie noted previously. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that there is a gap pertaining to the detail in the public record but it is perfectly clear to anybody with any common sense that nobody indulges in a shuffle among two States and one Territory over a period of 18 months for changes of directors and secretary and a major issue of shares for a company which is worth only $500. It is equally apparent to anyone peripherally familiar with the murky, amoral world of tax avoidance that this two State and one Territory shuffle was conducted to dodge taxes. It bears all the marks of a dividend stripping operation, one of the operations which was facilitated by what is known as the Slutzkin scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic, I suppose, that this motion should finally come up tonight on the same night as the Australian Broadcasting Commission Nationwide program should be giving a detailed account of the tax dodging procedures and some of the individuals exposed and named by the Royal Commission into the activities of the Ship Painters and Dockers Union in Melbourne. It is ironic that the sordid affairs of Ransley Victor Garland should be discussed in the Senate on the same night as Nationwide is talking about the sordid affairs of convicted criminal, tax dodger and former business associate of Sir Phillip Lynch, Mr Durtson. Mr Collie, who along with Mr Sheedy, clearly conducted a business the purpose of which was to provide facilities for white collar crime, has previously complained about being named in respect of this case. I should say that Mr Sheedy has not formally complained as has Mr Collie. In response to Mr Collie's protestations I invited him to supply the details pertaining to these cases which are not available, for whatever reason, on the public record. He declined to respond to that invitation. That reticence, coupled with what is clearly shown about the activities of this man and the companies of which he is director , reveal him to be one of those moral defectives in the legal profession who abdicate all responsibility on the grounds that they are only providing objective legal advice. They remind me of those medical personnel who collaborated with the Nazis in conducting medical experiments in concentration camps. </PARA>
<PARA> What of the Prime Minister's role? On 10 September 1980 my colleague, John Dawkins, addressed a question to Mr Garland, who was still a Minister in the House of Representatives, regarding these matters. He asked him as Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs to make a statement to the House providing the details of the transactions. In reply to his question Mr Garland said with respect to the Bowen guidelines:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government announced its policy in relation to that. I am abiding by those guidelines, as is required by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the things required by those guidelines and endorsed, so Mr Garland says, by the Prime Minister, is that the Prime Minister is to be provided with a declaration of pecuniary interests. The Prime Minister did not disassociate himself from Mr Garland's answer. The Prime Minister's silence must have been taken as consent and agreement. The Prime Minister on his own tacit admission was informed of Mr Garland's business activities, including the circumstances pertaining to and the reason for the details of the disposal of these companies in what was very clearly a dividend stripping operation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no doubt that that question and some other contemporaneous events were responsible for Mr Garland's decision a couple of months later to retire prematurely from politics. I have little doubt that he was probably assisted in making that decision by Prime Ministerial pressure, not because he had done something which was reprehensible but because of the usual reason-he had been found out. That is the usual reason for this Prime Minister taking any action on ministerial impropriety. I guess one would have to be fairly naive to believe that prior to Mr Garland's premature retirement from politics the question of his subsequent appointment as High Commissioner to London was not discussed between the Prime Minister and himself. </PARA>
<PARA> It was an appointment which led to criticism, subsequently publicised, by Lord Carrrington, the British Foreign Secretary, by the Australian Public Service Association and, of course, a good deal of other criticism. It was, according to reports published in British newspapers, among other things, an embarrassment to the Queen and, I might add, a disgrace to Australia. With respect to those London newspapers I cite just one reference from the Daily Express of 4 January this year. The William Hickey column, which is arguably the most widely read column in any newspaper in the United Kingdom, discussed the Queen's reaction to Mr Garland's appointment and indeed his subsequent knighthood. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> She has little discretion in such matters, being pretty much obliged to accept Fraser's advice on honours, whatever private doubts she may harbour. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing that can be done now can erase the damage done to Australia's reputation and prestige abroad by this appointment. Nothing that can be done now can cancel the doubts and clean up the sullied reputation of the Fraser Government with respect to ministerial propriety. But at the very least the Senate is entitled to a formal statement from the Prime Minister as to his knowledge of this matter ; and it is entitled to the details pertaining to the disposal of these companies since the Prime Minister, by his own tacit acknowledgement, his consent by silence, has those details. Either he has those details or he was an accessory to the misleading of Parliament by Mr Garland on 10 September. Of course we all know that the Prime Minister would not be a party to anything like that, so clearly he has the details. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate ought to assert its moral right. I understand it has no power to compel the Prime Minister to disgorge the sordid history of the second and third Fraser Governments in this way but it should insist on its moral right to be provided with the information on this matter which is of central relevance to the question of ministerial propriety. </PARA>

Ministers observe those interests, as they have done over the years on this side of politics whereby in Cabinet if a matter concerns their interests they indicate to the Cabinet that that is so. In fact that is an impeccable procedure which has been observed over the decades and will continue to be observed. It is not the intention of the Government to make public property of pecuniary interests. The facts are that those details are entitled to be preserved in their ordinary privacy as are those of any citizen at all. Senator Walsh, during the course of his statements, made a number of allegations. First he referred to Mr Sinclair. Mr Sinclair was indicted before the courts by a Labor Government in New South Wales. He went before his peers on charges and was totally acquitted. The fact is that this Parliament exists on one very important principle that honourable senators need to be reminded of, and that is that if indeed a court of law acquits a person it behoves those who uphold the rule of law to accept that verdict and to honour it and not to try to denigrate it at all.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can quite understand these interjections. They are aimed to distract; they will not. I want to make it perfectly clear that those who seek, as Senator Walsh does, to take a verdict of a court-that is a very important principle of law on which we live-and then seek to pervert it or to deny it are doing a great injustice not only to the individual but also to the principles of law. It could not be a sadder thing that a man finds that one of his family, unbeknown to him, has in fact committed breaches of the law. It could not be a sadder thing. It so happens that day by day in various parts of this country members of parliament find that. I invite Senator Walsh to read the Press and see some very sad circumstances in recent times. I do not intend to name them. I should have thought that the ordinary human decency of a person would be to understand that because somebody else in a family has committed a breach of the law one does not seek to reflect upon that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is, as I understand it, that Mr Sinclair has undertaken to make restitution of that money and has proceeded so to do. I cannot understand how anyone in this place can continue to cast aspersions given, firstly, the tragic circumstances of the family situation-I would have thought one would have deep sympathy for a person in that regard-and, secondly, the fact that a jury has reached the conclusion it has because it is ordinary human decency to uphold the jury's verdict and say: 'Here is a man who has been acquitted of these charges', particularly as he has taken it upon himself to rectify what was a breach of the law not of his own but by some other person. I hope we will never again in this place have cause to hear that. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh then proceeded to discuss Mr Nixon. Mr Nixon is a farmer in the course of his ordinary business. I understand that for most people it is a respectable occupation to be a farmer. For some I have some doubts. Mr Nixon, being a farmer and producing products, operates within a law in which we allow co-operatives and in which membership of a co-operative involved in the purchase and distribution of primary products means that members must hold nominal shareholdings-not massive shareholdings for dividend earning purposes but shareholdings to belong to the co-operative and so to operate. That is, of course, a normal and a respectable thing that tens of thousands of farmers do. Indeed, thousands of them must do so if they are to pursue normal farming. That is absolutely the normal behaviour of a farming person in that regard. That is precisely what Mr Nixon has done. Everybody knows that Mr Nixon is a farmer. He has disclosed quite clearly that he is a dairy farmer. The world knows that that is how he operates. To seek to impute some wrong motive to him in the discharge of his duties is absolute nonsense. In any case, if Senator Walsh or anyone else has such information, why does he not disclose it, not in the coward's castle, but elsewhere? Again, there was a reference to--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make another invitation available in a moment which I hope I will hear Senator Walsh say he will accept tomorrow. A reference was made to a former member of this place, Senator Webster. The High Court of Australia heard the case and found that Senator Webster had committed no breach. Note that here we have a senator who is elected to this place to uphold the rule of the law, the integrity of the courts of Australia, and all he can do is sneer at a former Chief Justice of this country who is regarded as walking high in the courts of this world, as one of the great justices not only of Australia but also of this world. Once again, the court found that there was no case to answer . An extraordinary situation has occurred. There has been an attempt to relate these events to what a royal commissioner has found about ship painters and dockers-murderers, as the evidence has come out. There have been massive breaches of the law. No such things have been found at all. The very reverse has happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During his remarks, Senator Walsh referred to a number of people, including a Mr Collie and a Mr Sheedy. I do not know either of these gentlemen. I do not know what their particular activities are or what their merits or otherwise may be, but the honourable senator has made some very adverse comments here about each of those gentlemen. He said an interesting thing. He said: 'I have sought some information from Mr Collie but he will not give it to me'. I suggest that the simplest way to test Mr Collie and Mr Sheedy is for Senator Walsh to state his allegations against Mr Collie and Mr Sheedy outside this chamber, not in this chamber, so that a court of law can have the opportunity if those gentlemen want to seek justice. They cannot seek justice in here; they cannot seek it at all. Senator Walsh said a moment ago that he would be willing to say something tomorrow about, I think, Mr Garland. I invite him to say something tomorrow about Mr Collie and Mr Sheedy. </PARA>
<PARA> One of our jobs in this place is to preserve the rights of individuals outside, not just to preserve and protect ourselves with the immense privileges we have got. We have no right to use the privilege of this place to attack any citizen at all unless we are prepared to go further in producing the evidence as such. What has happened tonight is that some quite severe allegations have been made. If Senator Walsh has those allegations to make he has one duty. He has the duty to go outside and state them publicly and to go to the police or the State authorities concerned and give that information. If he does not do so he stands condemned in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I take it that that is no point of order but a speech of rhetoric. Indeed, all the human indignation on earth, however simulated, cannot get away from the fact that if any honourable senator rises in this place and makes allegations against the good name and character of a person outside he ought to have the moral strength to go out and say so. He ought to have the strength to go to the authorities and say: 'Here is this information'. The fact of the matter is that I have issued this invitation. He has said he is willing to go out on another matter. Let him do so. What has happened is that Senator Walsh as usual has taken the occasion tonight simply to use slander and innuendo against a series of people and has offered not a tittle of fact. With Mr Sinclair the very contrary is true. The courts of the land have in fact found against Senator Walsh, not Mr Sinclair. That is a very important thing to understand. That is a fact. The courts did not find against Mr Garland. Notice the innuendo of Senator Walsh that there was something peculiar about the magistrate. What a tortured mind it is that it was peculiar about the magistrate , not about Senator Walsh, and peculiar about Sir Garfield Barwick and ex- Senator Webster. What a tortured and tortuous mind it is that cannot even acept the ordinary courses of the law. After all, that is what we are here for. We are here to stand up and say that we believe in the separation of the judiciary from this Parliament; we believe in the decisions to be made by magistrates, judges and juries. One after the other these allegations tonight have tumbled over. Only Senator Walsh stands convicted on the Sinclair matter because what he has said has been proven to be totally untrue. Only he stands convicted on the other matters. I ask the Senate to reject out of hand the statements that he has made. I hope that I never hear these kinds of innuendos and slanders here.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate is of the opinion that financial grants by the Commonwealth Government or its statutory authorities should not be provided, either directly or indirectly, to those organisations in public health areas the officials of which advocate that abortion is an acceptable or desirable form of 'fertility control'. </PARA>
<PARA>First of all, I point out that this motion has not been suddenly dropped on the Senate. Every honourable senator, even those relatively new honourable senators, should know that this motion has not been dropped upon him or her without warning or notice. I first raised this matter in the Parliament during the sittings of the last Parliament. I placed a notice of motion in identical terms to this notice of motion before the Senate on 21 February 1978. That notice of motion eventually surfaced on 24 August 1978. I explained then what I was trying to achieve. I refer honourable senators to the Senate Hansard of 24 August 1978, page 425 and following. Debate on my motion was adjourned and it subsequently disappeared from the Notice Paper when Parliament was prorogued prior to the 1980 election. </PARA>
<PARA> Immediately after the resumption of the new Parliament, I placed an identical notice of motion on the Notice Paper. That was on 5 December 1980. Now, 15 months later, it has come up for debate. So, let there be no misunderstanding about the fact that this matter has not been dropped on the Senate. It is a matter about which there has been adequate and substantial notice. In effect, there has been four years gestation period for this motion. Honourable senators who have been here for some years and even those who came here in 1980 have had ample time to consider the implications. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion is in reality an expression of principle to let everyone know where the Australian Parliament stands and where the Australian Government should stand. It is, in effect, similar to a United States congressional resolution which prohibits United States AID funds being used for abortion. The motion refers to financial grants. What are those financial grants? If adopted, the motion would apply to grants given to family planning organisations in Australia and to grants given to international organisations working in that same field. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take a look at the national grants for a moment. Details which were supplied to Estimates committees by the Department of Health show that these grants would cover the $780,000 of grants for the 1981-82 year under the family planning program of the Commonwealth Department of Health and also the related health program grants. I refer to pages 45 and 46 of the Estimates of the Department of Health. So far as the international grants are concerned, these would cover the $300,000 granted to the International Planned Parenthood Federation in 1981-82 and other similar grants which show up in overseas aid projects-for example, the international population and family planning project in Bangladesh. I refer to pages 67 to 69 of the Estimates of the Department of Foreign Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Are family planning organisations advocating the idea that abortion is an acceptable or even a desirable means of fertility control? As stated in my speech on 24 August 1978, to which I referred previously in this discussion, some key people associated with the family planning organisations in Australia have stated that abortion is an acceptable form of fertility control. This might come as a surprise to some honourable senators who did not hear it at that time. If one has a think about that statement, one will see that it really shows that they are admitting some failure. When they say this they are giving equality of treatment to abortion. They are treating it in somewhat the same category as the pill. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I remind the Senate of what was, in fact, said at that time by Professor Charles Kerr who was asked about this matter in a television interview on Tuesday, 7 February 1978. The interviewer asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What's your attitude to abortion?</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Charles Kerr responded:</PARA>
<PARA> Abortion is accepted. It's legally accepted as a means of fertility control; just one option available to women in this state and its fitted into the health system and the medical system. And the Association-if there comes a person who may require an abortion it would proceed in the normal channels, just like doctors doing work anywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer to the statement of the then Director of the New South Wales Family Planning Association, Judy McLean. She was interviewed on the Australian Broadcasting Commission's Broadband program in March 1977. At that time she stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the information we are gathering now on abortion seems to be pointing that this is a very safe method of birth control. If it was done for instance like Family Planning Clinics that are dotted right throughout the metropolitan area the cost of it would go down and it would be a feasible method of birth control. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Admittedly, since I gave notice of my motion such statements have not appeared broadly. But, as I will point out, the evidence points to the fact that in certain areas this particular philosophy or approach is adopted. If persons in the family planning area adopt this approach, they are also proving that they have failed one of their stated functions that is, the prevention of conception. Abortion is not the prevention of conception. It is the destruction of the unborn child which has been produced as the result of conception. Abortion is not contraception-how could it be?-unless, of course, we are not talking the same language. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with the question whether abortion is a form of fertility control. Is there evidence that abortion is growing in its acceptance as a form of fertility regulation? In other words, is the ready availability of abortion being used as a convenient form of family planning? There are very few figures available on rates of abortion and related aspects. Unfortunately, so far as the FPA is concerned, South Australia is one State which does keep reliable figures. To my knowledge, leading figures in the FPA in two other States and in the Australian Capital Territory have a worse record on this issue. The South Australian figures for 1980 were released in November 1981. In the Adelaide Advertiser on 18 November 1981, it was reported that 342 women who had had abortions in 1980 had had previous abortions under South Australian legislation. That represented 8.4 per cent of the total performed. But almost a quarter of these women were under the age of 20 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee which produced these figures reported:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee had discussed this in depth and considers the education of young people in responsible parenthood is still inadequate in SA . . . The Committee also believes the lack of motivation to avoid pregnancy in high-risk situations is a problem which can only be dealt with by greater awareness of the problem and by public discussion. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously throughout Australia, despite the hundreds of thousands of dollars poured into the Family Planning Association bodies, they are not having the effect that they desire. Therefore, it makes me wonder whether abortion is viewed by some of these people in the Association still, though they do not say it publicly, as a convenient way out for their failure. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me take the other area where there are detailed figures, that is, the Northern Territory. Those figures are kept by the Northern Territory health administration and published in a quarterly statistical bulletin. The Northern Territory law was changed in late 1973 or 1974. The percentage of repeat abortions in the Northern Territory has been: In 1975, 4.1 per cent; 1976, 7.6 per cent; 1977, 10.1 per cent; 1978, 11.9 per cent; 1979, 13.8 per cent; and 1980, 15.8 per cent. It is undeniable that a significant and increasing proportion of women are being influenced to the view that abortion is available to be used as a convenient means of limiting the number of children they have. In my view, that is a contradiction in terms when it comes to the question of family planning associations. That is why it is important for this Senate to declare at the earliest possible moment that it will not be party to the provision of funds which might be used to promote such an attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> The major organisations active in this area, are, of course, the family planning organisations and, as I have indicated, there are some people in prominent positions in those associations who are already on public record that they see nothing wrong with the attitude of using abortion as a means of fertility control. That is an extraordinary statement to come from those people, having regard to the objectives of the associations. As I mentioned in my previous speech, there are some associations which do not take that attitude but there are others whose officials do. This is shown up in statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to the international grants. I hope that this matter comes to determination this evening. As I mentioned earlier, the Australian Government will contribute some $300,000 to the International Planned Parenthood Federation this financial year. That is a 20 per cent increase on the previous year's grant . I have correspondence from Ministers for Foreign Affairs about the IPPF. I have not been satisfied with the denials in that correspondence that IPPF is involved in the promotion of abortion. I have an IPPF working paper which advocates:</PARA>
<PARA> Those FPAs that consider it necessary to fight for abortion law reform should have support from the regional and central organs of IPPF. </PARA>
<PARA>An article by Donald Warwick in the Hastings Centre Report of April 1980 claimed that IPPF:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . has been the most outspoken advocate of legal abortion services in the developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA>It provides 200 kits in the Phillipines and 5,000 abortion kits to Bangladesh as well as similar kits to Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and India. Donald Warwick is an institute fellow at the Harvard Institute for International Development. This is the very body which the taxpayers of Australia are funding to the tune of over a quarter of a million dollars each year-$300,000. Of course that, in the overall, is not an enormous amount. But it is the principle that is at issue. It is a principle which the people of Australia would go to the barricades on. They certainly would not have a bar of it if they knew that the Australian Government funds an organisation with this sort of objective. </PARA>
<PARA> The IPPF has also been accused of involving itself in the internal affairs of developing countries. It has been accused of being involved in the sacking of the Health Minister in Zimbabwe last October. I have a copy of an article from the New Zealand Tablet newspaper of 6 January 1982. It reports that the Health Minister, Dr Herbert Ushewokunze, had been sacked from his position because of his opposition to abortion on demand and an attack on the local family planning association for its use of the drug depo-provera as a contraceptive. The Minister for Health had, in fact, expressed his opposition to abortion on demand . He had, in fact, raised the question as to the appropriateness of the local family planning association using the drug depo-provera as a contraceptive. I have previously raised questions about depo-provera and its dangers. I know that Senator Haines has also asked questions about its use. The Tablet report states that because of his attack on the local family planning association, the Health Minister in Zimbabwe attracted the opposition of the international agencies including IPPF 'who saw in him a threat to their plans for the development of contraceptive and abortion facilities in the region'. The doctor was in overall command of the Zimbabwe African National Union medical teams during the bush war and joined ZANU in 1963. His revolutionary credentials were unchallenged, I imagine, in the eyes of the Government. But here was an international organisation on the bandwagon able to ensure that he was got rid of. This man, in fact, trained for the medical profession also in Durban and Natal. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a temptation for family planning agencies to become involved in the abortion industry because that is the soft option. But to accept abortion as having a legitimate role to play in the family planning area is, as I have said before, to admit defeat. I know that the family planning associations are very quick to point out statistics which they say claim that they have reduced the number of pregnancies, particularly teenage pregnancies. But having regard to what I said a moment ago about the statistics in South Australia and the statistics in the Northern Territory, if comprehensive figures were available, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, the main problem areas, and in the Australian Capital Territory, I think they would show the same trend and we would find that this had occurred through the greater employment of abortion. That is something that this Senate and, indeed, the whole of the Parliament should be concerned about. Not only does that deny the very objectives of the family planning associations and the purpose for which the grants are being given, but it also creates a mentality which is surely foreign to those of us- that is all of us-who believe in the principles of the right to life and the right for a person to develop with freedom and dignity and to ensure that person 's rights are maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe for a moment that Commonwealth funds should be used to prop up those family planning associations which are simply acting as conveyor belts for the abortion industry in Australia or elsewhere, and I mean elsewhere. If time permitted tonight I would be able to provide the Senate with details of the situation that exists in Bangladesh. That information would raise some very important questions as to whether this Government should have a very good and clear look as to where its funds are ending up in Bangladesh. Recently I had the opportunity overseas of having discussions about this issue. I have a number of details which I would like to provide to the Senate, but obviously time is against me tonight. Suffice it to say that I consider that once that sort of information hits the deck then I believe the whole question of the provision of funds should require greater scrutiny. I believe that the people of Australia, once they are aware of the facts of the situation, would, in fact, demand greater scrutiny of expenditure of their funds in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> It irritates me no end that these agencies, both the internal agencies and the external agencies, receive substantial funding from both Commonwealth and State governments. Yet, the natural family planning associations are, in general, given the brush-off. I wish that the Minister would do me the courtesy of listening to me and understanding what I am saying. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I became aware this afternoon, as many other Australians did later this afternoon as a result of the PM radio program, of some legislation which was introduced yesterday into the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and which is intended to be rushed into law by that Assembly next Tuesday. That legislation has caused me, and I suspect a great many other Australians, profound concern. I believe that it should cause equally profound concern to this Government and more particularly to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), with whom I have already discussed this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The legislation in question amounts to amendments to the Northern Territory Evidence Act designed to allow the suppression by the Northern Territory Government of certain documentary evidence in legal proceedings-namely, documents which the Northern Territory Attorney-General certifies not to be in the public interest to disclose. The description of those documents makes clear that what is intended are documents involving proceedings of, or communications to or from, the Northern Territory Cabinet or Executive Council. It is clear that these amendments are designed to overturn the effects of two very important High Court of Australia cases and also to overturn the application in the Northern Territory of some very important Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first place, it is obvious-indeed, Mr Paul Everingham, the Northern Territory Government leader, said as much on radio tonight-that the initial intention of the legislation is to overcome the effect of the Sankey case, which enables a court to overturn a claim of Crown privilege in relation to Crown documents, including Cabinet or Executive Council documents, when that court perceives it to be in the public interest to do so. I note in this respect that when the New South Wales Government enacted a similar amendment to its evidence Act in 1979 that attracted-quite rightly in my opinion-a storm of criticism. I believe that kind of principled criticism is equally applicable to the actions now being contemplated by the Northern Territory Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also clear that the legislation in question is designed to overcome, among other things, the effect of section 54 of the Aboriginal Land Rights ( Northern Territory) Act, which vests power in the Aboriginal Land Commissioner to require the production of documents relevant to the determination of land claims. Therein lies a very serious matter indeed. The Aboriginal Land Commisioner, Mr Justice Toohey, is presently engaged in, or about to be engaged in the hearing and determination of what is known as the Kenbi land claim relating to the Cox Peninsula adjacent to the city of Darwin. In hearing that claim he has a very great interest indeed in getting access to certain government documents, more particularly certain Cabinet-Executive Council documents. </PARA>
<PARA> The land claim to which I refer is the contest with respect to which there occurred, I believe, one of the most notorious exercises of government cynicism in the history of this country. I am referring to the gazettal in 1978 of the whole land area of the Cox Peninsula geographically adjacent to Darwin as being alienated for Darwin town planning purposes. When one considers the nature, the character, the location and the size of the land in question-in fact, three times that of Greater London-it is evident to any observer of the situation what a wildly implausible claim that was, that what was in issue here was the gazettal of land to extend Darwin boundaries for town planning purposes. It was manifestly a cynical exercise to alienate the land in question to take it out of the domain of the Aboriginal land claim to the Cox Peninsula being mounted by the Kenbi people. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of that gazettal of the land in question Mr Justice Toohey, when initially hearing the Kenbi land claim, found himself obliged to regard the land in question as having been technically alienated and, therefore, as not being able to be any longer the subject of a land claim proceeding. He declared the proceedings terminated. That decision by Mr Justice Toohey was then taken to the High Court of Australia by the Northern Land Council and in a decision brought down just before last Christmas, on 24 December-one of the more celebrated decisions of the High Court-the High Court decided that the Commissioner could not--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Without disagreement, indeed, as to the basic determination. The High Court decided that the Commissioner was not entitled simply to terminate the proceedings in that way. Notwithstanding the apparent successful alienation of the land in question by gazetting it under the town planning regulations, the High Court said that the Land Commissioner was obliged to go on hearing and considering the merits of the Aboriginal land claim and in particular he was obliged to turn his mind to the legality, the legitimacy of the particular town planning exercises; the regulation promulgation in question. More particularly- herein lies the enormous potential significance of the Toohey case in many other areas of public law-the High Court also said for the first time that it was permissible for someone in the position of Mr Justice Toohey, or any other court determining the legality of legislation or regulations promulgated in this way, to look behind the face value of such legislation or regulations and to determine whether, in fact, that legislation was validly passed by reference to the purposes for which it is possible to pass legislation, as specified in this case by the parent Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In other words the bona fides of the Northern Territory Government in gazetting this area could be taken into account. In fact, since the issue had been raised the Land Commissioner was obliged to look to the question of those bona fides. To the extent that that involved the compulsory production of Government, Cabinet and Executive Council documents he was obliged to take that course of action. There are varying degrees of precision with which the judges make these various points. I will not go into the technical detail. Suffice to say that the effect of the decision is perfectly clear and it was on that basis that Mr Justice Toohey was about to begin again hearing and determining the Kenbi land claim. It is obvious to me, as it is obvious to many in the Northern Territory and as I hope it is obvious to the Attorney-General-who I am indebted to see visiting the chamber-and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that we are seeing here a deliberate attempt by the Northern Territory Government, although it is clear that Mr Everingham will not admit it in so many words, to flout the High Court decisions I have referred to, to tear up the relevant provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and to make it impossible for this extremely important land rights claim to be heard and determined on its merits. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether this new Northern Territory legislation, if it comes into force next week, is capable of legal challenge. It might be, although it seems to me to be the case in the short time I have had to look at it that it is possible for a Territory law, passed as it is in the exercise of legislative power delegated to the Territory by the Commonwealth under section 122 of the Constitution, to override the effect of another Commonwealth law provided that the Territory law is later in time. It might seem odd that a territory law like this, not much more in its terms that what we have hitherto thought of as an ordinance, although now described as an Act under the self-government situation now applying, could override an earlier passed Commonwealth law. But I suspect as a matter of strict legal interpretation it probably can, there being no provision in the Constitution to ensure that valid inconsistent Commonwealth legislation overrides the Territory provision with which it is inconsistent. This is unlike, of course, the situation in State law; section 109 of the Constitution does enable inconsistent validly passed Commonwealth law to override a State law in question. While I am not clear about that-I express some hesitation-I do believe that probably this Northern Territory law, at least at first sight, is valid. But what I am clear about and I believe the Attorney- General to be equally clear about is that that law, if it is passed, is equally capable of being overriden by another Commonwealth law if this Parliament chooses to pass an overriding law to knock out, to neutralise, to defeat the purpose, the intention and the effect of this Northern Territory evidence provision. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is perfectly competent for this Commonwealth Parliament using its constitutional power-at least section 122 of the Constitution and perhaps also that under the racial powers of section 51 (xxvi.)-to override the Territory law in this way. The mere existence of a situation of self-government in the Northern Territory does not, in my view, alter that. The Territory self- government arrangements are themselves a creature of legislation passed by this Commonwealth Parliament. They can be removed-either wholly or partially-as easily as the powers in question were granted. I believe that in this situation this Government, through its Aboriginal Affairs Minister, Senator Baume, and no doubt the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, acting in consort and, no doubt, in consultation with the Cabinet, should issue an ultimatum to Mr Everingham immediately informing him that if his Government proceeds with the passage of this intolerable law, it is this Government's intention-the Commonwealth Parliament's intention-to pass the necessary remedial legislation immediately to override, to wipe out the effect of that Northern Territory law. I have no doubt that in taking that course of action and ultimately, if it proves necessary, actually introducing into this Parliament and passing such a provision, the Government would have the complete support of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take only one or two minutes of the Senate's time to raise a matter which has been of a little concern to me. It concerns the design and construction of the new Senate chamber in the new Parliament House. Late in the Budget session last year honourable senators may recall that we were invited to view the proposals for the design of the new Parliament House. This was in a part of the building somewhere near the dining room. I, like many other honourable senators, viewed the proposals and made some suggestions as to what I thought was a defect, namely, that as far as I could see the design of the new chamber showed the public viewing galleries as high and as remote as they are in the present chamber. This would lead to the situation where members of the public, citizens of this country or, indeed, visitors from overseas, wishing to look at our proceedings would find themselves in a situation where not only were they removed by height from the floor of the chamber but also the viewing lines would be such that most of the chamber would be obscured from their view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put that to the officer who was in charge of the display. He told me that that suggestion, amongst others, would be conveyed to the relevant authorities. I have had some informal discussions with those involved with the construction of the new Parliament House. They have told me that certainly the construction of the House of Representatives side is going ahead without the discussion of any such proposal and without any such suggestion having been put into the processes. I am rather afraid that the construction of the Senate side of the new Parliament House may go ahead without the suggestion receiving any consideration at all. I would not mind if my suggestion, amongst others, had been properly subjected to discussion amongst the relevant authorities late last year, as we were promised would be the case. I do not know whether it is proper to ask you, Mr Deputy President, to convey this matter to those concerned and to ask what happened to the suggestions made by members of parliament as a result of their viewing the designs on display late last year. Were they discussed seriously, if at all? If there is any record of my suggestion having been discussed, I would like to receive some note of the conclusion as to its merits. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans says what I hoped to be the position. With that assurance that it is still in the stage at which the issue is open, it is appropriate to make known again Senator Tate's representation and his concern to ensure that we seek from the Joint Committee the kind of response which the honourable senator is after. Senator Evans heard his speech. I undertake also to try to pass on this matter on Senator Tate's behalf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to what Senator Evans has said tonight, I will respond on behalf of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). One of the nice things about attending dinners arranged by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, with people like you, Mr Deputy President, and many others, is that one can sit down with Senator Evans and the Attorney over dinner and discuss matters in a more informal way. By the way, I must make one apology to the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Earlier today I moved a motion but no one had told me that I was able at that stage to say a few words had I so desired. I would have liked to have put on the record of the Senate the pride that many of us have in this Committee for what it has achieved over 50 years in its reviews of subordinate legislation. It is a world leader. It is looked to from across the world. I am only sorry that in moving that motion I did not take the opportunity to say a few words. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans raised a matter which came to my attention today by way of telex from the Northern Territory. I believe it has been mentioned on some news programs and was the subject of radio interviews. I have not yet got in great detail exactly what has transpired or what the situation is. Senator Evans is quite correct in saying that on 24 December last the High Court of Australia ordered that a writ of mandamus be issued to the Aboriginal Land Commissioner directing him to proceed with the Kenbi land claim application in accordance with the law. I do not think there is anyone in this chamber who would not want to see the Commissioner proceed in accordance with the statute under which he operates and in accordance with determinations of the Court when these are made. The difficulty is that we do not have to hand all the information we require. I have already consulted with my colleague the Attorney-General. We need to determine the actual events that have occurred and their legal significance. At that stage we will seek to proceed appropriately. The only thing I can say in response to Senator Evans's expression of urgency and concern is that any decision would have to be a decision of Government; it could not be a decision by an individual Minister or Ministers. As the Senate will be sitting next week, perhaps the honourable senator can raise the matter again. We will need a day or two to get on top of the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Queensland Water Resources Commission has advised that there is no threat to future water supplies in the Great Artesian Basin. It is well known that prior to the aquifers being tapped, they had become distended under the pressure of water. The drilling of bores has enabled the release of water from these distended aquifers. As aquifers have contracted, flows and pressures in bores have diminished, and will continue to do so until a balance is reached between natural replenishment and use, plus natural losses.</PARA>
<PARA> It has been estimated that the state of balance will be reached when the total output from all bores has diminished to 590 megalitres per day. This will be adequate to satisfy the needs of the pastoral industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Present output is 815 megalitres per day and, at the current rate of diminution , it will be at least 35 to 40 years before a state of equilibrium between use and replenishment is reached.</PARA>
<PARA> Some bores now flowing naturally may cease to do so but adequate water will still be available by pumping.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) An extensive investigation into the Queensland portion of the Great Artiesian Basin was carried out by a Committee appointed by the Queensland Government. Its report, 'Artesian Water Supplies in Queensland' was completed in 1954. Findings of this report have subsequently been updated and confirmed by the Queensland Water Resources Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> Flows and pressures throughout the Basin have been continuously measured and investigated. The Bureau of Mineral Resources has also carried out extensive investigations including the development of a computer model of the Basin.</PARA>
