<PARA>To the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That it is clearly apparent that Australian society is becoming more polarised- that the rich at home and abroad are becoming richer profiting from Australia's mineral wealth, whilst pensioners and the disadvantaged, some three million people, are becoming a race apart.</PARA>
<PARA> That, of necessity, the Federal Government take action that all Australians share the wealth of their country by the transfer of resources to income security, health care and housing, therefore your petitioners urge that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. All pensions and benefits be raised to at least 30 per cent of the national average weekly male earnings seasonally adjusted.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Removal of the means/income test on the pensioner health benefit imposed by Federal legislation 1973. Reintroduction of Medibank, in so doing restore all Australians to equality of citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. To alleviate Australia's shortage of housing stock within the capacity of people to pay (rental and ownership) the Federal Government inject $200m into State housing authorities, which will, in addition, alleviate unemployment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of Senator Chipp I present the following petition from 50 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes. This is seen as a matter of national food security.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognise that plant breeding is a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection , storage, and research has been publicly funded.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognise that any system giving ' property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Recognise that legislation establishing plant patenting schemes overseas has had serious adverse effects namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) subordination and/or curtailment of public breeding programs,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) farmer unrest at seed prices,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) monopoly control of seed production and sales has passed into the hands of giant petrochemical and drug corporations also marketing crop chemicals,</PARA>
<PARA> (v) increased uniformity of crop varieties leading to a vulnerability to pest and disease attack.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Reject any proposal to legislate for any system such as the drafted Plant Variety Rights Act, which gives exclusive ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises.</PARA>

<PARA> That since December 1975 the people of East Timor have been living under extremely repressive conditions and many tens of thousands have died. Australia has acquiesced with and assisted the Indonesian Military in its subjugation of one of our nearest neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA> The people of East Timor lost 40,000 of their own defending Australian commandos in W.W.2. Indonesia gained its Independence from the Dutch in 1949 with effective assistance from the Australian Government and Australian Trade unions.</PARA>
<PARA> The East Timorese have an inalienable right to self-determination and independence.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia is ideally placed to help the East Timorese in their hour of need, and ought to use its influence to inhibit further military expansion by Indonesia in the region.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate and Parliament assembled will :</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Recognise the inalienable right of the East Timorese to self-determination and independence, and reverse Australia's recognition of the Indonesian annexation of East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Initiate diplomatic action in support of self-determination and draw attention to the lack of free migration from East Timor at the United Nations and at all other appropriate international forums.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Cease all military aid to Indonesia until there is a complete withdrawal of Indonesian occupation forces from East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Suspend negotiations with Indonesia on the Australia-East Timor seabed boundary.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Allow Fretilin representatives into Australia to speak to supporters here and to give their account of the situation in East Timor.</PARA>

And that the Senate has already been made aware of the plight of tertiary students in the three volumes of ''Studies of Tertiary Student Finances'', tabled in the Senate on 15th October, 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should:</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the projected repeal by the Queensland State Government of the Aborigine Act 1971-1979 and the Torres Strait Islander Act 1971-1979 will almost certainly lead to the degazettal of all Aboriginal reserves in Queensland, as has already been the case with Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That if, as is likely, the Aboriginal communities from these reserves are placed under similar shire council legislation on fifty year leases, they will be exposed to serious encroachment on their land by mining and tourist interests .</PARA>
<PARA> That it is also quite clear, on past evidence, that these interests will have the full backing of the Queensland Government and the rights of Aboriginal people to land rights and self-management will not be granted by that Government .</PARA>
<PARA> That the Commonwealth Government has the power to legislate and acquire land for Aboriginal people under its constitutional powers since the amendments to the Constitution in 1967, but it is your Petitioners' sincere belief that it failed to act in 1978 and thus, failed in its duty before the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Aboriginal people of Queensland have stated that they want land rights and self-management.</PARA>
<PARA> Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government make use of its constitutional and legislative powers to grant full land rights and self-management to the Aboriginal people of Queensland.</PARA>

<PARA> 4. PVR will lead to the domination of the seed industry by the foreign interests not responsible to the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The proprietary rights granted by the PVR will encourage the introduction of seed distribution and marketing monopolies and lead to seed price increases.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister whether it is a fact that the Sweeney Royal Commission into Alleged Payments to the Maritime Unions, which reported in 1976, referred to the activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union in Victoria. Is it not a fact that the Sweeney Royal Commission referred to some activities of the Union which centred around tax evasion? In view of this, did the Royal Commissioner seek an extension of time to investigate these activities? Was an extension of time refused by the Fraser Government and was that decision announced by the Prime Minister? If so, why? Is it not the case that the Government was apprised of the possible extent of tax avoidance practices centred on the Painters and Dockers Union in 1976? Why was no action taken?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have any specific details regarding the Sweeney Royal Commission or the questions asked as to whether it, in fact, made some references to tax evasion or asked for an extension of time. I do have a very clear recollection, as I am asked what is the action of the Federal Government, that this Government, unlike other governments, set up the Costigan Royal Commission into the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. It, indeed, widened the terms of reference and extended the time of that Commission. That Commission has now reported that the Painters and Dockers Union is not an authentic trade union in the ordinary sense but, in fact, is a gathering of criminals who are recruiting criminals for criminal purposes. That same gathering is affiliated with the Australian Labor Party which sits opposite .</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. I refer to a possible problem concerning quarantine regulations for Australian private yacht owners who undertake pleasure cruises and take their animal pets with them to South East Asian countries, as distinct from foreign yachts coming in at recognised ports of entry. As a consequence, these pets may come into contact with infectious diseases, such as rabies, which is a reportable disease under Australian quarantine regulations. Could the Minister advise the Senate as to what quarantine provisions are in force, and whether they are strictly adhered, to protect Australia against diseases brought into the country by these animals on private Australian yachts?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that Australian yachts do travel extensively around the region. I was not aware that it was normal practice to take animal pets on such trips. I can advise the honourable senator that, as he would know, yachts returning from overseas are subject to normal quarantine requirements. They are advised that they can enter Australia only via a first port of entry where they would be subject to quarantine clearance, so that it is not appropriate for them to return other than through a first port of entry where they can get quarantine clearance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If an animal is on board, the master is required to confine the animal and to enter into a bond that the animal will not be brought ashore or be allowed to come into contact with an Australian animal, and the yacht is only permitted to moor mid-water, in that way trying to hold the animal isolated. The animal remains bonded on board the yacht for a period determined by the species of animal. That is laid down in the quarantine regulations. The previous movement of the vessel will help to determine what that period will be, depending upon which countries may have been visited. For example, the yacht may have been to a disease free area or it may have been to a disease infected area. That will vary the period of quarantine laid down. In the case of a dog or cat, the period would not be less than nine months of which, if previously in a rabies free area , some could be spent in a quarantine station. In the case of birds, the period is indefinite if previously in an infected area. I am advised that violation of any of the bond conditions can result in destruction of the animal, in forfeiture of the bond and in prosecution under the Quarantine Act.</PARA>
<PARA> Coming as he does from the Capricorn area of Queensland and having the interest he does in the welfare of his State, I can well understand Senator Collard's concern with this matter and I hope that the information has been helpful to him .</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister for National Development and Energy aware of a report conducted by Monash University researchers which states that the Olympic Dam copper, uranium and gold project in South Australia would generate 13,800 jobs and inject $360m a year into South Australia's production during its initial stages and far greater financial benefits in the future? Does the Minister agree that these projections are of great significance to Australia, particularly South Australia, with respect to economic growth? Is the Government concerned at the report's warning that policies such as automatic wage indexation may prevent the full realisation of employment benefits of the project?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Sir JOHN CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see a report in the Australian of approximately a week ago regarding a survey done by a number of people into the potential of the Roxby Downs project. I have advice from my Department, particularly the Bureau of Mineral Resources, as to the significance and potential of Roxby Downs for the future. It has been suggested that the development of Roxby Downs would create some 18,600 jobs. My advice is that the mineralisation in Roxby Downs is estimated to be worth in excess of $A140 billion. It is very large by world standards and there is every expectation that the zone of mineralisation extends further to the north-west and the south-east than has yet been established. I am advised that the copper contained in the deposit amounts to about 30 million tonnes. This is around six times as much copper as is at Mount Isa and about two and a half times Australia's total identified resources in other ore deposits. As we understand it, the uranium content is about 1.2 million tonnes of uranium oxide. That is estimated to be the equivalent of about 20 per cent of the identified world high grade uranium resources. These figures were provided to me by objective sources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was asked about the significance of such an undertaking to South Australia and to Australia generally. Clearly it would be of enormous significance. I remind the Australian people that the International Energy Agency has made it clear that the world will not be able to maintain its living standards or provide energy for such living standards without a very substantial increase in the use of nuclear power for electric power generation. Indeed, Australia will be one of the few countries capable of providing that energy to maintain the living standards of other countries. The answer is quite clear: If, as is now emerging, the Australian Labor Party is seeking to repudiate uranium contracts then there would be a disastrous effect not only upon the potential development of Roxby Downs but also upon the capacity of the world outside Australia to get the necessary energy source. I understand that the Australian Democrats have a similar attitude towards the export of uranium. It would be an outrage if such action were to deny to the people of the world the energy they need to maintain their living standards and to have both economic and political stability. Such action would be detrimental to South Australia, to Australia, to employment in Australia and the the living standards of the people of the world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to the fact that the allowance for the wife of a totally incapacitated ex- servicemen has not risen since 1964 when it was, as it still is, $8.10 a fortnight. Had the rate of inflation been taken into account the allowance now would be $30.20 a fortnight. Considering the fact that the wives of totally incapacitated ex-servicemen, through their devotion, have suffered-various studies bear this out-considerable nervous and physical stress and that the nursing that they perform has kept the costs of medical treatment for such veterans to a minimum, will the Government give attention to raising the allowance paid to wives of totally incapacitated ex-servicemen in recognition of that activity?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macklin has a couple of different ideas mixed up in his question. He talked about the wives of totally and permanently incapacitated veterans who are in receipt of pensions and also about allowances which are paid to the wives as dependants. He points out that that allowance has not increased since 1964. The reason is that successive governments over that period have decided there is a need to ensure that it is the veteran who receives the most benefit from what are limited resources. Therefore it has been the policy of governments to ensure that funds are directed to that end. That has meant that over this period there has in fact been a decline in real terms in the amount of the dependant's allowance paid to wives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, a further allowance, known as an attendant's allowance, is payable to those disabled veterans who have considerable problems along the lines that Senator Macklin described in his question. I think it is probably that point which he seeks to address his question to. That is a matter which receives attention in each Budget and consequently it is up for consideration every year at Budget time. Recent increases in the allowance have been made. I think we may need to have further discussions with Senator Macklin if he wants to pursue the matter further. I am sure that after he examines the matter a little further he will understand the reasoning behind the Government's approach to this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I saw the letter from Mr Warner referred to by Senator Elstob. The letter referred to the opposition that has been officially expressed by the State Council of the Western Australia Liberal Party, by Mr Warner personally and by others to the proposed legislation to recover the tax lost from vendor shareholders through bottom-of-the-harbour schemes. That is one measure which the Government has announced. The legislation is now very well advanced in drafting and will be presented to the Parliament as soon as possible. Mr Warner, as I understand it, is arguing, as indeed other people have argued and as I understand the Opposition argues, that the way to tackle this problem is not with special legislation but by prosecutions. The argument by Mr Warner to which Senator Elstob is referring seems to me to be a familiar argument. I have heard it in the debate from the Opposition as well as from Mr Warner, Mr Bill Mitchell and others. But the fact of the matter is that the Government will not in any way be deterred by these arguments that have been put forward. As the Government pressed on with the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill, it will be pressing on with the legislation to recover the money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say that despite all the talk of what remedies-civil or criminal-may be available, civil remedies, in particular, are being examined to establish what alternatives there could be. But I am quite convinced that there is no satisfactory alternative and that if we are really serious about recovering the tax that has been lost, special legislation is desirable and probably quite necessary. So I think that the Government's approach, particularly in view of the sort of slurs coming from the Opposition in relation to the Government's attitude on this, should be judged in the light of its firm determination in the teeth of a lot of opposition from, as the honourable senator says, the Western Australian branch or Mr Warner to proceed with legislation which it believes is the most satisfactory way of tackling this problem.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Elstob asked whether the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party was in receipt of any information in the possession of my Department or presumably myself. I can assure the Senate most firmly that it was not in possession of any information that came from me or of which I was in any way aware. I am very satisfied that the officers of my Department would have at all times observed the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful for the question from Senator Reid. I was aware of the very active and open support by the teachers' organisations in Victoria for the then Opposition -support which extended to quite massive and major financial help. Subsequent to the Victorian election, I have read some of the publications of Victorian teachers in which they make no secret of the fact that they were playing a political rather than an industrial role during that election. I am also aware, from contact which I have had in my State of New South Wales, of the desire of the teachers federation there to hear from political parties what their policies are in education because it has an inclination or disposition to consider lending its support actively to one or other party during the next political campaign. In fact-I must thank the teachers federation for this-I had the opportunity to appear before one of its council meetings and to talk to its members about what the Government has done and is doing. I was able to point out to the teachers, rather to their surprise, that total recurrent support by the Fraser Government for government schools last year, this year and next year is greater than it was in the last year, this year of the Labor Government. That is something which had not been pointed out to them and which they were surprised to hear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the situation in the Australian Capital Territory, I must confess to Senator Reid that it has not come to my attention what line the Australian Capital Territory Teachers Federation is taking. But I would not be at all surprised, in the light of what has happened in New South Wales and Victoria, that it might take an active line. The point of Senator Reid's question, and with which I agree, is that this Government is not about to make policy under threat or under duress. We will judge the issues in education on the basis of educational merit and on the basis of the pursuit of educational outcomes. We will receive arguments on that basis whether they be in New South Wales, Victoria or the Australian Capital Territory. I am sure that Senator Reid would want the Government to continue to take that line towards policy formation.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the 1982 Budget, it is of course well known now that in the Budget we have increased support for students at a whole range of levels. We have increased postgraduate awards by 48 per cent. We have increased the means test level for the secondary allowance scheme by 44 per cent. We have increased our contribution to support of schools and our contribution in all educational areas . In terms of our financial support for education, we have a very good case to make and there is no justification for a campaign of the kind which Senator Reid suggested may be under way.</PARA>

I am not in a position to verify totally the very large amounts mentioned in the newspaper reports, but I can confirm to the Senate that it does appear that very substantial amounts of money were collected by that individual.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do suggest that if there is a special place in hell for tax dodgers there is probably also a similar place in hell for people who rip off the social security system, certainly on the scale that apparently was attempted by the late Mr Stone. In a sense, the report is useful because it provides a balance to the concerns which are often expressed in the media, particularly the media in New South Wales, about the fact that my Department has, as part of its role, the suppression of fraudulent claims on the social security system. I am getting used to picking up newspapers which contain such edifying articles as ' How to beat the social security snoopers'. I am getting used to picking up newspapers which make critical comments about the fact that the Department is forced to make inquiries to try to prevent abuse of the system. It is valuable to be reminded that, unfortunate as it may be, there are individuals who seek to use a system which is there to prevent hardship in Australia to their advantage in a way that is just as fraudulent as is any rip-off of the taxation system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as this fraud is concerned, I can only say that we are in the position of making retrospective inquiries which cannot affect any future claims since the man is dead. Whether we will be able to recover any of the moneys I do not know. What is quite clear from the information that I have to date is that this fraud was reasonably sophisticated in that the forms of identification required by my Department were obtained in a variety of names. It is a clear, straightforward case of fraudulent activity and I would simply say that unfortunately, while there are people who are prepared to be dishonest in that way and while we have to have a system which is manageable by the great bulk of honest people who require the support of my Department, it will be true that cases of this sort will occur. I can only assure the Senate that every effort is made by us to reduce them to a minimum. I ask all honourable senators, in considering the matter that has been raised by Senator Scott, to remember the very difficult balance that has to be struck in the welfare system between having one which is operable by the needy and often defenceless in the community and one which is reasonably secure against this sort of depredation. It is a very difficult balance to strike. I believe that the officials of my Department have a very difficult job and I ask all honourable senators, and indeed the community, to support them in their very difficult work, rather than run off and criticise them every time some journalist writes an article about social security snoopers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a little information about the current affairs of Mr Mundey, who I understand is a candidate for the position of New South Wales State Secretary of the Builders Labourers Federation. I think a ballot was to have been conducted by the BLF on 3 September. In that sense the information I have is historical. There were reports that Mr Mundey had claimed to have been harassed by present officers of the BLF-that is, the pre-election officers of the BLF in New South Wales-following his attempts to have the ballot conducted through the Industrial Registrar and that the alleged action of those officials was in breach of the election provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act . However, at the time at which I was given advice on the matter, which was before the election, Mr Mundey had taken no action under the provisions of the Act to apply to have the ballot conducted under the control of the Industrial Registrar or to have the Registrar inquire into alleged malpractice by current BLF officers. In other words, it is not a situation in which one would expect action to be taken at the initiative of the Department. Rather, there are procedures under the Act which are available to a person who thinks he is being treated improperly under the Act to seek the assistance of the Commission. So my advice was-certainly to the point at which I had received advice-that Mr Mundey had not sought the protection of those provisions, notwithstanding their availability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In those circumstances no action would have been taken of the sort raised in the honourable senator's question, and no action, I believe, should have been taken.

I think that this may be a case in which there have been public allegations, no attempt has been made to use the protective provisions of the Act, and hence the election would have proceeded as it was conducted by the union.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the fact that off-shore tourist islands have not been included in the Budget list of users subject to diesel fuel tax rebate. Because of their isolation the off-shore resort islands are unable to obtain any of the services taken for granted by the general community, such as water, sewerage, transport and power, so the cost of power on the islands is already substantially higher than mainland electricity charges, and there is absolutely no other way to obtain it than by use of diesel generators. I point out that because the islands have no public roads it is impossible to use the fuel for any other purpose, and the rebate therefore could not be subject to abuse. In view of these facts, will the Minister give consideration to allowing off-shore tourist islands to claim the tax rebate on diesel fuel used by them?</PARA></TALK.START>

There is, unfortunately, no assistance, solace or hope that I can offer to the honourable senator in response to her question. As she will know, we changed our approach to diesel excise in the recent Budget and all diesel fuel will now bear a full rate of excise duty. Unlike the previous exemptions which were provided to certain users, the present position is that specified users may now claim rebates for specific categories of off-road end use. The categories eligible for rebate, as determined by the Government and announced in the Budget, are domestic use, hospitals, nursing and convalescent homes, and the agricultural, mining, fishing and forestry industries. All other end users, including the tourist industry, are not eligible for the rebate.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is the Minister aware of an incident which occurred in South Australia recently in which two men in receipt of unemployment benefits pooled their resources to purchase a truck in order to seek work from house to house, and promptly had their unemployment benefits discontinued despite the fact that they had not earned any income? I point out that after some publicity over the affair their unemployment benefits were restored, althought they are being kept under review on a regular basis according to the men's subsequent income. What steps are officers of the Department of Social Security required to take in cases of unemployed people seeking unemployment benefits when they are not in receipt of income but are actively seeking work in the manner referred to, or in a similar manner-that is, with the aim of becoming self-employed?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sorts of facts raised by the honourable senator in her question give rise to some difficult judgments which have to be made by my Department on the administration of unemployment benefit. The basic rule is fairly straightforward. To be eligible for unemployment benefit one must be available for work and seeking work. The so-called work test is no more than that. If a person wishes to claim the payment of unemployment benefit he must be available for whatever work is on offer and he must be actively seeking that work. Of course, many people in the community are self-employed. It is unfortunately true that many of those people are self-employed but not profitably. It is not unknown for people running businesses of one sort or another-these range from the large business down to the very small one-man business-to be working without necessarily making an income. I suppose that if we search the bankruptcy lists we will find plenty of examples of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The difficulty arises when somebody is not employed but sets about establishing a small business or some form of self-employment and thereby puts himself outside the category of being available for work. That distinction is the one which I think gives rise to the difficulty that was apparently faced by these two individuals. I must confess that with some 400,000 plus cases on the unemployment benefit list at the moment I am not familar with either that case or, indeed, the great bulk of the circumstances. The difficulties described by the honourable senator in her question would arise from that difficult decision which officers would have had to make as to whether the individuals concerned were seeking work and were available for work or were, in fact, conducting a business as independent contractors. Obviously mistakes can be made in that area . If the facts are as outlined by the honourable senator the second look would appear to have produced the view that these men were merely seeking work and were not currently self-employed. But I will get the facts examined and drawn to my attention so that I can be sure that the administration is in order.</PARA>
<PARA> I have had quite a number of these cases drawn to my attention. They involve people who have lost their traditional work as employees and, being of an industrious and perhaps more imaginative nature, have registered a business name and set themselves up to attract work as independent contractors. In some of those cases the people involved are simply not unemployed in the sense that is required for the payment of benefit. I make the point in defence of my officers that in general a genuine attempt is made to pay people the benefits to which they are entitled. The difficulty arises in those cases where a view is formed that the entitlement simply does not exist under the law.</PARA>

At the risk of raising the Minister's hackles I wish to ask him about the methods used sometimes by his Department to detect social security fraud or wrongful payment of benefits and not about the fact that that occurs which, of course, we all deplore. Has the Minister seen the guidelines for field officers conducting domestic circumstances reviews of supporting parent beneficiaries, widows and Class A pensioners issued by his New South Wales office in June? Are these guidelines currently used in New South Wales or any other State? Do they require field officers to collect information, before seeing single parents, from State housing authorities, local councils, electricity, gas or water authorities, Telecom Australia, employers, neighbours and even their children's schools? Are there any field officer instructions which explain or provide that an explanation be made to single parents that they have the right to refuse entrance into their homes, that they can answer questions instead at the social security office or that they have the right to have a third party present during such interviews? What instructions do field officers have about allowing single parents to know what information has been collected against them so that they can refute such information if it is false?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question contains a number of details which I will address when I see them in writing. Perhaps I will answer the question in more general terms now and go over the answer to see whether it needs supplementing later. Yes, I have seen the guidelines issued by my Department in New South Wales for the guidance of officers in that State who are operating in perhaps one of the most difficult areas of administration-namely, the determination of what benefits should be paid in cases where there is doubt about whether a supporting parent is living alone or is excluded from benefit because he or she is living on a bona fide domestic basis with somebody else and hence is to be treated as a married partner. It is, I think, a thoroughly acceptable principle in our social security system that we do not treat unmarried couples better than we treat married couples. The system is one which is designed to provide, basically, benefits according to circumstance and not according to whether the marriage ceremony has been gone through. Sometimes that works to the benefit of claimants ; sometimes it can work to their disadvantage. In relation to what are generally called de facto relationships, if we have a situation in which a man is claiming unemployment benefit and he is living in a de facto relationship with a woman, he can be paid unemployment benefit at the married rate and the woman is not subject to the work test. In that sense, there can be an advantage in a claim that there is a de facto relationship existing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the case of the supporting parent's benefit, if there is a claim that a de facto relationship is existing-although they are not the words used in the Act I think the meaning is clear to the Senate-there can be a question of an exclusion of benefit. So it is not a one way street and the Department is not geared to make judgments which are based on its assessment of what is right and wrong but its assessment of what the law says.</PARA>
<PARA> The guidelines were issued for use in New South Wales. They were drawn to my attention, I must say, only when I saw a report of them in the media. Again, the instruction manuals of the Department, as is well known to Senator Grimes, are very considerable. I must say that I do not see every bit of paper that is issued by the Department in this area. Because of the degree of controversy which had arisen I examined the guidelines and there were a couple of elements of them which I queried. I sent them back to the Department and sought further consideration and advice so that I could give the matter further thought. I think I had some advice which I thought was not quite what I was looking for-in other words, it did not go into the sort of detail that I wanted-and I have again asked the Department to give me further advice.</PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I think the guidelines apply in New South Wales and not in any other State. My recollection of the guidelines-and it is now some weeks since I read them-is that they do include reference to the right to refuse to answer questions. The guidelines have probably been seen by Senator Grimes and his recollection may be better than mine on the particular point. But my recollection is that there is reference to the fact that at a certain point, where an officer might consider that there is a risk of an offence having been committed and hence a risk that there might be a prosecution, there should be some form of warning. I would stress that I am relying on memory and my recollection may be imperfect. But my recollection is that, yes, there is some reference to the right to refuse to answer questions.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to right to enter, quite frankly I do not remember whether there is any specific reference to the right to refuse entry, but I would say that I would not particularly want to be encouraging social security beneficiaries to refuse to co-operate with officials of my Department. I think the simple fact of the matter is that, if we are to make correct decisions under the Act and if we are to make the payments which are due and not make payments which are not due, we would seek and generally expect the willing co-operation of those people who are seeking the support of their fellow Australians through the system. I say that bearing in mind that, whilst there may be odd cases of officious, difficult and unpleasant officers of my Department, in general my experience is that they are decent people trying to do a job and I believe that they are entitled to have the co-operation of the beneficiaries who seek the assistance of the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> I assure Senator Grimes and the Senate, however, that I do think it is important that we have guidelines which respect the dignity and the rights of Australians who seek the support of my Department. We would certainly not wish to do anything which impinged on those rights, which was vindictive or in any other way unpleasant. But I again say to the Senate that unfortunately, as this morning's newspaper recounts, there are people who do engage in fraudulent practices with respect to my Department and, unfortunately, to catch even a part of that number of people, it is necessary at times to treat people with suspicion when suspicious circumstances arise. Again I would simply say that I believe that the public servants in my Department who are charged with the administration of the Act in general try to strike the proper balance in these matters.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Government welcomes President Reagan's initiative in seeking a settlement of the Middle East dispute. The statement demonstrates the determination of the United States to build on the evacuation from Beirut and lay the groundwork for a broader peace in the Middle East. The United States initiative is based on the Camp David process and on Security Council Resolution 242, both of which Australia has supported. Australia remains totally committed to the security of Israel. We believe that this security can best be achieved by Israel reaching agreement with its neighbours. At the same time the Government believes that there can be no lasting peace or security in the Middle East without a resolution of the Palestinian problem. The legitimate rights of the Palestinians include their right to a homeland and the right to participate directly in decisions affecting their future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> President Reagan's statement has shown that the United States Government is prepared to address the underlying causes of the conflict and to use its great influence in the search for a just and lasting settlement. He has firm Australian support to that end. In the first instance the negotiations which we hope will follow President Reagan's statement should involve the parties principal to the conflict, and it is for them to agree upon particular means by which a comprehensive peace may be achieved. The Government regrets that the initial reaction of the Israeli Government to President Reagan's initiative was not favourable but hopes that further consideration will lead Israel to change its mind. Arab reaction has so far been cautious but will no doubt be clarified at the forthcoming Arab summit meeting. Without acceptance by all parties to the Middle East dispute-Palestinians, Arabs and Israelis-of the need to agree on further negotiations there can be no progress towards a comprehensive peace in the region.</PARA>

I have no particular recollection of that, but a large number of organisations will be receiving advice as to their requests for assistance. Those honourable senators who are interested in particular applications, as is Senator McLaren on this occasion, should not regard the failure of any application to be dealt with in the announcements over the next few days as being a sign that they will not get funding in the reasonably near future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McIntosh has drawn the attention of the Senate to the question of the environmental impact of developments at Perth Airport. The information that I have available indicates that the final statement on this matter has not yet been brought to the Government's attention and that the Government is awaiting the appraisal of some 250 submissions which were received before 30 July this year. Consequently, it would appear that it will be some time before the Government, through the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment and the Minister for Aviation, can focus its attention on this matter. I think that all I can do in the circumstances is to draw Senator McIntosh's concerns to the attention of both Ministers with a view to getting an answer for him.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The failure effectively to prosecute bottom-of- the-harbour schemers is only the tip of one iceberg in an ocean of incompetence and neglect in the Attorney-General's Department under Senator Durack's now five -year-old reign. In every area of the Attorney-General's activities and those of his Department-in the areas of law reform, legal administration and of criminal prosecutions-there simply has been an absence of positive achievement and a long history of delay and maladministration, which I will now do something quite specific and quite precise, in conjunction with my colleagues, to document. Let me begin, however, with Senator Durack's positive achievements, because it would be surprising indeed if he did not have at least some positive achievements to his credit after five years in that office. In the Melbourne Age last Monday Senator Durack claimed five major achievements during his five years as Attorney -General, which, of course, in itself is hardly an impressive record. One wonders what he was doing during the other 51 weeks of the years in question. But even those achievements evaporate on closer scrutiny. He mentions the enactment of the freedom of information legislation, the off-shore sovereignty agreement, the creation of the Human Rights Commission, the bringing to fruition of the United States anti-trust negotiations and the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us look at them in turn. The freedom of information legislation took four years to get through this Parliament. It is still, in the view of many, and possibly most, members of this chamber, too weak, and furthermore it is still not in operation. The off-shore sovereignty agreement was certainly an achievement, brought about simply by the capitulation of the Commonwealth against the national interest to pressures coming from States rights quarters. The Human Rights Commission has certainly been established, does exist and may be doing some useful work around the edges, but with its present jurisdictional limitations and present lack of powers it is a toothless joke, and is so regarded by most people who take these issues seriously. The United States anti- trust negotiations took four years to bring to fruition against the initially predicted six months, which does not say an awful lot for the competence or capacity of this Minister and his Department in matters of international negotiation, particularly when one notices that that agreement leaves quite unresolved by far the most controversial and difficult aspect of extra- territorial anti-trust legislation policy, the continued capacity of parties to initiate private litigation under that legislation in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the last of these personal achievements of which the Attorney-General is so proud, is the abolition of State appeals to the Privy Council. On the face of it this is an important and long overdue development, but it is one that has taken years to reach the present stage of mere agreement. On the present track record and on the predictions that I have heard around the place, it may well take years yet actually to implement. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for the achievements that are claimed by the Attorney-General. What of those less substantial achievements, those negative achievements, if one likes, which I believe justify the matter of public importance that has been put down today. To assist me in doing this, given the time constraints available, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a 13-page document which tabulates in systematic form and in much more detail many of the matters to which I now seek to refer. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave not granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek leave then to table the document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the Attorney-General for that degree of generosity. I am sure it will not go unnoticed, nor will his churlishness in not allowing this documentary record to be put in Hansard, where it might well have got more attention than will now be the case. In any event let us proceed and look firstly at the Attorney's law reform record. For some considerable time, I suppose, it has been a matter of amusement to refer to what I have often described as Durack's law. It is a new natural law which goes something like this: The prospect of achieving any given law reform varies in inverse proportion to the importance of the subject matter and the quality of the supporting argument. That has been a comment amply justified by the Attorney- General's track record in matters of law reform and that of his Department, but that track record has long since ceased to become a joke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me take the question of the family law, for a start. The Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act was established in 1978 and reported in 1980. It is now getting towards the end of 1982. The legislation was introduced in November 1981 but has lain on the table. Many of the matters dealt with in that joint committee report are still not even in legislative form, let alone have been brought to parliamentary attention. The question of a reference of powers from the States is something on which the future of family law effectiveness will largely depend. This Attorney has refused to accept the offer of a reference from New South Wales. He insists on waiting until all the States agree to make such a reference of the power, an insistence, of course, which will never be honoured in the observance by certain States. In the area of the matrimonial property inquiry, I think it ought to be noted that on 13 October 1981 Senator Durack announced that a committee of inquiry would be established to examine the question of a matrimonial property regime. Eleven months later that committee has not yet even been established, let alone set running to do that particular job of work. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of Australian Capital Territory legislation on matters of law reform is within the Attorney-General's drafting jurisdiction and it is again something on which there has been a lamentable record. The question of a crimes compensation system was the subject of a government commitment, on 22 August 1979. Three years after that announcement of government approval, there is still no legislation establishing such a system. So far as wills are concerned-a more exotic area of the law but a very important one for individuals-Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania amended their legislation between 1964 and 1966, with New South Wales following suit in 1977. In November 1980, when the Attorney-General's Department was pressed on what progress was being made here, it was said that the Department had the matter under consideration but could not say when the work would be completed. It is now 1982 and despite further proddings and jabbings from time to time nothing further has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of mercantile legislation Senator Durack announced on 22 July 1979 that legislation governing the processing of payments by cheques would be introduced 'early next year', that is, 1980. That was legislation to implement the recommendations of the Manning committee on bills of exchange. Three years have elapsed since that announcement and still there is no sign of that Bill. Let us turn to the Acts Interpretation Act, which in a more updated mode, the Attorney-General claims is another one of his achievements. Section 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act was enacted with bipartisan support. It draws the attention of the courts to wider considerations that they might legitimately take into account in applying statute law. At the time of the introduction of that provision he said that he would be bringing forward a Green Paper before the Parliament rose-that was before the end of the 1981 Budget session. One of the specific options floated was the idea of explanatory memoranda approved by Parliament to accompany legislation; obviously this is an initiative of tremendous significance. But no Green Paper appeared in that Budget session, or has since. Almost 12 months have elapsed since the announcement. </PARA>
<PARA> The area of prosecution policy is of enormous interest and significance in the light of recent developments. It is something which will be picked up by Senator Grimes when he talks about the social security fraud case, and also by my colleague Senator Georges, when he has something to say later about the Medibank fraud system, or lack of system in prosecutions there. The Attorney-General made an announcement on 14 January this year that he would be tabling in the Senate in the autumn session the statements setting out the Commonwealth prosecution policy and the general principles which should govern it. No statement appeared in the autumn session and no statement has appeared so far this session. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to another more exotic area of law reform-admiralty law. A joint committee of various legal bodies-the Law Council of Australia and the Maritime Law Association of Australia-agreed that the colonial or imperial legislation should cease to apply. Senator Durack announced in August that the case for doing this and for ensuring that the application of Australian law was unanswerable. But rather than just getting on with the business of legislating, he has referred it off to the Law Reform Commission. Of course, when one is talking about law reform, one can hardly fail to point out, as I have done on numerous occasions, that reports of the Australian Law Reform Commission reach an absolute graveyard when they come into the environs of the Attorney-General's Department and in particular the Attorney's office. We have seen the sad fate of the Criminal Investigation Bill which, despite successive reincarnations in various guises, still fails to hit the legislative deck. Similarly, we have seen a failure of action on the Unfair Publication report, the Insurance Agents and Brokers report and now the Sentencing report, a failure which simply cannot be attributed to an unwillingness by the Government to accept all the policy aspects lying behind those particular recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for law reform. What about some of the other things that his Department has been up to or has not been up to in the five years of his stewardship. I think it is crucial to document some of the failings of the Crown Solicitor's Division other than those in relation to tax prosecutions so that it can be appreciated that we are not here talking merely about an isolated instance. I think it equally ought to be noted that the Crown Solicitor's Division accounts for something like half of the total personnel within the Attorney-General's Department. It is no mere back alley within the Attorney-General's Department and as such it can hardly be regarded as a suitable case for the Minister in charge to ignore. The work of the Crown Solicitor's Division extends across the whole range of civil advices, the conduct of civil actions on behalf of the Commonwealth and, of course, the implementation of prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give some examples of maladministration across each of those fields. In the area of civil action the classic case has to be the Faulkner litigation, which has been the subject of some attention in this Parliament on several occasions and which I will refer to briefly again. It is an action in contract for damages brought initially in 1974. The matter wallowed along in the Crown Solicitor's Division with no action being taken. Attention was brought to the case in 1980 by Mr Bryant in the House of Representatives. I took up the matter in 1981. I have had an extraordinary saga of unanswered correspondence in this matter ever since. On 4 December 1981 I wrote a letter to the Attorney requesting full information as a matter of urgency following a letter of the same kind I had written six months earlier to which I had received only a formal reply. Formal acknowledgement of the December letter was received on 4 January. On 31 March this year Senator Durack's office advised that a reply would be coming 'within one or at most two weeks'. On 21 April, three weeks later, I was advised that the officer responsible had gone on leave, the letter was in draft form and would be done 'as soon as possible' but no promises could be made about when. I followed it up on 22 April at the Estimates committee hearing and I finally got the reply on 18 May. This is the way matters are conducted so often within the Attorney's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Then on another kind of activity of the Crown Solicitor's Division there is the preparation of agreements involving the Commonwealth. There is no more spectacular case than the Dintenfass case of which I have had quite a deal to say in this chamber. I simply remind the Senate that it concerns an agreement with the United States of America governing the location on a National Aeronautics and Space Administration space shuttle flight of a very important Australian designed experiment relating to the behaviour of blood in space. The experiment has been delayed something like seven years in its location on a flight by virtue of the Blue Hills saga which the Attorney-General himself in March 1982 recognised was the appropriate description for the way that matter had been handled by his officers. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we come to prosecution policy. Leaving aside the whole area of taxation about which we have heard so much, we find some extraordinary things. The Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth is particularly adept, it seems, not only at taxation prosecutions but also at trade practices matters! The Full Court of the Federal Court decided against the Commonwealth informant, the Trade Practices Commission, in the matter of Traveland Ltd this year, saying in the course of its judgment:</PARA>
<PARA> There are no less than 96 different combinations of elements of an offence against section 53 (c). Each different combination constitutes a distinct offence. The information and summonses in the present case failed to charge Traveland, in terms, with any one of those 96 possible offences. </PARA>
<PARA>Such is the level of competence of the DCS in Perth not only in tax prosecutions but also in crucially important trade practices ones as well. There is another case in the DCS office in Brisbane, that of Gilmour v. Midways Springwood Pty Ltd, which demonstrates again at that level incapacity of a similar order. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to what I have generally described in the document which is tabled but regrettably not incorporated as 'miscellaneous delays and failings', something should be said about the legal aid area. Here we have had another extraordinarily drawn out saga of inaction in relation to an extremely important report on cost comparisons between the delivery of legal aid directly by salaried professionals as against through private practitioners, an exercise which was supposedly set in train in August 1981 and which has been the subject of an unbelievable saga of inattention, neglect and possibly actual interference and obstruction by the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the legal aid largesse increase administered to the firm of Galbally and O'Bryan in the context of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union to which I drew attention in November 1981 and which has now, of course, assumed new interest, relevance and importance with the further revelations and conclusions about the appropriateness of Mr Galbally's performance in this respect in the fourth interim Costigan report. Here let me simply say that the Commonwealth, through the Attorney-General's Department, was party to what I think on any objective view would be described as an unjustifiably generous commitment of scarce legal aid funds-of which $800 for each non-sitting day of the Commission was perhaps the most glaring aspect-to a firm whose continued representation of the union was regarded as quite unsatisfactory by the Royal Commission and which in the Commissioner's words 'reflects no credit on Mr Galbally'. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been complaints by the Ombudsman, particularly in his second report, 1978-79, about failures of the Attorney-General's Department to respond quickly to requests for advice which have been made by numerous Commonwealth departments . There has been a failure to implement the United Nations Convention on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance despite its signature by Australia as long ago as 1956 and the conclusion of consultations about the form of regulations to enable Australia's implementation of that Convention in March 1977. Formalities are complete but still the matters languish. </PARA>
<PARA> There it is. Many more items could be brought forward in this particular bill of indictment against the Attorney-General and against the administration under him of his Department. The total impression one gets in all of this is of an Attorney, Senator Durack, bobbing about like a cork aimlessly in the sea, periodically beset by storms but mostly utterly becalmed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not just my opinion. I make it clear that this is not simply the perception of the Labor Party. Might I remind the honourable senator for a start that Senator Durack was attacked by the Young Liberals on 14 January 1982 for his 'lethargy' in law reform. He was attacked by the Liberal Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, Mr Connolly, in a statement on 20 April this year for his 'glacial' progress in responding to a Public Accounts Committee report. He was attacked only yesterday by the Senate Select Committee on Industrial Relations Legislation, an all-party committee of this Senate, in its interim report for his failure to provide adequate advice in relation to the legal issues before that Committee. He has been attacked by one of the honourable senator's back bench colleagues, Mr Max Burr from Tasmania, who has called for a full investigation into the administration of his Department, an investigation which is long overdue and which would undoubtedly reveal, if it did take place, across a systematic front that the fault in that Department lies by and large not with the middle and lower level officers, or with most senior officers, who have in my experience been wholly professional and wholly competent. The failure in that Department lies, in my perception and that of many people who have perceived this from outside, in the utter failure of ministerial direction from Senator Durack and indeed the man whom the Government has appointed as the head of that Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point of this matter of public importance is not to carp for carping's sake about a Minister whose performance is demonstrably simply not up to the mark. The point of bringing this matter of public importance forward today is to make it abundantly clear, unequivocally clear and unanswerably clear that Senator Durack's failure to prosecute effectively the bottom-of-the-harbour schemers-all those involved, whether as vendors, purchasers or promoters of those schemes-is not just an isolated instance of maladministration. It is not just an isolated instance of neglect, delay or incompetence. It is an instance of something which runs right through and which is endemic to the whole conduct of the Attorney- General's Department under this Minister, and it amounts to a devastating reason why he should resign. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance introduced in the Senate this afternoon and addressed by Senator Evans raises the question of the incompetence and maladministration of the Attorney-General's Department-one of the original departments of the Commonwealth, one with a very long and proud record and undoubtedly one of the major departments still in the Federal administration. It is a very large department with great responsibilities and one which over the years-including the years in which I have been its ministerial head as Attorney-General-has discharged those responsibilities with great distinction even though, of course, as in any big organisation, there may be some delays, some neglect and some grounds for criticism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting that Senator Evans introduces a complaint about maladministration because, of course, Senator Evans has never had any experience of administering anything except perhaps a lecture course to undergraduates. It is an old saying that those who can, do and those who cannot, teach. Senator Evans, in his whole career, has been a teacher of law students. Since he has been in the Senate he has assumed the role of teacher of the Senate and time and again we have been subjected to long boring lectures on the law, on me or on my Department. Such lectures usually empty the Senate, and today has been no exception because there were fewer people in the Senate when Senator Evans was speaking than there are at the moment. It is somewhat of an irony that this man who likes to call himself the shadow Attorney-General, who is an academic, a theorist and a lecturer, has given us a lecture today about administration. At least, that is what he purported to give us. Of course, largely it was a re-run from Senator Evans of the old record about me. Although the terms of it are about the administration of my Department and so on, in fact it turns out to be the old worn record of his complaints that he has about me and about the policies that I follow. I am proud that he does not agree with them. I would be very worried indeed if Senator Evans praised any of my achievements, because he does not agree with many of the policies that I follow and I certainly do not agree with those that he follows. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike Senator Evans, I will speak to the subject. He introduced a matter of public importance about maladministration and neglect over the last five years in the Department of which I am the head. In recent years the work of the Department has increased very greatly, particularly in the Advisings Division. Certainly if there has not in totality been more cases in recent years, the Crown Solicitor's Division has been concerned in the criminal area and the area of constitutional law with some very major cases indeed. I cannot give the total number of cases or files that there would be in the Crown Solicitor's Division, but the report of the Attorney-General's Department to the Senate last year shows that in the Crown Solicitor's Division more than 100,000 matters were completed in 1980-81 and 84,000-odd in 1981-82. It has a very large area of responsibility, and its work is conducted by 200-odd legal staff around Australia, assisted of course by a great many lay staff. In the Crown Solicitor' s Division alone there is a very large responsibility and, I believe, a growing responsibility. Because of the growth in the size of government in recent years the Advisings Division of the Department, which provides the daily legal advice on all the ramifications of government, has had a very great increase in demands made upon it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am speaking of the traditional role of the Attorney-General's Department and of the Attorney-General; namely, of giving advice to government and conducting litigation and prosecutions on behalf of the Crown. That is essentially what the Attorney-General's Department was established to do; and it has always been at the very heart and core of the Department to carry out that work. As I have said on another occasion recently, the work is that of a service department. The Attorney-General's Department acts as a lawyer on behalf of clients. Its client is the Commonwealth Government and all the numerous ramifications of the Government. The Attorney-General has the role of giving legal advice at the request of colleagues. He is in almost daily communication with them either in meetings or elsewhere. These days the Attorney-General takes very little time-in fact no time as far as I or my predecessor are concerned-to conduct litigation in court which was one of the traditional roles of the Attorney-General. The role of the Attorney-General is now so involved because of the size of the Department, the size of government and the political responsibilities that that is an impossible task. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the Attorney-General's Department has two other very large areas of responsibility, both of which have grown quite spectacularly in recent years. Firtly, I refer to the new Federal courts system. It is interesting to note that in 1975 there were 30 Federal judges; today there are 74 or 75. If we went back further, for instance to 1956, we would find that there were only 15. Over most of the period of the Department's life it has been concerned only with the administration of the High Court and very small Federal courts such as the Australian Capital Territory courts or the Industrial Court. In recent years that court system has increased greatly. The size of the High Court has not increased, but it has moved to Canberra and a great deal of work and new responsibility has been involved in that transfer and in the new legislation as well as in the new building. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Court of Australia, which was established in 1977 by my predecessor , is now one of the great courts of Australia, but it is also a very large court . The judges of that court have to be attended to, with their needs for court space, offices, staff and so on. The judges have to command attention from the Department and, indeed, from the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, in January 1976 the Family Court was established. With 41 judges, it has now become the largest court in Australia. It had to be set up as a completely new court. Finding premises and staffing branches in every State except Western Australia have made tremendous administrative demands upon the Department. So too have the appointment of judges and the necessity to deal with them, in particular the Chief Judge, having in mind the size of the court. I mention that simply to indicate the greatly increased responsibilities which in recent years have been assumed by the Department-an assumption that I believe on the whole has been very successful. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the Federal Court of Australia, despite the very short time since its inception, is now hailed as one of this country's great courts. The criticisms made of the Family Court have been largely misplaced and relate more to differences of view about the Family Law Act and the policy to be followed under it than to the court and its judges. It has been a most innovative court, one which has given true meaning to the phrase 'helping court', as it has frequently been described-I believe with full justification. It has initiated procedures, such as those involving court counsellors and conciliation registrars, which provide, through a court, a completely new concept of service to people who are in trouble. That has been a major achievement and responsibility of my Department and myself in recent years. To make carping criticisms of a few delays here and there, which is all that Senator Evans has done, shows a complete lack of sense of judgment about the size of the task and the dedication of the officers of my Department. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely not. How would he know? He has administered only a lecture course for undergraduates. Another very large area of responsibility of the Attorney-General and his Department concerns policy areas such as that of criminal law, a matter which, in the United Kingdom, is dealt with by the Home Secretary, not by a law department at all. Similarly, the Department is concerned in business and trade law matters which again, in the United Kingdom, fall within the responsibility of another department of state altogether. Industrial property law and copyright law also are the responsibility of the Attorney-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of his most important new responsibilities has concerned administrative law reform and civil rights. Senator Evans has grudgingly referred to the Human Rights Commission but, of course, there have been very much greater achievements in that area. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal has been developed. The Administrative Review Council provides judicial review of the merits of decisions. The avenue for complaints against police as provided by recent legislation is but another notable example of action in many areas. That is one of the new provinces, to use an old phrase, of law and order that have been developed in recent years and have become the reponsibility of my Department and myself. The freedom of information legislation took much time to prepare because it concerned a very innovative and controversial area. I had the responsiblity of piloting that legislation successfully through this Parliament. Senator Evans makes the further carping criticism that there has been delay in implementing it but he has not the remotest idea of the problems for the Public Service in regard to training and the development of systems in order to give effect to legislation of that kind. Those actions are proceeding. We will not bring the legislation into force until it can be administered effectively and efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans has referred to other areas of policy. I repeat that this is another very important aspect of the Attorney-General's responsibility. In the years during which I have held that office, I have found that a great deal of my time has been taken up with policy matters rather than with the traditional activity of providing legal advice. I refer to the aspect of court administration and the great development of the new Federal Court system-another matter which occupies a great deal of my time and that of officers of my Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, the criticism that Senator Evans has made, the criticism of the Crown Solicitor's Division that has been current in recent weeks, affecting as it does but a few officers of that Division, has clouded, in a most unfortunate and unfair way, the tremendous work and exercise of responsibility by the officers of the Department in the pursuit of all facets of its role. A tremendous disservice is being done to this country by those who-the Opposition, in particular-have been harping on failings here and there. This reduces, in the public estimation, the standing of one of the original, and most important, departments of state of the Commonwealth Government. I express my great concern about that aspect and the effect that it may well have upon the ability of the Department to recruit people of the calibre that it needs and has been able to obtain in recent years. The Department has always been able to find officers and lawyers of very high calibre. But in recent years attention has been given to ensuring the recruitment and training of young officers of like calibre. The Department has been well aware of the need for new management approaches and has taken important steps in that direction. I have referred previously to the joint management review and its implementation in the Crown Solicitor's area. But in recent years the Department has also conducted a number of management conferences and seminars for Second Division and Third Division officers. This training program was begun in October 1980. A major conference is held every year and during the year a series of training seminars for senior officers is held. Thus the Department is well aware of the magnitude of its management problems and has taken significant steps to bring itself up to date and to acquire the skills needed. The motion before us does a great disservice to a major department of state and is unworthy of Senator Evans. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance has been brought before the Senate today because members of the Opposition-Senator Evans in particular-wish to point out that, although the problems raised in the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union-especially the problems of tax evasion and the lack of vigour with which the Government has approached the prosecution of those involved in tax evasion-are important, the long history of delay, neglect, incompetence and maladministration in the Attorney-General's Department under Senator Durack is also a matter of importance. In opening this debate, Senator Evans spent time listing carefully and discussing a whole series of examples of delay, neglect, incompetence and dubious practice which in fact add up to maladministration under any meaning of the term. What have we had from the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, for the last 20 minutes? We have had, first of all, an attack on Senator Evans based on the fact that Senator Evans happens to have been an academic.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Evans says, he omitted the fact that he was a barrister and practised as such. Secondly, we had a description of Senator Durack's Department as the oldest and proudest department of government in this country. For the rest of the time we heard what can only be described as a whinge about the work load of the Attorney-General's Department being too great, about the increased responsibilities of the Department, about the increase in the number of judges and about the amount of advice the Department has to give. The Attorney was making an excuse for the incompetence, the maladministration, the delay and the neglect that Senator Evans spoke about and that I and Senator Georges will speak about. If problems such as this long litany of difficulties facing the Department because of increased responsibility are the cause of the disquiet in the community and in the Parliament about the Attorney-General's Department, I point out that the responsibility lies clearly with the Government and with the Attorney-General for having failed to administer that Department properly, for having failed to ensure that the Department had the capacity, both financial and human, to conduct its activities properly. That is also maladministration, and that is a responsibility that Senator Durack and his colleagues have to face.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Teague always sits and carps because he has nothing better to do on the afternoons when matters of public importance are discussed. Senator Durack then had the hide to suggest at the end of his speech, after having failed to answer any of the criticisms made by Senator Evans, other than by excuse and by a worrying speech about the difficulty of his job and the work load of his Department, that the Opposition is being irresponsible in bringing forward in this Parliament what is obviously a problem in the Attorney-General's Department and what is obviously a problem in the administration of it by the Attorney-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Evans pointed out, it is not only in those areas referred to in the Costigan report and it is not only in the area of failure to prosecute those involved in tax avoidance that the Department comes under criticism. There are the areas that Senator Evans listed and there are the areas that I will talk about. One matter to which I wish to refer is the differences in approach of the Department, particularly the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office, in regard to the prosecution of justice and in ensuring that justice is seen to be done in various aspects of the law in this country. It is important to realise that we have a duty to bring this forward. </PARA>
<PARA> Even the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has realised this in the past, if not at present. He has said in the past that there is no way known that anything less than the highest code and practice of public administration will be tolerated in this country. At the moment the Prime Minister is vigorously protecting the Attorney and his Department, in which a major blunder has been committed. He is protecting the Minister responsible for the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth in which, I suggest, the highest code of practice and public administration, to quote the Prime Minister, is a sick joke. So long as the Prime Minister does not accept the resignation of the Minister responsible-who, of course, is Senator Durack-he is tolerating a pocket of shoddy, lying and venal administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Costigan report claimed that inaction within the Attorney-General's Department has cost the Commonwealth revenue hundreds if not thousands of millions of dollars. I must suggest to honourable senators that that revenue could have eased the strain on millions of Australian families, the well-being of which has never particularly concerned the Minister responsible in this case, Senator Durack. In the failure to prosecute those involved in the bottom-of-the- harbour tax avoidance scheme and other rigged schemes in this country not only have we a situation in which the rich and the powerful are able to avoid their responsibilities but also we have a very good example, if we compare that activity of the Crown Solicitor's Office with that Office's activities in the area of social security prosecutions, of differential treatment, of double standards, which I do not believe should be tolerated in what Senator Durack describes as the oldest and proudest department of government in this country. Certainly the Australian Labor Party does not condone social security fraud but when people concerned with those frauds, usually involving only a couple of hundred dollars, if that, are prosecuted and jailed while prosecutions do not take place in cases involving many hundreds of thousands of dollars or more, one wonders about the system and its administration. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1978-79 there were 1,368 prosecutions against social security offenders and successful prosecutions were recorded against 1,328 of those people-about 94 per cent. The total payment which formed the basis for the alleged frauds in that time was $1.5m for the whole 1,300-odd people prosecuted. That amount of money would be considered petty cash by the people who have escaped prosecution, despite the advice of Queen's Counsel and despite the advice of the Australian Taxation Office, and who have run off with at least hundreds of millions of dollars. At the same time the might of the Crown Solicitor's Office has been brought down on these 1,300 people who received an average of approximately $1, 200 in overpayments. Many received much less. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of these people were unemployed, over half were married or in a de facto situation and most pleaded guilty though less than half seemed to be aware of their guilt or had not committed the offences because they needed the money. A total of 17 per cent stated they had acted in ignorance and 20 per cent gave no reason. Most of them were not represented by lawyers in private practice and 3 per cent received prison sentences. The Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office in Perth carried out 152 prosecutions. In Western Australia-famous for protecting the habitat of the shonky company directors we have been hearing about-one social security recipient was imprisoned for an overpayment of $148 and two others were imprisoned for more than 260 days each. The Law Reform Commission report from which these figures can be obtained unfortunately has no analysis which gives a clue as to how many of these prosecutions related to beneficiaries who were Aboriginals, non-English speaking or virtually illiterate, but I think it likely that these groups formed a high proportion of the people charged. Incidentally, the report of the Law Reform Commission suggests that the cost effectiveness of these prosecutions warrants scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> Getting away from the prosecution of these people who can be considered the small fry in the ripping off of government funds, we come to the most shameful episode in this Government's record of prosecuting people. I refer, of course, to the Greek conspiracy case, as it was called, in which 176 Greek-Australian pensioners and six doctors were arrested in 1978 and which was dropped after four years of the most expensive committal hearings in this country. Estimated costs vary from some $10m to many more millions of dollars than that. There were aspects of that case in which the Minister's Department was involved, which I think warrant scrutiny and demonstrate the sort of maladministration about which Senator Evans spoke. </PARA>
<PARA> When Senator Durack became Attorney-General in September 1977, there was a question of a reward for Mr Chris Narkis, an informant in the case. That was under active discussion with various departments but in particular with the Crown Solicitor's Office of the Minister's own Department. Mr Barry Leader of that Office, who rates some mention in the Costigan report, had been involved in talks which led ultimately to Senator Durack giving Mr Narkis a pardon and others in the Government giving an assurance of a reward commensurate with results, a reward estimated as varying from $30,000 to $200,000. It is important to know whether Mr Leader or any other of the senior officials who were involved in those discussions warned the Attorney-General that such a reward gave a financial incentive to framing a case against those so-called conspirators. If Senator Durack did not know what was going on in his Crown Solicitor's Office, he should have known, and if members of that office did not tell him it is clearly and example of maladministration in that Department. </PARA>
<PARA> As the final transcripts of the conspiracy case demonstrated, the conspiracy was in fact against the Greek pensioners themselves. Mr Narkis was described by the magistrate as one whose credibility was zero or next to zero, and the magistrate recommended that proceedings be taken against ex-Detective Chief Inspector Thomas for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice or for perjury or for both. When this matter was raised with Senator Durack-the question of action against Thomas some two and a half months after the magistrate had made that statement-it was replied to by the usual answer, that the Attorney-General did not know what was happening. </PARA>
<PARA> Almost 400 sitting days and 320,000 pages later, after the start of this case, the case collapsed-at great cost. Someone in that Crown Solicitor's Office must have known, in view of the questions that were repeatedly asked in this place and repeatedly asked in the community about the conduct of the case-indeed, the question asked by Senator Wright 10 days after the case when I first spoke about it, about the wisdom of proceeding on a conspiracy charge in such a situation- surely should have alerted the Attorney-General and the Crown Solicitor's Office as to what could happen in that case. That apparently did not happen. It is a demonstration of incompetence and of maladministration that nothing was discovered. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that if we add to this conspiracy case in Australia the situation which arose in Greece, where Greek Australians were charged under Greek law with offences under Australian law, and the agony through which this Parliament had to go to get information about that case, and the fact that the Opposition had to go to Greece and get the court records there-which apparently the Attorney-General's Department could not get despite the fact that representatives of his Department had gone there-this demonstrates a lack of concern about true justice in this case. It is to be compared with the manner in which the Attorney-General's officers sat on their hands over the tax evasion cases and the manner in which Mr Costigan describes the cavalier behaviour of those officers in Western Australia and other places. If this single case, the Greek conspiracy case, as compared with the actions in the normal social security prosecutions in this country, does not demonstrate a malaise in the Department by itself, combined with Senator Evans's long dissertation on the large numbers of difficulties which have arisen in this Department, it should do so, and if it does not cause concern for the Government, for members of the Senate and of the other place and of this community, it is a sad thing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance is another re- run of the matter of public importance raised by the Opposition yesterday and a fortnight ago. We have just heard Senator Grimes moralising about the Greek conspiracy case. In effect, what he is saying is that we are damned if we do and damned if we do not-because in the Greek conspiracy case we allegedly rushed into the prosecution too soon without giving it serious consideration, and yet, as I shall show later in my speech, according to Senator Grimes's colleague Senator Walsh, because we took 15 days before we suspended officers of the Attorney-General's Department in connection with the Costigan report, we were not acting quickly enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It fascinates me to hear Australian Labor Party senators moralising, because if the ALP were genuine about its morality in this matter, it would expel the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union from affiliation with the party. Instead of doing that, the Victorian secretary of the ALP has announced publicly that that affiliation is not in jeopardy. Let me quote a part of the report which was tabled yesterday in the Senate, and it is a part of the report which Mr Costigan had previously kept secret. Before doing that, however, I should like to comment on the secrecy of this report. Every night on television we have been seeing the Leader of the Opposition in the other place, Mr Hayden, like a harlot baring her breast, exposing to the Press titbits of the secret parts of the Costigan report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All right, Mr Deputy President if you so rule, I certainly withdraw those remarks. I was talking about Senator Grimes moralising here. Let me comment on that part of the secret report which was exposed yesterday as a result of what Mr Hayden has been demanding and leaking to the Press. Mr Costigan at paragraph 10.02 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this stage of the investigation I am satisfied that the Union, at least in Victoria, Newcastle, Queensland and South Australia, if not in Sydney as well, is an organised criminal group following criminal pursuits. </PARA>
<PARA>One cannot get anything blunter than that. Yet the ALP continues to allow this union to remain affiliated with it and to take its moneys. Furthermore, that union has an effect on the determination of the policy of the ALP, and it helps in the selection of ALP members of parliament because it elects delegates to its various organisations. If the ALP were genuine in this matter, it would be doing something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me comment on what Senator Evans has had to say today. The wording of this motion is Senator Evans's wording. It is clear that he is piqued that his pet projects have not been given the priority that he would have wanted to give them . Yet he comes here grizzling about the actions of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in not giving priority to his proposals. Why should the Attorney-General give priority to Senator Evans's proposals? With all due respect to Senator Evans, I suggest that he is naive. So far as an administrator would be concerned , he is an ivory tower academic. He comes in here with his carping criticism about the administration of the Attorney-General's Department when clearly he knows absolutely nothing about the administration of any organisation and certainly nothing about the administration of the Attorney-General's Department. I suggest to the Senate that he could not run a corner store. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, it is clear from the Costigan report, as I said in the debate yesterday, that the Ministers are innocent of any charge. Paragraphs 1.28 and 1.32 of chapter 3 of volume 1 of Interim Report No. 4 of the Costigan Commission clearly show that proposition I have just put to be true. It is also clear that Senator Walsh, who uses his vitriolic tongue to attack people both inside and outside this Parliament, has made it clear that, having read this report, he does not think there is anything in it so far as the Ministers are concerned except for a period of three weeks. He claimed that it was three weeks . In fact, on investigation I discovered that it was 15 days. Senator Walsh says that the Attorney-General received the report and waited for 15 days before he suspended the officers. </PARA>
<PARA> That is Senator Walsh's entire criticism. Let us analyse that entire criticism. In fact, the Attorney-General did not receive the report and have it for 15 days ; the Department had the report for 15 days. The Department received the report on 3 August and on 18 August the officers O'Sullivan and Bercove were suspended. That happended 15 days later and not three weeks later. That was the decision of the permanent head and not of the Attorney-General. Much to Senator Walsh's surprise, decisions on suspension in fact are not made by the Attorney-General but are made by the permanent head. I remind the Senate that there are such things as statutory authorities in systems of government and that there are certain offices that are independent statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, let us look again at Senator Evans and his carping criticism of Senator Durack. Let me analyse what some other people have said about the matter. For example, Mr Trevor Hawkins, the head of the bureau of the Melbourne Sun, on 4 September 1982 said:</PARA>
<PARA> Few will argue that Senator Durack is not a hard-working and diligent Minister who has a rare command of his portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA>Those who listened carefully to this debate earlier this afternoon would agree totally with those sentiments. I suggest to the Senate that the Attorney-General this afternoon confirmed beyond any shadow of doubt what Mr Hawkins said in the Melbourne Sun-that Senator Durack 'has a rare command of his portfolio'. Let us look at some of the things that have happened while Senator Durack has been Attorney-General of this nation. Let us look at the off-shore legislation. This legislation is due to be proclaimed later this year. I put it to the Senate that the legislation is a unique achievement in the history of Commonwealth and State relations. The reason it is unique is that the Commonwealth had exclusive power in this area. It is clear that the ALP would have ridden rough-shod over the States in implementing whatever proposals it had. In fact, what happened under the present Government was that the Commonwealth worked in conjunction with the States and finally came up with a solution which was satisfactory to the States as well as to the Commonwealth. I put to the Senate that that is what federation is all about-the sharing of power and responsibility among constituent governments of the nation. One of the landmarks of the Attorney-General's period in office has been the amendment of the Acts Interpretation Act which requires courts to take account of the purposes or intent of an Act when interpreting the meaning of legislation, the statutory interpretation provisions. The importance of this proposal cannot in any way be underestimated. One of the highlights of my term as a Senator has been supporting that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the administration of the courts. During Senator Durack's five-year administration as Attorney-General he has appointed the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, four justices of the High Court, 10 judges of the Federal Court of Australia and 11 judges of the Family Court of Australia. There has been not one word of criticism of any one of those 26 judicial appointments. All of those appointments have been right and proper and have been acknowledged by both sides around Australia. Apart from that, the Attorney-General was responsible for the High Court of Australia Act which, in fact, requires the Attorney-General of Australia to consult with Attorneys-General of the States before appointing a High Court justice. Also, that Act gives independence to the Australian High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General has been involved in a call for a single system of courts. He has indicated that he would give full support for the Commonwealth having these proposals developed, examined and debated as soon as possible at the Australian Constitutional Convention. He has been looking at conferences in relation to the sentencing of people around Australia. During this year he signed the anti-trust agreement-a landmark agreement with the United States of America-designed to resolve conflicts which might arise between Australian national interests and policies and the implementation of the American anti- trust laws. This was absolutely a landmark agreement and an enormous amount of work was involved in the preparation of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to look at the freedom of information legislation. Those honourable senators who were present will recall the enormous amount of painstaking time and effort which the Attorney-General put in to make sure that the freedom of information legislation was satisfactory to this Parliament. Again, the Attorney -General is to be congratulated on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been asked about tax avoidance. Let me say that the Attorney-General and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) of this nation have done far more about anti-tax evasion and anti-tax avoidance legislation than any other government has ever done in the history of this nation. In the years 1972 to 1975 the Labor Party had opportunities to take action in this area and it did nothing whatsoever about it. A list of all relevant legislation-hundreds of pages of legislation -in relation to tax avoidance has been presented to the Senate. Yet people on the Opposition side are suggesting that we have not done enough. The Attorney-General was responsible for all that legislation. The Human Rights Commission, which was established by Senator Durack, is coming into operation. I turn to the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation legislation. Legislation arising from the Hope Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security is coming into operation. The Attorney-General has done a vast amount of work and he is highly praised for having done so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me mention the problems of the public servants who are being criticised by the Opposition for their part in this matter. These snide remarks from the Opposition must surely be going down very badly with them, as they would be with the young people of Australia. Perhaps the old people of Australia, too, are also sick to death of mud-slinging being involved in politics and the sort of mud-slinging which is going on here today, which went on yesterday and which is continually going on in an endeavour, some way or other, to involve the Government in these matters. Instead the Opposition should be looking at the Costigan report and the criminal activities of the painters and dockers union and showing some leadership, courage and morality in doing something about it. That is what the Opposition should be doing instead of engaging in this carping, mud-slinging criticism. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If we are to take at face value what Senator Lewis has had to say about the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in the eulogy which he has just presented we must accept in stark contrast his performance in other areas. One could say that his incompetence in certain areas to which the Opposition has devoted itself-if what Senator Lewis is saying is correct-must be deliberate. This is a theory to which I am beginning to be attracted-that the incompetence of the Crown Solicitor's Office reflects the incompetence of the Minister. One must be reminded that the Minister is not only the Attorney- General; he is also the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate. For that reason he has a further responsibility to accept that he is a very important officer of this place and that his behaviour should be beyond reproach. His behaviour has not been beyond reproach. He must accept the responsibility for the performance of his Department, and it is my belief that his general attitude to his duties is now reflected in the performance of the Crown Solicitor's Office. It is in the area of income tax collection that the Attorney-General has failed the people of Australia. His failure to see that the Crown Solicitor's Office actively and promptly pursued areas of default makes him culpable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been mentioned by two previous speakers on this side that I would refer to another area of default by the Minister and by the Crown Solicitor's Office, but I have to limit my comments. It is a matter to which I can refer only briefly. It is being investigated by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. A reference to the Public Accounts Committee deals with Medi-fraud and overservicing within the Department of Health. Because it is a reference and because I am a member of that Committee I cannot refer to any evidence that has been received by the Committee which is not public; nor can I in any way come to any conclusion which can be anticipated as a conclusion which the Committee might reach. But it is only fair to advise the people of Australia that what is beginning to emerge is that the Deputy Crown Solicitor's Office has been at fault in this area of income collection. It is beginning to appear, and it is on the public record, that doctors have overserviced or defrauded to the extent of many millions of dollars. Here is another area of neglect which can in some ways be related to the Crown Solicitor's Office because it has not engaged promptly in prosecutions which would have minimised the problem. That is a fault. A fault is beginning to emerge not only in that area but also with regard to Customs and excise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Crown Solicitor's Office is not properly carrying out prosecutions which have been brought to it by the Australian Federal Police. That evidence is beginning to emerge in the area of collection of excise, and many millions of dollars of taxpayers' money, money that society has a right to have access to, is not coming to the Treasury. The Crown Solicitor's Office must accept responsibility for that. It is far too tardy. There is evidence that from the moment a matter is brought to the notice of the Crown Solicitor's Office it is often 12 months to two years before action is taken. All of the efforts of the Federal Police or the various departments which seek to have prosecutions enacted are negated. For that reason the Attorney-General must look to his Department and accept responsibility for it. What has happened under the administration of the Attorney-General is the devolving of responsibility from the Crown Solicitor's Office in Canberra to the deputy crown solicitors offices in the States; there is a sort of extension of federalism. It is the Attorney- General's responsibility that he was not aware that the Crown Solicitor in Canberra was unaware of what was happening in the deputy crown solicitors offices in each of the States, in particular in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> So what happens now? What are we faced with? We are faced with the situation of the Attorney-General knowing nothing because the Crown Solicitor knows nothing and the deputy crown solicitors in each of the States are afraid to act. What sort of department is this? It is a department which is responsible for prosecuting those who defraud. But nothing has been done and it is now exposed by the report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union that there is company fraud on a massive level. Let me take honourable senators back to 1970, when the Senate appointed the Select Committee on Securities and Exchange. What the report of that Committee revealed was what the Costigan report is revealing now, that is, massive company fraud, massive speculation and people guilty of fraud and share manipulation. But nothing was done by the Attorney-General's Department. Why is the Attorney, Senator Durack, culpable in this area? I think he entered the Parliament in 1971 . Let me find the exact date when Senator Durack entered the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. Senator Durack was appointed to the Securities and Exchange Committee on 17 August 1971. About a month after he entered this Parliament he was appointed to that important Committee. He was privy to all the evidence that came before it. He was privy to all the evidence that showed massive manipulation of the Stock Exchange in Perth. He was privy to the evidence of all those witnesses, some from Western Australia, who were brought before the Committee, some of whom perjured themselves. He knew of the massive share manipulation in Western Australia. It was from that environment that he and several others in this place came. He knew of the massive theft from the Australian people through the stock exchanges. He knew the environment, he knew the evidence and he knew the report. Having become Attorney-General one would have expected that something would have been done. But nothing was done and what we have now is a repetition of the disclosures--</PARA></TALK.START>

That Act was proclaimed on 1 July 1982, 12 years after all the massive distortion with which he was familiar was disclosed. The National Companies and Securities Commission, which took 12 years to appoint , has just received the legislation that it needs to operate. It took 12 years. I wonder how long it will take the proposed crimes commission to be appointed and what sort of legislation the Minister will give it. Could I say to you, Senator, that when I look back at your performance on the Committee and having appreciated what has happened over the past month or two, I am beginning to believe that your role on that Committee was to delay it, to divert it and to defuse it.

The Attorney-Genral's Department is responsible for making prosecutions and it has failed to carry out those prosecutions. Therefore we must hold the Attorney-General responsible. The Attorney-General has refused to accept responsibility. Although this matter of public importance is directed towards the Department, one cannot separate-no matter how much the Attorney-General may wish to do so-the Attorney-General from the Department. If the Department is at fault, the Attorney-General must accept responsibility. The fault has been massive to the point where only one action is acceptable to this place, that is, the resignation of the Attorney-General. But he will stick it out just as his colleagues do in Western Australia, Queensland and in the National Country Party. That very action diminishes this place. Senator Durack has introduced a new ethical position for Ministers of the Crown. He has introduced into this place some of the corruption which exists in the areas which he should have done something about. I am surprised that he should not accept that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are discussing a matter of public importance which is in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The long history of delay, neglect, incompetence and maladministration in the Attorney-General's Department under Senator Durack. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not my wish or intention to talk about the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, as a person or indeed about the many aspects of his administration which other speakers have discussed. There are good and bad aspects in every Minister' s administration. I intend to specialise in one aspect that has grown up in this country under his administration. He is not the only person involved. The whole of the Government has to be involved, particularly the Treasurer (Mr Howard), the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and other Ministers. Unfortunately and unhappily the debate about ministerial responsibility in this Parliament is becoming almost academic. I do not suggest that it is unimportant. A Melbourne Age columnist, Claude Forell, summed up the situation exquisitely this morning when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, it is clear that Westminster precedents have become optional guidelines or debating points rather than a firm basis for Australian political ethics. </PARA>
<PARA>One can look back and consider the totally unjust sacking of Senator Withers. One can consider the sackings of Messrs MacKellar and Moore over almost petty little things. Yet we have seen the survival of people such as Mr Sinclair and Mr Nixon-if one wants to extend it, one could include Senator Durack and Mr Howard-who have presided over mammoth inefficiency and corruption and who go unscathed simply because it is politically impossible to sack a National Country Party Minister. I do not propose to go into that nonsense. It might suit academics to talk about ministerial responsibility. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is too late for it and I agree that it is just not on. I wish to concentrate my remarks on the question of organised crime which has flourished under this Government. In Chapter 10 of Volume 2 of the report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, Mr Costigan describes a criminal octopus of almost fictional proportions which is frightening in its extent and in the massive damage which it inflicts on society. The descriptions that Mr Costigan uses-I understand that he writes every word with his own pen-would have done credit to any Raymond Chandler or Mickey Spillane novel. But this is not fiction. No matter how members of the Government might wish, quite properly, to defend their colleague, I would be very disappointed if they submerged this dreadful story that is now being unwoven by this courageous man, Costigan, in Melbourne. This octopus is preying on Australian citizens, particularly those who cannot afford the burden-because every dollar that these creatures skim off the top is a dollar that a pensioner or someone placed in unhappy circumstances does not get-with a well organised efficiency which is conspicuously lacking in those on whom we rely to fight crime in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wonder what the ordinary citizen feels about politicians today when he or she reads about billions of dollars being ripped off the Government by these criminals. He or she must think: 'What are politicians doing? They are getting huge salaries; they lead good lives. Here we are being ripped off while the politicians do nothing'. What sort of confidence do ordinary people have left in the public service and in bureaucracies? What sort of confidence do they have in the Australian Taxation Office, the police forces and the courts? All of these institutions are being eroded and corroded in the public mind. Where does the blame finally rest? It has to rest here in this chamber and in the chamber across Kings Hall. It has to rest with politicians. This is where the ultimate source of power is. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Costigan described large interlocking criminal schemes involving drugs, prostitution, illegal gambling, tax avoidance, tax evasion and loan sharking. One of the most worrying aspects of the report is that the people involved are not part of one tightly structured organisation. They are from different groups who possibly never meet face to face. There are the investors who supply the capital. According to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) there are some knights of the realm among them. They do so at arm's length knowing full well that they are party to secret crimes. There are the financial and managerial experts who assemble the funds and put them to use in an organised manner. Assisting these groups are the shyster lawyers and accountants who provide assistance for the schemes and assistance for the criminals when they run foul of the law enforcement agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the law societies of this country, the Australian Society of Accountants and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia doing if they are not policing the behaviour of their members? Members of those societies -lawyers and accountants-are assisting white collar crime to the extent of billions of dollars. Yet those societies have the effrontery to call themselves professional organisations. They are professional all right; but criminals attribute that adjective to themselves when they become proficient at their profession. Finally, there are the criminal operatives at the bottom of the scale who carry a cosh or a gun, the drug pushers, the enforcers and the couriers. The irony is that the members of this last group-the cosh merchants, the killers and the drug pushers-are in some way the least dangerous to society, but they are the ones who make the headlines, such as 'murderer arrested' and ' 20 years gaol for drug pusher'. They are the ones who go to prision and yet in some ways they are the least dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner mentions that some justices of the peace may be corrupt enough to subvert the ordinary processes of the legal system for the benefit of criminals. In other words, Mr Costigan is saying that maybe some justices of the peace are on the take. I go further and ask: Who is safe? Is anybody in a position of power in this country safe when the amount of criminal money floating around is of the magnitude suggested by Mr Costigan? We are not talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars. I have been rather amused today by the fact that certain people who have spoken in this debate and those who are about to speak, sniggered at my statements over 10 years that criminal activity in this country is profiting to the extent of billions of dollars a year. I have consistently spoken of profits of $750m a year going to organised crime in this country. There have been sniggers from both sides of the House whenever I have said that. People have said: 'He is at it again. He has an obsession about it'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Look at Hansard, Senator Tate, and see which Opposition senators have interjected while I have been raising these matters. But those people are not sniggering today. If I have made any mistakes in the past 10 years it is because I have underestimated the amount of criminal activity that has been allowed to flourish in this country under two governments, particularly the present Liberal-National Country Party Government. If that amount of illegal money is floating around, which sort of policeman, judge or politician, no matter what his intregity may be, is safe? Are all Cabinet Ministers safe? Mr Costigan has gone part of the way down the track by suggesting that at this stage there is some evidence that certain justices of the peace are on the take. This morning's newspapers reported the revelations of the Costigan Commission as though they are new. They are not new, but unhappily, as always happens in this country, we wake up too late. I hope that those who are now jumping on to this band wagon will not lose sight of the important issues at stake. We need to look at the nature and extent of the problem and then consider the measures necessary . It is a major growth industry in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> May I, without offending the listening audience, describe with over simplicity my understanding of what constitutes a bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. Let us assume that Mr A and his wife, B, decide to form a company and call it AB Company Pty Ltd. Let us remember that the company is now a separate entity from Mr A and his wife. I will make it simple and say that the company trades for one year and makes a profit of $100,000. The tax payable on that profit of $100,000 is about $42,000. So, when the Commissioner of Taxation puts in his assessment, that company will have net assets of $58,000-namely, $100,000 less the tax to be paid, which is $42,000. Then Mr C, the promoter, the white-collar criminal about whom we are talking today, arrives on the scene and says to Mr A and his wife, B : 'I will give you $80,000 for that company'. They cannot believe their luck. Father Christmas has come early. They have been offered $80,000 for something that is worth $58,000. They accept because they will be $22,000 better off. But Mr C does not buy the company. He gets Mr D and Mr E, who are painters and dockers or a couple of criminals, or Joe Smith and his wife Jessie to buy the company from A and B. As soon as that happens Mr C, the promoter, strips the company. Let us assume that the $100,000 I mentioned is in the bank. Mr C simply draws the money out of the bank as a consulting fee. He has done well. He has paid $80,000 for something for which he receives $100,000, so he is $20,000 in front. The only remaining evidence is held by D and E-the painters and dockers- or Joe and Jessie Smith. They then burn the records or, as the expression goes, send them to the bottom of the harbour never to be seen again. What is outstanding is the $42,000 in tax that has never been paid. If one adds three or six noughts to my little example of $42,000, one has millions or billions of dollars being avoided in tax by this extraordinarily simple device. </PARA>
<PARA> It was operated so successfully over nine years or more that the money became too hot to handle, too much profit was going around, so the money had to be laundered. No longer could it be laundered in Australia by a lucrative win at the races or whatever other laundering measures are available for chicken feed illegal money. An international launderer had to be found. Mr Costigan has found that launderer, as has almost simultaneously Mr Justice Stewart, who is conducting a royal commission into drugs. That international launderer was, of course, the Nugan Hand bank, that infamous group which dealt in heroin, obtaining it from Laos and Vietnam and sending it to Australia, then to New Zealand and then to San Francisco, which sold arms to both sides in Kampuchea, and whose directors had unsavoury connections with the Central Intelligence Agency and God knows what. Talking about time bombs in the political world of this country, I believe that future exposures about Nugan Hand will contain more than any others. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a serious problem. We would support very strongly an extension of Mr Costigan's powers. If the Australian Labor Party wishes to move for that it will have our total support. One thing I do ask my colleagues from the Labor Party to do is not to turn an intractable eye to the establishment of a crimes commission . Clearly our current law enforcement procedures, our departmental structures and our political setup have failed to stop crime flourishing in this country. Surely a new approach is needed. </PARA>

What he is doing is trying to gain himself a bit of notoriety. Now that Senator Evans has deigned to come back into the chamber, I would like to know just what he said when he started. I would like to know how Senator Evans used his time when he spoke on this matter of public importance. I think I could defy anybody here to tell me what information he provided today that was new, different or important. I do not think Senator Evans in fact has any appreciation of the fact that people with a high capacity for real work, like Senator Durack and others, do not necessarily have to spend their time just yacking. May I remind Senator Evans that it is what people say that counts, not how much they say. Here we are not paid like lecturers for the amount that is said and I think that occasionally Senator Evans fails to appreciate this point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Evans, having failed so dismally on two occasions already to make his points against the Attorney-General, I am somewhat surprised that he now turns his attack on the Attorney-General's Department. I do not think it is a very brave or courageous act to turn on the Department at a time like this when departmental officers are unable to be present here or to answer the sorts of allegations and aspersions he is, by innuendo, casting in their direction. The Attorney-General's Department, according to its last annual report, has a staff of 1,177 people. That is a very substantial number of people. I think it is ridiculous to brand them all under the headings of incompetence, maladministration, neglect and delay. These accusations have been made in the name of stupid headline grabbing. They are designed to feed a Press with scraps it might look for and to put up a smokescreen against the real issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I know and deal with many officers of the Attorney-General's Department. They have considerable ability, capacity and integrity. They would be rightly and justly indignant at being lumped into a hotch-potch motion such as this which is full of ridiculous accusations and insinuations. In fact, I would back the integrity, dedication and ability of many of the officers whom I know against the people who make the accusations. I think it is worth bearing this point in mind. Senator Durack by any standards is an excellent administrator. We know that. He handles his duties very well. Nobody answers questions in the chamber more fully and more accurately. In the time I have been in this chamber I have never once seen Senator Durack either retract or qualify one answer or one statement that he has made. That is a remarkable performance. Senator Durack came into this place following a very successful professional career in the real commercial outside world. He is highly regarded, he has been successful and he has a proven record in the administration area. </PARA>
<PARA> I think when we start to talk about administration it is not unreasonable that we should start to consider that those who attack his administration could possibly be deemed at some stage to be required to provide an alternative. What sort of administration do honourable senators think that the Australian legal system could expect from an alternative government? Could Australia expect an Attorney-General with such an outstanding knowledge of the law? I think not. Could it expect an Attorney-General with the years of experience in commercial practice in the real world. I think not. Could it expect an Attorney-General with the demonstrated administrative ability that Senator Durack has put together in his years in the real world? Could it expect an Attorney-General who has the established and proven respect of the entire legal system? Australia can be assured that a Labor alternative would be a rather feeble shadow of what we have become accustomed to of late. I would not like to think that the alternative would be some sneering patronising approach that goes with being a man among boys and a boy among men. I think that if that happened we could expect a continuation of the one-track mind operating in an intellectual vacuum of academic law. </PARA>
<PARA> An average person like me has little to do with the law and lawyers. But I think we all understand what Senator Durack has done in the areas of the law that affect ordinary people and ordinary business. I certainly fully understand what things like judicial review, defamation changes and freedom of information have meant to ordinary people. I understand what Senator Durack has done in respect of family law, anti-trust law, copyright and things of that sort. I think we all have to bear that in mind. It is a typical baby and bath water situation. I am absolutely amazed that anybody could criticise Senator Durack to this extent. </PARA>
<PARA> All the things that Senator Durack has done are very important and are particularly well acknowledged by the community. I really cannot understand why Senator Evans would, if he has the capacity that he claims he has, go to such extraordinary lengths here today to demean himself by trying to belittle the very real things that Senator Durack has done, achieved and established. The things that have come through while Senator Durack has been Attorney-General are noteworthy and worthy. No matter what Senator Evans says, he cannot take away the things that have been achieved. I am only sorry that Senator Evans is so sensitive now that the claims he has made have been shown, on the third occasion , to be so absolutely threadbare. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we all know Senator Durack is a very proper man. I have found that he always fully investigates, he appropriately attends to the job at hand and he operates certainly according to the law. It concerns me, as a non-lawyer, to hear certain speakers say that Senator Durack should have ignored or got around section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and that he should have had access to tax documents. I know Senator Durack well enough to know that that is not on. This is why the people of Australia trust him. This is why they know they can trust him. I have not yet had the same assurance from the Opposition nor from the shadow Attorney-General. I would like to have it and so would the people of Australia. I reject the blanket accusation made about the Attorney-General's Department and I again reject the accusation against Senator Durack. I request the Press to report accurately that the Opposition again has pathetically failed to besmirch this excellent Minister. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In the course of the debate on the matter of public importance which has just concluded Senator Georges, who unfortunately seems to have left the chamber at this point, made some statements of a personal nature which were directed at me and which I reject and deeply resent. He was a former colleague of mine on two Senate committees. We served on the important Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange which was presided over by our colleague, Senator Peter Rae. We also served together on the Senate Select Committee on the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill 1975 which looked at a Labor Government Bill on securities and companies. I found it very surprising indeed and very hurtful that Senator Georges saw fit to attack me in the way he did with the imputations he made against my character in the course of the debate. He indicated that in his view I was some sort of a stooge on those committees, to delay them and to prevent any effect being given to the committees' reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Georges also spoke in terms of some gross delays which he said occurred from 1971 when I joined the Securities and Exchange Committee and said that nothing was done until July this year. The fact is that the Senate Securities and Exchange Committee, chaired by Senator Rae, which I think was established in 1970, reported to the Senate in July 1974. In fact that was an interim report although it was the most substantial report that has been submitted to the Senate. That Committee had an enormous task of investigation of the areas of abuse in the securities system during the years of the mineral boom in the late 1960s and early 1970s. I played a very active part in the Committee's work and I gave quite a considerable amount of assistance to the officer who was drafting the Committee's report. I was in full agreement with the major recommendation of the report that a national companies and securities watchdog commission should be established. I resent very much indeed the suggestion that in some way I was there to frustrate the work of that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government saw fit to introduce its own version of a national companies and securities system in a typical bureaucratic and utterly complicated piece of legislation which was referred to another committee of which Senator Georges was chairman for a period. That committee was very concerned to ensure that a system that would not make use of the existing expertise and resources was not foisted on the Australian business community but that a system would be established which would be constitutionally effective. That committee did not complete its work because of the double dissolution in 1975. The then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Howard, began work on a system of control of companies and securities which would be effective constitutionally. That resulted in the establishment of the National Companies and Securities Commission, legislation for which was proclaimed in February 1980 , and the Commission was established in March 1980. It is true that the new uniform companies legislation did not come into effect until this year but the Commission was set up and has been working for two and a half years. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the purpose of this Bill is to discharge the responsibilities of the Commonwealth in relation to visits by foreign warships. The Senate will be aware that in recent months the Government of Victoria sought to exclude certain categories of foreign warships from its ports. Somewhat earlier the Government of New South Wales expressed reservations about visits of these same categories of warships to the Port of Sydney. There have also been attempts by some organisations to hinder or put difficulties in the way of such visits. The Government has made quite plain that it will not accept interference with these visits. Visits to Australian ports of foreign warships are an important aspect of Australia's international relations. They have obvious and important implications for our defence and security. </PARA>
<PARA> Constitutionally the powers in respect of such matters rest with the Commonwealth. It is the Commonwealth, not the States, that is responsible for the maintenance of defence and international arrangements with other countries. Quite properly the Commonwealth has exercised exclusive authority in this area. It intends to continue to do so. To ensure that there is no uncertainty as to the legal position applicable to the visits of such ships, it is believed that legislation in the form now introduced is essential. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to asserting in practical terms the exclusive authority of the Commonwealth, the Bill will perform two other functions. It will make provision in formal terms for the authorising, on behalf of Australia, of entry to our waters by foreign warships where such entry is desired. The need for authorisation to precede any such visit has long been recognised as a matter of international law and practice. Secondly, the Bill will provide a legal framework for appropriate action to be taken to safeguard approved visits from obstruction or interference. At the same time, the Government expects that there will continue to be co-operation with the relevant State authorities in regard to the visits of foreign warships. In the vast majority of cases over many years such co-operation has been forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill specifically adverts in its objects clause to the co-operation and assistance of the States and their authorities in facilitating access to Australian ports for visiting warships. The Government has reiterated in recent statements the importance it attaches to visits to Australia by the warships of allied and friendly countries in the context of our overall defence arrangements . These visits are of the greatest importance, whether they occur in the course of joint exercises, for resupply purposes, for crew recreation or as a practical demonstration of goodwill. We believe that foreign warships should be as free to visit Australian ports as Australian warships are to visit the ports of our friends and allies. The Government has no doubt that its views in this matter are endorsed by the overwhelming majority of the Australian people. It is also relevant to quote from the joint communique issued by the representatives of the Governments of the United States, New Zealand and Australia at the conclusion of the 31st meeting of the ANZUS Council held on the 21st and 22nd June 1982:</PARA>
<PARA>'In particular (the Deputy Secretary and the Ministers) confirmed the high priority each partner placed upon a regular and comprehensive programme of naval visits to each other's ports, as well as to friendly ports in the Asia/Pacific region generally. They recognise the importance of access by United States naval ships to the ports of its Treaty partners as a critical factor in its efforts to maintain strategic deterrence and in order to carry out its responsibilities under the terms of the Treaty. In this regard the Australian and New Zealand members declared their continued willingness to accept visits to their ports by United States naval vessels whether conventional or nuclear powered.'</PARA>
<PARA>In the light of statements made by the Premier of Victoria and earlier by his counterpart in New South Wales, it is believed that this undertaking may not be capable of implementation without the passage of this legislation. The Government accepts that concerns have been expressed, quite understandably, with particular regard to ships which are nuclear powered or ships which could be carrying nuclear weapons. So far as nuclear powered ships are concerned, the Government's position continues to be that expressed by the Prime Minister in his statement to the House of Representatives of 4 June 1976 on this matter. Subject to compliance with appropriate safety procedures, visits of nuclear powered ships can proceed without significant risk of adverse consequences. With regard to visits by ships which could be carrying nuclear weapons, as has been repeatedly made clear, the position is that the foreign governments concerned will not confirm or deny that a particular ship is carrying nuclear weapons. Again, if I may quote from the ANZUS communique: '(The Ministers and the Deputy Secretary) noted and accepted that it is not the policy of the United States Navy to reveal whether or not its vessels are armed with nuclear weapons.'</PARA>
<PARA>To do so in particular cases would over a period of time provide valuable information to potential enemies about the capabilities of the naval forces concerned. The Government accepts this position and will not be seeking disclosure as to whether a particular visiting ship is or is not carrying nuclear weapons. In relation to the safety of nuclear weapons which may be carried on visiting allied warships, the precautions and procedures that are known to be taken by the navies concerned are such as to preclude the possibility of an accidental nuclear detonation. The risk of accidental explosion of the conventional explosive in such weapons is judged to be as small as the risk of an accidental explosion involving conventional weapons carried by our own naval vessels. Such an accident has never happened. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background I turn to the terms of the Bill. As I have already mentioned, the Bill includes an objects clause stating that it is intended to establish procedures for the discharge by the Commonwealth of its constitutional responsibilities and powers. The clause also declares the intention that in furthering the object of the Act the co-operation and assistance of the States and their authorities be sought and utilised, so far as it is appropriate and practicable to do so, in facilitating access to Australian ports for warships visiting Australia. However, the Bill is expressed to operate to the exclusion of any State or Territory laws that would prevent or obstruct any act or thing that a warship or person is empowered or permitted to do by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Central to the operation of the legislation is the power given to the Minister for Defence to grant approval for a specified foreign warship, or class of foreign warships, to have access during a specified period to Australian ports or to specified Australian ports. Such an approval may be made subject to conditions. It is envisaged that, in practice, all such approvals will be subject to compliance with conditions relating to navigation and safety, and health, quarantine, customs and immigration requirements. Provision is also made for the Minister to give directions to the commander of a foreign warship in respect of which an approval is in force. Directions may be given about the movement of the ship or its crew or about the loading or unloading of goods. Directions of this nature would essentially be supplementary to the conditions attached to an approval, and could be necessitated by circumstances arising after an approval is given. Where an approval is in force, a foreign warship covered by the approval will be entitled to enter, remain in and depart from an Australian port covererd by the approval. In addition, goods may be loaded on to or unloaded from the ship and services may be supplied to the ship. </PARA>
<PARA> Under clause 9 of the Bill, the Minister for Defence is empowered to give directions to facilitate access by a foreign warship to an Australian port, where a relevant approval is in force. These powers would be exercised only as a last resort where access by a foreign warship was being frustrated or significantly hindered by a refusal or failure to provide the goods, services or facilities normally required for that purpose. These might include the provision of pilotage or tug services, the availability of berthing facilities, or the supply of services such as water or electricity. Clause 9 provides that a direction may be given only where the Minister is satisfied that giving the direction is necessary to secure the entry, stay or departure of the ship, or the safety of the ship, its crew or other persons, or is necessary or convenient for the effective operation of the ship. Provision is made for compensation for loss or damage sustained as a result of compliance with a direction. Provision is also made for payment for the provision of goods, services or facilities, or other things, pursuant to a direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will establish offences of preventing, hindering or obstructing the entry of a ship to, the berthing of a ship at, or the departure of a ship from, an Australian port in respect of which a relevant approval is in force. Other offences are provided relating to failure to comply with a direction by the Minister for Defence under clause 9, and of preventing, hindering or obstructing other specified activities relating to a ship. As I have already said, the Government believes that visits to Australian ports by the warships of our friends and allies have the overwhelming support of the Australian people. The Government is confident that this legislation, prompted by threat to the continuance of such visits, will have similar support. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>The motion is moved with the support, I understand, of the Australian Democrats and, I hope, of the Independent Senator Harradine, if not yet with the support of the Government or individual Government members. I make it clear at the outset that this motion, which requires the Government to table a series of 22 specifically designated papers, or groups of papers, relating to the Government' s knowledge or consideration of the prosecution of those participating in bottom -of-the-harbour schemes, is not moved with any desire to make it a vehicle for what might be described on the other side of this chamber as another rehash of the issues that have achieved so much prominence in the last three weeks. Rather my desire, and that of the Opposition and those who I hope will support the motion, is to enable the Parliament and the community as a whole to form its own view of what must still be described as the most colossal, in terms of cost, single failure of public administration in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack has refused to resign as a result of this colossal blunder-if that is an appropriate word for it-saying that he was not culpable or negligent for failing to ask questions about the progress of prosecutions in bottom-of-the -harbour matters or for failing actually to take steps to advance those prosecutions. He said, rather, that he simply relied, as he usually does, on departmental advice and that he is not to be held personally responsible for any failing that might conceivably have been involved at the departmental level. Similarly, Mr Howard, the Treasurer, has taken the same kind of position; that it was all someone else's fault, it was not his. The matter got lost somewhere in that interdepartmental jungle which lies in the terrain between the Australian Taxation Office and the Crown Solicitor's Division of the Attorney- General's office across the way. </PARA>
<PARA> If they will not resign, if they will not accept the force of the proposition that has been advanced so strenuously by the Opposition, not to mention the country's media over the last few days, that the Westminster conventions as they operate in Australia demand their resignation on the material now available on the public record, the next step, as the Opposition perceives it, is to ascertain who, then, was responsible. Was it simply those two or three people right down at the bottom of the departmental hierarchy in the Attorney-General's Department who sat on their hands for reasons of either negligence or possibly worse motives than that; was it at a more senior level within the Department, given that the Central Office of the Crown Solicitor's Division did after all advise the Commissioner of Taxation in 1978 that in its institutional view prosecutions would not lie; or did responsibility extend in a direct way higher up the tree still to the Ministers themselves?</PARA>
<PARA> There must be someone in the system who not only gets the blame for what went wrong but also can be seen to deserve that blame. The only way that that blame can begin to be established and rightly located is by the tabling of all the information, all the relevant documents, that will enable an even better judgment to be made of the situation than we have been able to make so far. It is only when all the relevant documents in this unhappy matter are tabled that we will know what opinions were available to whom and when they were available. It is only then that we will know what advices were given by whom and to whom and when. It is only then, when we have had an opportunity to scrutinise these documents, that we will actually know or be able to judge what the quality, respectively, of those advices and opinions was and whether there was any real justification for the failure of the Attorney-General's Department to advise these prosecutions. It is only then that we will know whether it is arguable that reasonable men-indeed even reasonable lawyers, if there is such a breed- were capable of differing about the possibility of such a prosecution or set of prosecutions prevailing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has taken the view so far that the events in this matter speak for themselves, that the culpability of the Ministers-particularly Senator Durack-is obvious. The Government has refused to accept that view. I acknowledge that the same position has been taken by some others so far, including perhaps Senator Harradine, who would no doubt welcome an opportunity to satisfy themselves further and more directly about the merits of this particular matter. I believe that access to these documents will enable, if not the whole truth to emerge finally, at least us to get some distance down that particular track. </PARA>
<PARA> The papers sought are set out in the terms of the amended motion. The amended motion substitutes a detailed list of 22 specifically designated papers, or in some instances groups of papers, for the original formulation of the motion which, as I gave notice of it yesterday, referred simply to all papers relating to the consideration of this matter by the relevant Ministers and officials. We have taken the view on further reflection that perhaps it was imposing too much of an unreasonable burden on the Government to ask it to sift through the potentially enormous volume of materials that presumably exist in this general subject area within the departments and to produce those documents accordingly. We have taken the view that it is, all in all, a more reasonable approach to adopt to identify with some precision the particular documents which we think should be made available, put on the public record and made subject to detailed scrutiny. We believe that this will make it very difficult indeed for the Attorney-General or anyone else in the Government to refuse the production of these documents on the ground of the unreasonable width or breadth of the request. </PARA>
<PARA> So, although there are substantial and ample precedents in this place for a motion in terms simply of seeking access to all documents or papers in existence relating to a particular matter, we have chosen the path of moderation and reasonableness-not that we seem to have had much credit for it from the Attorney -General in his performance a few minutes ago-and we ask only for a series of specifically identified documents. The documents in question in this list are those which have been referred to by Government Ministers themselves, either by Mr Howard in his lengthy Press release of 27 June or in subsequent statements, by Senator Durack in one or two other instances or which, if they have not specifically been brought to public attention by the Government itself, have come to public attention in the last two or three weeks by other means. Thus it is that we are seeking the production of a series of opinions from learned counsel relating to cases going back to the mid-1970s which have been the subject of so much discussion, including in particular the test case in the Perth office of the Deputy Crown Solicitor-we also seek a number of more recent opinions including those which have been circulated to Government members in recent days-in order that we and the public at large can better form a view as to where the blame lies, where the merits lie and where the truth lies in this matter. We are seeking access also to a number of departmental minutes of advice which passed from the Australian Taxation Office to the Treasurer and from officials of the Attorney-General's Department to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> We seek these documents to the extent that in these cases, as in others, those papers do not reveal the names of individuals. I make it absolutely clear that the text of this motion and my intention in moving it are not to bring by this means to public light the names of those individuals who are under active scrutiny at the moment with the possibility of prosecutions lying. We appreciate the force of section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act in at least requiring- or at most requiring, if I may put it that way-that the names and other identifying characteristics of individual taxpayers, or those who should be paying tax, be deleted. The terms of this motion recognise the requirement of the law and the policy that lies behind it, and acknowledges the force of both that law and policy. We do not seek a revelation of names by this means. </PARA>
<PARA> What we do seek, of course, is the substance of the opinions, the substance of the advice that flowed as to whether particular prosecutions could lie at a particular time, the advice as to what the state of the existing law was. That advice can be perfectly well communicated consistently with section 16 of the Act and consistently with matters of principle to which it is appropriate to have regard. It is not our desire in any way to prejudice the possible success of future prosecutions in this area by given untoward publicity to the position of any giving individual. It is our desire to get to the bottom, to strike a phrase, of the maladministration that has on the face of it so obviously occurred in the departmental consideration of these matters and in the decisions at the ministerial level to proceed by way of new legislation, belatedly rather than expeditiously, with the prosecution of those who clearly, on the face of it , could have been prosecuted. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the further point in relation to the papers that are here sought that the particular papers referred to in this motion are by and large those which have already featured substantially in either questions or contributions to debates in the Senate or the House of Representatives. By and large we have sought already the tabling of every single one of the documents referred to. There may be a handful of exceptions but certainly that is true as a generalisation. As a result, the Government should by now be in absolutely no doubt as to what it is that we are seeking the tabling of and why it is that we are so seeking. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no real justification for the Government's claim, made again in proceedings a few minutes ago by Senator Durack, that more time is needed before the Government can formulate a response as to whether it will be prepared to accede to the production of these particular documents. We were prepared- certainly I was initially prepared-to accede to the Government's request, as I understood it, that it have another 24 hours following the moving of this motion by me now in which to consider its position before we finally debated this matter. I am profoundly unhappy with the indications given by Senator Durack a few minutes ago that the Government may well want considerably more than 24 hours to consider its position. I make it clear from this side of the chamber that unless he is prepared and indicates, as I understand he was proposing to in reply to my speech, that it is only a matter of 24 hours, I will certainly feel disposed to press this matter to fruition today. I would request the Senate to proceed with full consideration of this matter and not to adjourn it today. There simply can be no excuse for any further delay in the Government's consideration of this matter beyond the 24 hours until the matter can be debated tomorrow, as was originally foreshadowed by the Minister. I would be grateful if those on the opposite benches could quickly establish from the Minister what the proposed position is, because certain things have been communicated to the Whips and to me about a 24 hours delay. If it is proposed to change that, then, as I say, I shall be disposed to press on with this matter right now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly. I have a few more things to say, which will give Senator Baume an opportunity to check the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, I anticipate, from what the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said earlier this week, that one line that the Government may be disposed to take in response to this request for the tabling of papers is that the Government may be prepared to table papers if the papers in question satisfy criteria laid down in the Freedom of Information Act passed by this Parliament but, of course, not yet proclaimed into effect. At first sight that may seem to be a rational and generous offer on the part of the Prime Minister, but in reality it is very far from that. I say that for three reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first place, the criteria for the production of official documents laid down in the present Freedom of Information Act are very far from commanding universal acceptance. Had the Opposition acceded to the terms of the Freedom of Information Act and actively supported the language of that Act, there might be something to be said-not much, but something-for the position that the Prime Minister seems to have carved out. But it must be well known that the Opposition has taken the view all along that the Freedom of Information Act is far too restrictive a code to be the last word in terms of open government and access to government papers in important matters of public administration. For that reason , among others, we take the view that the mere adherence or otherwise, on the face of it, to Freedom of Information Act standards cannot possibly be a good enough ground for a final determination as to whether these documents should be produced. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I make is that the Freedom of Information Act is not yet in operation, and in particular the appeals structure associated with that Act is not yet in operation. I mean the limited review role given to the Ombudsman and the much greater review roles given respectively to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the proposed Documents Review Tribunal. It is the case that when the Freedom of Information Act is in full operation an applicant for the release of documents who is dissatisfied by a government's decision, who responds unhappily to a government's decision to deny access to documents, will have a right of review and a right to seek redress for that initially adverse decision, in the first instance by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, or in certain cases the Documents Review Tribunal, with the Ombudsman exercising an additional review role as well. </PARA>
<PARA> None of those redress mechanisms is available at present, and should the Government be minded to say flatly that it refuses access to these documents on the ground that they do not satisfy in the Government's opinion the criteria in the Freedom of Information Act, there is simply no way yet in existence for that opinion of the Government to be independently objectively tested. So that is a second reason why it is inappropriate to apply Freedom of Information Act criteria to the decision as to whether the Government will release these documents. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I make in this area is that freedom of information criteria are in any event not absolute criteria. Even as they exist in the Act now, they can always be waived by the government of the day. They give the government grounds, if it so chooses to rely on them, for refusal of access to documents, but they do not demand that documents satisfying those criteria be refused. In a fully flourishing freedom of information legislation environment it is always open for the government to ignore completely any constraints on its capacity to deliver documents, or not to insist on any such limitations, and be freely willing to make these documents available. I simply make the point that the barriers in question are essentially artificial. For those reasons, they should not be erected in this instance by the Prime Minister. It is not a reasonable position to take, whatever the initial plausibility of it might be. </PARA>
<PARA> Having talked long enough for a flurry of Whip-like activity to take place around the chamber, perhaps I might be given some indication, by way of interjection, of whether the Government has now accepted the 24 hours suggestion . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall be stamping on something more than my foot in a moment if Senator Chaney persists with that attitude. I conclude by saying that the Opposition is sensitive to the justifications that might be advanced for caution in the release of certain of these documents. We do not want to prejudice effective prosecutions. We certainly do not want to be in the position of causing any breach of the legitimate requirements of section 16, that much over relied upon section of the Income Tax Assessment Act. But we believe that the documents should be tabled, subject to the conditions that we are now acceding to-namely, that there be deleted from such papers any names and identifying characteristics of individuals to the extent necessary to ensure that those rules are not breached. In those circumstances, with those conditions, there is simply no justification for the Government refusing access to these documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I repeat: It is only by access to these documents that it will be possible now, given the attitude that the Government has taken, for an objective view to be reached as to where the merits and the truth lie. If the Government has anything to hide, I can understand its continued reluctance to make these documents available. If the Government believes, however, that its Ministers and senior officials have acted throughout reasonably and with a proper sense of responsibility to the public at large, the Government should not hesitate for one second to put these documents in the public domain to enable the truth of that perception to be established once and for all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter before the Senate is extraordinarily important, as Senator Evans has indicated. I propose to speak to the matter when the debate is resumed tomorrow or whenever , but I want to speak at this stage to the motion that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting as I understand does Senator Harradine. Basically, the Australian Democrats vigorously support the motion of Senator Evans. For reasons that have been discussed all afternoon, documents need to be produced so that the Parliament, which should be the supreme authority in these matters, can have the information about tax evasion rather than continue to allow that state of affairs to exist where the information about tax evasion has been limited to the Public Service, the bureaucracy or, in some cases some Ministers. We have said time and time again that the Parliament is entitled to know that information, which was one of the reasons we joined Senator Evans and others in championing and supporting the Bill brought in by the Government for freedom of information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that I say that when a House of Parliament demands the production of confidential documents there may be some who would accuse it of grandstanding . If a group of anti-government forces, or whatever the case may be, for a moment wanted the production of documents against a government's wish, the accusation of possible grandstanding could well be levelled against it. I suggest that in this case the accusation is not sustained because we are not talking about a penny-ante cheap political point. We are talking about something worth thousands of millions of dollars. What is at stake is the credibility of certain members of the Public Service and certain Ministers. I suppose one could sum up the thrust of Senator Evan's request by asking: For how long have Ministers known about tax evasion? When was the earliest reasonable time they could or should have acted? I suspect that that is basically the wish of Senator Evans is asking for the production of these 22 documents-to ascertain at least those two dates so that this chamber can make a decision on how it might act. </PARA>
<PARA> A request has been made of the Government. I will be saying something tomorrow to support that. I apologise to Senator Evans because I have not had an opportunity to discuss events with him since we had our last quick talk in the aisle. Events move quickly in this place from time to time. When I learned that this matter would be adjourned until tomorrow I expressed surprise at Senator Evans's reasonableness in acquiescing to that request of the Government. I would have thought that this was a clear case. The request has been known by the Government for some time. The dogs of Canberra have been barking it and surely the Government could have made up its mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume has a point. Then Senator Evans rose to speak. I had a discussion with the Attorney-General. I hope he does not mind my divulging the nature of this discussion. He did not say that it was confidential. He put to me a proposition that although the Government wished to co-operate in the tabling of these documents-names expunged and identifications removed-in certain cases it may well be difficult to comply with such a request within 24 hours. He said: 'For example, let us assume that the Government, because of the information contained in these documents-information such as a Queen's Counsel's opinion-can see a case for prosecution against a certain tax evader or avoider and let us assume that you expunge the names and all matter of identification'. The Attorney then said to me: 'Is it good sense to warn a person against whom you are going to lay charges of the weakness in the case by openly disclosing that Counsel's opinion on the table of the House'?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A lot depends on this. Senator Evans has already given notice- threatened is too harsh a word; a gentle soul like Senator Evans seldoms threatens-that unless the Government reintroduces this debate within 24 hours he will take action now. I would have thought that every word I have said is pertinent to the question before the chair, namely, that the debate be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting. It is absolutely relevant. I come to the point. I suggested to the Attorney that surely, by negotiation between the Attorney, Senator Evans, myself as Leader of the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine, if material is included in these 22 documents that is so sensitive that, in our combined judgment, it would prejudice a successful prosecution against a tax avoider, then I would hope that we would agree-I hope by a consensus-that that document either should not be tabled or should be disguised in some other form. That seemed to me to be an absolutely reasonable point of view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Attorney went on to say that to make a decision-I do not know; I have not gone through the nature of each of the 22 documents-may well take longer than 24 hours. I apologise again to Senator Evans. I have not had a chance to get his reaction to this. But as I understand it, at this stage that seems to me to be a reasonable request from the Attorney, particularly with regard to counsel's opinions about people against whom it is proposed to lay charges. I would be deeply grateful if for once in this place we could have a spirit of consensus. If the Labor Party could agree to negotiate with the Government in company with Senator Harradine and me on what documents could be extremely sensitive and what documents could not be, that would be an eminently sensible solution to what is now becoming a difficult situation. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the Democrats are concerned, we will support the thrust of the Labor Party's amendment. If co-operation is not forthcoming from the Government we will take the further inevitable step-which we would hesitate to do-of calling public servants to the bar of this chamber, which I am extraordinarily reluctant to agree to do. But that will be the inevitable conclusion if we do not get co- operation from the Government. As I am informed by the Attorney up to this point , the Government realises that it has very little option but to produce the documents. But the argument espoused by the Attorney, that there may be difficulty in terms of possible criminal charges by prematurely disclosing certain information, certainly makes some sense. </PARA>

That clearly is not necessarily the result of this motion, unless the Government gives us some guarantee that in fact it will be debated tomorrow or we will get an answer tomorrow along one of the many lines that have been discussed here this afternoon.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter was adjourned yesterday at my request to enable me to have a little time to examine the report which was put down and to consult with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee). I indicated then that I would seek an adjournment to today only. That day having elapsed, I would now suggest to the Senate that we should simply deal with the motion moved by Senator Harradine, which is for an extension of time to the Committee, the Committee having been continued in existence until today by the resolution which was passed yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, having seen the view of the Committee, which was universally that further consideration should be given to the Bill by the Committee, respects the right of the Senate to give further consideration to the Bill. The Government seeks the passage of legislation in these sittings and calls on the Committee to complete its examination as soon as possible. I am sure that members of the Committee would wish to do that in any event. Given that there could be significant further delay, however, the Government may wish to consider seeking the co-operation of the Senate in earlier passage of non-controversial sections of the legislation. But again I simply flag that so that there should be no subsequent suggestion of bad faith. </PARA>
<PARA> There are various proposals contained in the legislation. Some of them are more controversial than others. Some have had different levels of consideration. I merely wish to advise the Senate that it is possible that the Senate might wish to bring forward at an earlier stage some non-controversial or less controversial aspects of the Bill. Having said that, I indicate that the Government will support the resolution which was moved by Senator Harradine yesterday for an extension of time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After the somewhat dramatic debate today dealing with the deficiencies in the Attorney-General's Department and tax evasion, I suppose one would say that the debate on the Air Navigation (Charges) Amendment Bill seems small fry. However, I stress that this is a piece of legislation that indicates another decline in the Government's area of responsibility. Though the Opposition decided to agree to the Government's general package in the Budget, nevertheless it does have a great deal to say about what is happening to the airline industry in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of this legislation is to provide for increases of some 20 per cent in air navigation charges on domestic trunk lines and regional airlines and a 12 per cent increase for general aviation. As it is part of the Budget package we do not oppose the Bill. However, I think the Opposition has an obligation to point out that the latest impost will increase cost pressures on the domestic airlines at a time when the industry in this country-as indeed elsewhere throughout the world-is clearly in a state of serious downturn and when domestic traffic is almost stagnant. I think one has only to travel on the airlines to appreciate the decline in service. One has only to listen to passengers generally to appreciate the concern of the travelling public about what is happening to Australia's airline industry. The increases which are proposed in this legislation will add at least 1 per cent to the overall operating costs of the airlines. That means, of course, that the airlines will be seeking to increase their domestic air fares to recover the additional air navigation costs . Doing that will be very difficult for the airlines, suffering as they are from cost pressures and a decline in air traffic movement generally. It will exacerbate the current crisis that is facing our domestic airlines today. </PARA>
<PARA> The latest air navigation charges form part of a Government proposal to increase revenue. It is the most recent in a series of attacks by the Fraser Government on the domestic aviation industry. The Government's handling of our aviation industry, which is faced with an economic downturn, is characterised by increasing costs on the one hand and a lack of planning and co-ordination on the other. The decline in standards of service and safety is obvious to every airline passenger. In this circumstance the general public suffers most. Fewer people are able to travel. The ones who do travel are faced with greater costs, greater inconvenience and fewer safety standards. The Air Navigation (Charges) Amendment Bill, or any of the other aviation related legislation brought before the Senate by the Government, does not address itself properly to any of these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely the Government must be aware of the decline that is taking place in the industry. Certainly those members of parliament who travel by Trans-Australia Airlines must be concerned about what is happening to our Government airline. One could almost get the impression that there is a deliberate attempt on the part of the Government to reduce the effectiveness and the capacity of our Government-owned airline. Every time I travel I find that services have been cancelled or reduced or that they run late. From that experience one can only gain that something is radically wrong with the Government's airline and with the Government's concern, or lack of it, for what is happening to TAA. The Fraser Government's mismanagement of the situation is having a detrimental effect. It can be seen that the number of air passengers carried in 1981-82 increased by a meagre 0.8 per cent over the previous year 1980-81. Clearly, Australians are voting with their feet by not patronising the services offered. There has been a marked decline in the services operating from our capital cities to our national capital, Canberra. There would not be many members of parliament or members of the travelling public who have not noticed the very serious decline in Canberra services. </PARA>
<PARA> General aviation is already struggling to survive. It is struggling under the burden of increased sales taxes which were imposed in last year's Budget and this year's Budget, and from increased fuel and wage costs. Heaven only knows that the increase in fuel costs will have another effect of increasing the problems facing our domestic airline industry. All of these factors combined will bring about a dramatic fall off in demand for the services of general aviation. There have already been widespread retrenchments in the industry. The increased sales taxes, the increase in petroleum charges and the increased navigation charges, which are provided for in this Bill, will exacerbate the industry's plight. One must surely express concern about what appears to be the complete indifference of the Government to this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The air navigation charges which are altered by this Bill cover expenditure in the areas of airport facilities, safety and meteorological and air navigation services. It is essential, therefore, that the provision of these services is responsibly planned and that those services are efficiently provided. But neither of these criteria is being met by the legislation or the Fraser Government. Let us look at what I am saying. The Government and its conservative predecessors have not applied themselves to any sort of comprehensive or desirable national airport program over any period. Decisions on airport development are made on an ad hoc, unplanned basis. The main factors in the decision making process seem to be the date of the next election and the narrowness of the margin by which the Government holds a seat. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the indecisiveness of the Government in respect of Sydney Airport. Scant regard has been paid to the priorities expressed by the industry, to the impact of the air fare structure to future costs being generated by airport investment or by the provision of the services that are involved. One can only ask, a year after the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares, where are we in respect of our domestic airline industry in this country? I have referred to the problems facing Sydney Airport. This is a prime example of the lack of forward planning and of the Fraser Government's incompetence. Only recently has the Government expressed concern at the airport needs of Sydney. Those of us who travel to Sydney will appreciate that sometimes, because of traffic movement into Sydney Airport, aircraft have to fly around Sydney for 15 or 20 minutes before they are able to land. This situation is allowed to exist under a government whose Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Sir John Carrick, is supposed to be involved in a campaign to conserve fuel. Practically every plane that flies to Sydney is forced to get into a queue and spend time and waste fuel before it can land at Sydney Airport. This is due to a lack of forward planning in respect of Mascot Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> The newly appointed Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife) has suddenly discovered that there is a problem with the current Sydney Airport. All I can say is that it is about time this was discovered. Back in 1970 I was appointed, as a representative of local government, by a conservative government to examine the needs of Sydney Airport. At that stage we were concerned with the matters such as aircraft noise, aircraft traffic and the need for forward planning in respect of providing a second airport in the Sydney region. Information was available to us 12 years ago regarding that aspect. Yet the new Minister has suddenly discovered-he has been around for long enough-that there is a major problem. Where has he applied himself to this problem other than to say that something has to be done about resolving the impasse that exists between the views of the New South Wales State Government and the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> For some 15 years conservative governments have fiddled around with the airport needs of Sydney. They have preferred to politicise the issues involved rather than seek a co-operative and sensible solution to the problem. I know that Government members will say: 'Why did it not happen between 1972 and 1973?' Let us look at what happened in those three years. We cannot put every problem that exists in government administration back to those three years. We must recognise that during those three years we had to face three elections as a result of the intransigent position taken by the conservatives in the Senate. Under that sort of atmosphere and environment the Whitlam Government attempted to look at a whole variety of problems in many areas that had been neglected by the Commonwealth. In respect of this matter the Whitlam Government sought the co- operation of the then Liberal Government in New South Wales, the Askin Government. The Whitlam Government never received any co-operation from that Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Now that this conservative Government is back in power in Canberra it suggests that the Wran Government is holding up a decision in respect of Sydney's airport problems. The Wran Labor Government in New South Wales faces a political campaign from the Federal Government which seeks to sheet home the blame on the State for the problems of airports in both city and country areas in New South Wales. What we need is a genuine attempt at Federal and State co-operation; it is not taking place. The opportunity is therefore available to us to debate that subject when discussing this piece of legislation. One can only hope that some initiative will be taken. I notice that the honourable member for Barton in the other place, Mr Bradfield, has suggested a near country area in the outer suburbs of Sydney as the place where a second airport ought to go. Certainly that is the view of all the residents in the St George, Botany, Marrickville and Sutherland areas. Those living in the areas around the present airport support, to the very last man and woman, the New South Wales Government's view that there ought to be no further extension of Sydney Airport and that there ought to be, as there is in every other capital city in the world, a second airport provision . It is about time this Government got off its backside and really set about making a decision in that respect in concert with the New South Wales Government . </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the other hallmarks of the Fraser Government's maladministration of the aviation industry. The past years have been marked by understaffing of the Department of Transport, the degradation of the supervision of air safety standards, the ignoring accorded the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares, the Walter ultra-large fire tenders fiasco, the crippling shortage of air traffic controllers that led to the closure of the Brisbane Airport, the chaos that has been caused in air services to Canberra, our national capital, and a massive 220 per cent increase in air fares since 1975, just to give a few examples. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to remember that it was the decision of this Government to increase the short haul fare structure to seek a growth in traffic for the long haul trips. A dramatic fall off in passenger movements on the short haul routes has resulted from that decision combined with a determination by many business firms to move their personnel from first class travel to economy class. So in fact the Government has not been able to profit from those decisions that were made in 1981. The Government's response to these problems has been to move aviation from being part of a portfolio embodying other components of transport, thus encouraging further disintegration, as we see it, and disorganisation. I think we are at the stage where we need a Minister to handle aviation on its own. The Australian Labor Party argues that there should be a co-ordinated and across-the -board approach to aviation. Such an approach should include different grades of air fares, including cheaper no-frills fares, to enable a wider range of people to travel, a national airports authority to plan, develop and operate our major airports-surely that is a desirable objective-and an approach which gives country dwellers a fair go and which ensures that those who pay are those who can afford to pay. I think the Government has to accept that there is a problem of growing intensity in our domestic airline industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Bill continues the upward pressure on aviation industry costs. It will force air fares higher and higher under the policy being pursued by this Government, which sees it as a revenue area. It will create greater problems for the general aviation industry, including passenger movement. All we can say is that when there is a change of government we will ensure that there is an improved efficiency in the provision of services to the Australian aviation industry and, most of all, that the travellers in this country, after many years of conservative administration, will get a fair deal. I can assure the Government that there is a great deal of criticism, even from its own back bench and certainly by most members of the travelling public, about the deterioration of services-this is characteristic of the airline industry-that has taken place over the last six months. Just as we have been critical of the deficiencies in the administration of the Attorney-General's Department, we join the chorus so far as the aviation industry and the Department of Transport are concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Air Navigation (Charges) Amendment Bill 1982 follows the introduction last year of a similar Bill which raised quite considerably the charges on a range of aviation operations in line with the Government's intention to recoup from the industry itself 100 per cent of the costs. I wish to refer to one part of the Bill in particular, not because some of the charges in other areas are not inequitable, but because the charges in this area are grossly inequitable. This is the reason the Australian Democrats will be opposing this Bill. I refer to the general aviation charges. What we have here in terms of increased charges on general aviation is yet another impost on a group of people in our society who have enough difficulties at the moment without this Government adding excessively to their costs. I refer particularly to the people who live in remote parts of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 12 per cent increase proposed in general aviation charges comes on top of increased sales taxes connected with small aircraft and increased avgas charges and wage costs. All of these charges are increasing at a time when the Government professes to be concerned about people affected by drought. It may not be generally known that the general aviation industry is of crucial importance to Australia's outback. The large rural areas of South Australia, New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia in particular will be hit excessively hard by the increase in general aviation charges. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On top of the 20 per cent increase last year. The cost increases in other areas-for example, the regional airline sector-will also hit those areas very hard. But then, of course, they have already been hit so hard that to get around the west of Queensland one has to go on a milk run flight. It takes one longer to get from Brisbane to any of the major outback centres than to get from Brisbane to Singapore. The isolation of many people in outback areas will be increased by these increased charges because the general aviation sector has to pass on those charges to the very few passengers and the equipment and goods it carries to rural areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps I should give some examples. I will come to the National Country Party' s stance on this matter a little later. The typical owner-operator of an air charter service or air taxi service in these areas would run the only charter service for some considerable distance-probably hundreds of miles. Therefore, the air taxi service operates as the ambulance for the area and the major communications source for the area. It operates as a life stream for small western towns. Over 90 per cent of the people who use those types of operations are people who have no access to government funded public transport systems. They do not have access to bus systems or railway systems. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or road systems that are in any way comparable with the type that the people of urban Australia are used to and demand. Those people are already suffering difficulties from living in remote and isolated areas and they deserve much better treatment from the Government not only in high profile ways, such as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) outlined recently in relation to drought relief, but also in other ways. This treatment needs to be applied across the board; it should not be highly selective. We should not give with one hand and take away with the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the Government's air navigation charges, as they run through the system, an outback owner-operator would have to pay in the region of $3,000 to register a twin-engine aircraft and roughly $2,000 to register his back-up aircraft, which would normally be a single-engine aircraft. This fee was levied and argued for at the time to offset infrastructure charges. The startling fact is that rural users are precisely the people who use these government facilities least of all. An outback owner-operator who is flying of the order of 600 flying hours in an operational year could typically look at under 20 hours of operation on a government aerodrome or within a government flight information area. Added to that he would operate up to 10 hours under the air traffic control systems which are currently, of course, in larger centres. These flyers would use government services and facilities rarely. Certainly they would not be used to the extent to justify the types of charges which are currently being proposed or which have been levied on them. </PARA>
<PARA> The big costs in aviation occur at the larger international airports with the expenditure on modern technology, radar facilities and air traffic controllers, who are highly qualified people. To the rural operator these airports are a Star Wars operation compared with the 2,000 feet of gravel he has to land on and take off from. Indeed, the only time that many operators in the outback, particularly farmers who operate aircraft on their properties, ever see a government aerodrome is once in every 100 hours when they have to land on one for a flight service check. When one talks to rural owner-operators one is told that they have absolutely no objection to the user-pays principle. Their objection is that they are paying for a service that they are not using. </PARA>
<PARA> It is inevitable that the charges imposed on these operational businesses will be passed on. It is reasonable to assume that an owner-operator in my own State of Queensland-I believe that the figure would be similar in other States-could look to carrying 150 to 175 passengers per year. On that calculation the Government charges would be in the vicinity of $20 extra per passenger. This is not the nominal increase that the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) spoke about in his second reading speech. On a commercial flight the increases would add a couple of cents per passenger, but on the air taxi service we are looking at $20 per passenger. Again, that is an impost on the rural areas which are currently undergoing tremendous hardships.</PARA>
<PARA> In the outback of Australia the aeroplane is not a toy. It is not an operational vehicle to take up at weekends for joy flights. It is an essential element, an essential part of the whole operation of a decentralised system. It is not a substitute for the car or the truck. It is very often a matter of life or death. The use of air taxis, which often fly outside their licences as they are allowed to do on mercy flights, in fact provides many of the western Queensland towns with a safety net which is all too often forgotten. In my State of Queensland, for example, it is not possible to take by road a seriously injured person from somewhere such as Charleville, Cunnamulla, Thargomindah or Quilpie-those remote centres-to the centralised hospital system that operates in the States with good quality and top class medical attention. The costs are picked up by the State government and often a doctor will recommend that the patient, who may not even be suffering from a serious complaint, be taken by aircraft because of the state of the roads. Those aircraft provide that safety net. If one cares to go and talk to the people in those towns, one will find that it is of vital concern to them to know that if their children are injured they can get them into hospital in rapid time. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2I4">Senator MACKLIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The price is picked up by the State governments. But, unfortunately, in many areas the cost often is carried on. Of course, in many areas the aeroplane is used as an agricultural tool for sheep mustering, fence checking, keeping track on water supplies-especially in times of drought-and the operation of crop dusters. As I have said, many farmers use their aircraft solely on their properties. They are not interested in going off their properties except when they are required to do so every 100 flying hours to comply with the regulations governing inspections. I am talking about a person who probably looks after his plane, has built his airstrip and who in Queensland often has to operate on his own on a sighted flight plan as the beacons are so often down. He never flies to a government aerodrome and yet is charged these exorbitant charges under the pseudonym of 'the user pays'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe that these costs ought to be borne fairly and evenly across the community. We believe that as a part of any reasonable decentralisation program light aircraft should not be seen as one of the luxuries that people might enjoy in rural areas, but as one of the necessities to support rural Australia. We also believe it is important that Australia looks at defraying the expenses of these operations not only in the way that the Government has done. For example, in Canada the Department of Defence pays for the use of radar beacons and associated defence equipment. In Australia we source none of those charges back to the Department of Defence. We source them all to general aviation, commercial aviation or regional aircraft. I do not understand why the Department of Defence here ought to be excluded when in Canada the Department of Defence picks up those charges as a defence necessity. After all, it would be a defence necessity to have that type of equipment right the way across Australia even if we were not operating commercial aircraft at all. Therefore, I think it is reasonable for the Government-not as a subsidy or a handout but as part of the costs that must be borne by it for operating defence-to ensure that parts of the charges be shot home to the Department of Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> Over and above that, I believe that the people who operate in general aviation could very well look to the government for a massive decrease in those charges on the basis of any fair minded inquiry into what the general aviation sector actually uses. From inquiries that have been made so far it appears that anyone will admit that that should be so. Anyone who has ever been to meetings with people in general aviation will know this. Government spokesmen have admitted it at such meetings, yet they come into the Parliament and vote against it. They stand up in western Queensland and talk about general aviation but they will not vote against the legislation. The same happens with Government spokesmen in South Australia, New South Wales and Western Australia. They talk about the fact that charges to general aviation are vastly in excess of anything that the users could be reasonably said to be using, yet they vote the very opposite in this chamber. I have spoken against these charges at a large number of meetings in Queensland. I will vote against them and so will the other Democrat senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -We have just heard Senator Macklin talking and I am very pleased to hear that he recognises the role of light aircraft in western Queensland. He talks like a new found convert. I hope the conversion keeps up. As one who has lived in that area for many years, and who does venture out only occasionally to see what is going on, I am very mindful of the role that light aircraft play and of the role of the air traffic control system that they use. Of course, not all the aircraft use the system all of the time in those areas but they all use it some of the time. They may fly from their own airstrips but every time they contact flight service or get into an air traffic control area they use the system. Any time they get lost the whole ramifications of the search and rescue facilities are there. I am mindful of the fact that they do not use it all the time but they certainly use it some of the time. For that reason, as a senator for that area and as a member of the Government transport committee, I have fought against the full cost recovery being levied on general aviation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I address myself to some of the remarks made before dinner by Senator Gietzelt in relation to the Air Navigation (Charges) Amendment Bill. He rightly drew our attention to the question of safety in air standards throughout Australia. No doubt it is a matter of great pride for Australians that we are amongst those nations with the highest record in standards of safety in the world. This has applied for many years and is something which we hold as very dear and as a very important part of our aviation policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was a little disappointed to hear Senator Gietzelt remark that he thought the standards were in decline. Certainly, I do not believe that he is able to bring forward evidence to demonstrate that at all. That aside, it is a matter of great concern to the Department of Aviation, certainly to this Government, that the highest standards be maintained in the safety area. That is something for which we all strive and fortunately, over the years, we have been successful. Senator Gietzelt spoke of the non-existence of a Ministry of Aviation and sought the establishment of one. He may have missed the changes in the administrative arrangements that occurred on 7 May of this year when, in fact, the Department of Aviation was created. </PARA>

<PARA> As regards the general issue of standards of service available on airlines, it is true that in recent times concern has been expressed in various places about this. It is hard to know whether that is a function of change in the use of various kinds of aircraft or due to the kinds of pressures to which Senator Gietzelt has referred. My impression is that the whole aviation industry is in a state of change as a result of the introducion in recent times of new aircraft. Naturally, we are all adjusting to new standards of service, not all of which can be claimed to represent movement in a downward direction. In fact, my experience generally is that there has been an improvement in the standard of service available to the travelling public. I do not consider that, as Senator Gietzelt would have us believe, it is a response to change brought about by cost pressures. Rather, it is a function of structural change in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt referred us to the problems of the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. Indeed, I believe he suggested that there appeared to be no comprehensive policy on the part of this Government for the establishment, renewal, refurbishment or redevelopment of the various airports throughout Australia. Clearly, he has not had access to a news release issued by the Minister for Aviation (Mr Fife) on 17 August, the night the Budget was presented . That release highlighted, in quite a comprehensive way, the various airport redevelopment projects that were under way. I refer, for instance, to the major works being undertaken, at a cost of some $270m, at Brisbane Airport. Also, a new international terminal complex is being constructed, at a total cost of $42m , at Perth Airport. A parallel taxiway is being constructed, at a total cost of $3m, at the same airport. Construction is well under way at the international terminal complex in Adelaide. The total cost is to be $11.2m with expenditure this year of some $10.7m. At Townsville Airport works for international services will be completed at a total cost of $4.5m. In addition, the expansion and improvement of the Townsville domestic terminal will cost $3.6m. </PARA>
<PARA> Further works are under way at the Adelaide Airport, at a total cost of $8.9m, for the introduction of the new wide-bodied aircraft. In Adelaide the total expenditure during this financial year is to be of the order of $20m. At Melbourne Airport $3.6m will be expended and in Perth $3.9m. At Coolangatta $1. 8m will be expended and in Hobart $3.5m. A number of other airports are being redeveloped and refurbished. I refer to work on operations buildings, the upgrading of runways and the construction of international airports. I put it to you, Mr Deputy President, that this does not in any way demonstrate an ad hoc approach to the problems of airport development. Rather, it represents a comprehensive program, given the resources available to the Government for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt referred in passing to problems at the Sydney Airport and sought to pin them all on the Federal Government. He ignored especially the negotiations that have taken place and the difficulties that have arisen over the relevant period. It is true that the Commonwealth Government acknowledges the problems at Sydney Airport and that there might be difficulties ahead as traffic density in the area worsens. It is estimated that the cost of delays, translated into airline operating expenditure and the value of travellers' lost time, is now of the order of $30m a year. The Commonwealth has been prepared since 1979 to proceed with measures to remedy that problem by the construction of a closed space parallel runway at Sydney Airport, but the State Government, the Neville Wran Labor Government of New South Wales, has refused to co-operate in that respect. The Commonwealth is also prepared to work in conjunction with the New South Wales State Government to identify a second airport site against a possible future need. I hope that the proposals for resolving that vexed question will be put before the Commonwealth in the not too distant future. Those are problems that Senator Gietzelt in his glib fashion has sought to attribute purely and simply to the Federal Government. They clearly involve other questions of a broader kind. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin gave us a sermon about the problems facing general aviation. As one who, over a long period, both since entering the Parliament and before, has been closely in touch with general aviation and acknowledges its worth to the community, I believe I can contribute some thoughts on very important aspects of it. First, it is significant to note one or two of the points that Senator Macklin made and compare them with what might be regarded as a rational approach . He first made out a rhetorical argument that general aviation ought to be supported in general terms without its contributing in any way to cost recovery. He argued that there were remote areas of Queensland-perhaps other remote areas as well--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise. I felt that he emphasised the position in Queensland. My State of South Australia has remote areas, as have Western Australia and other States. They are very well served by general aviation. A consideration of the degree of cost revovery from various sectors of the industry might throw some light on the problem on which Senator Macklin has focused. According to the formula of allocation there is, for international airlines, 100 per cent cost recovery. From domestic trunk airlines 90 per cent of costs are recovered. For regional airlines the figure falls substantially, to 25 per cent of the estimate. The figure for general aviation is 15 per cent. Across the board the average is 53 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The trouble with the Australian Democrats is that nothing is ever relevant when one quotes the facts. They simply cannot acknowledge facts. They are strong on rhetoric but weak on facts. A very significant point is to be made here. General aviation as demonstrated by these figures, is shown to enjoy a significant subsidy paid by other sectors of the airline industry. Senator Collard clearly demonstrated that point in his brief contribution to the debate on this Bill. Let us take the issue a little further because clearly Senator Mason is not satisfied with that argument. Senator Macklin made a substantial issue of the fact that people using outback services were not actually using the airport facilities which might be available in larger towns. The fact is-perhaps Senator Macklin does not know this-that there is a remission of air navigation charges for airport usage in respect of airports not owned by local authorities or by government. In that respect clearly there is a further subsidy for the use of such airports to other sectors of the air passenger community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Mason" NAMEID="YJ7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ7">Senator Mason</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it is not. That is demonstrated by Government policy. Clearly the Government has designed its policy to assist those in outback areas. In addition to that there is a 15 per cent remission in addition to the original 50 per cent remission for aircraft operating in the agricultural sphere. So a very significant contribution is made in favour of light aircraft using outback facilities and servicing agricultural areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A further argument can be advanced by showing that compared with last year there are some significant changes in the degree of increase or otherwise in charges for the various sectors. In 1981 there was a drop of 5 per cent in the rate of recovery from the international sector. That has now levelled out and no increase or decrease is applicable for this year. An increase of 12.5 per cent applied to domestic trunk airlines last year; the figure is 20 per cent this year. But in the area of regional airlines there has been a decrease compared with the previous year; the figure has gone from 25 per cent to 20 per cent. In the area of general aviation there has been a most significant lowering from 20 per cent to 12 per cent, in the rate of increase. Does this not demonstrate the clarity of the Government's policy in seeking to assist those who are in the greatest need-those in the remote areas, those who do need the services of general aviation in the way that Senator Macklin seeks to make out in his argument in not very specific terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I want to make in response to the debate refers to the matter to which Senator Macklin alluded at the end of his remarks; the operations of military aircraft and military airports. In fact, military aircraft do use civil facilities free of charge but it is also true that civil aircraft use military airports free of charge. I will enumerate those examples. Clearly the Canberra Airport is a prime example, not only for regional and general aviation but also for domestic trunk routes. There is also Townsville, which is an outback centre, Williamtown and that outback centre to beat all outback centres, Darwin. Obviously there is a quid pro quo here, a trade-off between the two very large sectors of defence and civil aviation. I believe that that deals effectively with the points raised by the Opposition and the Australian Democrats in this debate. I wish the Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I need some clarification from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Senator Messner). From his winding up remarks on the second reading, I understood him to class Townsville Airport as an outback airport. I have been through Townsville Airport on many occasions. It is an international airport which is on the seaboard of Queensland. Whilst I would have agreed with the Minister had he said that Queensland under the jurisdiction of Bjelke-Petersen could be classed as outback and not up with the times, I cannot agree with him that Townsville Airport is an outback airport. Perhaps he may not have meant to say that. As my colleague Senator Colston points out, Townsville is the second city in Queensland. No doubt many people in Queensland, particularly those who use Townsville Airport, will be most disturbed having heard the Minister tonight term Townsville Airport an outback airport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the Minister to clarify another matter. How much of these increased air navigation charges is embodied in the Government's payment of $442,000 to a corporate image company in respect of altering the logo of Trans Australia Airlines? Is the Government running so short of funds that it has to increase these airport charges to try to recoup some of that money? The Minister, as the Minister representing in the Senate the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt), has told me, in answer to a recent question of mine, that the Government has been prepared to pay a corporate image company a retainer of $15, 000 a month to change the logo of TAA. Is one of the reasons why the airport charges are being increased to try to recoup some of the $442,000?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to Senator McLaren for bringing to my attention my terminological inexactitude in regard to Townsvile Airport. I am glad to acknowledge also that Senator McLaren has had the opportunity of passing through that airport on many occasions, as have I. I regard Townsville as a very significant city in Queensland, and I apologise to those who may have misinterpreted my remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I wanted to say was that Townsville is the centre of service for a vast outback area of Queensland and, indeed, the Northern Territory and parts of Western Australia. In that respect, it represents a very significant part of the servicing of that area. The point that I was seeking to make is that, the airport being a military airport, civil aircraft can use it free of charge and, as a result, there is great advantage to people in regional outback areas of Queensland. Consequently I am grateful to Senator McLaren for bringing that point to my attention so that I am able to clarify that for the people of Townsville and of areas of outback Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> On the second point, naturally I do not have at my fingertips the information which Senator McLaren requires. I shall refer the matter to the Department, and I hope that I can bring back some information to him in due course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise another matter. It concerns the construction of the so-called international airport at West Beach in South Australia. I understand that it is to be opened some time in November to coincide with the forthcoming State election. Mr Tonkin is no doubt hoping that this will give a big boost to his prospects of re-election in South Australia. What I am concerned about is what effect these increased airport charges will have on international flights coming into West Beach Airport, what increase will be embodied in the international fares, whether, in effect, this could put a damper on the traffic through West Beach, and whether what the Federal Government is doing will have some hamstringing effect on Mr Tonkin trying to use the opening of the airport at West Beach to bolster his campaign to be, as he would hope, re-elected in the forthcoming election. Coinciding with that is the opening of the Hilton International Hotel in Adelaide. If these airport charges deter people from coming to Adelaide, this whole matter could blow up in Mr Tonkin's face.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Like Senator Messner who is in charge of the Bill, I am somewhat concerned about that, because I should have thought that nothing that the Fraser Government would do would be to the detriment of the Tonkin Government, in view of the fact that Mr Tonkin said in 1979 that he fully supported the Fraser Government's policies. Now he is trying to divorce himself from all those things . I hope that the Minister will give me some answer on that matter. I put it in a nutshell: Will these increased airport charges have any effect on traffic through this international airport which, as I have said, Mr Tonkin hopes will be opened on the eve of the announcement of the forthcoming State elections in South Australia?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLaren must have been distracted because he missed the point I made that there will be no increase this year in the rate at which international flights are to contribute to the cost of running airports. Naturally, there will be no effect as far as air navigation charges go on air fares for flights from Adelaide to overseas. Looking at it the other way round, Senator McLaren may have been suggesting that there were costs other than air navigation charges which may be affecting the cost of air fares for flights from Adelaide to other places. Naturally that is a question of commercial judgment on the part of the airlines that will be operating out of Adelaide. I can add nothing further to that. If Senator McLaren is interested, I will certainly make inquiries about the situation from Qantas Airways Ltd and get a reply for him as quickly as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested to hear the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) say during his reply that the Federal Government is extremely proud of its developments in the general aviation area and in other aviation areas in this country. He mentioned, as did Senator McLaren, the developments at Adelaide and Townsville airports and so on. I wonder whether the Minister would be good enough to say when-I have brought up this question before-airports in South Australia which carry quite a considerable amount of traffic, such as the airport at Mount Gambier, will be upgraded. I understand that Senator McLaren travels through Townsville a lot. I have just come back from Tamworth where the facilities are extremely good, far outdoing anything that the people at Mount Gambier would even dream of and certainly far and away better than the Nissen hut from which the airlines are operating at the moment. I understand that Hamilton Airport, which services an area with a population somewhat similar to the population of Mount Gambier, also has far better facilities. I wonder whether the Minister is prepared to say whether any part of the increased charges brought in by this Bill are likely to be spent on upgrading what is the gateway to South Australia's south-eastern tourist area.</PARA></TALK.START>

As to the question Senator Haines raised during her remarks, it is a matter of concern to me as a senator for South Australia that this matter should be reviewed by the Government.

I am the only senator in South Australia who is actually domiciled in the country. In fact, I have a regional office in Mount Gambier. I have much concern about it. Whilst the Australian Democrats may sometimes travel through Mount Gambier, I have an office and a staff member there. I am very concerned about the Mount Gambier Airport. I have taken up this matter on many occasions. In view of what Senator Haines has said tonight, I have now acquainted the Democrats with the fact that I have an office there to service the people.

I too have a very vital interest in Mount Gambier. I hope that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), in seeking some information about the matters Senator Haines has raised, will take into consideration the fact that Mount Gambier Airport is a very important airport. Whilst the Government may say , as it has often done when I have raised the matter, that it is up to the local council to go into the local ownership scheme before it will expend any money on the airport, I think that with the money the Government will raise now through these increased airport charges it could well afford to expend some money on the airport at Mount Gambier, particularly in view of the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) often flies to that airport in a VIP aircraft and then gets a Commonwealth car or a charter aircraft to transport him from there to his property at Nareen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a very important airport not only to the people who live in the Mount Gambier area but also to the leader of the Government parties, the Prime Minister. I hope that this Government will give due consideration to finding more money to upgrade the terminal. I think the strip is all right. I have flown to Mount Gambier quite often, probably many more times than Senator Haines has ever gone there, having lived in the Portland area for many years before I migrated to South Australia. I am well versed with the problems that exist in the south-east of South Australia. I conclude by saying that I hope the Government will give due consideration to finding extra finances to upgrade the terminal at Mount Gambier. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is apparent that Senator McLaren misunderstands what air navigation charges are all about. In fact, they are a means by which the Government seeks to recover the costs of past airport developments rather than the costs of future developments. It is the costs in respect of previous airports that we are seeking to recover by this Bill. To that extent Senator McLaren's remarks in respect of Mount Gambier are irrelevant. Nevertheless, I am glad that he is joining forces with all of us in the Senate who are interested in the development of Mount Gambier as a tourist centre in South Australia. Indeed, I will bring his concerns to the attention of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I just add, as Senator McLaren has drawn the matter to our attention, that Mr Porter, the honourable member for Barker, has been most assiduous in his representations to the Government on this matter by bringing forward his concerns and those of the constituents of Mount Gambier and other parts of the south-east of South Australia. He has done so in such a way that there has been quite a reaction to his representations. I believe that we have dealt with these various issues very effectively during the debate. We are ranging far and wide in what is really a Committee debate. I hope that we can now attend to the matter at hand and get the Bill passed as quickly as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The intention behind the Remuneration and Allowances Amendment Bill 1982 is to amend the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1973 in accordance with the recommendations contained in the 1982 review of the Remuneration Tribunal, to amend the Ministers of State Act 1952 and the Remuneration Tribunals Act 1973. The Opposition supports the general thrust of the Bill before the Senate. However, I give notice that at a later stage I will be moving several amendments on behalf of the Opposition. But first I should like to raise some matters arising from the Bill in relation to the Tribunal's consideration and consider some comments made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman). Before I go on to consider these comments from the Government I should stress again-I want to make this very clear-that the Opposition supports the thrust of the Tribunal's recommendation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I pointed out that the Senate, in examining this Bill, has to take into consideration that movements in the salaries of parliamentarians have remained below the movements involved in the cost of living and below the movements in the rate of increase of average weekly earnings. The proposal inherent in the legislation is for a 7 per cent increase in the salaries of members of parliament to become operative on 1 October next in accordance with the Tribunal 's recommendation. This effectively means that the rate of increase is cut back over a 12-month period to about 5 per cent, and that cut back is to take place in a year in which it is expected that the cost of living will move by something like 11 per cent. That figure is the Government's own estimation in the Budget Papers. The Remuneration and Allowances Amendment Bill 1982 is clearly taking a step which puts the salaries of members of parliament and others affected by this legislation in a secondary position to that which applies to the rest of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also makes provision for adjustments in other allowances provided for members of parliament, in the salaries and allowances provided for senior public servants and for members of the judiciary. We in no way quibble with the proposals which are before the Senate. However, I think it ought to be pointed out that earlier this year, which was the last time I spoke to the Senate on the matter of the Remuneration Tribunal's proposals-I find this very much a matter of inconsistency on the part of this Government-we had before us proposals for a 14 per cent increase in the salary range of members of the Second Division of the Public Service. I would remind the Senate that when the Labor Government in 1973 brought in the Remuneration Tribunals Act, the purpose of that legislation was to take out of the area of public disputation the question of salaries and allowances for members of parliament, the judiciary and other senior public servants. It used as its yardstick at that time the suggestion that salaries of members of parliament should be related to the Second Division of the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> When we dealt with this matter earlier this year, there was not a word from the Commonwealth Government, from Mr Fraser or Mr Howard or Mr Newman, that is the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Administrative Services, about that substantial increase in salaries which in fact had the effect of putting Second Division officers of the Public Service on a salary range of approximately $43,000 and therefore it showed up the comparative difference which had grown up over the years between those who had received the same salary in 1973, that is, Second Division officers, and members of the national Parliament. There were some 2,000-odd members of the Second Division of the Public Service-I think we ought to just pause and reflect on that-who received a 14 per cent increase without any interference from the Fraser Administration. But when it came to dealing with the salaries of something less than 190 members of the national parliament there was all the fanfare and hypocrisy which is so much a part of the posturing of the Fraser-Howard Administration. I think that is why we find in the determination of the Remuneration Tribunal some expression of concern at the attitude which was taken by those three members of the Fraser Administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has approached the Tribunal in a way that has never been tried before. It has used the hearings of the Tribunal as a way to gain publicity for its own discredited and disorganised wages, salaries and economic policies. I think Mr Hayden dealt with that point very adequately in the House of Representatives when this matter was being debated. The Government effectively made three very public submissions to the Tribunal, one in writing by the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman; one in writing by the Prime Minister and one verbal submission by the Treasurer, Mr Howard, who now, of course, is the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party and someone whose whole administration of taxation is seriously in question by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> These circumstances were, to say the least, as the report of the Tribunal remarks-I use its word-unusual. In other words, the Tribunal found the intervention by these three senior members an unusual event. All of the Government's submissions had the intention or the strategy of gaining publicity for a government's commitment to what it terms maximum wage restraint-I emphasise that-but it said not one single word of criticism about the increase of 14 per cent for Second Division officers early this year. Of course these submissions were made by members of a government, the great majority of whom not only receive large salaries as Ministers of State and members of parliament but also, in a great majority of cases, are in receipt of extra income from outside the Parliament in the form of income from their grazing properties or from the businesses and other activities with which they were associated prior to their becoming members of parliament. We find the attitude taken by these three senior members of the Government hypocritical and unacceptable to the degree that it attempts to suggest double standards in respect of a small handful of people. It attempts to suggest that this salary increase for parliamentarians will have some melodramatic impact upon the whole question of wages and salaries in Australia. The Government has not been concerned with the real economic effect of its submission. It has been conceived from the point of view of how it will look to the public. In the Tribunal's words:</PARA>
<PARA> The submissions are concerned essentially with the appearance rather than the substance of our determinations and recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the words of the Tribunal. In other words, the Government wants to be seen to be doing something positive for the economy when in fact it is not doing that because the sort of money that is being saved is quite small compared with its attitude in respect of other persons covered by the Remuneration Tribunal. Let us look at the whole question of wage restraint. The Tribunal in its report- again I am being very careful to quote precisely what it said-stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Rt. Hon. the Prime Minister wrote personally to the Tribunal stating the view of his Government that it is necessary to achieve a moderation of the rate of wage and salary increases in the community in order to avoid an immediate rise in unemployment, to reduce inflationary pressures, and to avoid further damage to our international competitiveness. He stated the Government's view that the decision taken by this Tribunal would significantly affect such matters . </PARA>
<PARA>Does the Government really believe that by a gesture of reducing the amount that normally would be made available from 14 per cent to 7 per cent, applicable from 1 October, meaning an effective increase of 5 per cent, it will help with unemployment, reduce inflationary pressures and avoid any further damage to our international competitiveness? The Government not only is pulling the wool over the eyes of members of parliament but also is trying to do so with the Australian community. Later, when this view was accepted, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer welcomed the decision of the Tribunal. Again, to use the Prime Minister's expression, this proposal represented a clear example of restraint. There are several problems with this thesis. Firstly, the agreement of members of parliament to take the 7 per cent pay rise means that they will get an increase of nearly $50 a week. That will not provide any incentive and in no way will assist that 60 per cent of the Australian work force-the wage and salary earners-where wages are average weekly earnings. The wage and salary earners will see that what we do is completely irrelevant to the economic difficulties that they are facing as a result of the economic policies which are being pursued by this Government. Secondly, as the Tribunal has pointed out, so-called wage restraint by members of parliament will have no economic effect. In its report the Tribunal stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In money terms, the change in the remuneration of offices within our jurisdiction is not of relevant significance to the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The possibility of our review being treated as a precedent for other decisions could, were such matters dealt with merely on a logical basis, be excluded. </PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, the Government has sought to suggest, falsely in my view, that wage increases represent the main cause of Australia's economic problems today. In effect the Government is seeking to apportion blame to one section of the community-the wage and salary earners-for the very complex and difficult economic problems that we face. The Government seeks to blame that sector of society which has the least power, influence and income. But it never questions its own approach, the approach of employers or its own failure to arrest the problems of inflation, unemployment and the general decline in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has no effective or consistent wages policy. It allows real wages to be continually eroded by inflation, increasing prices, health insurance charges, State charges as a result of the Government's Budget policies, interest rate hikes, tax increases and, as we well know from the events that have occurred in the last several weeks, amazing and extensive tax rorts. The Government ignores all of these problems, it concentrates only on wage and salary earners who have no opportunity but to seek redress by way of wage and salary increases through the effectiveness of their trade unions and the industrial tribunals in State and Federal jurisdictions. The Government has a policy of ad hockery and disorganisation only. It rejects any approach which may confront the real and widespread problems of the economy such as unemployment, inflation, a stagnating manufacturing industry and reduced levels of investment. None of these matters will be in any way affected by this hypocritical action taken by the intervention of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Administrative Services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has rejected out of hand the suggestions of the Australian Council of Trade Unions in recent days that an employment fund be created out of contributions from wage and salary earners, industry and the wealthy. In return the ACTU has offered to support a process of orderly and equitable wage fixation but the Government, off the cuff, through the Prime Minister and the Acting Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Brown, has rejected this considered, reasoned and restrained approach. Alternatively it has suggested that by 190 members of the Parliament being treated in this way the problem is largely resolved. What an absurd suggestion from a government that has turned its back on the degree of taxation scandals that have been allowed to continue by the Australian Taxation Office and the Attorney-General's Department over the last seven or eight years. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is the same Government that piece by piece took apart the basis of the wage indexation system which was set up by the Whitlam Labor Government. It has destroyed the Tribunal's work over the years to maintain the sort of parity which was accepted at that time to be a fair and equitable way in which these matters would be dealt with by the national Parliament. The Opposition takes the view that a wages policy must be seen and dealt with in the same broad context of economic policy. An orderly, regular and equitable system of wage fixation is needed. Such a system is a key element of a planned economic and social policy based on a process of co-operation between unions, employers and Government. Such an approach is embodied in the Australian Labor Party-ACTU prices and incomes agreement. This represents a much more genuine attempt to deal with the problems facing this country than the sort of hypocritical gesturing and posturing by the Fraser Administration. We would welcome a positive and creative contribution from the trade union movement to an economic and wages policy of the kind made by the ACTU in its proposal in recent days. The Government can only rest on publicity oriented statements such as those it has made in relation to the report of the Remuneration Tribunal. Whilst we accept the thrust we point to the utter hypocrisy of this Government in the way in which it has dealt with the tribunal and its findings. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to the amendments which we propose to move. The first amendment seeks to amend clause 6 of the Bill to delete the section providing an allowance for all justices of the High Court of Australia who maintain their principal home outside Canberra. I remind the Senate, and particularly my colleagues who I hope are allies on this matter-the Australian Democrats-that the Parliament in its wisdom, correctly said that justices of the High Court should, on appointment, reside in Canberra. Why did the Parliament make that judgment? Because it believed it was essential for judges of the High Court not only to be domiciled in Canberra but also to begin to take on a national outlook, to come out of the cloister or the parochial areas in which they had previously worked- whether that be in the Public Service, the private sector or some other jurisdiction. The Parliament believed that they should come out of those environments, live in Canberra and look at matters from a national point of view . I would have thought that the Australian Democrats would consider these matter to be national issues-as indeed the Australian Labor Party does-and not State issues. I would have thought the Australian Democrats would look at these issues not from a narrow parochial point of view but from the point of view of national politics. The judges of the High Court hitherto have been regarded by other people's definitions-not my own-as State righters, as people who were expected to take a point of view that was related to the State point of view as distinct from the national point of view. We have seen a transformation of the High Court . As a result of the Government's guidelines the High Court has taken on a national characteristic-a national view. I think that was a correct position to take. The consequence of that is a strenghening of the national viewpoint over a whole ambit of legislation and interpretation of law. The Government decided that as from 1 July 1980 an allowance would be paid only to those who had been appointed prior to that date. So the Government's intention was that people appointed to the High Court of Australia should come on the understanding that they will be domiciled in the national capital. The Australian Labor Party supports that concept. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe everything that the High Court has done in recent times has justified that unanimous view of the national Parliament, one which the Opposition and the government of the day supported. However, when I look at the submissions which were made by various organisations, public servants, private citizens, judges and so on, to the Remuneration Tribunal, I realise that there was obviously a submission of some sort made by the Chief Justice, Sir Harry Gibbs. I do not know whether he made the suggestions that are now embraced in this Bill. Two recent appointments have been made-Mr Justice Deane and Mr Justice Dawson. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's intention with the passing of this Bill is not only to increase the interstate allowance but also to encourage the justices to live in the States in which they were previously domiciled. So rather than coming here and strengthening what I believe to be a very desirable philosophy and outlook, we will now have four judges of the High Court receiving this allowance and living elsewhere. It is not a great sum of money but I believe a principle is involved here-the need for the judges to carry out what was the express wish of the Government. We find the Government accepting this; in other words, going through the back door to undo the legislation which previously existed. We should automatically have a judge with a national perspective not only residing here but I would suggest also socialising here and therefore looking at things not from the narrow point of view of Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide, Darwin or Hobart but from the point of view of how they affect Australia as a nation. That is the way in which the High Court should operate. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe in the devolution of power. I am not a centralist just for the sake of it; neither is the Labor Party. We support the principle of the devolution of power but we believe with respect to Australia as a nation certain fundamentals ought to exist. Yet on looking at the Government's proposals, which adopt the recommendations of the Tribunal, there is no evidence to suggest other than there must have been a submission made by Sir Harry Gibbs, or some private arrangement made with the justices concerned. If that was the case the Parliament should have been told and the Government should not have gone about it through the back door, as is suggested in the clause that I have referred to. I do not think the Senate should undermine the basis I have referred to or the truly national outlook which is now a feature of our High Court. This should put an end to all these tax avoidance and evasion schemes which were so much a feature of the way in which the High Court previously operated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party has a number of other amendments which seek to transfer to the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly the power of disallowance in respect of decisions of the Remuneration Tribunal relating to that body. In other words, we are saying that as the Remuneration Tribunal has recommended-and the Government has accepted-that the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly shall have the power to disallow any of its salaries or allowances, we suggest that, again concerning the question of devolution of power, the same principles should apply to the Australian Capital Territory Assembly and that there ought to be a uniform approach; in other words, if it is good enough for Norfolk Island, surely the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly in the national capital should similarly have that right. So, in the Committee stage we will be moving an amendment to achieve exactly the same purpose in respect of the Australian Capital Territory. I think it is appropriate that the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly should accept responsibility for deciding whether it will accept the determination of the Tribunal in exactly the same way as the Parliament accepts responsibility for its own conditions, salaries and allowances. In that context we will be moving a series of amendments which have been circulated. It would appear as though there were a great number of amendments in the two pages which have been circulated. In fact we are dealing with only two substantive matters; the first relates to the allowance of $9,125, which is to be paid to the judges who wish to remain in their States of domicile ; and the second seeks to apply to the Australian Capital Territory Assembly the same principles involved in the Norfolk Island Assembly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Remuneration and Allowances Amendment Bill 1982 is, in my view, a very important Bill which implements a responsible report by the Remuneration Tribunal. It is very important at this time that we should have wage restraint because if we are to recover from our present slump and reduce unemployment we must reduce the rate of increase in real wages. Last year average weekly earnings increased by 17 per cent, yet the real productivity increase was only 1.2 per cent. We just cannot go on like that. We are trading with the rest of the world at an annual deficit of about $9,000m. Interest rates have to be kept high so that we can balance the books with capital inflow. Jobs are being destroyed daily. The trite old saying 'one man's pay rise costs another man his job' is only too true today. These points were put to the Remuneration Tribunal and I am delighted that it accepted them. The Remuneration Tribunal states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer put forcibly to the Tribunal--</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think it means forcibly, but forcefully--</PARA>
<PARA>the Government's view that there is now a direct relationship between the level of wage and salary increases and the growth of unemployment and that the decisions of this Tribunal will have a significant influence on such matters. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . we believe we should give effect to the main thrust of the submissions which have been made to us. </PARA>
<PARA>That it does basically with a recommended increase of about 7 per cent in salaries. I am delighted by that, but what worries me is what the Tribunal states elsewhere in the report. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . later in the present year, we shall keep under review the salaries within our jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA>That worries me because I think if we are to have any influence-I will come later to the point Senator Gietzelt was raising about whether what we are doing will have any impact-and if we believe that by restraining salaries in these areas we will make an impact on the growth of real wages in Australia, we must be seen to be sincere. If we give the impression that later in the year we will have another look at salaries and put them up again that will destroy any possible impact such restraint will have. I believe we must make it quite clear that this is our lot for this year. This is all we are going to get and all we are going to ask for. There must be no question of a further increase later in the year. I am writing to the Remuneration Tribunal on those lines. I think it is vital that this Parliament sets an example. We must make quite clear that this is the lot for this year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Tribunal may reopen the matter. I am urging it should not do so. The Tribunal is an independent body and it may reopen the matter. I am trying to make it quite clear that in my opinion and, I hope, in the opinion of the majority of members of parliament that should not happen. We should be satisfied with what we have got. I will come in a moment to the question of what happens if the example is not taken up. Both Senator Gietzelt and the Tribunal made the point that the restraint in this limited range of parliamentary salaries, First Division officers and judges on their own will not have much impact. Certainly it is a small example. However, it cannot really affect the wage structure of this country. What we must do is to see that this restraint extends to all Commonwealth employees. The Commonwealth Government now has 478, 000 people on its payroll. It is quite absurd for the Government to be preaching wage restraint to private employers while at the same time granting generous pay increases for its own employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The groups which come on the Commonwealth's payroll fall into four categories. The first group includes people with whom we are dealing in this Bill tonight- members of parliament, judges, first division officers and so on. I do not want to deal with this group in respect of which restraint has been shown. The second group is made up of the remaining public servants whose salaries are set by government regulation. I think the Government must make it quite clear that it would limit pay increases to them to not more than 7 per cent in 1982-83. The third category consists of other Commonwealth Government employees such as the employees of Telecom Australia and Australia Post whose pay is determined by their management but with access to the conciliation and arbitration system. However, their pay levels are subject to ministerial disallowance. The responsible Minister should not approve any wage increases of more than 7 per cent in 1982-83. Finally, the fourth category is made up of members of the Defence Force whose pay levels are set by the Government and they too should have to show the same restraint. Of course, if this goes on and the example is not taken, we cannot possibly disadvantage all Commonwealth Government employees and in subsequent years there will have to be a catch up for what has been forgone if the example is not taken. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that at this stage it is vital that we should set the example, and set it throughout the whole range of Commonwealth Government employees. This Government has a chance to give a clear lead in this crucial area of wage policy . We have to make it clear that wage restraint is in the interests of the whole community. The Australian Council of Trade Unions recently, for the first time in public as far as I am aware, recognised that wage restraint is very important to the unemployed. The Whitlam Government deliberately used the Commonwealth Public Service as a pacesetter in wages and conditions. The result was the 1974 wage explosion. We should use the Commonwealth Public Service and all people on the Commonwealth payroll as pacesetters in wage restraint. </PARA>

I welcome restraint by the Parliament on the question of its own salaries and emoluments. I particularly welcome restraint by the Parliament at a time when the Parliament and the Government are seeking restraint more widely in the community. My colleague Senator Hamer expanded on this matter during his remarks .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is proper that we should seek this restraint. It is proper that we should do so with Australia in the economic situation it is today, with the prospects being difficult as they are around the world. Senator Gietzelt has chosen to belittle the value of some of the calls for restraint or to belittle the value of the approach which the Government has taken. Senator Gietzelt does not believe that it can be effective. The Government has a different view. The Government believes that there is an effect from the representations which we have made to the Remuneration Tribunal, from the response by the Tribunal to those representations, by the efforts of people like Mr Howard before the Tribunal. May I say that Senator Gietzelt chose to belittle some of the people who went before the Tribunal on the basis that they had other sources of income. Mr Howard, of course, as Treasurer depends upon the income he receives from the Parliament as do many of the rest of us. It is not fair to impute to people like that motives which really are not proper. Mr Howard went before that Tribunal to put a view on behalf of the Government, a view which we hold quite firmly. We believe that our representations and the determination which was made have had and will continue to have a useful demonstration effect. </PARA>
<PARA> In the portfolio which I administer we have recently had a report from the Academic Salaries Tribunal. The Government has yet to respond to that report. But it is interesting to note that the Academic Salaries Tribunal has elected to make an award which has in itself demonstrated a conscious recognition that restraint is appropriate at this time. I would hope that that example of the Academic Salaries Tribunal will be copied in other places. We have seen large corporations in this country asking their senior executives to take little or no pay rises at this time. This is another flow-on from the demonstration effect of what is being done here in the Parliament on behalf of the nation. We in fact may never agree on the merits or otherwise of the approach that has been taken. But I put it to the Senate that the approach by the Government on that is motivated by a desire to help Australia and that our approach to the Tribunal recommending that we should receive less is made on the basis that the nation will be better for those efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt was good enough during his speech to outline what he wants to include in his amendments. It might be appropriate if I responded to the two sets of proposed amendments now even though they will be moved at the Committee stage. If I deal with them now, it may be easier for us when we come to the Committee stage. First of all there is the question in relation to the allowance for judges of the High Court. Part II of the Bill implements the recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal in relation to the salaries and allowances of the judiciary. Of course, Senator Gietzelt proposes to move an amendment to clause 6 of the Bill which seeks to change the basis of eligibility for the Canberra allowance payable to justices of the High Court of Australia. The Act as it stands provides for the annual allowances to be payable to a judge who held office on 1 July 1980 and who has continued to have his sole or principal place of residence outside Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has had this matter before it for a couple of years. I think Senator Gietzelt will acknowledge that in the 1981 report of the Remuneraton Tribunal a recommendation was made that a change should be made. The Government at that time chose not to proceed. In 1982, again the Remuneration Tribunal has recommended that the limitation for this allowance to justices appointed before 1 July 1980 should be removed. Once again, the Government examined the recommendation and reassessed it. We have looked at the matter again in the light of the Tribunal's repeated views and in the light of a number of representations which we have received. State governments, particularly those in some of the less populous States, have put a view that there can be some advantage to justices continuing to have a place of residence in such a State. There is a view that having a justice of the High Court with a place of residence in one of the less populous States is not without its merit. I am not going to go through the merits or otherwise of that. What I am aware of is that the Remuneration Tribunal on two occasions now has recommended that the limitation should be removed. We have had a number of representations from the States and various other people and we have in fact taken these into account. The representations have come not only from the States but also from the Law Council of Australia, from bodies representing the legal profession and from individual legal practitioners. In the light of these representations the Government now believes that it is appropriate to adopt the recommendation. It is one of those issues which we took some time to determine. We considered it- not hastily but over a couple of years-and on balance we now think it is appropriate to adopt the recommendation. We have included in the Bill a proposal which will allow us to adopt the recommendation. The proposal of Senator Gietzelt is not to adopt the recommendation. The Senate will make its choice. But I indicate that the Government will not accept the amendment which is proposed. The Government wishes to proceed to adopt the recommendation of the Remuneration Tribunal and I hope that the Senate will see its way clear to support the Government on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The other group of amendments relates to whether a power of disallowance should rest with the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly rather than with this Parliament in matters relating to the House of Assembly. The analogy suggested between Norfolk Island and the House of Assembly is not an exact analogy. Honourable senators may wish to consider several facts. They may wish to consider that the people of the Australian Capital Territory, by way of a referendum, rejected self-government. The Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly is a body with advisory power only. The Norfolk Island Assembly is a body which has its own legislative powers. The parallel does not follow. </PARA>
<PARA> We think that the power proposed by Senator Gietzelt would be inappropriate and inapt. The Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly is merely an advisory body and has no legislative power other than to determine its standing orders. The provision which is proposed would in fact extend the power of the House of Assembly in a major way and almost, as it were, just as a throw away gesture. The amendment, if passed in the Senate, would raise questions relating to future governance of the Australian Capitral Territory. I mention for the guidance of the Senate that the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) has on many occasions stated his belief that no developments will be made on the constitutional issue until he has received the report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission's inquiry into the Australian Capital Territory's finances. That inquiry is under way. When the results of it come to hand the Minister for the Capital Territory will have to take into account a whole range of questions which go to the governance of the Australian Capital Territory. We believe that it would be inappropriate to accord to the House of Assembly any legislative power in advance of the Government's consideration of the Grants Commission's report. I remind honourable senators that there are regular occasions on which the amendments proposed by Senator Gietzelt could be considered again. Once we have the report from the Grants Commission and once it has been considered, it may be more appropriate to look at this proposed extension of the powers of the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> We have an indication that there is support for the legislation and I thank honourable senators for that. It is not the Government's intention to accept any of the amendments proposed. We will oppose them in the Committee stage. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators have before them the amendments which the Opposition proposes to move in the Committee stage. The Opposition seeks the deletion of paragraphs (a) and (b) of clause 6. Consequently what would remain would be the reference that the additional allowances paid to certain justices of the High Court of Australia be $9,125. In the second reading debate the Government made its position clear, but it has ignored what I believe to be a fairly fundamental principle. First of all, the Opposition does not in any way suggest that the appointments to the High Court should be criticised. We are happy with the appointments. In fact it would certainly be my judgment that the Government has made some very good appointments to the High Court. However, without getting involved in any way in the question of personalities, circumstances do exist in which persons operating in a State sphere and giving advice to a State are on occasions appointed to the High Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we know, a great deal of the legislation dealt with by the High Court relates to differences between a State view and the Commonwealth view. Often circumstances arise in which persons involved in the jurisdiction of a State suddenly find themselves elevated to a position on the High Court. In other words, the environment changes dramatically but their experience and previous professional involvement have been in a different jurisdiction. It seems to us to be logical for persons elevated to the highest judicial position in the land to be in a position in every way, shape and form to look at questions of law interpretation-whether they be matters of difference between State and Federal jurisdiction or between individuals and institutions or governments-from a different viewpoint from that which they previously held. As far as practicable they should be encouraged in their new environment to have a national outlook and to look at things from the point of view of how they might affect the whole nation and not how they might affect a particular State. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not resile from the fact that States have a point of view to which they are entitled. But on many occasions members of a State parliament have come into the national parliament and had their views changed as a result of their experiences in debates that take place within the national Parliament. They get a wider view; their experience is broadened, their outlook is broadened and they start to look at things from a national viewpoint-from an Australian viewpoint, and not from the more restricted viewpoint which was understandable in the jurisdiction in which they previously worked. A great deal can be said for judges-this was the view that the Government took and that the Opposition supported-of the High Court to be domiciled in Canberra; to live and absorb the atmosphere of national issues, national politics and national affairs, and to socialise in an atmosphere in which they will appreciate the changed environment and the change in emphasis that is now their principal area of responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> There is every reason for the Opposition to take the viewpoint that it is a negative position to have judges who have spent three or four days in Canberra returning to the environment in which they previously practised, whether is was in the private sector or in the public sector, and looking at issues from the point of view of their previous experience and not that of their new area of responsibility. No evidence has been presented-Senator Baume did not present any evidence-to show that there are any advantages. The Remuneration Tribunal produced none-not that it was obliged to. It was merely obliged to make recommendations in respect of the evidence before it. No one that I am aware of has been able to say that what is proposed will give us judges of a higher quality; that their judgements will be better if they commute back and forth, to and from, their respective States. I understand that of the last two appointees one was from Victoria and the other from South Australia. Senator Baume referred to the smaller States. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that it would be in the community's interest for the judges to spend seven or eight hours of a given day travelling between Perth and Canberra, for instance. Their task is to sit in judgment on matters before the High Court in the national capital. We have built a High Court building. We have taken High Court judges away from their respective States, although I understand that some cases are still heard in the various capital cities. But, overall, the objective in building the High Court in Canberra-I believe the building to be a monstrosity-was to enable the Court to operate here, to feel the Canberra atmosphere, to obtain the national, the Australian viewpoint. Consequently, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Page 2, clause 6, paragraphs (a) and (b), leave out the paragraphs. </PARA>
<PARA>This would delete the provision which states that judges may have the option of residing at their previous place of domicile. They would then be required, to justify receiving the allowance, to live in the Canberra district. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I respond to Senator Gietzelt's suggestion that reasons might be offered for the position that the Government is taking. The present position merely draws a distinction between two groups of High Court judges-those who were appointed before a certain date and those who were appointed after a certain date. At present different standards of treatment apply to each. Under the portfolio that I administer the Department not infrequently must look for people to accept positions of national importance, which may involve their moving to the national capital. For the people whom I have approached a quite major family disruption is involved. I suggest that we draw a distinction between that person and the rest of his or her family. In many cases there are family roots and obligations which would keep the rest of the family where they are. If that is not easily possible we sometimes find-I have spoken to some of them-that they decline to take the post. Often, for very good reasons, they are not willing to move their family in toto to Canberra. We require, of course, the very highest calibre of person for the positions of justice of the High Court. I am ad idem with Senator Gietzelt on the points he made about the need for judges of high quality. The Parliament should take actions which will make it possible for people of the very first rank to feel able to accept appointment to the High Court. This is essential to maintenance of the best state of health of the polity and the nation as a whole. I refer Senator Gietzelt to paragraphs 28 and 29 of the 1981 report of the Remuneration Tribunal, which set out its reasons for proposing the course that the Government is now taking. They include the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If justices appointed in the future will not receive the allowance, persons who ought to be appointed to the Court may be deterred from accepting the appointment. A newly appointed justice will, in many cases, be compelled for financial reasons to move his home to Canberra. In some cases a person asked to accept appointment to the Court might be prepared to move his residence to Canberra and might even wish to do so. In other cases, family or other commitments, or simply personal choice, might lead a person who clearly ought to be appointed to the Court to refuse to accept the position if that entailed the moving of his home to Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>I might add that some years ago, when my mother and father sold their home, the purchaser was, and still is, a justice of the High Court to whom we are still exceedingly grateful, and he obtained a very good home. In paragraph 29 of the report the Tribunal went on to say that there were considerable advantages to the community if some members of the Court continued to live outside Canberra, and it set out the reasons. That is the Tribunal's view. Senator Gietzelt has put the alternative view. The Government took some time to make up its mind. We believe that, on balance, the course we are now taking is a proper one. I understand that there will be differences of opinion but the Government does not accept the amendments that have been proposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, prior to the 1980 determination two judges, Justices Mason and Wilson, qualified for the allowance because they wished to remain at their original place of domicile. So the Government said: 'Well, from here on in no further allowances will be paid because judges will be required to live in Canberra'. The purpose of this amendment is to allow any judge, including the two recent appointees, to elect to reside anywhere other than the Australian Capital Territory, or a part of New South Wales in the vicinity of the Territory, to receive the $9,125 special allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister said that we ought to have a yardstick, a standard, which is to apply to judges of the High Court. As I understand it, that is not the view that the Government has taken with respect to the senior members of the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. According to a Press report recently, when the whole Department was to be moved from Melbourne to Canberra, some two-thirds of the senior staff elected not to live here. We have here a double standard. The Government says to some people whose careers are affected: 'Your position requires you to come to Canberra; you are required to leave your families and environment and all the other attributes and attractions that kept you in Melbourne'. Two-thirds of the staff have elected not to do that. In respect of the High Court, the Government is setting a different standard by saying that the judges can take any option they like; they can decide to live wherever they like as long as it is not in a particular area of New South Wales or in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>

<PARA>I indicated in the second reading debate that I would move the amendments now circulated to all honourable senators. They are all consequential on taking certain steps to apply to the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly the same principles that apply to the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly; that is to say, the legislation provides for a new principle and that is that the Norfolk Island Assembly shall have the right to accept, amend or otherwise the matters affecting salaries and allowances of members of the Assembly. The Opposition has no quarrel with that because we believe that that is delegating to the appropriate authority the responsibility of making the decision in respect of members' own salaries and allowances. However, for the life of us we cannot understand why the Government has two different standards. I appreciate what the Minister for Education, Senator Baume, has said-that Norfolk Island has certain obligations and responsibilities in its own right and that there is a limitation on the way in which the Australian Capital Territory Assembly operates. Nevertheless, the principle is the same. The Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly is only one step short of being a self-governing organisation. I think that everyone appreciates that in due course it will reach the stage of self-government for the Australian Capital Territory. I suppose that the people took a conservative view. They did not agree in the referendum to assume their full responsibilities in the area of self-government. But I do not see that that necessarily is an argument why the Assembly should not have the right to make a decision in respect of these matters. It would be only an advisory decision, because the decision would finally rest with the Government accepting or rejecting that decision. Decisions of the Assembly are subject to ratification by the appropriate Government authorities in the national Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as we support the principle of devolution of power, we believe that it would be an act of responsibility to give the Assembly the right to have a say in respect of the allowances paid to its members. That is the purpose of the amendment. This was a matter raised in our party room as a reasonable approach. We saw no reason as a party not to support the concept. We believe that it is a step in the direction of finally convincing the residents of the Australian Capital Territory that they should accept total responsibility as a self- management organisation. If the national Parliament gives them added responsibilities and delegates them certain powers as proposed in our amendments , we shall be taking the essential step which in the long run, and perhaps in the short run, will have the effect of their agreeing finally to taking the same position as the Northern Territory, Norfolk Island and the other territories previously under our control and management. The purpose of the amendments is to achieve exactly the same obligations and responsibilities for the Australian Capital Territory as apply in respect of Norfolk Island. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I set out some of the arguments earlier. There is a fair amount of common ground between the Government and the Opposition on this matter. The difference may be one of the appropriate timing. I indicated earlier to Senator Gietzelt that the Australian Captial Territory at a referendum had rejected self-government. The honourable senator referred to that. But there is at present work under way which bears upon the governance of the Australian Capital Territory and looks at the correct way of managing its finances. The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) has indicated that he will be looking at the results and will be working from that on questions of constitutional development. There will be a stage at which we shall then be on quite common ground, I think, in seeking to advance that constitutional development and to pass down the decision making power. It is our contention that while the investigations are under way through the Grants Commission it is not an appropriate time to pass this extra power across to the House of Assembly in the Australian Capital Territory. I indicated earlier why we think it is not appropriate at this stage. I appreciate the points made by Senator Gietzelt. I think that the difference between us is one of when these things should be done. We would like to see the present investigations and the present work completed and then look at the question again.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not my intention to enter into this debate but I was provoked to do so because of some of the remarks made by the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) in his reply to the second reading. People listening to this debate would have thought that this is the only government which has taken any action to implement restraint in salaries paid to members of parliament and Ministers. Despite the fact that my colleague Senator Gietzelt pointed out that the Whitlam Labor Government had refused any increase at all, Senator Baume saw fit to overlook that fact in his winding up speech, and that is of some concern to me. We must give credit to the Whitlam Government, which decided that we would not accept any increase. Later Senator Baume said that the Government had agreed to the recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal in this instance. But it should also be remembered that the Government did not agree to the recommendations of the Tribunal some 12 months ago. The Government decided that it would alter the Tribunal's recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only other thing I want to say to those who may be interested in this debate is that there are many misguided people in the electorate who are of the belief that members of parliament do not pay income tax on their salaries. Those people ought to be reminded that we, like every other wage earner, pay income tax. That is something which ought to be brought out for the enlightenment of some people, because members of parliament are continually criticised as being people who are paid far too much for the work that they do. In my experience, back benchers are not paid too much. Ministers who have a double income may be overpaid. We know that most Cabinet Ministers in the present Government have other sources of income. In the Opposition, the only people who get extra income are the Leader of the Opposition, and the Deputy Leader. Those on the front bench have all the extra work load of shadowing Ministers but get no extra pay over and above what a back bencher gets. People who criticise members of parliament ought to be made aware of that fact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate will recall that, when this debate was last in progress approximately a fortnight ago, I had been referring particularly to three reasons that the Australian Democrats had put to the Senate why they would support the amendment moved by the Australian Labor Party to the effect that the Bill should be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources. The reason why I was concentrating on the Democrats' reasons was that, as we know, they approach these matters with an open mind. If they can be convinced that their concerns are not well founded, presumably they will be prepared on this occasion to change their minds and support the legislation which would thus be to the benefit of the agricultural community of Australia as a whole. In particular the reasons that they put to the Senate on that last occasion were that, firstly, they were concerned about the minor inaccuracies in an information kit that had been provided by the Government to assist members of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;'Minor inaccuracies' was the terminology used. As I indicated on the last occasion, I am sure that such minor inaccuracies will be clarified by the responsible Minister later in the debate. The second reason that the Democrats put to the Senate was that they were concerned that this Bill would in some way inhibit fundamental research in institutions of higher learning. As I pointed out, there is no reason at all why that should follow, this Bill being designed, in fact, to induce further funding for the benefit of plant variety rights. This time the funding is to come from the private sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third reason why the Democrats were concerned that the Bill should not be passed was that the Government was unable to make accurate projections on the economic consequences of the Bill. As I indicated on that occasion, that is an impossibility. I suggested that a better course of action would be to look at the overseas experience. If one does that and looks at the 25 countries that have legislation of this kind, one will find that the legislation has been beneficial in improving varieties, yield and such aspects as disease resistibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicated on the last occasion that there were two principal purposes for which the Bill was introduced. The first, which I touched upon a moment ago, was to generate private investment in the seed breeding industry. I had looked, in fact, at the United Kingdom. Since the introduction of the legislation in that country so many more plant breeders were producing that there was a decided widening of seed varieties and there were increased yields. The second purpose upon which I had touched was the lack of access from an Australian point of view to certain protected overseas seed varieties due to the absence of similar plant variety legislation as that which exists overseas. I was in the process of listing a number of plant varieties to which Australian breeders do not have access because of not having similar legislation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Archer had listed in much greater detail-in fact, had incorporated in Hansard-many plant varieties to which Australian growers do not have access because of the absence of this type of legislation in this country. Senator Archer mentioned varieties of grape, nectarine, peach, cherry, plum, ornamental plants, rape seed, beans, peas, perennial rye-grass, sweet-corn, strawberries, apples and blackcurrents. As honourable senators will recall, the list takes up several pages of Hansard and there is no need for me to repeat it. These are the important plant varieties that we cannot get into Australia at the moment because of an absence of legislation of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> I touched upon the working party of the Australian Agricultural Council which had listed many varieties of plants to which our growers do not have access. I was about to mention that the working party had little doubt that the list would grow if Australia did not have a PVR scheme and that Australian rural industries would be disadvantaged by lack of access to many of such commercial overseas varieties. Some gauging of the extent of such disadvantage is apparent from the fact that, to the end of 1980, the United States of America had granted protection to 774 varieties of 53 different seed propogated crops plus thousands of asexually propogated crops under its 1930 Plant Patent Act. I mention 1930 to indicate how long ago the United States moved to introduce legislation of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> Agricultural crops in the United Kingdom to the end of 1978 were in excess of 424 varieties. There was a similar figure for decoratives and a further 58 fruit varieties. It is worth noting that, in April 1980, protection of the United Kingdom was in fact, extended to seven additional crops comprising beetroot, cauliflower, gooseberry, flax, linseed, rape seed and oenothera. In actual fact, in Britain at the moment we are seeing an extension of the varieties to which its plant protection legislation will apply. France has granted protection to 1, 177 varieties of 67 crops. Belgium has granted protection to 59 crops. In New Zealand, some 126 plant variety grants had been issued by September 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, a huge number of plant varieties are protected throughout the world. I have mentioned only half a dozen of the 25 countries to the varieties of which breeders in Australia do not have access because of the failure to implement similiar legislation in this country. I understand, in fact, that a recent survey by a senior member of the Victorian Department of Agriculture on the operation and effects of the New Zealand plant variety legislation-I remind honourable senators that it was introduced in 1973-has found that one of its main benefits has been the greatly increased in-flow of plant genetic material from many overseas sources. </PARA>
<PARA> On the last occasion I referred to the British plant controller, Mr Murphy. In his paper entitled 'Plant Breeders Rights and the Improvement of Plant Varieties ' he observed the improvements in pastoral and horticultural productivity derived from the introduction of plant varieties from overseas. It is interesting to note that in the early stages of the operation of the British Act in the United Kingdom companies were established to do nothing more than evaluate overseas bred varieties. Mr Murphy, however, noticed a change in commerical operations after some years. In his paper, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that many of these companies which started off by introducing foreign varities developed their own specialised breeding programs and they are now producing varieties bred in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Our experience, I think, is that only by establishing a plant breeders rights system do you actually encourage companies to even consider introducing varieties and investing any money in the evaluation of foreign varieties. This in turn can lead them to establish their own private breeding programs. </PARA>
<PARA>I have mentioned the number of plants and seed varieties currently registered in only a few of the 25 countries which have similar legislation. It would be naive for us not to accept that many seed varieties within that international bank would be adaptable and profitable in Australian conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of concerns have been expressed about the Bill and it is, therefore, appropriate that I deal with the more significant of such concerns. The first is a fear that the legislation will detrimentally affect public breeding programs. Up to this point, research and development of new seed varieties in Australia have been principally carried out by the public breeding programs, State agricultural departments, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and, to a lesser extent, the universities. There is no reason why this Bill should have any effect whatsoever upon public expenditure on plant variety research. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, this Bill is attempting to attract a new source of investment funds. It is worth noting, however, that, given the Australian dependence on public moneys for research, there is always the danger of a reduction in funding allocations. To broaden the base of community financial support would appear to be wise. Overseas experience tends to support the view that the introduction of PVR is irrelevant to public plant breeding programs. In some countries, such as Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany and the Netherlands, there is more concentration on basic breeding research, handing this on to private breeders for possible commercial use. I thought that that fundamental research was the point that Senator Macklin was emphasising in his speech. In actual fact, in the countries I have just mentioned, that has occurred with PVR. That may not be a bad thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Campbell, at a seminar in Canberra in 1977 on international genetics, referred to the failure of Australian wheat breeders substantially to increase yield rates. On the other hand, in countries such as the United States of America, South Africa and Switzerland there has been an increase in public breeding at the same time as they have had PVR. The experience in New Zealand would appear to indicate that public breeding organisations have welcomed PVR and are using them to obtain rights to many newly-developed varieties. According to a Department of Primary Industry information paper, a co-operative effort has been developed between public and private breeding organisations in New Zealand. I should think that Senator Macklin would applaud that. This touches upon a further reason why PVR should not cause concern to Australian public breeders. The reason is, of course, that the Bill in fact allows government funded agencies such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization to participate in the scheme. The development of new varieties by public breeding organisations will be eligible for registration under the Act. They will therefore be able to receive a return on the sale of their patented variety. Moreover, the public breeding programs will have the initial advantage over private commercial firms of having had a presence in Australia over many years and their expertise and knowledge of Australian conditions would give them a head start in research and development of new seed varieties. </PARA>
<PARA> The second concern expressed in relation to the Bill is the likelihood of the industry falling under oligopoly control, with consequent inferior quality, higher priced seeds flooding the market. The oligopolies are usually seen in the form of the dreaded multinational companies. Like any industry in a free market situation where rapid growth is occurring, there is always the chance of takeovers. However, I would stress to the Senate on this occasion the provisions in the Bill that provide that the registration authority has a charter to ensure that a reasonable supply of varieties is placed on the market at reasonable prices, so the concern expressed in this area is not well-founded. Poor quality seeds which are susceptible to disease or require substantial chemical inputs would not survive as a commercial proposition for very long. Those who raise this issue of quality and price tend to forget that only new varieties will be included in the scheme. If new varieties prove to be inferior or the price does not reflect their yield potential, farmers, horticulturalists and orchardists will not buy them. Existing seed varieties would therefore retain their competitive edge. </PARA>
<PARA> The third concern expressed is that the granting of plant variety rights is likely to lead to an increase in seed costs for farmers and gardeners. I remind the Senate of what the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has said on the matter. It has said that if increased private involvement in plant breeding results in the development of improved plant lines through time, and hence an improvement in plant productivity, then the net result will be a decline in the effective cost of seed; that is, the increase in the value of output from far better varieties will more than offset the increased cost of seed. </PARA>
<PARA> The final concern which has been mentioned is the impact on Third World countries of the granting of proprietary rights over new plant varieties in Australia. I find this concern difficult to understand. If indigenous varieties are replaced by new and more effective varieties, it appears to me to be to the benefit of lesser developed countries. If the existing product is more efficient , it simply will not be replaced. One of the great concerns of Third World countries is to develop as much as possible self-sufficiency in food production and new and efficient seed varieties. This is, therefore, an important step along that road. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is sensible and forward-looking. It will help to encourage a more competitive, efficient and productive plant breeding industry in Australia. There will always be reservations about innovative legislation in this country, even if it has successfully been utilised elsewhere for decades. But experience elsewhere shows that reservations changed to solid and positive support. Of the situation in New Zealand, Mr R. R. Heading, Principal Improvement Officer of the Plant Standards Branch of the Victorian Department of Agriculture, said:</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot help getting the feeling that in both Government and industry there is very great support for the whole concept of plant variety rights. Once in action the whole thing settles down and particularly the plant breeders are more than ever conscious of the need to maintain very high quality in the varieties they produce. </PARA>
<PARA> After a long wait this legislation will place Australia in step with the international plant breeding community. It will enable Australian plant breeders to gain better access to varieties previously denied them, and will provide consumers with a greater range of high quality fruits, vegetables and ornamental plants. It will contribute to ensuring that we are not left behind in a world of change. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill now proceeds with the general support of the Australian Agricultural Council, the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation , the Australian United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association and the Australian Seed Producers Association. The Bill deserves the whole-hearted support of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendement moved by Senator Walsh on behalf of the Opposition that the Plant Variety Rights Bill be referred to the Senate Standing Committe on National Resources. The plant variety rights legislation before the Senate will enable plant breeders' organisations to obtain ownership or property rights over the seeds and cuttings of newly developed plant varieties. Patented seeds will remain the property of patent holders for a period of 15 years to 20 years. The owner of the new plant variety will have the power to determine who or which outlets will be able to sell the seeds of the new variety and to charge growers a royalty fee if they use the seeds. Not only will retail outlets need the authorisation of patent holders before selling patented seeds but also farmers who might wish to sell their neighbours a few bags of seed will be covered by the same law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Industrial patents are a familiar example of a property right which allows patent holders to charge users royalties. The plant variety rights scheme however, differs from the industrial patents scheme in two ways: Plant patents will be able to be obtained from discoveries, and breeders will not have to make known to the public detail of the breeding and selection process that led to the new patented variety. The commercial consequences of plant variety patents go far beyond the control of seed sales and the inclusion of royalty fee in the price of seed. Companies holding plant patents can use their power to control the sale of seeds to stop independent seed producers-that is, farmers who grow seed for sale-from growing patented seed for sale on the open market. </PARA>
<PARA> The greatest impact of plant patents will be on the current free exchange of seed and genetic information. Just as normal research and development by companies is a closely guarded secret, so will genetic information become a similarly closely guarded secret because of this legislation. Right now with public breeding programs for public benefit there is a free flow of information and techniques. If patenting becomes law this flow will become one way-from the public sector to the private companies. I suggest-I can prove this assertion- that that flow will be from smaller companies to larger companies. I believe that seed prices will rise. </PARA>
<PARA> This restriction will flow on to the role of public seed breeders. It is inevitable that the expensive basic research will be pushed on to public bodies while the more lucrative exploitation of that research will be left to private enterprise. I disagree with Senator Hill on this point. Subsequently I will show where he is wrong in comparison with the major countries. Instead of proposing this Bill-this is where I disagree with Senator Hill-we should be extending the public programs to cover other crops. Some public breeders are opposed to plant variety rights. If the amendment moved by the Opposition is carried I hope that the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources will hear from people such as Mr S. S. Gladstones, who is the principal plant breeder in the Western Australian Department of Agriculture. Mr Gladstones has strongly attacked plant variety rights. His view, as a plant breeder, is that public breeding programs are more efficient, and that interstate, let alone overseas, developed varieties will often be of little value and commercial breeding cannot do the job, firstly , because of the small size of the Australian seed market and, secondly, because plant variety rights encourage cosmetic rather than substantial changes. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a summary contained at page 11 of a paper prepared by Mr Gladstones entitled-'Western Australia's and Australia's plant breeding needs and likely effects of plant variety rights'. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The summary read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Summary</PARA>
<PARA> Improvement of crop and pasture plants by breeding is an outstanding and essential investment, both to the farming community and to the nation. Improvements in yield or quality due to breeding are normally without added cost to the producer, and are thus pure profit. Cost-benefit analysis indicates that there should be a greatly increased input into agricultural plant breeding and associated research. </PARA>
<PARA> Breeding and testing for Western Australia need to be done predominantly within Western Australia, in the environments where the varieties are to be grown. With diminishing exceptions, varieties bred elsewhere cannot be expected to give continuing improvements in yield and profitability for Western Australian farms.</PARA>
<PARA> Private or corporate breeding, under PVR, cannot be expected to do the required job in Western Australia or, for most of the important self-pollinating crops and pastures, in Australia as a whole. The commercial seed trade is, and will remain, too small to support any worthwhile breeding effort in these species on the basis of royalties from seed sales. What private breeding does take place will remain confined to limited parts of eastern Australia, and will be predominantly of the minimum-input, 'cosmetic' type. </PARA>
<PARA> If introduced, PVR will greatly reduce progress by public breeding by undermining the basis for collaboration among States and institutions, and by imposing extraneous requirements on public as well as private breeders to meet the special needs of PVR. Commercial lobbies can be expected to seek the reduction and perhaps eventual elimination of competition provided by public breeding programmes. </PARA>
<PARA> For most farmers in Australia, and for almost all farmers in Western Australia, no advantage of any sort can be demonstrated for PVR. Costly, major disadvantages are certain, especially in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore essential that PVR legislation, if introduced at all, be clearly confined to those crops (e.g. horticultural and ornamental) for which advantages to Australia can be proved. Cool-season annual crop and pasture plants should be explicitly and permanently excluded. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IF4">Senator CHILDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A key factor in the debate over plant variety rights is the difference in farm techniques between Australia, Europe and the United States of America. Overseas farmers purchase new seed every season. Here farmers purchase a few bags of seed and build up their own seed stocks for future use. Because of this, one company-the Shell Oil Co.-will not come to Australia. The market is just too small. I wish to quote from a Mr G. J. Hollamby, who is a senior plant breeder at Roseworthy Agricultural College in South Australia. Mr Hollamby recently addressed the PVR issue in the context of the winter cereal industry. He stated that Australia could not have a domestic market sufficient to support even the present level of plant breeding compared with United Kingdom where 90 per cent of seed is purchased annually. In Australia less than 4 per cent of the crop is sown and then bought as seed. Even with heavy promotion Mr Hollamby considers that 20 per cent would be the maximum and that consequently accompanying legislation might be needed to compel farmers to buy seed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Bill becomes law farmers will be presented with a multitude of cheaply bred, heavily promoted cosmetic varieties with little information on local suitability. The Government says that farmers are not fools, but no farmer can be expected to critically evaluate new varieties during the initial years when he is increasing seed. Still less can he quickly evaluate a pasture variety whose merit may depend on its ability to persist over many years. It is clear to backers of plant variety rights that the big oil companies and chemical multinationals such as Shell, which I have mentioned, would want to change the habits of Australian farmers, that is, to get farmers to buy seed from the company every year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Sir John Carrick) referred to the long period of public debate which has taken place on the Bill. That length of time makes it even more inexcusable that there has been no economic evaluation of the impact of plant variety rights. In the only current economic study on plant variety rights by Mr David Godden of the New South Wales Department of Agriculture it is shown that plant variety rights is not needed economically. Mr Godden says that plant variety rights will not work unless Australian farming practices change substantially. Mr Godden, who won the Australian Agricultural Economics Society's masters prize for PVR, went on to say of small seed companies:</PARA>
<PARA> These firms tend to disappear after plant variety rights. </PARA>
<PARA>After an extensive study that was Mr Godden's view. So much for the Minister's claim that these firms will not be disadvantaged. Mr Godden points out a tendency to oligopoly. I struggle with that word. It is a difficult word to get my tongue around and it leaves a bad taste in my mouth as well. An oligopoly is an industry which is dominated by a few large transnational corporations. Finally Mr Godden concluded that the effect of plant variety rights will be to encourage imported varieties rather than domestic breeding. </PARA>
<PARA> To be patentable under the law new variety rights must be distinct, uniform and stable-distinct in that they are new and different from already identified varieties; uniform in that every plant of the variety must be much the same for the purposes of identification so that the PVR system is administratively possible; and stable in that the variety must maintain its uniformity over a number of generations. These distinct, uniform and stable characteristics, referred to in Europe as DUS provisions, are provisions which are based on distinctiveness. Breeders are forced to reduce characteristics that are not distinct-for example, characteristics of yield, disease resistance and product quality. I will again refer to Mr Gladstones who points out that English breeders, who have had experience under public sector breeding, have claimed that the rate of yield is halved after plant variety rights legislation is introduced. The characteristics that I am referring to have nothing to do with consumer needs. Increasingly it is genetic variety not uniformity that is seen as a solution to crop vulnerabilities. PVR would block off this as an alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most sinister aspect of plant patents is that they are being pushed by huge multinational corporations which also have large interests in insecticides, fertilisers and other chemicals. I make no apology for criticising multinational companies such as Shell Oil, Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz because they are typical of the companies involved. There will be two problems. These companies will make sure that the seeds which develop are dependent on their chemicals. This has happened in the United States of America. The very size and concentration of the industry could endanger agricultural diversity. On page 221 of a report on overcoming world hunger by the Presidential Commission on world hunger in 1980 this was stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Closely interrelated with patenting laws are distressing trends within the seed industry. Patenting laws, strongly supported by some large seed companies, have encouraged concentration within the industry. The number of seed company takeovers particularly by large pesticide, fertilizer and drug companies, has increased dramatically over the last few years. This could well lead to oligopoly pricing and the potential that narrow economic self-interests will be determining the fate of humankinds common heritage-agricultural diversity. </PARA>
<PARA>This fear of oligopoly control is well founded. Figures from the United States Plant Protection Office show that at December 1979 in the United States three corporations held 80 per cent of patents on beans; four corporations held 45 per cent of patents on cotton; four corporations held 60 per cent of patents on lettuce; four corporations held 62 per cent of patents on peas; four corporations held 48 per cent of patents on soya beans; and four corporations held 69 per cent of patents on barley. So much for the market forces which were mentioned by government senators! The simple fact is that this does not exist. The anti-competitive aspects of this have already been brought before the European Court of the European Economic Community. Pricing activities of transnational seed companies or corporations have already led to protests in West Germany. West German farmers objected to paying 70 per cent more than French farmers for the same corn seed. In a significant test case on 14 November 1978 reported in the Common Market law reports, between Mr Eisele and the Institute of National Research Agronomy from France, the effect of the decision was to take away from Mr Eisele the ability to sell seed in Germany at any price . I would like to quote from that decision-page 442-because it sums up in the European context the development of these companies gaining control of the seed industry. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Profit margins in recent years have enabled the largest of these private breeders to control or take over production or distribution of the varieties they exploit. On the world market this trend is reflected in the recent acquisition(s) by Sandoz, Ciba-Geigy, Shell and other groups of major holdings in large American breeders and, hence, in their European agents and subsidiaries , a further illustration of the interest which major international groups are showing in the seed industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The decision in the case I have referred to was appealed against this year and the European Commission upheld this movement of the people in Europe. Exclusive rights will be taken out of the European plant breeders rights as a result of that appeal being won by the people of Europe, preventing those multinational companies at this stage from engaging in the activities that they have been involved in. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for future inclusions of crops in the scheme to be made without reference to Parliament, only by assent of the Australian Agricultural Council. No species is specifically included in or excluded from the Bill. It is vital to realise that the scheme as passed could be extended to cover any crops without Parliament first being consulted. The Bill embodies that characteristic of other schemes in that merit is no criteria for receiving a patent. Plant variety rights will not be granted for varieties whose seeds or plants have previously been sold in Australia or have been on sale overseas for longer than four years, and in some cases six years. However, those provisions are easily circumvented. Minor physical changes can be made to existing varieties and patents can be applied for. These minor changes, plus strong promotion, can mean some company could have a winner, but I suggest the growers and the people will not benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 13 (2) extends plant variety rights to foreign residents and varieties developed overseas. The danger here is that non-Australian companies can take out patents on new varieties that they develop after taking advantage of research performed by public institutions such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, universities and departments of agriculture. The 1979 Senate inquiry into industrial research and development revealed that overseas corporations were taking out 90 per cent of Australian patents. The danger is that under this legislation the same thing would happen in this area of activity. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an increasing tendency overseas for companies involved in food processing to develop varieties more suited to their cultivation, harvesting and production methods than to eating. I am on the side of the eaters. People are entitled to make sure that the food process is not interfered with by these giant companies. This legislation is one more step in letting loose the profit motive in our agriculture in a devastating way. I have already mentioned Mr Godden's reference to oligopoly developing. As I have shown, oligopoly in the United States of America and Europe is synonmous with plant variety rights. Seed companies with chemical interests would tend to develop seeds that are dependent upon oil based pesticide coatings rather than being naturally pest resistant. Yet this is what plant variety rights encourages at great cost to the world, particularly the Third World's energy and economic future. I disagree strongly with Senator Hill on this matter. The simple facts are that these companies that I have referred to tonight are well known. In fact, they are infamous throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than regulating to push farmers down these damaging paths the Government should be doing all it can to encourage long-term ecologically stable agriculture. We may not pay the price for plant variety rights, but our children will unless we are very cautious. I believe with the controversy surrounding this matter that caution is best dealt with by referring this matter to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources and making sure that the Australian people know more of the dangers behind this legislation. The genetic resources of our planet are our future, but they are falling more and more into private hands. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation one company, United Brands, controls two-thirds of the world's germ plasm of bananas. Plant variety rights is not the only cause of this depletion and concentration of genetic resources, but it is part of the process. It illustrates the problem that I referred to earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many reasons why I think all Australians have a stake in this debate. The Opposition has proposed that this matter go before a Senate committee which allows the people to make their representations. People in all walks of life are concerned about this issue. I urge all honourable senators to support the amendment moved by Senator Walsh. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe the Plant Variety Rights Bill 1982 is long overdue. It is in the area of plant variety rights in Australia that lack of protection acting as a disincentive has become extremely pronounced. There are simply no incentives to produce new plant varieties. After all, why should a person devote time, energy and finance to developing new concepts and new products when, without the protection another may plagiarise and profit from that invention? That is graphically illustrated by the experience which the British have had in plant variety rights legislation. Over the last five years alone in England there has been a 500 per cent increase in private investment in plant breeding. In addition the number of private companies involved in plant breeding has increased from 10 in 1967, just after the introduction of the PVR legislation, to 23 currently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The need for PVR legislation in Australia is, to say the least, in simple terms twofold. Firstly, it will provide a stimulus to private plant breeding by affording protection to new seed discoveries and, therefore, providing the incentive of profit for plant breeding. It is for this reason that in 1976 the Industries Assistance Commission report on financial rural research recommended- I refer honourable senators to paragraph 40-that the introduction of plant breeders rights be expedited. An example of the present lack of commercial interest in plant breeding was given recently by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture. In a statement made last year in reference to the breeding of open pollinated crops it noted that it would cost a breeder with all necessary equipment and supporting staff $100,000 a year. New plant varieties would take a minimum of five and sometimes up to 10 years to develop. Under these circumstances it is clear that without PVR legislation to protect new varieties private plant breeding will simply not grow in this country. The second need for plant variety rights legislation-in my view this shares equally in importantance with the first-stems from the desirability of Australian farmers and nurserymen being able to tap international seed breeding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a question concerning the application by a voluntary non-profit body for status under section 78 (1) (a) ( xv) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 which makes provision for the tax deductibility of gifts to the value of $2 and upwards made towards a public fund established and maintained exclusively for providing money for the acquisition, construction or maintenance of a building used or to be used as a school or a college by a government or public authority or by a society or association which is carried on otherwise than for the purposes of profit or gain to individual members of that society or association.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 21 October 1981 such an association, namely, the Australian Association for Buddhist Studies Ltd, which is a public company limited by guarantee and registered under section 11 of the Companies Act 1961 and is a non-profit organisation, made application for the status of a school building fund pursuant to that section of the Income Tax Assessment Act. It wanted to establish an educational institution and the name of the fund was to be called the Tara Institute Building Fund. I do not wish to canvass the merits of this application or to prejudice the question of whether the proposed educational institution falls within the criteria set out in that secion of the Income Tax Assessment Act. However, I wish to make the point that the first application was first made to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Victoria on 21 October 1981. In that application the Association indicated in a broad way how the Tara Institute educational organisation would function. It indicated particularly that its senior teachers had been educated in the traditional education system of Tibet in monasteries and monastic institutions. Some telephone conversation and correspondence has taken place between the Australian Association for Buddhist Studies and the Taxation Office. Letters have flowed on 13 April 1982 and as recently as 5 August 1982 providing clarification to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in relation to certain queries and matters raised by the gift assessor in relation to this application. </PARA>
<PARA> My simple point is that, without prejudicing the outcome of this matter, one would have hoped that in the 11 months since the original application by this institute for tax deductibility of its building fund some resolution of the matter might have been reached. To a certain extent it does not matter whether the answer is yes or no, though I would hope the answer will be yes. But certainly it is required so that donors may contribute to the fund with the knowledge that any substantial donation they may wish to make will attract the tax deductibility provided for in the Income Tax Assessment Act. After 11 months the need is becoming urgent for certainty in this matter so that the building program may proceed. I simply ask the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) whether he would be so kind as to follow up this matter with a view to getting a reasonably speedy answer. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to bring up one other small matter before Senator Peter Rae rises to speak. During the week I and other senators received an invitation to attend the opening by Her Majesty the Queen of the National Gallery in October. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to direct my remarks at the moment to the importance of this highlight of our social and cultural life in Australia, namely, the opening of the National Gallery. As I said, all honourable senators received an invitation. For those who are currently in the married state the invitation was addressed to the senator and wife or husband, as the case may be. In other words , it was an invitation to the senator and spouse. In the case of those eight senators who are not in the bliss of the married state at the moment, no such invitation to be accompanied by a guest, companion or partner was extended. I asked my office to make an inquiry as to why this was so. A phone call was made to the RSVP phone number on the invitation and a secretary said that she and the National Gallery were highly embarrased by the situation but had been instructed by the Government that the invitations were to go out in this manner. I should like to know who within the Government gave this direction which is so discriminatory and unfair in its impact on those senators who normally attend such functions in the company of a partner or a companion. Certainly, those who attend without a partner or companion will feel singled out in this situation. It is an important social and cultural highlight of our national life and I should like somebody to take it up, to find out who within the Government gave the direction to the National Gallery to that effect, with a view to reprimanding that person and to getting the direction reversed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I recently had occasion to write to the publication known as the Cattleman, a monthly journal published by the Cattlemen's Union of Australia which has amongst other contributors a Mr John Carter who just happened to get things about as fouled up as one could possibly get them. He made a vitriolic attack upon a Senate committee, without justification, which is factually inaccurate. He was forced, as a result of the letter which was written , to apologise rather pathetically to that Committee for having totally and absolutely misrepresented what the Committee had done. But it suited his vitriolic purpose-I refrain from going further-to misrepresent what had been stated and to apologise in a most abstruse way at the bottom of his column. All I can say is that in due course in the courts he will find that that apology was totally inadequate. The point I raise tonight is that I think there is a need to make clear that if the parliamentary system of Australia-the democratic system of Australia-is to operate we need to have a little co-operation instead of a stand-off. It does not enhance the operation of the system to hear through the media that challenges have been thrown out in some way to some parliamentary committee to do something unspecified, unknown and never requested.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been three contributions to the adjournment debate tonight. Senator Rae indicated in his contribution that there may be some legal action flowing from some of the things which were said. On that basis I do not wish to take up any of the substance of the matters, except to make the observation that he was asking for courtesy in dealings between people. I think all honourble senators would acknowledge the force and the correctness of that request. Senator Tate raised two matters. The reason I am in the chamber, of course, is that word went out that the first matter concerned a school. I think the honourable senator will recognise that although the matter possibly concerns a school, it is not a matter for the Minister of Education. It is, in fact, a matter which relates to activities of the Treasurer (Mr Howard).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator's point in relation to the Australian Association for Buddhist Studies is a perfectly proper point-that is, there is a matter before the Government requiring a decision. Eleven months have passed and no decision has emerged. The honourable senator asked that a decision be forthcoming. It is my belief that my colleague, the Treasurer, would be most anxious to have no delay in any matters of this kind requiring action from within his Department. I will undertake to place the matter before him. I hope that we can get an answer for the honourable senator. I make only one comment. One of the tests we apply in my Department in relation to certain matters concerning schools is that they should be registerable in a State. It may or may not be that that is an issue but, as I said, I will put the matter before the Treasurer and see where it takes us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The Government has attempted to investigate allegations concerning the position of lawyers in Iran raised in the first part of the honourable senator's question.</PARA>
<PARA> It has not so far been possible to obtain confirmation of all the specific allegations listed by the Centre for the Independence of Judges and Lawyers. I understand, however, that lawyers and the Bar Association in Iran have been under considerable pressure for at least the past twelve months and that the Bar Association has been evicted from its offices in Teheran.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government will continue to seek further information on developments relating to the status of lawyers in Iran and will consider what action might be appropriate in the light of whatever further information is obtained.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a)-(d) Yes. The Australian Government is aware of the allegations by the Centre for the Independence of Judges and Lawyers relating to the situation of lawyers in Turkey.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Australian Embassy in Ankara is monitoring the trial of the leaders of the Revolutionary Trade Union confederation (DISK). An official from the Embassy recently attended a session of the trial in Istanbul. While some aspects of the trial give the Government cause for concern, the trial would appear to be following properly constituted procedures.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Government has on three occasions in the Parliament this year expressed its serious concern at the human rights situation in Turkey. The Australian Embassy in Ankara has also made representations to the Turkish Government, as have officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra. These representations have stressed that human rights can only be effectively guaranteed by the restoration of civilian rule, and have also brought to the attention of the Turkish Government the concern expressed in the Australian Parliament. The Government will continue to make its views known to the Turkish Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. In 1981-82 there was a limit to the funds which could be applied to the various operations of the Australian Electoral Office and habitation review activity was reduced. No reviews were conducted in Queensland and Tasmania and percentage reviews only were conducted in New South Wales (67 per cent), Victoria (75 per cent), Western Australia (32 per cent) and South Australia (36 per cent).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. Recent State elections in the joint roll States of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania generated considerable enrolment activity and the follow- up by the relevant State Electoral Offices of non-voters at those elections assisted in the roll cleansing process. In Queensland the State Electoral Office has been conducting a roll canvass and is providing the Australian Electoral Office with the information obtained. It must also not be forgotten that whatever additional roll maintenance activities are undertaken by the Electoral Office, the final responsibility for being correctly enrolled rests with each individual elector.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. Funds have been provided in the 1982-83 budget to enable a full habitation review to be undertaken in all States and Territories this financial year.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The Department of Education endorses the need, identified in the Committee' s report, to improve access to teacher education courses by Aboriginals who are a seriously under-represented group at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme (Abstudy), administered by my Department , facilitates the access of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders to post- school education and training, including teacher education at tertiary institutions. It does so primarily by the provision of student allowances which have contributed in large measure to the increase in numbers of Aboriginal students undertaking tertiary study in recent years. In 1975 the number of Abstudy grantholders in tertiary institutions was 163. By 1980 this number had risen to 1003, a significant increase.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Department makes a contribution to a number of educational and training programs specifically designed to meet the needs of Aboriginal people, through the payment of course fees on behalf of grantholders. Some of these special course programs have provided Aboriginals with access to tertiary education and have taken the form of</PARA>
<PARA> Bridging courses which enable Aboriginals to improve their education and gain admission to normal tertiary education courses.</PARA>
<PARA> Programs which provide special counselling and tutoring services, and other support staff to assist Aboriginals in courses leading to standard qualifications. These programs may also include special arrangements regarding admission requirements and course structure.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1981-82 approximately $200,000 was allocated in this way to assist tertiary institutions mount special teacher education programs for Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The following table shows the number of Abstudy grantholders enrolled in full-time teacher education courses at tertiary institutions in the years 1975 to 1980:</PARA>

<PARA> Growth in enrolments is still limited by the relatively small number of Aboriginal students completing secondary education. However, there are signs of improvement in Aboriginal retention rates in secondary school which could provide a basis for increased enrolments in tertiary institutions in the future.</PARA>

<PARA> The Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission examined the question of a university in the Northern Territory over the longer term, and its recommendations encompassed other tertiary education matters. In particular it was necessary to resolve certain issues relating to the Darwin Community College and the North Australia Research Unit of the Australian National University before the distribution of funding for the 1982-84 triennium was determined.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department of Health Circular MB No. 239/HB No. 158 did not require that larger health benefit organisations hold reserves equivalent to two months' contribution income and smaller organisations to hold reserves equivalent to four months' contribution income. The Circular recognised that some organisations could have inadequate reserves and advised that in the circumstances of the industry, it would not seem generally practicable to achieve in those cases a rapid build-up of reserves. Accordingly, organisations were advised that there would be no objection to their incorporating components in proposed contribution rates to achieve a build-up over time. For larger organisations, reserves equivalent to two months' contribution income would be acceptable and for smaller organisations the target would be equivalent to four months' contribution income.</PARA>
<PARA> Since its inception, Medibank Private has achieved a level of reserves in accordance with the above-mentioned guidelines in the State of Victoria only. A review of the operations of Medibank Private was recently undertaken by an interdepartmental committee, which, among other things, commented on the reserves position of Medibank Private.

<PARA> I do not recall any contact with the Australian Chemical Industry Council (ACIC ). However, my Department does have contact with ACIC. Several past and present members of National Health and Medical Research Council (NH and MRC) committees in the occupational health and industry liaison areas are, or have been, members also of ACIC. The NH and MRC is a body under my control and the secretariats for its committees are provided by my Department. The NH and MRC committees usually meet at least twice yearly, and considerable interchange of information has therefore occurred between the two Councils.</PARA>
<PARA> ACIC provides representatives at meetings of various committees of the Standards Association of Australia (SAA) at which may be officers representing my Department. ACIC once approached my Department concerning the use of Departmental computing facilities for information on hazardous chemicals. Otherwise contact has been limited, with ACIC seeking emergency information for enquiries to the National Poisons Information Service. My Department has also approached ACIC for assistance in contacting manufacturers who may handle a particular chemical or class of chemical.</PARA>

<PARA> (5) Asian Games Federation. The national Olympic Association of the concerned host country is the official body for all matters relating to Asian Games in its own country. The President of the Indian Olympic Authority is thus the President of the Asian Games Federation in India. In addition, each host country establishes its own Organising Committee to oversee arrangements of the Games. For ASIAD '82, India has set up a special Organising Committee for the purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) and (7) According to information available, the Asian Games Federation does not have a permanent headquarters. The venue for the succeeding Games is decided upon during the preceding Games by the participating countries. The Special Organising Committee for ASIAD '82 is headed by Sardar Buta Singh, Minister of State for Shipping and Transport, assisted by K. T. Satarawala, Vice Chairman and Coordinator for ASIAD '82, and Mr K. Sankaran Nair, Secretary-General, ASIAD '82. The Special Organising Committee for ASIAD '82 is located at 1, Pragati Maidan, New Delhi. In turn, the SOC has established a steering committee headed by the Union Minister for Education and Culture, Mr S. B. Chavan, to implement SOC decisions.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The Host Government is responsible for funding the Games. With arrangements for succeeding Games being decided upon during the preceding Games and as the Asian Games Federation, as such, does not have a permanent address, there would not appear to be any financial support between each Asian Games.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect to questions 9-14, the Department of Home Affairs and Environment has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> (9) to (14) To our knowledge, the Australian Government has never received an invitation to compete in any of the Asian Games that have been conducted since the inception of the Games in 1951.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Olympic Federation (which is responsible for the organisation of Australian Olympic teams) has approached the Asian Games organisers at past International Olympic Committee (IOC) meetings on behalf of one or two of its member sports, on the possibility of these Australian sports competing in the Asian Games. On each occasion, the AOF has received a negative response as the organisers do not regard Australia as being part of the Asian region. (The IOC regards Australia as being part of the Oceania region.)</PARA>
<PARA> Based on this advice, it would appear unlikely that any Australian sporting teams would be permitted or invited to compete in future Asian Games.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator Durack</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 March 1982 (Hansard, page 1159) Senator Macklin asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Science and Technology, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Can the Minister representing the Minister for Science and Technology inform the Senate whether the Government has cut from $50m to $33.3m the funding to more than 120 Australian companies for industrial research and development?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Can the Minister inform the Senate of the types of projects which will be affected by the funding cuts?</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Can the Minister confirm that such technology will have to be imported and paid for by Australian exports if technology is not developed in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA> During a reply which I gave to a similar question which I received from Senator Townley on 25 March 1981, I drew Senator Macklin's attention to a very detailed answer and explanation given in relation to this matter by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle on 24 March 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and Technology has provided the following additional answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) A full reply to this question was provided by the Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, in her reply to a question from Senator Watson . The reply appears at page 1095 of the Hansard of 24 March 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I am unable to provide specific details concerning industrial research and development projects for which companies are seeking grants as this information is confidential to those companies and is covered by the secrecy provisions of the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act 1976. However, the projects referred to by the honourable senator would relate to products and processess extending across a broad spectrum of manufacturing, mining and construction industries.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is no simple substitutional relationship between Government supported industrial research and development and the procurement of technology from overseas, particularly as market forces provide a strong inducement to companies in Australia to keep abreast of developments in technology occuring overseas and to adapt that technology, as necessary, to local production circumstances. However, I would point out that it is the long term effect which must be considered in this situation. The limitation on further commitment to project grants to which the honourable senator refers is essentially a current situation relative to the operations of the IR&amp;D Incentives Scheme this financial year. The Incentives Act was amended in June 1981 and the Government then reaffirmed its commitment to providing this form of encouragement to industry by extending the life of the Act for a further five years. As pointed out by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle in her earlier reply to Senator Watson, funding levels will be determined in the 1982-83 Budget context in the light of the Government's decisions on the Industries Assistance Commission's report on certain budgetary assistances to industry and the Government's obligation to provide funding under existing agreements.</PARA>

<PARA> In his reply Senator Chaney, who represents the Minister for Industry and Commerce, acknowledged that Government senators had not opposed the proposal. This matter is now the responsibility of the Minister for Defence Support. The Minister has provided the following further information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Select Committee presented its report to Parliament on the future of the Ordnance Factory, Bendigo on 9 March 1982. A proposal to lease the factory was subsequently examined but the Government considered it did not meet its requirements or its commitment to the people of Bendigo.

<PARA> Is it a fact that there has been and still is a waiting period of six months for people applying for Australian citizenship? Is the bulk of this delay-that is, four months-due to the time taken by the police doing security checks of applicants? If so, will the Government take the action necessary to shorten this inordinate delay which has caused and is causing problems for the applicants?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The current average national processing time between date of receipt of an application for Australian citizenship until date of decision (approval or refusal) is 22 weeks. On average a further six weeks elapses for conferral of citizenship at a Departmental ceremony. Public ceremonies are conducted by local government authorities and the waiting period for these ceremonies varies considerably according to the size of the municipality and number of conferrals undertaken by the particular authority.</PARA>
<PARA> Several initiatives have been taken to reduce bottlenecks and to streamline processing procedures generally. These include a joint review of citizenship procedures conducted by the Public Service Board and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The recommendations of that review are currently under consideration. The time taken for completion of penal checks by the Australian Federal Police has been significantly reduced and the average turnaround period for these checks is currently three weeks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 April 1982 (Hansard, page 1574), Senator Kilgariff asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs a question without notice on the current situation in regard to the reunification of Timorese families in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since this matter falls within the portfolio of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, he has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In addition to normal migrant entry (including family reunion provisions), successive arrangements providing for re- laxed migrant entry of East Timorese into Australia have been made since 1975. Of these, the East Timor Special Humanitarian program (SHP) and the special family reunion list program are still current.</PARA>
<PARA> The SHP provides for those East Timorese whose lives were disrupted by the events of 1975 and who are living temporarily outside East Timor on 30 September 1980 and experiencing settlement difficulties to be reunited with their relatives in Australia; to date 1,800 people have arrived in Australia or have been approved for entry under this arrangment. Another 800 persons currently in Portugal may qualify under this program.</PARA>
<PARA> The family reunion list program resulted in 359 people arriving in Australia by the end of June 1982 but progress has been slow.</PARA>
<PARA> Recently, through the involvement of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), progress is being achieved. The Indonesian Government has agreed to resumption of processing of remaining persons on the list by this international agency as a humanitarian gesture. The ICRC is tracing the remaining list members, identifying those who wish to travel to Australia, assisting in the processing of movement to Australia, and obtaining the necessary exit permits.</PARA>
<PARA> The first group of 10 persons processed under these new arrangements arrived in Australia on 9 July 1982 and were reunited with their families.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government hopes that with the co-operation of the ICRC and the Indonesian authorities the program can be finalised as quickly as possible.</PARA>

<PARA> I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether Australian support for the British attempt to regain possession of the Falkland Islands was conditional on the observance of a declared 200-mile zone around the Falkland Islands area. I ask, in search of information I might say by way of explanation: Was the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano within that 200-mile limit at the time it was sunk? Secondly, was it in fact positioned between the 200-mile zone or the perimeter of that zone and the Argentine coast? Thirdly, has the Government any information on whether there is truth in the allegation, and indeed the boast, by some representatives of the British government that the United Kingdom forces had been seeking to entice the General Belgrano into the 200-mile zone for several days but that the vessel had failed to succumb to those enticements at the time it was sunk?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Australian support for Britain in the Falkland Islands dispute was not conditional on observance of a declared 200-mile zone around the Falklands.</PARA>
<PARA> The exact position of the Argentine vessel, the General Belrano, at the time it was sunk is a matter of dispute between Britain and Argentina.</PARA>
<PARA> The British Government has stated that the General Belgrano was posing a direct threat to the British task force and that the action taken against the General Belgrano was fully consistent with the duty of the British task force to defend its ships and men.</PARA>
<PARA> So far as allegations that representatives of the British Government had said that United Kingdom forces had been seeking to entice the General Belgrano into the 200-mile zone are concerned I have not previously heard of these, nor have I information bearing on the truth of this matter.</PARA>

I specifically asked whether the Government would intercede and use its good offices with the United States of America to make representations to both sides on this question?

For example, the matter was discussed with Vice President Bush during his visit to Australia and again during the Prime Minister's visit to Washington on 17 May. The Prime Minister said after these discussions that there was no divergence of views between Australia and the United States over the Falklands. The Government supported the mediation efforts of Secretary of State Haig.

<PARA> I preface my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services by saying that no doubt he will remember the statement made by Mr Newman during the last week that some politicians in this country are associated with criminal activities. As this statement places all politicians under a cloud-I believe this is something Senator Jessop mentioned recently, and I and many other politicians do not appreciate it one little bit- will the Minister advise the Senate of the names of those politicians thought to be so associated? If not, can he say whether the Minister meant State politicians or Federal politicians?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> It would seem to be an important aspect of organised crime, based on overseas experience, that to ensure its survival and growth, organised crime elements seek to infiltrate or influence legitimate business and public activities.</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Alfred McCoy, lecturer at the University of New South Wales, referred, in his book Drug Traffic-Narcotics and Organised Crime in Australia, to a number of disturbing instances of close relationships between organised crime figures and influential politicians in recent decades.</PARA>
<PARA> To effectively tackle the problems posed by organised crime, the possibility- however unlikely it may seem-of infiltration or corruption needs to be recognised and faced up to.</PARA>
<PARA> It cannot be assumed that a certain group is necessarily beyond infiltration or corruption. In this regard, the steadfast denial that it could not happen to a particular group in the community, be they businessmen, politicians or others , may be a costly delusion resulting in an incomplete, and perhaps therefore ineffectual, strategy for tackling organised crime.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Government has recently announced its decision on the future of export incentives. I refer the honourable senator to my media release of 19 July 1982 in which I set out the details. Legislation to give effect to the changes will be introduced shortly.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government has acted consistently to provide the sound and stable economic climate essential for the development of efficient export oriented industries.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is also committed to provide direct help to exporters. The trade promotion budget for 1981-82 was over $6m. Some 1,000 Australian firms participated in overseas trade fairs, displays and exhibitions, and my Department organised and funded several overseas and inwards trade missions. A trade promotion program of similar magnitude has been approved for the current financial year. The export finance facility of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation assists the sale of Australian capital goods and related services. Australian firms continue to use the services of Australian trade commissioners in some 54 locations overseas. These efforts are bearing fruit in markets for Australian exporters and they will continue. Less visible but of equal importance are the Government's efforts to seek to achieve improvements in the international trading environment which Australian exporters must face. Consultations and negotiations by ministers and officials are undertaken continuously with our trading partners to safeguard our interests and to gain further benefits for our exporters.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 August 1982 (Hansard, page 103) Senator Macklin asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry in the Senate. His question concerned the increase in the disease eradication component of the livestock slaughter levy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied me with the following additional information:</PARA>
<PARA> For a number of years the cattle industry has been meeting 70 per cent of the operating costs of the eradication campaign. In 1975 and again in 1982 the campaign was the subject of Industries Assistance Commission reports which confirmed that the major beneficiary of the campaign was the cattle industry and that the industry should meet the major costs. Where there have been shortfalls in the funds provided for the campaign by the industry the Commonwealth Government has met these by making loan advances. At 30 June 1982 the total of these advances plus interest amounted to $23.5m.</PARA>
<PARA> Recognising the current financial difficulties faced by the industry the Government has agreed to write-off this substantial amount thus relieving the industry of a considerable burden.</PARA>
<PARA> The funds raised through the previous $3 per head levy have not kept pace with the actual operating costs of the campaign and this has been exacerbated by the reduction in the number of animals coming forward for slaughter in recent months. To meet the costs of the campaign and to prevent a similar large debt in the future of Government has decided it is necessary to increase the levy from $3 to $4 per head.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government recognises that there are particular problems facing marginal pastoral properties especially in the northern areas of Australia. In order to develop a specific program for these areas and to accelerate, if possible, the current programs, the Government supported the setting up by the Australian Agricultural Council of two special groups. These are charged with the urgent task of preparing a comprehensive national and operational administrative plan, including funding requirements for finally eradicating brucellosis and tuberculosis. The groups will give particular attention to the special problems of northern Australia and will recommend what further funding may be necessary to achieve success for the campaign and how any additional funding may be met.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also agreed to lift its share of the net compensation payable for animals slaughtered for tuberculosis to 75 per cent from the end of the present arrangements bringing it into line with brucellosis provisions.</PARA>
<PARA> The increase in the disease eradication component of the livestock slaughter levy is not seen as a deterrent to the continued participation in the eradication scheme by marginal pastoral properties. The groups developing the future national eradication plan will be studying the situation of those properties experiencing special financial and managemental difficulties in following an individual property eradication plan and will be making recommendations on what, if any, additional assistance such properties may require.</PARA>
<PARA> Because it will be the major beneficiary from the eradication of these diseases the Government believes that the cattle industry should continue to fund a substantial share of the operational costs. However, the Government will study closely the recommendations coming forward from the National BTEC Planning Group to ensure the ultimate success of the campaign.</PARA>

<PARA> I have received the following information about the question from the Minister for Science and Technology:</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised by the Minister for Science and Technology that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has ended its cloud seeding research program. A statement to this effect was made on 28 October 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO will maintain expertise in cloud physics and provide advice to State authorities and other people using the cloud seeding technique for drought relief and other purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision is based on scientific evidence and increasing costs.</PARA>
<PARA> In August 1979 the CSIRO Division of Cloud Physics commenced a five year cloud seeding experiment to be conducted in western Victoria, in collaboration with the Victorian Department of Agriculture, subject to a review to be carried out at the end of the second year of the project.</PARA>
<PARA> The experiment aimed to increase the rainfall in the Warracknabeal area by seeding suitable clouds with silver iodide smoke spread from aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> However, meteorological data obtained during the two seasons of the experiment indicated that the number of opportunities for cloud seeding was far less than previously anticipated, and that no statistically significant result could be obtained during the remaining three years of the experiment.</PARA>
<PARA> The paucity of genuine seeding opportunities, combined with the fact that the cost of hiring light aircraft is increasing at a much faster rate than the price of wheat, made it evident that economic benefit to Australian agriculture would be unlikely to result from the experiment.</PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO and the Victorian Department of Agriculture therefore agreed to terminate the experiment.</PARA>
