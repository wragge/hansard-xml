<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I refer the Minister to the fact that 1,386 cases of discrimination have been dealt with by Mr Al Grassby, the Commissioner for Community Relations, in just over a year and that all of these cases have been dealt with by persuasion and negotiation. I ask: Is the Minister aware of the disquiet in the community at the reports that the appointment of Mr Grassby will not be renewed when it expires at the end of this month? Is he aware also that over 200 letters have recently been sent to the Prime Minister from South Australia alone, calling for the extension of Mr Grassby's term because of his experience, knowledge and talent in this area? In view of the excellent record of Mr Grassby, will the Government now renew his term?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. Recent adverse media publicity has prompted the Australian Fisheries Council to agree that legislation should be urgently enacted to ensure that prosecutions for misrepresentation are possible in all States.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1929" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A meeting of the Australian Fisheries Council was held in Hobart within the last week or so. At that meeting Ministers endorsed recommendations that legislation be enacted to ensure that prosecutions for misrepresentation of fish are possible and, secondly, that legal status be given to a list of marketing names for fish. A draft list has been drawn up by the Australian Fishing Industry Council and will be finalised after comments are received from industry and government. I suspect that quite a lot of consumers will be pleased to hear about that, including the habitues of fish and chip shops, of whom I am one. Most of the legislation concerning the proper naming of fish is, unfortunately, not our responsibility, so we are not able directly to ensure that fish are correctly named. It is the responsibility of State and Territory authorities. But the Commonwealth has some legislative responsibility in the area. In particular, we are responsible for the naming of fish through the Customs Act, the Trade Practices Act and the Pure Foods Act of the Department of the Capital Territory. So the Minister for Primary Industry, following that Fisheries Council meeting, is writing to the relevant Commonwealth Ministers, drawing their attention to the recommendations and urging that they be given practical effect at the Commonwealth level, and no doubt that will be done.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. Is it a fact, as appears to be the case in South Australia at least, that Commonwealth Employment Service offices are not permitted to display or hand out pamphlets, information or posters from other government departments which outline the assistance available to unemployed people? Is it a fact, for example, that no Department of Social Security pamphlets or Department of Education information can be made available at CES offices and that the best that can be done is for officers there orally to suggest possible forms of assistance or other ways in which an unemployed person could better his or her chances of employment?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1930" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations would have to give some of the detailed information sought, but I am aware that the CES has over recent times tried to concentrate its attention on its primary function, which is facilitating entry to the work force. The administrative rearrangements which took place last year and which transferred to the Department of Social Security a good deal of the administrative responsibility for unemployment benefit and the various administrative requirements that relate to its payment were made with a view to trying to ensure that the CES could concentrate on its primary role. Of course, the CES tends to point to the number of job placements, both for employees generally and for special categories such as the disabled, as the true measure of its success and so on. I mention that because, if there is some restriction placed on the range of material available in CES offices, it would be, I am sure, on the basis that the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations would not wish to see too much distraction from that primary role of those offices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am particularly conscious of the difficulty of information overload that can occur partly in the context of the sorts of requests which have been made to me over the last week by Senator Grimes on public radio and by the various Housing Ministers around Australia that the Government do more to advertise the benefits which are available to people in the sorts of programs mentioned by Senator Haines in her question and the programs which are administered by my Department and the Taxation Office to facilitate home ownership, to prevent hardship, to get people into employment and training and so on. I will refer the question for a more concise and precise reply from the Minister. But I make the point, in response to Senator Haines, that there is a very real difficulty for both departments and the Government in ensuring that the range of useful information which can be of benefit to citizens is made available. That is a matter which is certainly currently receiving my attention and the attention of other relevant Ministers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Health. I raise once again the matter of the labelling of foodstuffs, which is something I have raised here before and in which I believe a large percentage of the population has an interest. My question is prompted by an article in yesterday's Daily Telegraph-something that might have prompted Senator Missen's question of yesterday relating to sugar. That article states that a report is to be released next week that criticises the product labelling laws of Australia. The laws allow manufacturers to deceive us about the product contents. Will the Minister once again ask the National Health and Medical Research Council to expedite the requirement to label products and show particularly the amount of sugar and salt in a product? If the Council cannot influence the States to speed up their action, perhaps the Minister for Health should make labelling compulsory in the Australian Capital Territory because I think that would force manufacturers to take some action. If they have nothing to hide, why do they not do that?</PARA></TALK.START>

Can they expect government funding of 2 1/2 per cent towards the cost of the scheme?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been some problems with superannuation arrangements in higher education institutions in Australia, as a result of which the institutions have opened up discussions with the Government to see whether we would endorse and help them introduce a new scheme-the superannuation scheme for Australian universities-which might be better based in actuarial terms and which might meet their needs better. A fair amount of negotiation has been necessary to get that scheme worked out, particularly as to some of the more detailed parts. What is emerging is a proposal that there should be a scheme with the employers putting in 14 per cent of salary and the academics or those entering the scheme putting in 7 per cent of salary. A number of the details at the margin were, until recently, still under negotiation. I advise Senator McIntosh that I have this week been in contact orally with the Chairman of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, Professor Caro. We may not be able to get all the details finally worked out. Rather than hold the scheme up, it has been suggested to Professor Caro that the Committee might be able to amend the proposal slightly for the moment and get the scheme into operation. The remaining item or two that require further negotiation and consideration by government could be set aside for further discussion later. Like Senator McIntosh, we want to see the scheme in operation . The Government has made an appropriate allowance of a small amount of money that will be required to help the universities should the scheme start. We have allowed money for 1983 and 1984 for this purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see in the newspaper a reported comment of the Prime Minister with regard to the possibility of a further referendum to bring the two Houses into line in the event of a double dissolution. It is true that this proposition has been put to the people of Australia on several occasions. My recollection is that it was very narrowly defeated last time. I think a very substantial majority of Australians were in support of it. I would be interested to look at alternative constitutional proposals. I would be very happy to have information that Senator Martin may have. Perhaps she will discuss it with me. I would be very happy to bring that material to the attention of the Prime Minister. I think nobody in Australia wants to have a situation in which separate Senate elections are held as we had during the 1960s, which gave a continuity of elections to the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>

Since the Government has proposed that increases to members of parliament be kept strictly within a 7 per cent limit, does the Minister consider that any increase over 7 per cent to the rest of the public sector is justified in the present economic climate?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hamer has asked me a series of questions relating to Public Service remuneration. The question is perhaps even broader than it sounded because, of course, the expression 'public servants' covers a fair variety of employees. The clerical, administrative, keyboard and related groups received pay increases in the range of 5.8 per cent and 6.6 per cent awarded by a Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission with effect from the first pay period on or after 2 August 1982. That is one group of public servants . Another group, the physical and technical grades, received increases endorsed by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission of the order of $25 a week plus $ 14 a week mid-term adjustment for tradesmen with different proportionate increases applying to other classifications. They were to take effect from 8 April and 3 June for the different categories. Those changes reflected variations in the metal and building industries outside the Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Pay rises of between 6.5 per cent and 7 per cent from 23 September 1982 are awaiting endorsement by the Public Service Arbitrator for those professional groups of public servants; that is, legal officers, engineers, scientists and so on. Statutory office holders received a 7 per cent increase with effect from 1 July 1982. So, overall, the percentage pay rise for the mass of the Public Service this year is somewhere around 6 per cent to 7 per cent. In no case is there to be further consideration of increases this year. But the clerical officers have already lodged an application for a further increase to take effect from next February, which is the expiration of the six months during which it was said that no further increases would apply. That claim is in hand and has yet to be dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as any question of the power of the Commonwealth is concerned, it will be well known to honourable senators that the Commonwealth has consistently, before the various wage-fixing tribunals to which it has access, asserted that there should be wage moderation. We had a fair amount of discussion in the Senate yesterday on the reasoning behind that. It is certainly the belief of the Government that in a time of some economic difficulty an expansion of the incomes of currently employed people can be only at the expense of those who are not in employment and indeed of those who will lose employment. What is likely to be granted is a matter for arbitration if no agreement can be reached. But it should be pointed out that the Commonwealth cannot insulate itself and its employees from the general Australian scene. The Commonwealth has tried to be consistent in its approach to wages across the board. It would not seek to impose a harshness of rule upon its employees that was not imposed upon the community generally. I emphasise that the wage restraint which we have urged before arbitral tribunals considering the wage rises of public servants is based on the same arguments that we have advanced with respect to broader or other areas of wages. I also wish to stress that the Government understands the need to be fair to its employees but it consistently believes that wage restraint is a very important element of economic policy in Australia in 1982.</PARA>

We have established rules for safeguards and those rules are the most stringent in the world. We are active members of the International Atomic Energy Agency and we maintain our own safeguards provisions very strongly indeed. We will uphold the nuclear non-proliferation situation. We are strongly against the proliferation of nuclear weapons. We are opposed to the testing of nuclear weapons. We have taken that stand in relation to Mururoa and elsewhere. In any commercial undertaking that was involved in uranium we would apply all those principles, irrespective of the nation involved.

I have made the point that the only government that can take action to maintain a register of foreign ownership of land and keep it up to date is a State government. The Commonwealth, through its Foreign Investment Review Board, can as a primary matter look to the directionalism of capital when it flows into Australia and could take certain steps if it felt that the direction of that money was against Australian interests in terms of ownership, but it could not follow that through after a series of secondary uses of that money. The conveyancing of land and its title to ownership is entirely a State matter. Therefore, it is a matter for each of the States to look at the ownership of resources in those States.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I outlined in the Senate yesterday, because of the ruling that section 108 of the Social Services Act requires a person to have lost income because of sickness before qualifying for sickness benefit, the present position is that in cases where a person was not in receipt of income and had therefore not lost income because of illness, sickness benefit cannot be paid. That is a legal matter. In the past there has been a differing view of that section but it seems quite clear that that is what the law requires. To ensure that this does not give rise to hardship, pending examination of whether there should be any change to section 108, as I indicated to the Senate yesterday, special benefit will be paid to people in those circumstances under terms which are more generous than those usually applying to special benefit. In particular, a test will not be applied on the basis of available cash resources. Normally special benefit is not available to people who have money in the bank or in some other form which is available for their maintenance. Instead the payment of special benefit in those circumstances would be subject to an income test only. The amount of special benefit payable, which would be the same as the amount of sickness benefit, would be reduced for any other personal income the person might have. The reason for that is that in fact it is a more generous provision than is usually applied. It is applied because of the history of the availability of sickness benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the purchase of medication, any person on a low income is entitled to obtain health card cover and any person who is entitled to benefit under these circumstances undoubtedly would be eligible for health card cover. That position should be covered for any person who is in the circumstances raised by the honourable senator. The question of the availability of benefit generally is one on which I think there could be some differences of opinion. If people were not in receipt of income-for example, if they were housewives, students, or something similar-and fell sick their financial position really would be little different from the position they were previously in. If they have available to them cash resources some might argue that the taxpayer ought not be called upon in those circumstances.</PARA>

Is the Minister aware of results of a survey of caravan parks that show that in Queensland alone it is estimated that in excess of 75 per cent of caravan parks are using distillate as a method of water heating? Does the Minister agree that the removal of exemptions from this tax may lead to serious cost increases in an industry which, even though providing the lowest cost forms of accommodation, must still work to restrain costs to compete?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that various industries which have not received the exemption from the diesel fuel excise feel that they are hindered by that and regard that as a disadvantage. I am really indebted to a number of government senators and, in particular, to Senator Collard who, in the debate on this measure in the Senate on Tuesday, pointed out that this is a revenue raising measure and as such the impost does have to fall somewhere. It is unfortunately true that the wider the exemptions one provides for any form of taxation, but certainly excise, by definition the more heavily it has to fall on the remainder of the community to raise any given amount of revenue. One could go on, as indeed the debate in the Senate on Tuesday indicated, endlessly suggesting further exemptions. But if one is to raise the revenue which is sought it is necessary to impose taxes to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The tourist industry is one that has received considerable attention from the Government over recent years. I think the industry has grown very steadily. It has been assisted greatly by the fact that it, of all industries, I think, was first given assistance in terms of depreciation of buildings. That significant encouragement to the industry was certainly widely welcomed. If we look at the figures for building in the tourist industry it is clear that it certainly was beneficial.</PARA>
<PARA> The particular section of the tourist industry to which Senator Bjelke-Petersen refers, the caravan parks, is of course a section of the industry which will benefit from the Government's move to improve the national road network and indeed, not least in her State of Queensland, I think there will be significant advantages if there is a significant upgrading of the national roads as will now occur under the Government's program.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to the final part of Senator Bjelke-Petersen's question, whilst it could never be said that laws cannot be changed and so the possibility of the widening of the exemption is present as a possibility, I would not hold out a great deal of hope for that. I would rather direct the attention of the honourable senator and through her direct the attention of her constituents to other steps which the Government has taken to try to ensure that the tourist industry is able to advance and prosper in Australia. I believe that in general under the recently retired Minister, Sir Phillip Lynch, the industry has received close and favourable attention.

Indeed, the Fraser Government's aim is to play such a role in every avenue in which it can, because it is implacably opposed to world armament, to nuclear armament and to any insensate move towards war. It plays an active role in the United Nations and all its agencies. It has taken a very active part in moves for multilateral nuclear disarmament. That is the primary key to the situation. Wherever there is such a cause, people will find the Australian Government putting its arguments with force.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Commerce, concerns the problems of the Australian steel industry and the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd. Is it not a fact that BHP helped Pohang Steel in Korea to set up its current modern plant which has, in effect, made Australian steel uncompetitive, so that we can conclude that BHP has the necessary expertise as to the nature of a plant which would be necessary to become competitive again? Has BHP acknowledged publicly or to the Government that the future of the Australian steel industry lies with the modernisation of its plant to at least the same standard as Pohang Steel? Finally, has BHP acknowledged publicly or to the Government that it will take advantage of the generous accelerated plant depreciation allowances in the current Budget which were tailored to allow modernisation of major industries such as the Australian steel industry?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my understanding-I confirm that it is no more than an under - standing-that the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd was involved in the establishment of that Korean plant. I have little doubt that BHP does have a very high level of technical expertise and the technical expertise to run a modern steel industry. Indeed, it is, running a very substantial steel industry on any world standards. Again, I have heard no argument which would suggest that Senator Lewis is wrong when he puts forward the view that the future lies in modernisation of plant. I have seen no acknowledgment by BHP of the value of the recent alterations to the depreciation provisions. I am not saying that BHP has not given any public indication, but I am not familiar with any. It is certainly true that the Government, in altering the approach to depreciation, has endeavoured to provide Australian industry with a clearly understandable and workable system of depreciation which will encourage the sort of capital investment which is essential if we are to have modern industries in Australia. So I will ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to consider the series of questions raised by Senator Lewis. I would also wish to say that I think that many of the points he made are semi-axiomatic and a further reply from the Minister may not be necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

They show that there are 7,000 new companies and that in one year there has been an actual increase of 6.5 per cent in the total number of companies. The identification and naming of each of the new companies that have come to South Australia over the past three years would require the commitment of very substantial resources indeed. However, I have obtained from South Australia's Department of Trade and Industry a list comprising 84 major manufacturing projects, with total project costs amounting to more than $250m, which have been completed in South Australia since October 1979. In a moment I will seek the incorporation of details of those 84 major projects. I repeat, they represent projects that have been completed. Of course , they do not take into account the very substantial developments that are now taking place. They do not take into account the developments associated with the Stony Point-Cooper Basin pipeline or the foreshadowed refinery. They do not take into account the moves to establish Roxby Downs and other mineral interests. Therefore, taken together, they more than confirm the evidence that the Tonkin Government has achieved the attracting of very substantial industry to South Australia. I repeat, the details cover only two of the three years involved. I seek leave to have the list incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday Senator Lewis asked me a question with regard to certain statements by one Colonel Langtry in connection with the defence industrial structure in Australia and drew attention to certain deficiencies. I now have a reply for Senator Lewis. There are a great many types of aluminium and steel alloys used in defence equipment. Australia manufactures only those for which sufficient demand exists to enable them to be produced with reasonable economy. Some quite sophisticated alloys are in fact produced, including electroslag refined steel used, for example, in making gearboxes. We do not produce special alloys used in small quantities, for obvious economic reasons, but this is not to say that the capacity to do so does not exist if the need arises. The Department of Defence Support is conscious of the need to assist industry in respect of special defence needs. Typically, a project to develop high strength HY80 steel used in warship and submarine hulls is currently in progress.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A similar answer applies to composite materials and petrochemical products. In peacetime we manufacture those products which are reasonably economic but the basic capabilities exist to develop and produce a wider range of products if economy becomes subservient to special exigencies. Australia does not presently make a very wide range of general purpose machine tools for the same economic reasons as have been outlined. Nonetheless, there are more than 90 companies which presently receive the machine tool bounty. Several companies are producing complex machining centres with computer control. Many more companies currently engaged in other work could produce machine tools given the need. A review of the defence mobilisation of Australian industry along World War II lines has not been carried out in recent times because it would not be a very meaningful exercise except in very specific areas. Our current defence industry policy concentrates on achieving a balance between the possible need for reliable overseas supply lines, the stockpiling of spares and critical items and the selective development of specific capabilities in industry. Our needs in this direction are kept under constant review by the Department and also by the Defence Industry Committee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a personal explanation concerning statements yesterday made about me by Senator Jones. I would have preferred the opportunity to make a personal explanation yesterday but I was not in the chamber when Senator Jones made his comments and, of course , I had no knowledge that he was about to launch an attack on me. It seemed to me more appropriate that, rather than use hearsay evidence of comments made yesterday, I should wait until this morning to have the opportunity to read Hansard and to know exactly what he said. In effect, he accused me of lying and I regard that as a very serious attack on my reputation. I was not forewarned of it in any way. I heard as secondhand evidence that I had been virtually called a liar in this place by Senator Jones. He knows that I am making a personal explanation this morning because I sent him a note to inform him that I intended to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter under discussion relates to funds spent by the Federal Government on sport in this country. The Australian of 6 October, referring to Senator Jones, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> He also discovered that if you want to be a sports star in this country the first step should be to move to Canberra where nearly half of the federal sports funds are spent. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the fact is that nearly half of those funds are spent on the Australian Institute of Sport which is a national facility located in Canberra, which is, of course, the appropriate place for it to be located. Those funds are not spent on Canberra. About $7m of those funds was spent this year on the swimming and tennis complex; in other words, on capital developments; and $4m on the Institute itself. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that there are a few Canberra students on scholarships at the Institute, but most students come from the States. It is totally misleading of Senator Jones to suggest that to move to Canberra is the way to get into the Australian Institute of Sport. If students want to get into the Institute of Sport-young sportsmen and women in this country should know this and not allow themselves to be misled in this way-they have to become proficient and show expertise and potential in their state. It is from their State that they apply for a scholarship to the Institute. Moving to Canberra will not assist them to get in unless they have those qualities and they apply in their State. It is best for young people to know the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the sort of Canberra bashing that this implies is something that we have become accustomed to from the Australian Labor Party. I am sure that everyone in Canberra remembers that the 'fat cats' comment was started by a colleague of Senator Jones, Mr Clyde Cameron. That was made some years ago but we have long memories and we know exactly what the Australian Labor Party had in mind at that time. </PARA>

What she should do is go back to Hansard and read the report so that she is well aware of the facts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a personal explanation regarding some remarks made after the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory brought down a report in this place last Thursday on retail trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory. The report consisted of three major sections. One was a large section, being the main report of the Committee, then there was a dissenting report which was supported by Mrs Kelly, Mr Fry and myself, and a further dissenting report which was submitted by Senator Georges. Last Thursday evening, I happened to be listening to the Australian Broadcasting Commission local radio news which went on air at about 10 minutes past 7. I heard some disparaging comments about those who submitted the dissenting report. I have not been able to obtain a transcript of that program. The Parliamentary Library does not record that program and I was not able to obtain a transcript from the ABC. However, I did obtain a transcript of the ABC television news of that evening. The Parliamentary Library does tape that program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to quote from some parts of the transcript. The program went on air at 6 .55 p.m. A person called Ron Miller, among other things, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recommended that all Canberra stores be allowed to stay open six days a week, but that only small shops be allowed to stay open on Sundays, still a long way from total deregulation, but some of the members of the Committee aren't happy with the decision. So much so that today Labor Senator, George Georges, and a group led by the Labor Member for Fraser, Mr Fry, each put in separate dissenting reports. The Chairman of the Committee, Senator Margaret Reid, says it's the Labor Party simply supporting trade union opposition to deregulation. Mr Fry says this is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement that the Labor Party was simply supporting trade union opposition to deregulation is nonsense. Not only is it nonsense but also is it a reflection on the integrity of the Committee members concerned who put in this dissenting report. Anybody who read the report would see that we agreed with the points of view which were put forward by the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association. Not only did we support the Association's views but also we put forward other views which supported our dissenting report. It will be seen that we made reference to the fact that the evidence did not establish any demand for changing the present ordinance. It will be seen that we pointed out the amount of opposition to deregulation. The opposition was overwhelming. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The first item on the paper that you, Mr President, have presented relating to outstanding Government responses to parliamentary committee reports is a report by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs on the constitutional qualifications of members of parliament. It was presented to the Senate on 2 June 1981. The Committee's inquiry arose principally but not entirely because of a private member's Bill that I had presented to the Senate- the Constitutional Alteration (Holders of Offices of Profit) Bill 1981. Originally this Bill was presented on 15 November 1978 but after the new Parliament met, following the 1980 election, the Bill was again presented to the Parliament. Recommendation No. 10 of the Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill entitled the Constitutional Alteration (Holders of Offices of Profit) Bill 1981 should not proceed . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, amongst other things the Committee recommended that the Bill I had presented originally in 1978 and then later in 1981 should not proceed. I was quite content with that recommendation even though I have left that Bill on the Notice Paper. I was content because recommendation No. 11 suggested that section 44 (iv) of the Constitution should be altered in a particular way. Basically, the intent of my original Bill had been to allow public servants to be candidates both for the Senate and the House of Representatives without first being forced to resign from their Public Service positions. Recommendation No. 11 which the Committee brought down certainly goes further than my original Bill but it encompasses the intent of my original Bill. That is why I was quite content when the Committee said that the Bill should not proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage, I indicate to the Government that it is well over 12 months since this report was brought down-it is something like 15 months or even longer . It seems to me timely that we should receive a response from the Government so that, for a start, I could be aware of whether I should proceed with my original Bill, whether the Government is going to proceed with any of the recommendations that the Committee brought down or whether the Government is going to suggest that if the recommendations of the Committee are going to be pursued then it is up to a private member to bring down a further private member's Bill. At this stage I ask the Government to respond to this Bill as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter now before the Senate deals with the paper which Mr President has put down. I should like to comment on it briefly. I do not think we should let it pass without comment. I was the Chairman, of course, of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which presented the report to which Senator Colston referred. I am very concerned that the Government has not responded to that one report despite its undertakings to respond within six months. As I understand it, each of the 17 reports mentioned are beyond the period of six months. Other reports have come in since then. The Government is in default of its undertaking in relation to all these reports. I want to make some general comments. I am not speaking specifically to the one report about which I am particularly concerned. I am concerned about all reports. I am concerned about the future of the committee process in the Senate and the enthusiasm which honourable senators are expected to engender in relation to the creation of reports. I am concerned about the series of failures of response from the Government to these reports. Reports will go out of action and will become out of date if they are allowed to go too long without attention and therefore they may be turned down on the grounds that they are no longer up to date in their recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This development is a very sad one indeed and a concerning one. I am sure that senators who are concerned for the future of the Senate committee system and its reports would like to have, perhaps not at this stage today but later, a real explanation of what will be done to ensure that reports are responded to so that where they make sensible recommendations they may be acted on at a later date. I say that, I trust, calmly and without rancour. But I feel that this a matter about which the Senate must be very concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to make some brief comments on this matter. I am afraid I am not as soft on the Government as the previous speaker, Senator Missen. I can appreciate the difficulties in which he perhaps finds himself, having been very active over the last several years in attempting to get the Executive Government to respond to the very worthwhile reports that are made to the Senate. The numerous reports have resulted in a great deal of information being made available and a great number of recommendations being made to the Parliament. This has been of great value to the Parliament and to the Australian community. But these recommendations become meaningless unless the reports are given life and they can be given life only by the government of the day. The Opposition does not take the view that there are not pressures on the Government; of course there are. There are pressures on the Government all the time and because of those pressures the processes of government are slowed down to the extent that they do not always respond to the efficient workings of the Parliament. If the pressures on the Government are such that it is not able to respond to recommendations made in reports and to the very important work carried out by Senate committees, the Government has to take some responsibility in this area and it has to take some steps to allow the very effective work of the Senate committees to have some life. I do not think we can sit back, in a sense, year after year accepting an inadequate response on the part of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I know, Mr Deputy President, the pressures that were on you when you were a Minister of the Crown. I accept that there are pressures on all Ministers. But that is not good enough. The pressures are always there. There are pressures on members of parliament. But there is a responsibility lying here that has to be resolved. If in fact the pressures are such that the work of the Senate committees is not being attended to and their recommendations are not being taken into consideration, particularly in respect of a number of matters that are related to the effective working of the Parliament, the Government has to accept the responsibility for failing to carry out the work of the Parliament as distinct from the work of the Executive. Surely we should be looking to the Government, particularly this Government, to appoint a Minister or to take some other Executive action to ensure that at the end of the session this year we are not confronted with a problem similar to the problem that we were confronted with at the end of the session last year and the year before which culminated in the decision of the Senate to have a more effective review of the Executive and its relationship to the Senate. If the problem is not solved we will destroy not only the effectiveness of the Senate committee system but also the enthusiasm of honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> I know how many honourable senators during non-sitting weeks come to Canberra or go to various cities and provincial centres throughout Australia looking at problems, which have been referred to them as a result of a decision of the Senate, with a view to assisting the Parliament, and to some extent the Government, with the varied matters that are referred. I know that the Opposition, as distinct from the government of the day, always says that we are supposed to be wedded to a system called parliamentary democracy. But in fact we have allowed that system to degenerate into a government democracy. You, Mr Deputy President, together with the Presiding Officers, have made some progress this year in at least establishing the role of the Parliament, as distinct from the Executive, in establishing better processes and procedures for the effective functioning of the Parliament as such. That is a matter that certainly concerns me. It would certainly concern me if I were a Minister; I would still be concerned at the role that the Parliament plays, as distinct from the Executive or the Cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, we have an unsatisfactory position. I understand the difficulties that Senator Missen finds himself in again being a critic. But we on this side of the House can only say that we will continue to maintain the role of being a carping critic. We will be more critical than Government members because we feel that there is a degree of irresponsibility, a degree of inadequacy, in the way in which the Government is treating the reports of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> We are grateful to the President for carrying out the function that has been requested of him by the Senate. There should be regular reports or at least annual reports to the Parliament on these matters. When we look at the nature of the reports, whilst we have referred to only one or two of them, we see that there are some very valuable reports about our security, about refugees and about the natural resources of our country and the state of them. From time to time important work has been carried out by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations in relation to statutory authorities. All of this work in essence remained in limbo because of the inability of those reports to come to life and become part of the work of the Parliament and part of the work of the Executive of the day. On behalf of the Opposition I applaud the initiative that has been taken by my colleague, Senator Colston, and by Senator Missen. If this state of affairs continues we will have to consider a much more effective criticism of the role of the Government and its failure to take these important reports into consideration.</PARA>

In fact, it can be truly said, quite contrary to what Senator Gietzelt has said, that in the years of the Fraser Government, including in particular those years in which it commanded a majority in the Senate, it went out of its way to encourage the parliamentary authority within this chamber in its fullest development. I reject out of hand any suggestion that in the time of the Fraser Government the Executive has been in any way attempting to pre-empt or limit the authority of the Parliament. The very reverse is true. The whole of the conduct of this chamber was with the fullest understanding that we should develop the talents and the expertise of the Senate and its committees. Over the years, I have been an active and enthusiastic member of such committees.

<PARA> The Senate may recall that the Joint Committee on Publications, in its report entitled Inquiry into the Purpose, Scope and Distribution of the Parliamentary Paper Series, made a number of recommendations concerning the free distribution of principal parliamentary publications, excluding Hansard.

<PARA> The Joint Committee has been advised that the first part of the review, that concerning publications other than Parliamentary Papers, has been completed and will result in considerable savings through a substantial reduction both in the quantity of documents distributed and the number of wrappers prepared and sent. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents concerned are Notice Papers of both Houses, proof and final Journals of the Senate, proof and final Votes and Proceedings and Bills of both Houses. Reductions in print runs were effected from the commencement of the Budget sittings and estimates provided by the Australian Government Publishing Service indicate that savings at this stage amount to $420 per sitting of the Senate and $660 per sitting of the House. On the current distribution this will result in a saving to the Parliament of over $75,000 per year. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Shippers Council has made a number of very important points in its report which I should like to draw to the attention of the Senate. The first point is that the Australian National Line-ANL-was scarcely mentioned in the Crawford Report on the Revitalisation of the Australian Shipping Industry and the subsequent task force report. The Shippers Council has drawn attention to its disappointment that nothing has apparently been done by the Government over the past 12 months to review the role and performance of the Australian National Line. I share the Council's concern, and I think that the investigation into the ANL is much overdue and is an urgent task for the Government. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to hear that Senator Archer agrees with me. The Australian Shippers Council also continues to be concerned about the number, severity and costs associated with waterfront industrial disputes. A major dispute in November-December last year disrupted shipping in Australian ports almost totally and led to delays in the export of liner cargoes and consequent financial difficulties for export shippers, importers and ship owners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most important point to which I draw the attention of the Senate is the Council's remarks about the Crawford report on the so-called revitalisation of Australian shipping. It gave consideration to the Crawford report when it was produced and sought consultation with the Minister for Transport and Construction (Mr Hunt). Unfortunately, the subsequent task force employed to look into the recommendations of the Crawford report did not consult the Shippers' Council or any other organisation representing the users of shipping services. That is a matter of great concern to me. I would like to make it clear that I am fully in agreement with decisions to extend the five-year depreciation period to ships, to provide investment allowance for overseas trading ships and to eliminate the 2 per cent import tax on ships-provided that the crews are brought down to reasonable international levels. Also, I am all in favour of a revitalised Australian shipping industry, but with two vital provisos-that it does not increase the cost or the unreliability of our overseas trade. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, the shippers, the people who have to pay the first cost-in the long run to be passed on to the Australian community-were consulted very little in this whole process. It looks to me and, I think, to them, very much like a cosy deal between ship owners and unions. That is, of course, my worry. However, before I deal with that I should like to dispose of one other matter with regard to the revitalisation of our shipping, and that is the defence argument. At present coastal shipping is an Australian flag monopoly. All the ships on the coast are Australian owned. We have 70 ships of 1.5 million tonnes on the coast, with 13 ships of 450,000 tonnes engaged in overseas trade. I am sure that we could get enough ships from these to support even a Falklands scale operation, provided that there was proper prior planning. We have not been doing this; but that is another story. </PARA>
<PARA> The arguments advanced by the Crawford report on the revitalisation of shipping , in my view, are all either wrong or suspect. It is unlikely that increased Australian flag shipping would make a significant net improvement in our balance of payments. It would be most unlikely to lead to increased employment and even more unlikely to provide a useful window on real shipping costs. Even if all these advantages were there, they would still have to be balanced against the cost. At present the ANL is the darling of the conferences with a cost structure which is so high that it raises the average freight rates for all the other members of the conference-a bonanza for overseas shipping lines-and we, the Australian community, pay the resultant costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Why are our shipping costs so high? Australian shipping is costly because of excessive crews demanded by unions. For example I mention the crew sizes of three sister ships-identical ships-on the Australia to West Coast of America service. The Swedish crew in the Paralla numbers 28; the British crew in the Dilkarra is 35; and the Australian crew in the Allunga is 36. That is typical; the Australian crew is about a quarter more than the Swedish crew. Worse still, not only are the Australian crews the largest and the highest paid but also they have five months leave a year; nearly two crews are needed for each ship. They do less on-board maintenance than the smaller crews of other nationalities. This , of course, increases costs still further and reduces the ships' operational availability. One of the main reasons for the excessive Australian crews is the number of unions involved-six. There is one encouraging development there. Two of the unions involved-the Seamen's Union of Australia and the Marine Cooks, Bakers and Butchers Association of Australasia-are in an advanced stage of amalgamation, which will reduce the number of unions involved in a ship to five. Obviously this is an improvement but this surely is one area where we should be looking for a single industry union. What we need in a single industry union for shipping is appropriate cross training so that members of the various previous unions can carry out all the functions involved in the ship. I am glad to see that the Minister is tackling that by allowing ratings to be trained at the maritime college in Launceston. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport and Construction in his statement said that about 12 ships might be added to the Australian flag for overseas trading in the next three years. The only way that these could be economically justified would be if the unions showed, by performance, that they were prepared to bring the total manpower cost-not just the crew numbers-of running an Australian flag ship into line with that of other developed countries such as Sweden or Norway. My worry is that we will be pressed into negotiating bilateral deals with other countries , as we do with airlines, and our shippers will be forced to use Australian ships despite the fact that labour costs have not been brought down to world standards. As I said earlier, the shippers have been consulted very little in this whole process and they are the ones who bear the initial cost. The community will bear it ultimately. </PARA>
<PARA> I am all for bold initiatives that will overcome the high costs and low productivity of our shipping, but industrial peace can be bought at too high a price. I am fearful that we will burden ourselves with high cost ships providing unreliable services and with industrial blackmail being used to force shippers to use them despite their uncompetitive costs. I hope I am wrong. I hope we will not negotiate bilateral shipping deals until our total manpower costs-not just the crew numbers-have been brought down to competitive levels and the whole scheme will be dropped forthwith if the unions are not fully co-operative. If the Government sticks to its announced principles I think that no new ships will be acquired. When this becomes clear, the Government will be under enormous pressure to water down its requirements. This must be resisted. It would be much better to have no new Australian flagships involved in overseas trading if the alternative is to saddle ourselves with high costs and unreliable ships, which would do great damage to our position as a trading nation. The Government has announced its principles in this area. I hope and pray that it will stick to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate that steps were taken during the last Australian Labor Party administration to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Australian Federal Police, to which Senator Murphy and his successor in the position of Attorney-General, Mr Kep Enderby, were subsequently traduced by the conservative parties at the time. They delayed the eventual amalgamation of the Australian Capital Territory Police Force and the Commonwealth Police Force until 1979 when they established the Australian Federal Police by legislation. Section 38 (2) and section 39 of the Australian Federal Police Act provided the Commissioner with the power-this is part of the process of the amalgamation that I want to refer to-to retire a member of the Force, transfer a member to a lower rank and transfer a member to a different position. Here we were in a position of amalgamating two forces which had similar definitions but also in a contradictory sense different functions. Clearly such powers as we said then were held by the Commissioner of Police would demand a system of review. That was one of the points consistently made by the Opposition in the debate over the Australian Federal Police Act in 1979. The Opposition moved, among many other things, for-I refer specifically:</PARA>
<PARA>the creation of rights of appeal in relation to transfers, promotions, discipline, demotions, retirements and dismissals. </PARA>
<PARA>That is referred to in page 3 of the report. The government of the day, as is pointed out in the report, refused to accept these suggestions. Of course there was considerable dissension in the Force in the last three years as the amalgamation and all of the processes associated with it took place. We are now confronted with a situation, some three years later, where the serving members of the Australian Federal Police still have no adequate appeal mechanisms for the matters which we referred to in that debate. Currently available measures of review are and have been shown to be inadequate. They are summarised by the Adminstrative Review Council-again I refer specifically-as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> It is thus the position that both review by the Ombudsman and judicial review have their limitations. By way of summary, neither means of review can:</PARA>
<PARA> effect a review on the merits;</PARA>
<PARA> result in a decision on the merits of the reviewing authority being substituted for that of the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition,</PARA>
<PARA> the Ombudsman does not investigate action taken in relation to employment. </PARA>
<PARA> applications for judicial review involve the prospect of substantial legal fees being incurred. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course that has the effect of creating a degree of discontent within the Force. Further, it is the case that other Acts which give the authorities power similar to those under sections 38 and 39 do have review and appeal procedures. This report identifies the Commonwealth (Redeployment and Retirement) Act 1979, the Postal Services Act 1975, the Telecommunications Act 1975, the Overseas Telecommunications Act 1946, the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 and the Government and Related Employees Appeal Tribunal Act 1980. The report recommends that the Promotions Appeal Board, which has been created pursuant to regulation 18 of the Australian Federal Police regulations, appears to be a welcome and long overdue step to overcome the difficulties that exist within the Australian Federal Police and affect its effectiveness as a police organisation. It is now essential that the relevant Ministers-the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman)-consider this recommendation as a matter of urgency to overcome the discontent that exists and consult the Australian Federal Police Association, which is now amalgamated and currently electing its officers. They should act on the recommendation very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter to which I wish to refer concerns the serious question of staff shortages and the ability of the Australian Federal Police to police organised white collar crime, which was raised by me during a hearing of Estimates Committee C. In reply to a question related to Medibank fraud Mr J. C. Johnson, the Acting Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, replied:</PARA>
<PARA>The Medibank fraud matters have been particularly worrying this year. It has caused us to allocate additional staff to that area. It has been reported to me that we are handling the problem adequately at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA>That was on 13 September. However, on 12 October, a month later, according to the Canberra Times of 13 October, the Australian Federal Police submitted to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts that there were insufficient resources within the force to deal with medical fraud. Mr Johnson is reported to have said:</PARA>
<PARA>At present . . . the unavailability of resources in AFP divisions is a significant factor when determing the effectiveness of any concerted action taken to suppress medical fraud, or for that matter any form of criminal activity. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that there were problems with training and with the level of demand placed upon skilled investigations. When these claims are added to the criticisms of the Australian Federal Police by Royal Commissioners Woodward and Costigan it is clear that a response is needed from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I released a Press report which referred to statements by Commissioners Costigan and Woodward. The report of the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Ship Painters and Dockers Union pointed out that the police force did not have sufficient personnel of the appropriate intellectual training and capacity to undertake the difficult analysis of facts which is necessary to identify major criminal organisations. The report of the Woodward Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>When the police were called in, their work was ineffective. </PARA>
<PARA>I put the following question to Acting-Commissioner Johnson during the hearings of Estimate Committee C:</PARA>
<PARA>There has been an increase of some 50 staff from one year to another. Having regard to all that has been said over the last couple of years about white collar crime, drug running, gun running, the Nugan Hand Affair, and all of the other issues which have become areas of public interest, is the present complement of 3,098 men adequate to carry out all the responsibilities which clearly come to the fore in areas of crime in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer to that question was not given to me by the Acting Commissioner. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle replied yes. I submit to the Senate that Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle misled Estimates Committee C when she answered that question which was directed to the Acting Commissioner. I will admit that the procedures for Senate Estimates committees are such that the Minister is the person responsible for answering the questions asked by honourable senators. In this case, however, the Acting Commissioner replied to all of the other questions asked. Subsequent to the hearings of Estimates Committee C we had the reports from the royal commissions I have mentioned. Mr Johnson has also made a report to and answered questions before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Admissions were made to that Committee in respect of staff and other deficiencies within the Australian Federal Police. Yet, the Minister in charge of the estimates which were considered by Estimates Committee C said that all things were satisfactory and that there was no need to consider further the sorts of matters that had been raised. Mr Johnson was not allowed to answer the question satisfactorily from the point of view of the Estimates Committee. However, subsequently he made submissions to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which contradict-I think that is the best way to put it-the evidence that was given before the Estimates Committee and contradict the statement made by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. I find that a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. I do not know what course of action is available to us other than to say that the Australian Federal Police has a tremendous responsibility in this area of fighting white collar crime in Australia. It obviously lacks the resources and the skills necessary to carry out its work. The Senate, through the Estimates Committee, was denied an opportunity properly to deal with those matters because of the way in which the Minister replied to the question. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to congratulate Qantas Airways Ltd for its report. I think the Australian editorial of Wednesday, 27 October, summed up the situation very well when it said that the Qantas loss should be commended. The report shows an overall profit for the year of $61m, compared with a $19.5m loss in 1980-81. The passenger growth of the airline was up 5.2 per cent. I think this is a very good result given the world-wide decline in tourism and international air travel. There is a recession at the moment in international aviation. The major airlines around the world are in a horrendous state. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last 12 months two major airlines have crashed. One was Laker Airlines. I remember many Government senators telling us when Laker first came on to the market that the deregulation of airlines was going to be the new wave of the future, that Laker was going to be a great success. That airline has now gone to the wall. More recently Braniff collapsed. It was not a small airline. Apparently it was the eighth largest airline in the United States of America. It employed 10,000 people and had over 50 aircraft. British Airways has just reported a loss of approximately $900m in the last year. Closer to home, Air New Zealand has posted another major loss this year. This led me to ask a question in the Senate recently about the position of the two United States airlines that fly into Australia. I asked that question because of an article on the Braniff crash which appeared in Newsweek of 24 May 1982. The article pointed out that six airlines in the United States were in danger of financial collapse. Two of these airlines-Pan American World Airlines Inc. and Continental Airlines Inc.- fly to Australia. I was concerned about the possibility of Australians, especially those travelling in internal routes in the United States, being stranded if either of these two airlines was forced to cease operations and strand passengers in the way Braniff did. </PARA>
<PARA> I was staggered by some of the figures in the Newsweek article. The article pointed out that Pan Am has at the moment a total debt of over $11 billion. That company's current assets amount to $7 billion to $8 billion and its current liabilities are between $9 billion and $10 billion. The article points out that Continental has a total debt of between $4 billion and $5 billion. Its current assets amount to only $2 billion and its current liabilities are between $5 billion and $6 billion. In 1981-82 the airlines associated with the International Air Transport Association, the world body, showed a loss of $1.9 billion. In 1980-81 the loss was $1.6 billion. There are some reports that next year the figure will be approximately $2.5 billion. I think, therefore, that we have to compare the actual airline operation loss by Qantas of only $24m for the year in the context of what is happening on a world-wide basis and see that as a very good result. But I am concerned that the Qantas profit of $61m which I have mentioned was achieved by selling during the year for $75.5m the Wentworth Hotel in Sydney. Qantas was forced to sell the hotel because of what I believe to be this Government's shortsighted policy. I wish to quote what was said on this subject by Mr Leslie, the chairman of Qantas, in presenting the airline's annual report. An article in the Australian Financial Review of 27 October states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Leslie raised hopes of a break-even result for Qantas in the 1982-83 year but this is expected to hang largely on the proceeds of the sale of Qantas House . </PARA>
<PARA>That is another property that will have to be sold. The article continues. </PARA>
<PARA> He complained bitterly yesterday of the airline's need for further capital injection from the Federal Government, and made pleas for capacity control on air traffic to the United States and greater freedom for the Qantas Board from day-to-day ministerial direction. </PARA>
<PARA> He said it was vital for the airline to reduce its debt ratio if it was to keep its position in a cut-throat market environment. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Government had injected $25 million into the airline early this year, it needed a further $120 million to bring its debt to equity ratio back to a commercially sound 40:60 basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Leslie said the outdated air transport agreement between Australia and the US had resulted in the presence here of two US carriers Continental and Pan Am. </PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman went on to speak of the difficulties of those, a subject on which I have already spoken. This Government should be concerned about the proposal that Qantas staff be reduced by more than 1,000 in the next five months. Given the horrendous unemployment in this country at the moment, one can imagine what will happen, especially in cities such as Sydney, from which the majority of Qantas staff come, if 1,000 people lose their jobs in that period. I am also concerned about the safety issue. Qantas has the record of being perhaps the safest airline in the world, but I believe that there has been a decline in airline safety worldwide as a result of falling income and the need to cut costs. One has only to consider the recent crash in Chicago of a DC10 aircraft, in which almost 300 people died. According to the investigation report the crash was brought about because the company involved had indulged in time saving as far as the maintenance of engines was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> What concerned me greatly about the sale of the Qantas property was a report on what is said to be the most efficient airline in Europe. I refer to Swissair, in respect of which I would like to quote a statement made in Newsweek which stated :</PARA>
<PARA> Unlike most European airlines, Swissair is turning a profit. It expects to end this year in the black with an estimated profit of more than $26 million. But even at hyperefficient Swissair, spiraling flight costs have taken their toll . . . Fortunately for Swissair, the airline's top managers understood the cyclical nature of the industry early on. Their response: diversification. Swissair owns two charter airlines, Balair and CTA, and services the planes and engines of other carriers. It runs an insurance company, an auditing firm, an aerial-survey company, a convention-booking agency and a chain of hotels that includes the Drake in New York City, the President in Geneva, the International in Zurich and the Bellevue Palace in Bern. </PARA>
<PARA>The article states that Swissair is the most efficient airline in Europe and is showing a profit because it has diversified; that part of the diversification involves owning international hotels, but Australia's airline, because of the Government's shortsightedness, has been forced to sell its hotel in order to show a profit in one year. That is a nonsensical approach. </PARA>

I ask it especially to consider the problem that must be faced in the next five months of trying to reserve the jobs of the 1,000 Australian workers who might be laid off by Qantas.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This is an interesting and indeed quite beautiful report on the Great Barrier Reef. It is very well documented and illustrated. I wish to express concern about the reef because, in a sense, we feel that what passes for government policy in relation to it really constitutes a series of platitudes. The Government has consistently claimed that under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act the reef is protected, in the sense that environmentalists, the majority of Queenslanders I suspect, and anyone concerned about the great attributes of the reef would like to see it protected. The Opposition does not believe that that claim has sufficient reality because only those sections that have actually been declared a marine park-Capricornia and Cairns-Cormorant Pass- are protected by the Commonwealth Act. In 1979 the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) gave the Queensland Government power of veto over the areas that could be protected. In 1980 the Government handed control of the three mile territorial sea around all the islands and reefs to the Queensland Government. It gave the Premier of that State the right, if he thought that course necessary , to permit oil drilling on the reef. In 1981 the Commonwealth Government excluded from the Cairns section of the park 70 per cent of the three-mile territorial sea. It is clear at this stage the Government has no intention to declare the entire reef a marine park. </PARA>
<PARA> The report itself is largely devoted to the beauty of the reef and its importance, but it is fairly silent on some of these important issues concerning its ultimate protection. The Opposition believes that the Queensland Government will declare its own marine parks in the reef area. That could have all sorts of consequences for the use of both marine parks for oil drilling and so on. It would be disastrous if oil drilling or mining were allowed in the area of those marine parks. It would mean that all reef areas not included in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park could be subjected to oil drilling. The Government has handed over to the Queensland National Parks Service the day to day management of the marine park. The record of that Service in managing its own island national parks is not very good. There are in the Cairns section 27 Barrier Reef islands that have Queensland National Park status, yet only two are ever visited by Queensland rangers and one, Michaelmas Cay, is visited only twice a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The raising of some of these matters represents merely expressions of concern by the Opposition, which is conscious of the fact that they involve important questions of Commonwealth-State relations. Our view is that, in respect of a number of matters, the Queensland Government has not displayed sufficient diligence in the protection of these areas. If one goes to the Barrier Reef area what is increasingly seen there, particularly on the beaches of north Queensland , is the exclusion of the public for private development-a sort of public squalor and private affluence in relation to the development of these areas-and a series of policies which in the long term will result in disaster because of unco-ordinated, unplanned and unprotected development of the whole of the north Queensland region. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, as a political party, we announced a number of policies for north Queensland. Central to our policy statements was the need for emphasis to be placed on tourism for the area's future prosperity. We see north Queensland as an area of specific tourist interest and we take the general view that, in looking at regional policies in Australia, it is important to identify what regions can do best and what particular characteristics those regions have in terms of their economic potential. There is growing concern in north Queensland about the need to diversify the economy of that region, very much dependent as it is on sugar and the prices which commodities receive in overseas markets. Tourism, under the present Government, is the only growth industry in Australia apart from tax evasion. It is labour intensive, would employ a lot of people and is a profitable area of economic activity. It is because of that that we expressed special concern about the preservation of particular attributes of north Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Something of the same sort of argument should be put and could be put by a responsible Commonwealth government in relation to parts of Tasmania. Again, that area has particular and significant tourism potential. Tourism in north Queensland is already a big employer and a big industry, albeit somewhat haphazardly developed, because of the great natural resources of the region and the great natural beauty of the Great Barrier Reef area. That potential will never be realised if the Federal Government does not live up to its responsibilities. If it does not move quickly and firmly to protect the reef the area's single greatest asset could be destroyed. That is something about which all Australians ought to be concerned even if the Premier of Queensland is not particularly concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Government is more interested in gung ho development than in weighing up the damage to the national and regional interest in the long term. Our view is that the hour is late and that the protection of the Barrier Reef, as with protection of other areas not only of environmental significance to Australia but also of potential great economic significance because of their capacity to attract tourists, is in danger. Again, it is an issue which all Australians, particularly north Queenslanders, are aware of and concerned about. We persistently hear arguments in this Parliament that all these things are best left to the interests of the State concerned and to management by State governments. If State governments do not discharge their responsibilities the Comonwealth Government has a role in respect of areas of national importance, which we believe the Great Barrier Reef to be. I commend the report to the Senate for careful attention but I commend it only in the context of saying that we have great qualifications about the attitude of the Commonwealth Government to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. We will continually express our concern about this issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some remarks on the annual report for 1981-82 of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Firstly, I must congratulate the Chairman on the presentation of the report. It is certainly an outstanding report, both in the colour plates and photographs that adorn it and also in the comments in relation to the establishment of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. I share the point of view put forward by Senator Button about the doubts we have about the Queensland Government and its view of the Great Barrier Reef and the marine park. The Queensland Government's view is one of development rather than one of preservation for future generations. But that is not the point that I would like to speak on very briefly today; I wish to deal with research documentation. The report states quite clearly:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two projects are underway to facilitate the co-ordination and dissemination of marine research information. The first, entitled Australian Marine Research in Progress is a co-operative venture between the Department of Science and Technology, CSIRO-Division of Computing Research and the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>On dealing with that research or with the bodies involved in that research, particularly the Department of Science and Technology, I was somewhat amazed, when I asked a question on an Estimates committee, to find that it was quite obvious that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) had endorsed a recommendation to terminate Federal funding for research into the box jellyfish. It seems to me that, although one could say that the box jellyfish will not affect the reef itself, certainly when we extend our view of the reef to include its potential for tourism we see that the box jellyfish would certainly have some effect because of its ability to keep people out of the water in the northern areas. I was amazed that when I asked the Minister a question he indicated that something like $500,000 was spent on research generally in the northern part of Australia. The amount actually spent by the Government was in the vicinity of $138,000-not $500,000 as the Minister had stated. So at the Estimates committee I decided to try to gather a bit more information on the Government's real ability or real desire to go on with research, particularly research that affects the Great Barrier Reef. On asking a question I found that a Dr R. F. Hardwick of James Cook University applied for further funding for research into the box jellyfish and the problems as they affect the northern waters of Queensland. He wanted to continue research into the control of box jelly fish infestation through the northern waters. He also wanted to have further investigation into diesel fuel slug, which he was investigating at the same time. But the allocation in the Budget showed very clearly that the Government was not greatly interested in that sort of research continuing. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LH4">Senator JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It could develop from, say, the Townsville area right down. It certainly affects the area that is part of the marine park and will affect the Barrier Reef area. Dr Hardwick made a request of the Department to seek an extra $24,375 for research into the areas that I have spoken of. At the Estimates committee I was informed that only $9,800 would be available for the continuation of that research and that the Australian Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee had endorsed the payment of that amount of money . It also endorsed-or the Minister had endorsed-the fact that there was to be no further research. In other words, Dr Hardwick requested somewhere in the vicinity of $24,000 to finish the research that he had started in the area. He was allocated only $9,800 and in no way, with that amount of money being allowed to Dr Hardwick, could he finish the research that he had started into the box jellyfish and other problems that exist in that northern part of the reef area. I draw the attention of the Senate to this matter. The report of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is of a very high quality. I feel sure that those people who are responsible for this report would be very interested in the fact that this Government intends to neglect to pay the extra amount of money required to continue the research into the infestation of the box jellyfish in north Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Labor Party's policy with regard to uranium contains the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> The uncritical support of nuclear technologies by governments worldwide encouraged the nuclear industry to develop before the fundamental questions of safety, disposal techniques, effective regulatory and safety systems were tackled and which still remain unresolved. </PARA>
<PARA>It is in relation to those very questions that the Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council reports from time to time to the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr McVeigh) and hence today to the Parliament. It cannot be denied that in the Australian community there is a very real fear. There are misgivings of a grave nature as to the waste products from the nuclear fuel cycle not least because of their hazardous nature but also because of the very long life of those waste products. The Labor Party is most concerned that sufficient research effort be applied by both government and private industry to ensure that if the industry is to operate at all it should do so only when the risks associated with the disposal of waste have been minimised to a degree which is acceptable within the whole of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> When one reads the two letters from the Council to the Minister which are before the Senate today-one might say that we are indebted to the distinguished members of that Council for the time they have put into reviewing the state of the high technology which is being developed, some successfully and some with less success, in order to deal with waste disposal-one finds, in the first letter a reference to an incident in the Tsuruga nuclear power station operated by the Japanese Atomic Power Co. where a cubic metre of low level liquid radioactive waste overflowed from the storage tank at that nuclear power station and found its way to the local stormwater drainage system. That incident alone demonstrates that the safety of nuclear plants and of surrounding communities has not been given sufficient attention in as much as the overflow from that plant flowed into the local stormwater drains. It strikes me and, I am sure, most honourable senators that simple matters such as that which go wrong give rise to the very real apprehension in the community. It is as to the long term disposal of waste products that the Council directs the bulk of its letters to the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it would be of interest to most Australians to hear what the Council has to say about the Synroc method of trapping wastes in a way which is said to prevent their leaching or movement into the surrounding environment. The Synroc proposal did capture the imagination of the general public in Australia, particularly those with real political concern in this matter, because it seemed to be a case of Australian expertise, learning and techniques perhaps providing some solution to this problem. I was astounded to read in the letter from the Council to the Minister that at present no radioactive waste has been incorporated in Synroc. My general impression was that even at the laboratory level experiments had taken place whereby radioactive waste had been introduced into the Synroc artificial material in order to see what effect that waste radiated product might have on the encasing material. It seems that to the present crucial experiment has not been undertaken at the laboratory stage and certainly not even at the pilot plant or full-scale demonstration stage. The Council made certain comments in relation to the Synroc process. These comments need to be related to a previous letter which discussed the enclosing of waste products in glass. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . one advantage which is claimed for SYNROC is that in accelerated ageing tests the leach-rate rapidly declines to a much lower value than that measured for glasses. However, there is evidence that some naturally occurring minerals which have structures not dissimilar to SYNROC become amorphous-glass-like-after substantial exposure to radiation. It is therefore vital that extensive studies should be undertaken of the effect of radiation on the structure and leach-rate of SYNROC. </PARA>
<PARA>Those experiments have not yet been undertaken. It is a cause of concern that that should be the case. The Australian Labor Party has a strong policy in relation to the need to find methods to store waste products safely from the nuclear fuel cycle. We have an international concern in this regard. For example , our present policy states:</PARA>
<PARA> For example, any contract with the Japanese could only be contemplated subject to them withdrawing from their intention to dump waste material in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA>The attitude of the Japanese is perhaps at one extreme-a contemptuous disregard for the environment of the Pacific and of the wishes of the peoples in those island states. That is at one extreme in relation to which the Labor Party says certain things ought to happen-this is embraced in the second last paragraph of our policy which follows from other paragraphs. The Labor Party says:</PARA>
<PARA> In adopting the view that the onus and responsibility to meet the conditions as outlined rightly belongs to the miners, producers and developers we determine that an Australian Labor Party government will have neither a moral, legal, or political obligation to compensation to the industry as such. The responsibility is theirs to meet the above necessary and reasonable conditions. It is not the responsibility of government. </PARA>
<PARA>That refers to an earlier paragraph which requires that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . miners, producers and users of the products of the nuclear fuel cycle accept responsibility for developing effective waste disposal mechanisms, satisfactory safety and occupational health conditions, proposals and funding for the decommissioning of nuclear plants and also provide financial assistance for the development of safe alternative energy sources. </PARA>
<PARA>That brings me to the final paragraph of the Council's letter to the Minister. In relation to Synroc being taken to the pilot plant stage and then to full demonstration, the Council stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council recommends that the Commonwealth Government should give continued strong encouragement to the SYNROC programme and should endeavour to provide a guarantee of adequate support over a period of at least several years. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not my place at all to speak for the incoming Labor government and the resources which it will provide in accordance with that strong recommendation of the Council. But I can say that in accordance with our policy the level of resources which might be contributed by the national government to that project would be a contribution, a supplementing, of the research expenditure which would be required of the industry itself. That research effort by industry would be a condition of its operating at all in the phasing out of that industry under Labor Party policy. The disposal of waste is a problem which has to be tackled with the expenditure of quite considerable financial resources. Those resources must come not only from the general community through national government but also from the industry. That will be a key point in Australian Labor Party strategy on coming into government. Because of the brief amount of time available to me, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the Australian Labor Party's uranium policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Uranium</PARA>
<PARA> Recognising that the provision of Australian uranium to the world nuclear fuel cycle creates problems relevant to Australian sovereignty, the environment, the economic welfare of our people and the rights and well being of the Aboriginal people; believing that, having regard to the present unresolved economic, social , biological, genetic, environmental and technical problems associated with the mining of uranium and the development of nuclear power, and in particular-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to the proven contribution of the nuclear power industry to the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased risk of nuclear war; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the absence of procedures for the storage and disposal of radioactive wastes to ensure that any danger posed by such wastes to human life and the environment is eliminated;</PARA>
<PARA> It is imperative that no commitment of Australia's uranium deposits to the world's nuclear fuel cycle should be made until-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a reasonable time has elapsed for full public debate on, and consideration of, the issues;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the ALP is satisfied that the abovementioned problems have been solved; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the Australian Government endorses Recommendation 6 of the First Fox Report which states-</PARA>
<PARA> 'a decision to mine and sell uranium should not be made unless the Commonwealth Government ensures that the Commonwealth can at any time . . . immediately terminate those activities, permanently, indefinitely or for a specific period.'</PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, a Labor government will-</PARA>
<PARA> 54 (a) declare a moratorium on uranium mining and treatment in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) repudiate any commitment of a non-Labor Government to the mining, processing or export of Australia's uranium; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) not permit the mining, processing or export of uranium pursuant to agreements entered into contrary to ALP policy. </PARA>
<PARA> This policy will be implemented in the light of the following-</PARA>
<PARA> 55 The ALP's approach to uranium policy is dominated by its concern that the economic, social, biological, genetic, environmental and technical problems associated with the nuclear industry are unresolved and that uranium is a source material leading to nuclear armaments proliferation, which poses the most serious threat to world peace yet experienced and to Australian sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA> 56 We have remained steadfast in our opposition to the growing propensity for reliance upon the nuclear fuel cycle as a source of energy and for other commercial and military applications. </PARA>
<PARA> 57 The development of the nuclear fuel cycle has delayed the development and application of passive energy technologies more suitable to our fragile global environment. </PARA>
<PARA> 58 The uncritical support of nuclear technologies by governments worldwide encouraged the nuclear industry to develop before the fundamental questions of safety, disposal techniques, effective regulatory and safety systems were tackled and which still remain unresolved. </PARA>
<PARA> 59 The acceptance of nuclear power as an energy alternative by developing countries has not only presented these countries and the world with a substantial safety and surveillance problem but has provided many with the option of becoming nuclear weapons States adding to the dangers of increased armament proliferation. </PARA>
<PARA> 60 Labor believes the development of a nuclear weapons capability from civil nuclear programmes is the most distressing feature of nuclear power, and one which requires the most urgent and earnest international attention. </PARA>
<PARA> 61 Australia is not a producer of nuclear power but is involved in the international nuclear fuel cycle as a supplier of uranium. </PARA>
<PARA> 62 Despite widespread concern in the community, the opposition of the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement, commitments have been made by previous governments to certain corporations operating uranium mines in Australia and to the governments of customer countries, to maintain Australia as a uranium exporter. </PARA>
<PARA> 63 We recognise on becoming government-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) we will inherit an existing position of Australia under the Fraser government of having made treaties and authorised contracts of supply of uranium to a growing number of countries with little effort to impose controls and conditions on supply;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) an incoming ALP government is already committed to repudiate all existing commitments. In adopting our repudiation commitment an ALP government has neither a moral, legal, or political obligation to compensation to the industry as such;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) understanding the difficulties which could be encountered in the implementation of that commitment our minimum position would be a total unequivocal commitment to phase out Australia's involvement in the uranium industry and that certain conditions as outlined will and must be applied to those mines existing in production as of July 1982; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) as an ALP government we give total commitment to preventing any new mines from being developed during our period of office. </PARA>
<PARA> 64 Accordingly, a Labor government will-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) make a total commitment to exerting all possible influences on the development of creating effective international arrangements covering nuclear non-proliferation treaties, waste disposal, arms control and nuclear disarmament ;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) review bilateral safeguard agreements governing supply under these contractual arrangements and, if necessary, renegotiate these agreements to impose conditions relating to the nuclear practices of the customer country (e.g . the cessation of French atomic testing in the Pacific area);</PARA>
<PARA> (c) consider applications for the export of uranium mined incidentally to the mining of other minerals on a case by case basis and on the criteria of whether in the opinion of a Labor government the mining of such minerals is in the national interest; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) allow no new uranium mine developments to commence or come on stream whilst the government of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> 65 In government if the only recourse is to implement a policy of phasing out the industry as of July 1982, the following conditions will be applied-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) miners, producers and users of the products of the nuclear fuel cycle accept responsibility for developing effective waste disposal mechanisms, satisfactory safety and occupational health conditions, proposals and funding for the decommissioning of nuclear plants and also provide financial assistance for the development of safe alternative energy sources;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) measures are adopted in the International Atomic Energy Agency and elsewhere not only to improve the technical efficiency of existing safeguard systems but also to establish new and multilateral approaches to a reduction in nuclear proliferation and to more effective control of existing nuclear facilities;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) satisfactory arrangements have been developed for the storage or disposal of the products of uranium mining, low level waste such as equipment or material contaminated by radioactivity, spent fuel, plutonium and depleted uranium as products of reprocessing and high level waste separated by reprocessing;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) arrangements have been established by mining companies, in cooperation with national health authorities, for health screening and study of employees, both while employed and for a period considered by medical authorities as being necessary, to detect the incidence of disease related to exposure to radioactivity; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) not permit the treatment, storage, or enrichment of nuclear materials in Australia nor domestic use of nuclear power. Whilst opposed to the establishment of domestic storage and treatment systems, Labor will support the development of safe long-term nuclear waste disposal technology for application to existing waste problems. </PARA>
<PARA> 66 Consistent with clauses 63b and 63c an Australian Labor government will adopt the process of phasing out our involvement in uranium mining, and certain conditions will be imposed upon the producers in accordance with this policy and we will utilise our right to apply trade embargos to ensure these conditions are met. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, any contract with the French government could only be contemplated subject to that government ceasing all nuclear testing programmes in the Pacific . </PARA>
<PARA> For example, any contract with the Japanese could only be contemplated subject to them withdrawing from their intention to dump waste material in the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, any contract with the Finns would be subject to our being satisfied beyond all doubt that the supply of uranium was not being deflected into the nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear arms programme of the USSR. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, any contract with Great Britain would be subject to our being satisfied beyond all doubt that the supply of uranium was not being used to assist in developing nuclear armaments. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, any contract with the West Germans would be subject to them ceasing the supply of technology and equipment to countries such as the Argentine which is leading to the establishment of yet another potentially nuclear armed country. </PARA>
<PARA> Any such conditions will apply to purchasing countries over and above existing international safeguard agreements being agreed to and observed. </PARA>
<PARA> The principles inherent above which apply to specific markets will be applied in relation to contracts to any other countries, arising out of the production of current mines, within which similar circumstance arise. </PARA>
<PARA> 67 Labor is commited to reversing the direction of nuclear developments worldwide. As part of this Commitment, a Labor government will undertake appropriate research and provide assistance to the energy impoverished nations of the world to find energy solutions which are more suitable to their decentralised populations and which are a real alternative to reliance upon large blocks of expensive centralised nuclear generation with extensive reticulation grids. </PARA>
<PARA> 68 Labor will take steps in international forums such as the International Energy Agency to promote a fair distribution of available energy resources so that the rich nations are precluded from placing inordinate demands upon the world's scarce and finite fuels. </PARA>
<PARA> 69 Nations must also be convinced that their interests are best served persisting with energy systems which utilise their indigenous fuels and decrease their dependence upon the international oil trade, transnational oil companies and the merchants of nuclear power. </PARA>
<PARA> 70 As part of its comprehensive approach to uranium policy and its concern for the gravity of the international outlook for peace and security, Labor will monitor the nuclear activities of other countries and their propensity to develop weapons capabilities. In tandem with its monitoring programme and to reduce the prospect of a nuclear war, it will indefatigably pursue a policy of international arms control and disarmament. </PARA>
<PARA> 71 If in implementing this policy opportunities for employment are affected on a regional basis then provision will be made for adjustment assistance, compensation and alternative employment opportunities to those workers, and the provision of financial assistance to an alternative means of economic development for those Aboriginal communities adversely affected will be guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA> 72 On a regional basis, the provision of special assistance to those local economies adversely affected by the implementation of the policy will be given to facilitate the implementation of alternative policies for economic development. </PARA>
<PARA> 73 In adopting the view that the onus and responsibility to meet the conditions as outlined rightly belongs to the miners, producers and developers we determine that an Australian Labor Party government will have neither a moral, legal, or political obligation to compensation to the industry as such. The responsibility is theirs to meet the above necessary and reasonable conditions. It is not the responsibility of government. </PARA>
<PARA> 74 Finally, no revision of this policy with the view of allowing the industry to develop further will be undertaken by the Australian Labor Party until and unless all of our unresolved concerns related to the industry are satisfactorily resolved and agreed to by the ALP National Conference. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>This report was prepared by Mr H. W. Paterson. I believe this is a very good report but it is long overdue. It is long overdue not only because it is a report on the capacity of the Commonwealth Government Printing Office but also because, in a most scandalous way, this report, which is dated February 1981 and which left the Government Printing Office in April 1981, is before the Senate only now. One can well ask: What has happened? Why has this report been suppressed from at least April 1981 until today? The delay is unforgiveable. That delay represents the way in which this Government has treated the Government Printing Office, which is a very efficient organisation. This Government has been seeking to give government printing work to private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> The report sets out to examine the capacity of the Government Printing Office. Mr Paterson refers in his report to the Printing Office having a turnover worth $20m a year. It is a very sizable and very efficient government enterprise. A serious problem for the Government Printing Office is the fact that this Government has continued to sabotage its own office by its ideological prejudice in that it insists on hiving off work to the private sector. I refer to the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. G 43 dated Tuesday, 27 October 1982. On page 59 of that Gazette, under the sub-heading 'Australian Government Publishing Service', I find a typical example of the way in which this Government has directed the Australian Government Publishing Service to give preference to commercial enterprises. That typical example in the Gazette shows contracts to the Canberra Publishing and Printing Co., the Union Offset Company, Moore Paragon (Aust.) Limited, the Canberra Times and Trade Typesetters, Canberra. They are all companies in the Australian Capital Territory area. In particular, the period contract referred to in the Gazette refers to the typesetting and supply of reproduction material. I think these are annual contracts or contracts at least for a considerable period. </PARA>
<PARA> Those contracts are particularly significant because in the report Mr Paterson refers to the changes taking place in the Government Printing Office. Changes in technology are taking place which are absolutely essential in order to make the Government Printing Office comparable with commercial enterprises. In the Gazette for the week previous to the one to which I have referred the amount of money shown as having been given to commercial enterprises was to the extent of $129,000, which I think is fairly typical of the way in which this Government is giving work to private, commercial enterprises. This is happening at a time when the Government Printing Office is under capacity. The Government is sabotaging the Government Printing Office by, on the one hand, giving work to the commercial companies and yet, on the other hand, not utilising fully the capacity of the Government Printing Office. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect of this report which is of concern and to which I have referred is the tremendous delay in its presentation. When Mr Paterson addressed himself to the problems of the Government Printing Office he was dealing with the situation in 1980. Now we find that some of his predictions, which of course were genuinely made in 1980, are out of date. For example, on page 28 at paragraph 4.14 of his report under the heading 'Conclusions and findings' he states:</PARA>
<PARA>That adequate use will not be made of the photocomposition system illustrated in Appendix V when it is completed in 1982 unless input is lifted by about 30%. </PARA>
<PARA>His estimate was that there was a need to plan towards that use of new equipment . My information is that that under capacity of work in the Government Printing Office at present is 50 per cent and that the new system which has been introduced into the Government Printing Office has increased the capacity of the Government to be concerned with its own typesetting for reports and other matters with which it deals. As I have already referred to, the Government, through the Government Publishing Service, is giving work away to the Canberra Times which is part of the Sydney Morning Herald group, to Trade Typesetters and other commercial printers. That is clearly a stupid system of allocation of resources. The Government is clearly attempting to sabotage what is an excellent service-the Government Printing Office. </PARA>
<PARA> Over a period, the service has been undermined because of the way in which work of the Government Printing Office has been curtailed by the development of the Publishing Service hiving off work to the private sector. In paragraph 8.4, listed under the commercial options to which Mr Paterson refers, he points out that it would be interesting to conjecture what should be done and to speculate on the possibility of the Government Printing Office actively seeking work to combat what he describes as the passive attitude towards the Government Printing Office. The Government Printing Office has not been encouraged to accept work from government departments and other government sources. In paragraph 8.7 (b) of the report Mr Paterson proposes:</PARA>
<PARA>Develop a group of up to eight persons, trained to service departments, with clear and quantified objectives concerning the nature of timing of contracts required by the CGPO, and ensure that their commitments to customers are faithfully carried out. </PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph (c) of his recommendations he goes on to point out that it is necessary to do the following:</PARA>
<PARA>Change the production control system of the Kingston plant from passive status reporting to a positive management tool which discloses in advance the location and likely extent of unfilled capacity and closely monitors the progress of orders through the plant. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Paterson is doing something that I would support very strongly. He is proposing, in an intelligent and sensible way, that when the Parliament is not sitting the Government Printing Office be able to solicit work from government departments and, in that way, keep working to capacity, as it should be. At the moment the Government Printing Office works at a 90 per cent capacity in parliamentary periods. The remaining 10 per cent, apart from any cases of sickness or matters of that nature, is to cover ordinary maintenance on that equipment. The real problem lies with the use, during probably 50 per cent of the time, when the Parliament is not sitting, of the typesetting capacity which is available. It is there as a result of changes in technology and the installation of new equipment. It would appear that the Government does not have any plans to use that equipment as it should be used. </PARA>
<PARA> In talking about the equipment I should like to add that the Government Printing Office has a particularly skilled section of trades people. It has some of the most skilled people in the Australian printing industry. The work of the Government Printing Office requires special skills. It requires extreme accuracy . Quite often a Bill with many alterations is sent at 4.30 p.m. to the Government Printing Office. The required number of copies of that material is always available the following morning, despite the interference of politicians and the alterations that are often necessary in such a situation. It is necessary for officers at the Government Printing Office to be given the opportunity to exercise their skills. If the Government Printing Office is allowed to be undermanned the valuable skills in the bookbinding and finishing area, in the trade typesetting area and in the many other skilled areas of the Government Printing Office will be lost to this Parliament. Unfortunately, we will then pay through the nose for commercial printers to undertake work that at the moment is quite capably done by the people at the Government Printing Office . </PARA>

Honourable senators will find that the recommendations made in that report are similar to those advocated by Mr Paterson. At page 34 of his report Mr Paterson gave a commercial option. A bureaucratic option appears at page 35. If honourable senators care to look through those options and compare them with the report on the Australian Government Publishing Service they will find that they run along similar lines. Therefore, it behoves the Government to look at those two reports before it comes down with any recommendations. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I advise honourable senators that at page 150 of the sixty-first report of the Commissioner of Taxation tabled in the other place this morning my name appears, though I am not identified as a senator, as having understated my income by something less than $1,400 a year for a period of four years. For a very long period I and my father before me had engaged a firm of accountants. The firm had full details of my business and private affairs and each year prepared my taxation return from that information. In 1979 I received a request from the Commissioner of Taxation for details of interest received from investments. On investigation I discovered to my horror that interest received from term deposits had been overlooked by my accountant. The interest had not been disclosed over a period of four years. My accountant had full knowledge of all my investments but had failed to obtain details of accrued interest which had been automatically added to the investment and did not appear on my bank statements. In 1980 I paid the amended assessment and the penalty.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Honourable senators will recall that on 11 June last year, the then Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts tabled the Committee's report entitled 'Children and Television Revisited'. This report was a review of the study undertaken in 1978 by the Committee into the impact of television on the development and learning behaviour of children. The purpose of the review was to re-examine the recommendations of the earlier report in the light of developments in the area of children's television. The Committee canvassed the views of a number of individuals and organisations and held public hearings during March and April 1981.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to inform the Senate that the Government has carefully considered the recommendations contained in the report entitled 'Children and Television Revisited'. I can assure honourable senators that the issue of the impact and effects of television on children continues to be of great concern to the Government. I am pleased to say that, since the 1978 inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, the Government has achieved a great deal in the area. This is reflected by the fact that the majority of the Senate Standing Committee's recommendations in the latest report, which re- affirm or amend those of the previous study, have been or are currently being implemented. Major recommendations of the review are: The reduction of the total amount of violence on Australian television; the suggestion that the Film Censorship Board be responsible for program classification; endorsement of the concept of an Australian children's television foundation; and further research into the promotion of the concept of consumption of healthy diets. A schedule of Government responses to the Committee's recommendations has been prepared. I seek leave to have it incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>1. The Effects of Television Violence</PARA>
<PARA> That the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal as early as practicable fulfils all the relevant terms of Recommendation 1 of the Committee's original Report:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in consultation with Australian researchers and where relevant overseas authorities, including broadcasting authorities:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) formulate guidelines designed to reduce the total amount of violence on Australian television; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) that such guidelines take particular account of the more damaging forms of violence identified by researchers;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the Broadcasting Information Officer monitor telecasts to determine the amount and kind of violence being presented on television; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that periodic assessments be made of the amount and kinds of violence against the criteria and principles of the guidelines and this information be made readily available to the public and be taken into account by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal when assessing a station's performance during licence renewal hearings.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> Any action to be taken on this recommendation is a matter primarily for the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT).</PARA>
<PARA> The formulation of guidelines relating to violence will be part of the current review of television standards being conducted by the ABT.</PARA>
<PARA> The ABT has issued a discussion paper on 'Violence on Television' designed to obtain information on community attitudes towards violence on television as a pre-requisite for regulatory or other action.</PARA>
<PARA> Concerning the Broadcasting Information Office see comment for Recommendation 2 .</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>2. Broadcasting Information Office (BIO)</PARA>
<PARA> That the Government reconsiders its decision not to establish the Broadcasting Information Office.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> On 15 April 1981 Cabinet agreed not to proceed with the establishment of the BIO. It was subsequently decided that some of the proposed functions of the BIO would be absorbed, in a suitably reduced and modified form, in the ABT.</PARA>
<PARA> The ABT has been reorganised taking into account recent Government decisions on the BIO. The major research and information gathering functions that had been proposed be transferred to the BIO continue to be performed by the ABT. Accordingly the Government has decided not to accept Recommendation 2.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>Program Classification</PARA>
<PARA> 3. That the Film Censorship Board be responsible for program classification on behalf of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has considered these recommendations and has decided that the Film Censorship Board will not assume responsibility for the classification of programs on behalf of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 4. That in the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 the responsibilities of, and procedures to be followed by, the Film Censorship Board in undertaking program classification on behalf of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal be clearly specified and take account of the terms of the provisions outlined in this Review.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The ABT is holding discussions with the ABC and the industry representative body, FACTS. Following these discussions I shall take up the matter of options in the longterm for the classification of imported television material with the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>Children's Television Program Production Unit</PARA>
<PARA> 5. That the Commonwealth Government supports the Australian Children's Television Foundation and that this support encompass financial contribution.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is supporting the establishment of the Australian Children's Television Foundation and has provided $250,000 in 1981-82 towards the cost of its establishment.</PARA>
<PARA> The proposal is that the Commonwealth meets approximately half the cost of the Foundation during its initial three years of operation (i.e. up to $1.5m) with the States and Territories sharing the remaining $1.5m. It is expected then that the Foundation will be self supporting.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth is committed to support the Foundation in 1982-83, with the balance of funding in 1983-84 and 1984-85 conditional on its performance in the initial two years of operation.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1982-83 $500,000 was appropriated to the Foundation in the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 6. That Films commissioned by the Foundation for local production qualify for tax concessions under the provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Income Tax Assessment Act provides for four kinds of eligible films. Films made for children may be eligible, having regard to approved guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 7. That financial support to the Foundation from the private sector qualifies as a tax deduction.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has recently decided that gifts to the Foundation shall not be tax deductible.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>The Children's Program Committee of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal</PARA>
<PARA> 8. That the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 be amended so as to provide for formal status of the Children's Program Committee of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and that in the drafting of such legislation note be taken of the comments made in this Review.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The ABT in consultation with the Children's Program Committee drafted a formal Constitution governing the operations of the Children's Program Committee, which came into effect on 1 December 1981. Legislation is, therefore, unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>Advertising</PARA>
<PARA> 9. That the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal continues to review the criteria on which advertising standards are based taking into account the possible harmful effects of the influences of advertising on the formation of children's attitudes and values.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> All the matters raised in the Report concerning advertising are being taken into account in the current review of the ABT's Television Advertising Standards . The ABT anticipates publishing discussion papers concerning these matters which will invite public comments before the Standards are finalised.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 10. That appropriate funding be made available to the National Health and Medical Research Council to allow it to undertake an advertising campaign on the electronic media during children's listening and viewing times designed to promote the consumption of healthy diets.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The National Health and Medical Research Council (NH and MRC) Working Party on Television Advertising of Foods Directed to Children has recommended that an advertising campaign promoting the consumption of healthy diets be undertaken by the Department of Health.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 11. That the National Health and Medical Research Council continue to pursue its research into the dietary habits of Australians and the effectiveness of television advertising in influencing what Australians eat.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA> The NH and MRC is presently giving consideration to action it may take in regard to pursuing its research on matters mentioned in Recommendation 11.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of the Committee's recommendations concern the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, such as those relating to advertising standards and assessment of the effects of televised violence. The Tribunal is currently undertaking a review of television standards and will be paying close attention to these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The review recommends that the Government reconsider its decision not to proceed with the establishment of a broadcasting information office. Honourable senators will recall that this decision was taken in the context of the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee. The Government has since decided that some of the proposed functions of the broadcasting information office would be absorbed within the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal will, therefore, continue its research and information gathering roles in a suitably modified and reduced way, taking into account the Government's decision on the BIO. The Government has reconfirmed its decision on the BIO and does not accept the recommendations of the Senate Committee on this matter. In view of the time and the procedures of the Senate, there is a short additional part of the Government's response which might be suitable for incorporation in Hansard. If that were the wish of the Senate, I seek leave to have the remainder of the statement incorporated in Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Some of the Committee's recommendations involve other departments and authorities. These have been referred to the relevant body for appropriate action.</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee also recommended that the Children's Program Committee be given formal status under the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942. However, the ABT subsequently developed a Constitution governing the Children's Program Committee, which took effect on 1 December 1981. The Government has therefore decided that it is not necessary to give a legislative base to the Children's Program Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the classification of programs which is a difficult but necessary task.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considered this matter and recommended that the Film Censorship Board assume responsibility for classifying all imported and locally produced television programs on behalf of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. After careful examination of the complex issues involved, the Government has decided not to add to the responsibilities of the Film Censorship Board in this way. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is currently discussing the classification of imported television material with the ABC and the television industry representative body, the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations (FACTS). The aim is to establish acceptable arrangements which acknowledge the importance of generally accepted standards and the capacity and experience of the industry, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and the Film Censorship Board . I will consider any recommendations which come forward as a result of these discussions at the appropriate time in close consultation with my colleague, the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee devoted considerable time to investigating the area of advertising and I have already mentioned that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal will be pursuing the matters raised in the Committee's Report. In addition, the National Health and Medical Research Council is considering the matter of supporting further research in relation to the dietary habits of Australians as proposed by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I come to the matter of an Australian Children's Television Foundation . Honourable Senators will join with me in commending the principles on which the concept of the Foundation is based.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has agreed to provide $1.5 million to the Foundation over a period of three calendar years, representing 50 per cent of the Foundation's estimated expenditure during that period. Of this amount, $250,000 was provided late in the 1981-82 financial year, and $500,000 is to be provided in 1982-83. The provision of the balance of the Commonwealth commitment in 1983-84 and the first half of the 1984-85 financial year will be conditional on the government being satisfied that the Foundation is making a worthwhile contribution to the improvement of children's television by its performance over the initial two years of operations. The Foundation is expected to be self supporting after three years. The Senate Standing Committee is to be congratulated on the painstaking work it has undertaken and the depth of analysis which is reflected in its Review. Through its efforts, there has been a general increase in awareness of the television needs of children which, it is hoped, will result in better children's television programs in the future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a number of points in respect of South Australia in this pre-election period in that State. Three years ago the South Australia electorate elected the Tonkin Liberal Government on a promise of stopping the job rot and on a promise of developing confidence in the future. Three years later it is very much a situation of the time being up, not only for Dr Tonkin and for the Liberal Government in South Australia, but also for thousands of South Australians who, in the last three years, have in one way or another discovered that the promise for the future was not met. It is a government that now goes into an election bankrupt economically and bankrupt of ideas. It is a government which, to the electorate of South Australia, is presenting itself with the intellectual capacity of the Muppet Show. It has presented no policies during this campaign, and, despite that fact, it is now about to embark on a campaign of deception and smear. We have seen in South Australia-in fact we have not seen in South Australia in recent weeks-the phantom Premier, Dr Tonkin, who has quite conspicuously not been there. The great government announcement this week of a new bank for South Australia was made by the Minister of Industrial Relations, Mr Dean Brown. Dr Tonkin did not grace the photograph in the newspaper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We know that the election will be held in nine days time. One thing that we know in South Australia is that the election, which could be held up to March next year, is to be held at this particular time for a particular reason. In that respect I refer to an article in the South Australian Advertiser by its industrial reporter Michael Grealy, in which he says:</PARA>
<PARA> The worsening employment situation in South Australia, more than any other reason, has prompted the State election sooner, rather than later. </PARA>
<PARA>That very much is the crux of the situation in South Australia. Let us turn for a moment to the record of this Government. Let us turn to its economic record, the record of the Tonkin Administration as economic managers. Let us look at some of the indicators. Let us look at employment and unemployment. In Australia over the last three years there has been an increase in unemployment in the vicinity of 300,000. In South Australia there has been an actual decrease in full time employment of approximately 2,000. When we look at total employment, both full time and part time, we see that even in this respect the increase has been 0.01 per cent of the national total, which is hardly the share that South Australians have been used to. When we look at other indicators such as the number of persons unemployed for each job available, we see that whereas in 1979 there was one person unemployed for every 20 jobs available, this figure has now increased to a massive 50 persons unemployed for every job vacancy. In the actual indicator for unemployment, the unemployment level, we find that in the three years September 1979 to September 1982 there has been an increase in unemployment in South Australia from 7.6 per cent of the national unemployment rate to 8.5 per cent. In 30 of the 33 months of Tonkin Government we have consistently had unemployment at the highest level of all mainland Australian States. The construction industry is in the same position. </PARA>

<PARA>the last has been a shocker for employment and South Australia is strapped into a downward slide. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the improvement we are talking about. So we have the spectacle today of the Minister for what we on this side of the House are starting to call him, the Minister of funny talks, presenting to the Senate a document lising projects for which the Tonkin Government, or so Senator Sir John Carrick claims, is responsible. He tells us that there has been a huge amount of $200m. I have had a chance to go through this list and analyse some of it. In fact I have not had a chance to go through more than about one-tenth of it. But let us have a look at some of these items listed in this document; for instance, Adelaide Brighton Cement Ltd, Birkenhead, an expansion of $17m. This expansion was announced under the Labor Government in 1979. It includes a new ship which was commissioned and started under the Labor Government. We turn then to the Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd at Whyalla, and the projects there at the cost of $52.5m. These projects were announced by Des Corcoran the South Australian Premier in 1979. In fact, one of them was announced in March 1979 under the Labor Government. This list is littered, I might say, with companies that in recent months, in fact in the recent year, have had to retrench workers. I will come to them in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The list continues with Levi Strauss (Australia) Ltd at Elizabeth West, $2.5m, a project commenced in the early 1980s and commissioned under the Labor governments of Dunstan and Corcoran. We have the lube oil refinery expansion at Port Stanvac. That project was announced by Labor in 1979, at a cost of $20m. We go on again and again. We have the South Australian Brewing Co. Ltd, a $21m project for the rationalisation of production facilities, or so the Leader of the Government in the Senate claims. That project was announced by Hugh Hudson and in the 1977 annual report of the South Australian Brewing Co. Hugh Hudson was thanked by the Brewing Co. for the co-operation of the then Labor Government . Not only do we have projects that were commenced and announced and for which the Labor governments of Corcoran and Dunstan should take the credit included in this list but also we have included Government expenditure. For instance, included is the Woods and Forests Department at Mount Gambier, re-equipping of log mills, at a cost of $8.2m. How the inclusion of those sorts of statistics indicates any sort of industry confidence in the Tonkin Government is quite amazing. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that there was another aspect of this list which we should take into consideration. I refer to the scores of South Australian companies referred to by Michael Grealy which have significantly reduced their work force. When we go through that list we find that the names of companies which have retrenched staff also appear on this list. My submission to the Senate is that even though industries have invested in South Australia, much of that investment, approximately $121m in my very early assessment of the $200m projects announced by Senator Sir John Carrick, were of pre-September 1979 vintage. Since that period those companies which showed confidence in South Australia at that particular time are now in the position in which they have to retrench workers. Let us consider those companies. They include John Shearer Ltd, down 180; Adelaide Steamships Ltd, down 140, including its subsidiary the Mount Barker Tannery; Tubemakers of Australia Ltd, down 95; Trans Australia Airlines, down 40 ; Sapfor Timber Mills Ltd, down 75, and on the list goes, hitting both metropolitan South Australia as well as country areas. So we have this embarkation by the Tonkin Government on a scheme of deception in substitution of adequate policies which it is not geared towards either producing or presenting to the electorate. As another part of this deception we have the spectacle of the Premier of South Australia, last weekend, getting the nod from the Prime Minister. It is rather a strange thing to get from this Prime Minister, but Mr Tonkin says that he got the nod for a giant uranium plant. As quoted in the Sunday Mail last weekend, Mr Tonkin said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has indicated to me we have a better than even chance of getting a uranium enrichment industry ahead of Queensland . . . </PARA>
<PARA> After the Prime Minister's visit to South Australia, I am more confident than ever South Australia can win this plant. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not and was not the start of the deception. The deception started in a speech made by Mr Doug Anthony, the Deputy Prime Minister, on 7 October 1982. In South Australia Mr Anthony said:</PARA>
<PARA> South Australia is also under active consideration as a possible site for a uranium enrichment plant. </PARA>
<PARA>He referred to the Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia and he said that it had given the Government:</PARA>
<PARA>a further report on its study into the feasibility of establishing a commercial uranium enrichment industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Sir John Carrick continued the deception on 19 October in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. The whole question of the development of this project was put to rest by correspondence from UEGA to members of this Parliament dated 20 October 1982. Let me quote a number of points from that correspondence. UEGA said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> UEGA is not proposing at this time to proceed with the construction of an enrichment plant in Australia, nor even with a detailed feasibility study. </PARA>
<PARA>That contradicts what the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, was saying. Let us look at the date of this correspondence-20 October, as compared with 9 October. It is much later correspondence. The Government cannot claim that there have been developments since then. The correspondence goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Whether or not a detailed feasibility study is undertaken in the near future will depend on our joint assessment, with Urenco-Centec, of the extent and timing of future markets. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very much up in the air. It is very much, at this stage, pie in the sky. UEGA, in its correspondence to us, enclosed correspondence that UEGA sent to the Canberra Times. Let me quote a couple of passages from that. UEGA stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no firm proposal to establish an enrichment industry in Australia at this time. UEGA has merely advised the Australian Government of the preferred technology to be used as a basis for further studies and investigations. Whether or not a uranium enrichment industry is established in the future will be dependent on the results of the proposed market and feasibility studies. It is therefore quite premature to be talking of any enquiry of any kind. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on UEGA stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The key to the matter will be the size of markets available to an Australian plant. Such markets could be available in the early 1990s which is the timetable towards which UEGA is presently working . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The nomination of the technology for further study--</PARA>
<PARA>Which is the process which UEGA claims that it is undergoing now-</PARA>
<PARA>is merely one step in a fairly lengthy process of study and investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at UEGA's stated commitment and compare it with the allegations of the Government, both State and Federal, and let us look at it in the light of the international scene. In doing so, I should like to quote an international authority in this area, Mr Walter Patterson, who is a nuclear physicist and the editor of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists. He is also the author of the best selling book Nuclear Power. In mid 1981 he was asked about benefits from the uranium enrichment industry and whether he thought there would be a market for enriched uranium from South Australia in the late 1980s. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Personally I very much doubt it. The industry's record of forecasting future demand is abysmal, and this is, of course, one reason why private industry and private finance world wide won't touch enrichment with a barge pole unless it is given iron clad guarantees. </PARA>
<PARA>When asked whether he thought that an enrichment plant in Australia would end up as a white elephant, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is likely to be a very large white elephant which, once in place, will be a white elephant that will be very difficult to get rid of, because once you have that kind of financial commitment of capital investment in terms of hundreds of millions of dollars, you will find that the Government will not know how to stop. </PARA>
<PARA>So that is the only relief that the Government of South Australia is prepared to present to the people of South Australia. My time is all but up. It is very much the same situation as that of David Tonkin. He has nine days to go as Premier of our State, and from indications within the State parliamentary Liberal Party he will not have much longer to go as leader of that party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak for some quarter of an hour in relation to world military and social expenditures and the disparity between the two which has emerged as a feature of this global community's madness, particularly in the decades since the Second World War. That this is a matter for concern cannot be doubted by any person of good will. Indeed, the desire for peace and disarmament which is being promoted this week around the world by the United Nations in particular, as this is United Nation World Disarmament Week, is a force with which I believe politicians everywhere will have to grapple, because it unlocks one of the deepest aspirations of mankind-to live in a peaceful society in which human beings can come to their fullest development. One is reminded forcibly of the quotation from the prophet Isaiah, in the great Jewish tradition, when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more. </PARA>
<PARA>That aspiration there given voice by Isaiah is one to which we would all wish to give voice ourselves. But we need to give voice to it in practical ways, because not only is it an aspiration but also it is an ethical imperative, for us individually and as a society. We have to see the ethical imperative calling us to evolve a system in which international disputes can be resolved peacefully, and we also need to devise a system in which the tremendously disparate expenditure on armaments is not such a feature of our communities. I shall outline some of the disparities shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that there is, I believe, a hopelessness pervading the general community which comes about because of the awesomeness, the very nature of the destructive power, which could be unleashed from the nuclear arsenals of the super-powers. The fact is that we are confronted for the first time in human history with a completely new possibility-the annihilation of mankind. For that reason we need to come to this question of disarmament with a completely new perspective, a perspective that is not partisan nor determined by which country one happens to live in. We are very fortunate to live within one of the democracies, an industrialised democracy. Therefore, we are able to have rallies , which have occurred with increasing frequency and with increasing numbers of people participating. One thinks of the April rally this year right around Australia. Even in my area of north-west Tasmania last Sunday there was a rally organised by Don Herron and some country and western bands in the Burnie Park, where children gambolled and played with emus and kangaroos in what was really an idyllic setting, but it was a setting which those a little older than the children realised nevertheless had hovering over it the prospect of nuclear annihilation. </PARA>
<PARA> We in the democracies surely have a responsibility not only to give voice to our own fears but also to voice the concerns and fears of those in dictatorships who are not permitted to give voice to their very real concerns. Can it be denied that the mothers and fathers in Moscow and Leningrad fear as deeply for the future of their children as do the mothers and fathers in Washington or Sydney? If we do not express their fear then we could well be haunted by their reproach should the inevitable catastrophe occur. Even then, I am slipping into the wrong sort of language. It is not inevitable, it is likely unless we, around the world, take steps to tell the political leadership of the super-powers that to defend their concept of how society ought to be organised by the use of nuclear weapons is utterly immoral and likely to lead only to the destruction of both the competing systems which try to dominate this world. </PARA>
<PARA> It was indeed for that very purpose that I raised at Question Time yesterday, in perfectly good faith-it was responded to as such by the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle)-the interesting report of a committee of the United States Catholic bishops conference, which stated, amongst other things, that any use of nuclear weapons is immoral and called for immediate bilateral verifiable agreements to halt the testing, production and deployment of new strategic weapons. I asked then whether the Australian Government, in conveying, as a constant and reliable ally of the United States to the American Administration its view as to the future of the world and the peril in which the whole of humanity is at present, would take into account the sorts of criteria that are there outlined by what might be thought to be-we have an historic reason to know what used to be-a most conservative body within the United States social and political establishment. If within that establishment there can arise that call then so much the more within Australia one would hope that this call could be made by a variety of community organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> One would expect that if the religions of the world-whether they are from the Hindu or Buddhist tradition, the Jewish, Christian or Muslim tradition-looked objectively at the sources of their tradition and at their great books and the words of their founders, they would find inspiration for giving hope. That is so necessary in this struggle because the lack of hope of course paralyses and induces an atmosphere in society where what is thought to be highly likely indeed becomes inevitable and is not protested against. In addition to the religious organisations within Australian society it is very gratifying to note the constant proliferation of non-government organisations, such as small community groups and groups under more widely known and respected national organisations such as the United Nations Association of Australia, which are gathering people together so that as a united force, although speaking from different traditions and perspectives, they might put forcibly to governments that disarmament is an absolute ethical priority and is imperative. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very pleasing to note that the United Nations Association of Australia has been putting forward the concept of a ministry of peace, so that at the highest level of Cabinet decision-making in Australia there might be that input which is so essential, that perspective which would be well researched and backed up, to enable those making the decisions to have a viewpoint put with the authority of a Minister of the government to supplement that view, and perhaps to contradict on occasion, the view of the defence establishments in particular.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am informed by Senator Hill from South Australia, who I know has a very keen interest and concern in this matter, that Sweden has such a ministry . In that it may lead the way, a way which I hope we will follow. The point is that the armaments industry-the defence establishment and the bureaucracy which supports it-is an extremely powerful force within society in the sense that it is very hard for other forces within the society to shift the inertia. It has an ever growing, rapacious appetite for funds and expenditures which are thereby being diverted from the proper addressing of the real social needs of mankind. Honourable senators will be aware of the excellent annual publication put out by Ruth Leger Sivard entitled 'World Military and Social Expenditures'. I have the 1981 edition before me, in which the two expenditures, military and social, on a global scale are contrasted and outlined. For example I just pick a small point. It mentions that the world spends 2,300 times more for military activities than for international peacekeeping. The figures which I want to present to the Senate are contained in this thought: If there were an immediate reduction by half of the nuclear arsenals of the super-powers, some $50 billion could be saved in 1982. These savings would then be available for some of the real social concerns which humanity as a whole ought to be addressing. Here are some examples:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unsafe water is a factor in 80 per cent of all infectious diseases. Over half the population of the Third World lacks an adequate supply of safe water; even larger numbers are without sanitation facilities. Water taps and sewage systems could halve the incidence of diseases like typhoid, dysentery, cholera--</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to mention other notable diseases. To provide safe water for all within the decade some $7 billion would be required. Another example is:</PARA>
<PARA> Six diseases measles, poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, diphtheria, whooping cough, and tetanus, are child killers. WHO estimates that every minute 10 children may die as a result of these diseases. Although vaccines have existed for decades only 10 per cent of the 80 million children born yearly in the developing world are immunised. The cost of immunisation is $3 per child. </PARA>
<PARA>To speed vaccination protection for all children the expenditure would be $1 billion. There are but two examples of humanity-the poor, the opporessed and the children of this world-crying out for governments to direct expenditure to meet their real needs. One is reminded of the words of Pope Paul VI who said that armaments kill the poor by causing them to starve. In that statement one has encapsulated the very real truth that the very existence of the nuclear arsenals of the Trident class submarines, of the huge expenditure on maintaining military forces, even without their use, causes the poor to starve, the children to die and the malnourished and ill of this world to go untended. If we have any responsibility one to another as human beings without regard to partisan, racial , religious or sexist divisions then surely it must be that we all unite to ensure that the wealth of this globe is directed to the real needs of our fellow human beings. </PARA>
<PARA> One is always graphically reminded of what a fragile and interdependent world we live in when one sees the photographs of the earth taken from satellites or, more particularly, from the moon by those intrepid cosmonauts and astronauts who have stepped on to that satellite which has circled this earth for so many millions of years. When one looks down on the earth from that moon one sees, as I say, how small the earth really is. One realises what a great responsibility is involved in our being privileged to exist within the universe in such an environment as is the case with the earth. It is a great tragedy that instead of directing our resources, our abilities and our expertise in a creative fashion to ensure that all humans reach their full potential, we continue to divert so much expenditure into the arms race. I hope that the Senate responds to the constant plea of Australians and other persons throughout the world to ensure that our Government understands the real concerns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; This, of course, is the last sitting day of the Senate before the South Australian election. Therefore, I feel that I should say something about the options facing the South Australian voters. It was just three years ago that the voters in South Australia overwhelmingly swept the Australian Labor Party out of office after a decade of government. They did so because they feared for the future, for their jobs and for their standard of living. They had accepted the social experiment of Labor; they had responded to the charisma of Dunstan. But, by the end of 1979, they recognised that no longer could the soft path, the soft options, be taken, that the relative position of South Australia had disastrously slipped and that the economic future under Labor management was gloomy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the Liberals offered was to return South Australia to its former competitive position; to reduce the costs of government and to be able, therefore, to reduce taxes; to encourage industry and investment by the advantages that follow; and, therefore, to offer to voters and even more importantly to the children of those voters a future in South Australia. The slogan was 'Let's make South Australia great, again'. The electors remembered when South Australia was in fact great. They accepted that, at the end of every party, there has to be a reckoning and, to use another famous election slogan, they said 'It's time'. </PARA>
<PARA> In just three years, all a government can do is build a foundation. If that foundation can be built when the world around us is in the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s, when 30 million people in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries are unemployed, when the OECD growth rate is down to half of one per cent, when for the first time in 20 years international trade actually shrunk last year, a State government has done a good job. If it can build that foundation when its business is ravaged by the flow-down effects of the worst drought in Australia's history, it certainly deserves the opportunity to build upon that foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> The South Australian voters must make the decision whether to let the Liberal Government build on that foundation, the foundation which it has established over the last three years-in other words, further advance the mandate that they so enthusiastically endorsed just three years ago-or whether, in the panic of the world recession, they should grasp the soft options, the handouts, the artificial job creation schemes, the extension of protection-the traditional Labor alternatives which in the Federal sphere have been condemned so widely in the editorials which appear in today's newspapers. In difficult times it is tempting to take the easy course and not concern oneself with the question of who will pay. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last year, two most worthwhile papers have been produced in South Australia by the State Development Council. This body, which is made up of a highly accredited group of South Australian businessmen, academics and bureaucrats, was charged with the responsibility of recommending to the Minister of State Development in South Australia policy guidelines for the development of the State defining aims, objectives and priorities. The Council's report is set out in two volumes of a document entitled 'South Australia-A strategy for the future'. The report asks the question: Does South Australia have a chance of a prosperous future or is it destined to be a parochial stagnant backwater in Australian life? The report concluded that South Australia could grasp prosperity but only by taking the hard road, not by groping for the soft options . These two positive documents look at the strengths of South Australia. The second volume of the report recognises the strengths as follows: The changing view of South Australia's location from isolation to one of being advantageously placed in relation to the rest of Australia and the Asian-Pacific region; a lean , competitive agricultural industry which is capable of further development and diversification; a wealth of manufacturing experience, a stable, educated and skilled work force with a good industrial relations record, lower direct and indirect manufacturing costs; a revival of industrial development though one not yet sufficient to reduce the present disturbingly high unemployment rate-which is, of course, accepted; the rewards from resource development and exploitation are closer and the possibilities are expanding; low cost housing, a good education system, excellent community facilities, and in general a fine environment and life style. </PARA>
<PARA> Take those strengths and add to them the right philosophy of government. In that regard the question of the correct philosophy of government for economic recovery in South Australia was examined in the first volume of the report. The report looked at two alternatives. One advocates heavy emphasis on government involvement, protection of industry and regulation. The other prefers minimal government involvement and emphasis on individual enterprise and initiative. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Development Council recommends policies based on the minimal- interventionist approach. </PARA>
<PARA>Add to that the right philosophy of encouraging an attitude that is positive, opportunist and innovative. One can contrast that with the Dunstan Labor rule in South Australia where the community was brainwashed not to expect too much but rather to lower its standards. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> What exists can be turned into a springboard to success. </PARA>
<PARA>That is in fact the Liberal recipe. We were advised by this expert group that, if we are conservative, pessimistic, deprecatory and resistant to evolutionary change and ideas, the opportunity that is still apparent in the 1980s will be squandered. That is in fact, when examined, the Labor alternative. </PARA>
<PARA> So the cornerstone of Liberal Government policy in South Australia is investment and development. As was said in one view of the strategic plans, which appeared in the Adelaide Advertiser:</PARA>
<PARA> The political processes which determine who gets what are meaningless unless there is something there to distribute. </PARA>
<PARA>In South Australia, even in these difficult times, there is a government which has the runs on the board. It has in fact rebuilt the foundation. It can point to cuts in gift duty, death duty, payroll tax, and land taxes-in all a total in excess of $100m. It has been able to prune the public sector of more than 3,000 positions purely through attrition. It has been able to establish Technology Park to encourage firms developing high technology industry. It has upgraded the Small Business Advisory Bureau to provide information and management training. </PARA>
<PARA> What it is now able to offer prospective investors considering moving to South Australia is the lowest rate of industrial disputation in Australia, wage levels 6 per cent to 9 per cent below the national average, the highest percentage of skilled workers in Australia, industrial and residential land half the price of land in the eastern States, establishment grants of up to $400,000 for new industries with loan guarantees, payroll and land tax reimbursement and rent subsidies and opportunities that will be at the heart of resource development of the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The recipe which has been offered is working. Only in September the Premier announced results which showed that investment in manufacturing rose dramatically in South Australia against the backdrop of a national decline. He was referring to a survey by the Federal Department of Industry and Commerce which showed that investment in South Australia had jumped $440m in the six months to June of this year while in the other States it fell by $1,440m. Since October 1979, South Australia has attracted 19.5 per cent of the national total of investment which is, of course, well in excess of South Australia's share of the population which is 9 per cent. Overall investment committed or in the final feasibility stage for manufacturing and mining projects in South Australia had risen by $550m at the end of 1981 to $4,030m by the end of June this year. That is another figure which is in excess of South Australia's proportion of the population. New investment and development will bring new jobs and prosperity. One only has to look at the Roxby Downs development alone, for which a recent independent study by Melbourne's Monash University predicted up to 18,600 new jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> This is, in fact, an exciting time for South Australia. Roxby Downs, which I have just mentioned, is well on the way despite Labor opposition. The liquids pipeline to Stony Point has been completed and construction of the fractionation plant is on schedule. The construction of a refinery has now been announced. Feasibility studies for an associated petrochemical plant are continuing. The new international aviation terminal is ready to open and the first overseas flights will soon arrive. The new international hotel has been completed. The Tonkin Liberal Government has laid in just three years the foundation for the future prosperity of South Australia. It must now be given the opportunity to build on that foundation. In difficult times the electors must be aware of the Labor soft option that will not bring long term gain but will only further retard South Australia's competitive position and therefore its prospects. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose briefly in this debate on the motion for the first reading of Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1982-83 to discuss a matter involving strange dealings in Tasmania. It concerns bottom-of-the-harbour companies and certain personalities are involved. It relates to a property at 159 Collins Street, Hobart, across the road from the Commonwealth Government Centre. The Commonwealth should have bought the property itself but did not. The Commonwealth now rents it from a company which paid a vastly increased sum for the property compared with its cost at the time when it was first offered for sale. At this stage I have more questions than answers about this matter. It is a further example of the strange dealings which go on in the world of property and business dealings which call for many more answers than we get.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The company to which I am referring is called Ancam Investments Pty Ltd. It began in 1973 in Victoria with people called Zarro as its directors. On 11 July 1979 Ancam Investments Pty Ltd began operations in Tasmania also and appointed a company called Murdos Pty Ltd. However, it operated in Tasmania for less than one financial year. It was out again before the end of the financial year 1979- 80, which seems a bit strange to me. I have documents which show the appointment of directors and an agent, that the registered office of the company is at 10 Victoria Street, Hobart, that the authorised capital of the company was $10,000 and that the Zarros were still directors of the company. On 19 July 1979, a few days after beginning business in Tasmania, the company bought the property at 159 Collins Street for a sum of $413,000. On 30 July 1979 Australian Guarantee Corporation Ltd leased the building. On 17 August 1979, within 18 days, Ancam sold the property to Wales Management Pty Ltd which, of course, is a company closely linked with AGC. That sale was for a sum of $1,027,755, a $600,000 profit in less than a month. That again raises all sorts of questions. On 19 June 1980, less than 12 months after Ancam commenced operations in Tasmania, it ceased trading in that State. </PARA>
<PARA> The story then goes back to Victoria. On 30 June 1980, still within the 1979-80 financial year, the Zarros resigned. On the same day the now infamous John Walker Wynyard of 142 Cathedral Street, East Sydney, was appointed as a director of a company called Shareholder Pty Ltd. Trevor Burton Huttley, whose name is also well known in connection with the tax evasion stories of recent times, was appointed as one of the secretaries. Ancam Investments Pty Ltd is one of those hunderds of companies that were listed in the National Times a couple of weeks ago as companies from which Mr Huttley resigned as secretary. The complication continues because on the same day as John Walker Wynyard was appointed a director of the company he resigned. On that day John Patrick Connell was appointed as director and as the other secretary of the company with Trevor Burton Huttley. So it is a complicated story of which I do not pretend to know all the ins and outs. But there is clearly enough information to require further investigation, especially as the property concerned involved the Commonwealth Government as what ought to have been a potential buyer and now as a sublessee leasing the property from AGC. It involves property speculation and a profit of $600,000 by Ancam over 28 days on an investment of $400,000. There is a link with certain tax avoidance personalities. I add that all this was happening right across the road from the Commonwealth Government Centre in the electorate of the honourable member for Denison and Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman. </PARA>
<PARA> One could go so far as to say that because the Commonwealth did not buy the property in the first place it merely encouraged the speculation which followed because the Commonwealth, in particular the Department of Social Security, occupied part of the building from July 1980. I seek answers to some of these questions: Was Ancam liable to pay tax on its $600,000 profit, made within that 28-day period? If so, has it been paid? To what extent is the Australian Taxation Office investigating Ancam Investments Pty Ltd? Has the company been involved in any other property deals in Hobart and are the appropriate authorities investigating this? I again ask the basic questtion that I raised some months ago: Why did not the Commonwealth Government buy the building in the first place as it needed the building to provide extra office accommodation for the Department of Social Security? The answer from the Minister at the time was that the building was not suitable for office accommodation. But not long after that-certainly after some renovations, but not very long after-the Commonwealth leased the offices for about $50,000 a year. They could have been bought by the Commonwealth, renovated and turned into the offices which it needed. But, I suppose because of its ideological objections to buying property instead of leasing it from private enterprise, the Government did not do that. It would be interesting to know to what extent Ancam was aware that the Commonwealth was going to sublease part of the building at the time it was sold for the highly inflated amount. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is that the Fraser Government's property policies are clearly encouraging waste and extravagance by paying high rents when the Government could buy existing buildings or build appropriate office accommodation. The policies are obviously encouraging property speculation and tax avoidance. One would like to know to what extent such tax avoidance, involving property speculation by mainland companies who blow in and out of Hobart to make a fast buck on the way, is still happening and what efforts are being made by the Government to make sure that this sort of thing does not happen. In raising this matter, I raise more questions than answers, but they are important questions which ought to be asked. On this occasion they are being asked by me. They have been asked also by Kathy Smith, the Australian Labor Party's candidate for Denison, who has done a lot of work in querying this matter. I am pleased to be able to bring it to the attention of the Senate on her behalf. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his Budget Speech, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia now faces more daunting economic prospects than for several years, with the possibility of prolonged recession overseas and high inflation and weak activity at home. </PARA>
<PARA>No mention was made of the high unemployment and the plight of the people who are unemployed. In last year's Budget statement on strategy, it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA> For more than half a decade the present Government has pursued an economic strategy directed towards establishing an environment conducive to sustainable strong private sector growth. To this end policies have sought to eliminate a number of distortions in the economy, the most important of which were inflation , an over-expanded public sector, and depressed profitability. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, there was no mention of unemployment or the people who are suffering as a result of it. Great numbers of Australian people are suffering as a result of the strategies and of this Government's policies. They are suffering not only material deprivation in a rich country but also the fear of insecurity for their jobs, for their family life, for the aged and for youth. Their hopes and dreams are shrivelled with the frost of monetarism. What benefit has resulted from these seven years of suffering? Where is the good management promised by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) seven years ago? The state of our nation suggests that we are the victims of bad management. The Government's philosophy of the user pays is in complete opposition to the accepted ethic that every person has a basic right to the necessities of life, security and dignity. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:</PARA>
<PARA> Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for health and well- being of himself and his family, including food, clothing, housing, medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability and widowhood. </PARA>
<PARA>It is only when people have these necessities that they can become constructive, creative and responsible forces in the community. Only when people's rights to these necessities are satisfied is there real democracy in a country. It is this force and this energy of people which this Government ignores. Yet it is only out of this force of the human spirit and the human person that the answers and remedies for the problems of these days will come. People must be listened to. Their problems must be heard. The miners recognised that the other day when they came to this Parliament to be heard. It is a necessity for Government to listen to what the people are saying and to their needs. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget is concerned only with the economy. What research has been done by Government departments into the effects of Government policies on the families and the people of Australia, on the unemployed, on the aged and on our children' s development and their future? Surely we should be given some evidence of such research when a Budget is presented. There should be consideration of the effect of the Government's actions on families. Of all the things in the world, people are the most precious, and all things that are done should be done in the interests of those people. The way that the youth and the people of this country are being used and dehumanised to aid the economy goes beyond human acceptance. The results of this Government's policies are public issues which threaten the social, historic and spiritual environment of our nation. They are destroying the real values which are our people. They are not creating or building a national concept or a reality of which we can be proud. When the Royal Commission on Human Relationships made its interim report, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Our files are full of reports about increasing suicide among young people, unwanted pregnancies, battered wives, battered children, alcohol and drug abuse.</PARA>
<PARA>Does this sound like a happy society where people enjoy living, where people are creative and where people are achieving things? The pressing problem in Australia seems to be for its people to rediscover what it means to live in a real community where people matter, where people are concerned for one another's welfare and have a sense of purpose and values that makes existence become truly living. What are the basic needs of people? They are homes, income security and a sense of achievement. Why are people homeless in this country? Why should young and old people on low incomes be deprived of the most basic necessities of life, of shelter, good food, enjoyment and the simple pleasures to which people have a right? How do Federal Government policies develop security and allow people truly to live and not just to survive when their emphasis is only on economic principles and not on people?</PARA>
<PARA> The economic policies of the Federal Government are unethical. They totally lack social concern and social responsibility. It is the result of the Federal Government's policies that in the past 12 months, for the first time since figures started being collected, there has been no growth in employment throughout the country. At the same time the Federal Government promotes the family unit and yet at no time has the Government considered the impact of its policies on people or upon the family before it implemented them. In the area of work and unemployment these irresponsible policies are causing grave social problems. People have a right to work. If work is not available they have a right to a social security system which allows them to live in dignity. Today's workers are in fear of decisions made in board rooms overseas because profits being earned in this country are going overseas and are not being invested for the welfare of the Australian people. Men and women are being thrown on the scrap heap as though they are mere scraps of disused machinery. </PARA>
<PARA> The very foundations of Australian society and economy are shifting. The Australian economy is being transformed in ways that will change the character and the quality of our society for the worse-not for better. The control of our wealth producing resources which should belong to the Australian people is rapidly passing into foreign hands. Unemployment is rising; the social wage is deteriorating. There does not appear to be a very happy future or any hope for our greatest resource, which is our children. What is the Government doing about it? If the capitalist free market economy is so efficient, why is the Government in the mess it is now in? It has failed totally. Full employment is not impossible. A Labor Government achieved it during the rehabilitation program from war to peace after the Second World War. It is the will to achieve full employment that is lacking by the present Government. A Labor government would have that will to work and would act urgently to provide employment, hope and achievement for the people of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The very foundation of our society means that people should be put first. To put people first means that work has to have a special meaning. At this time work is being denied its true meaning. Work is not only the means by which a person provides for his needs; through work a person produces the goods and services that his fellow men need. It is this which gives work its dignity and its purpose. Because this should be the quality of work it is wrong for its availability to be left to the whims, the manipulations and the fluctuations of the market place. We know that there is a huge amount of work to be done to supply the needs of people in this country. There is a need for planning to fulfil those needs. Workers have spoken to us about the fact that they are being made redundant because of the Government's policy to hand over to private enterprise in the name of so-called greater efficiency. What is that greater efficiency when workers lose their jobs? Some of these people have been in jobs for 10 to 30 years. Yet all their lives, their families and their homes, have to be sacrificed in the name of economic efficiency. We have to ask ourselves: Where is the greater efficiency? Is it efficiency in the services provided to the public? Is it efficiency in making our country a great country, or is it just economic efficiency to make greater profits?</PARA>
<PARA> I feel a deep shame at the way in which future generations will look back at our caretaking of this country and the history in which we are now taking part. We do everything to achieve the greatest profit. We take as much as we can from the soil and in our greed leave a desert. We sell our forests and leave a land of drought and salt. We rip out the wealth from our earth and leave nothing for future generations. We deny the money needed to develop our own culture and to educate our people. The foreign policies of this Government and other governments would even deny that there could be future generations. We do not have to follow the ways of the United States of America, Europe or any other country. So often people ask: 'Why can't we just be Australian-working for Australia and for our own future?'. Unless Australians control the resources of our country and unless the people of Australia are put before the growth and purpose of technology, Australia will become structured in the interests of international capital and not in the interests of the Australian people. I wish to conclude with a quote from Professor Manning Clark. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In the nineteenth century Australians enjoyed the reputation of being in the vanguard of human progress: They were often the pioneers in the introduction of bourgeois democracy, and rather boastful about it. By contrast, in the twentieth century Australians seem to have missed the bus carrying humanity into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians are no longer the pathfinders, but rather the men of the army in the rear . . . We had the institutions and the value to promote the use of parts of our country as quarries for foreign powers, but neither the institutions, nor the inclination, nor the belief to make our country a paradise for the people. </PARA>
<PARA>If Australians are once again to be in the vanguard of human progress they must insist that capital, the economy, technology and the services of government serve our people instead of the reverse situation which is now developing. </PARA>

<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to appropriate amounts required for expenditure in 1982-83 from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, other than amounts provided by special appropriation and those included in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1982-83 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> The expenditure program of the Government was outlined in the Treasurer's Budget Speech. </PARA>
<PARA> The amounts sought for each Department are shown in detail in Schedule 2 to the Bill, and total $11,855,005,000; an amount of $125,000,000 is also included in the Bill for the Advance to the Minister for Finance. This provision remains the same as that for the past four financial years. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill seeks authority for the issue of $7,163,982,000 from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the balance of $4,816,023,000 having already been authorised by the Supply Act (No. 1) 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 of the Bill also provides for appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund to enable the Minister for Finance to issue amounts for payment or increases in salaries and wages and payments in the nature of salary arising out of awards, orders or determinations made under or in accordance with a law. Honourable senators will be aware, in this regard, that a bulk allowance has been included in the overall Budget figuring for prospective increases during the year in wages and salaries of Service personnel and other employees included under the defence function, $110m, and of other Public Service employees, $120m; those bulk provisions are not, however, appropriated in advance of any increases being awarded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee will recall that last evening when considering clause 23 Senator Harradine raised some points relating to another possible avenue by which the needs of the State of Victoria might have been approached. These points were raised in response to some criticism that had been made of that State's action in imposing a levy upon health insurance contributors. I promised to get the honourable senator some information. Some information has come to hand just this moment. It has been quite difficult to get it all together. I will read the information I have to see whether it can help us by elucidating the point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Premiers Conference held on 25 and 26 June accepted the Commonwealth's proposal for new tax sharing relativities based on the 1982 report by the Commonwealth Grants Commission on tax sharing entitlements. It was a 1982 report . A condition of the Commonwealth's proposal then was that no special grants would be paid during the phasing-in period. That is the nature of what happened in June. The Victorian Minister of Health wrote a letter on 28 June. In that letter he noted that section 12 of the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act provides for a State's revenue raising capacity to be investigated by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Given the heavy work load of the Commission over the last financial year it may have been impracticable to ask it to investigate the basis of the 1981-82 health grants. The Victorian Minister raised the possibility of the Commission examining revenue raising capacity applicable to the 1982-83 grants. He specificially asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Would you please let me know if you are prepared to refer this matter to the Commission?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister whom I represent responded. In his response on 6 August 1982 he indicated that Mr Roper's suggestion of a reference to the Grants Commission would also not be appropriate. I think Senator Harradine was aware of that response. Mr Carlton's response did not indicate a refusal. It was made against the background on which decisions at the Premiers Conference were taken. It may be possible, if it is the desire of the Committee, to table the letters which passed between them. That could be done if honourable senators wanted to clarify this matter further. It may not be necessary, but I will not object to that course. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act 1973 States are entitled to seek an assessment by the Grants Commission on claims for special assistance. The basis of such a reference to the Grants Commission is an approach from the State Premier to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and to the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) who is responsible for the Grants Commission . That avenue is open; it is provided for. In the light of the above it was not open to Mr Carlton to refer the question to the Grants Commission as the procedure for an approach to the Commission is well established. It is another avenue. However, whilst the Minister did not consider that such a reference was appropriate, he did not preclude formal approach by Victoria to the Commonwealth on the specific question of the tax sharing grants. Particularly, the Minister's letter did two things: First, it provided the basis for the Commonwealth's assessment of revenue raising capacity and, secondly, it pointed out that the identifiable health grant was only a component of the tax sharing package. The tax sharing package as such is a matter for the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and, as honourable senators would know, the Treasurer properly has these matters under his consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that there is no doubt that the Minister would facilitate in any way he could a formal reference to the Commission. To the extent that Senator Harradine's question to the Committee last night wanted to explore the possibility of going down that route, I hope that what I have said has clarified the matters raised. I am advised further that the report issued by the Grants Commission in 1982 actually makes clear the approach taken by the Grants Commission to these and other matters. I refer the honourable senator to pages 63 and 64 of that report. I can give further details if they are required. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Committee well knows, the Australian Labor Party Opposition opposes this clause. I do not think anything the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) has just said in answer to the question Senator Harradine asked last night changes our views on that clause. The matters under contention are, firstly, whether the Victorian Government can or should put such a levy on out-patients' attendances in Victoria through the voluntary health funds. Secondly, the matter of contention which has been very heavily alluded to by Senator Peter Baume is in fact the calculation, the actual costing , of this levy by the Victorian Government. At one stage Senator Peter Baume seemed to place great emphasis on this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have, as we frequently have, a dispute between a State and the Commonwealth about the level at which such a levy should be put on and the amount of money which would be raised by it. The Victorian authorities contend that they made their calculations on the basis of Commonwealth figures. There is a dispute. The Victorian Minister suggested that it should go to the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The Federal Minister for Health (Mr Carlton) in a letter to the Victorian Minister said quite clearly that this was not appropriate. Yet, we now have the situation where the Minister says: 'Although he said it is not appropriate, we could go down that road if we liked, if the Victorian Government made a formal application.' It seems to me, from the letter that was sent by Mr Carlton to Mr Roper, that the Commonwealth was clearly opposed to any independent arbitration, if that is what the Government wants to call it, about the size of this levy. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem arises from concerns expressed by Senator Harradine and later expressed by the Minister that certain people would be disadvantaged by the application of such a levy. Such levies have been common in health insurance in this country and other countries. The basis of these levies is that we in fact end up with a community rating, a distribution of the costs of health care over the community. Senator Harradine expressed the concern, for instance, that country people would be disadvantaged because they do not have available to them the out-patients facilities that exist in the cities. I think there are two points to be made about that. The first is that country people are already disadvantaged if we just consider out-patients because the health funds build into their premiums a segment which is concerned with out-patients facilities. It is distributed throughout their contributors in the same way as this levy would be. The second aspect, of course, is that in Victoria or any other State there is, for instance, a considerably higher number of in-patient beds per capita in the country than in the city. In that way country people could be said to be at an advantage over city people. I put it to the Minister that in fact this means of distributing the premiums across all people, be they resident in the country, cities or suburbs, is the way in which the health funds themselves operate. It is a sensible way of applying a levy like this. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one final difficulty. The Victorian Labor Government has instituted this levy. Quite clearly from the correspondence, the previous Victorian Liberal Government was investigating this course of action and was talking about introducing the same levy. It was a continuous process as the governments changed. The levy, the collection of fees of this type, has been introduced into Victoria. The basic purpose of this levy is to provide a means of more simply collecting outpatients' fees and everything else. As Mr Roper and others have said in a Press statement today-they have said this on previous occasions also- one of the unfortunate results of the Federal Government's attempts to wipe out the levy in this way will in fact be that there will be a considerable decrease in the amount of funds available for hospitals in Victoria in the near future. Unfortunately, as a result of that action, expenditure in the hospital system in Victoria will be at risk. In fact, some jobs may well be at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is a very serious matter that the Government should quite suddenly, after the Budget, decide to tack this legislation on to the Budget without holding consultations of any meaningful nature with the Victorian Government. It suddenly announced that it would chop down on this action for the spurious reasons given by the Minister in another place. He announced that the Government would persist with this legislation. Provision is made in this legislation for pensioner health benefits and sickness benefits and we have been told that we should pass it and that we should ignore the fact that it will severely disadvantage the State of Victoria and the Victorian hospital system in particular. We have been told that, because one section of the legislation deals with sickness beneficiaries, it is our duty to pass what we consider is an offensive part of the legislation. I attempted to simplify the process by dividing the legislation. For reasons of which we are all aware, I was unable to do that. That would have made no difference to the treatment of this Bill in another place. I think we should persist with our opposition to clause 23 and Part IV of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Government to come to some reasonable compromise with the Victorian Government rather than to put Victoria's out-patients services, hospital services and particularly employment in those areas under threat by what I consider to be precipitate and unfair action. I believe that States should be able to adjust the methods of collection of fees for out-patients in this way. I believe it is an administratively sensible cost-saving device. I believe in fact that it is as equitable as any method of collecting fees can be in our system. I think it is quite wrong of us to interfere with the Victorian Government's arrangements in this way. I repeat what I said last night: If the Federal Government tried to intervene with the Queensland hospital system-that system would be as contrary to the stated philosophy of the Minister for Health in this Parliament as is the Victorian Government system-all hell would break loose. Of course, the Government will not attempt to do this because the ideology of the Queensland Government is so much akin to this Government's ideology that it does not want to be seen to be in dispute with the Queensland Government. I urge the Committee to continue to oppose this clause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add a little to the point that Senator Grimes made relating to the possible loss of jobs in Victoria if the Victorian health levy proposal is not implemented. I have taken some considerable pains this morning to look into this matter. I am sure that the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) will be only too glad to correct me if I am wrong but I understand that the $20m shortfall that apparently will affect Victoria in the next six months is likely to mean a loss of jobs, not for one, two or even 200 people but for up to 2,000 employees of the Victorian Government, who work at the moment in Victorian hospitals. Quite frankly, I cannot see how any government could allow itself to compound a mistake, which was of its own making apparently, to affect so drastically a further 2,000 people in a period of massive unemployment not only in Victoria but also right across the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Grimes raised the hypothetical question of Federal Government interference in Queensland vis-a-vis the manner in which the Government is prepared to interfere with the Victorian Government's policy decisions on health matters. What is going to happen in States like Tasmania and South Australia when 1985 rolls around and those States too fall into the same sort of grant system that is now affecting Victoria? What will happen if, in the intervening period, the governments change, as is likely to occur in South Australia? How many more people will be thrown out of work simply because the Government makes some sort of arithmetic mistake and then is prepared to compound that mistake when the State government concerned attempts to take corrective action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that other honourable senators want to speak in this debate. I respond by saying that the argument put forward by Senator Haines is not sustainable. On 16 May, Mr Roper presented a paper in which he made it clear that the revenue shortfall in Victoria was due in part to that Government's incapacity to mount the appropriate resources to collect the money. The money was there. The services had been given. The money was recoverable. Mr Roper, at page 9 of his paper, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The incapacity of hospitals to devote the requisite resources to the pursuit of fees for all chargeable occasions of service-means that the hospital benefit funds are avoiding payment of benefits . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly the capacity was there for Victoria not to have a shortfall had it decided to put into place the resources which were necessary to collect what was its under a process to which we would not have objected. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to go over all the arguments that we have gone over as to why the Government opposes the levy introduced by the Victorian Government, but I should like to draw Senator Grimes's attention to page 1908 of yesterday's Senate Hansard. There Senator Harradine is reported as setting out some of the bad features of the levy and some of the systematic effects it will have which are undesirable. He made a number of points. I will not go through them. Among other things, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Many people in country districts of Victoria will not have the ability to go to outpatient departments. I am concerned about it because of the principle and the likely flow-on to other States. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on he makes this comment:</PARA>
<PARA> Also, whilst I consider that another problem about this whole question of a levy of the character that is being proposed in Victoria is that it appears to shed responsibility for accountability in certain public hospitals, let me say this very clearly . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I have had a chance to look at what my colleague said and I should like to endorse those kinds of criticisms. It is not just a simple matter of efficiency, as set out by Senator Grimes. It has some quite significant adverse effects and the Government will persist with the clauses as they are. It will oppose any move to remove the clauses. I do not wish to prolong the debate unduly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to prolong the debate but I have to answer a couple of points made by Senator Peter Baume. First of all, I spoke of the concern that Senator Harradine had for country people. I pointed out that in fact this disadvantage exists under the present system and is counterbalanced by other factors. It is inherent in the present system of voluntary health insurance. It is not unduly aggravated by the levy which is intended to be imposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second thing is that I think the costs of the collection of funds are important. It is not just in Victoria that a government is having difficulties in collecting out-patients fees, as Senator Baume has said. Hospitals are designed to assist people who are ill. If they have to divert manpower and finance to the collecting and processing of accounts, inevitably they have to have that much less in resources for the caring of people. The aim of this levy, which is certainly creating interest in other States, is to make the collection of out-patient fees more efficient and more equitable and to enable hospitals to concentrate more on treating people and less on running around trying to collect bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the final point I want to make. It concerns something that is frequently said in this place. It is false and it is an insult to the people in public hospitals to suggest that the best way of making them accountable for what they do is to have them going around collecting individual bills from people. One never hears comment of that sort about the Queensland hospital system from members of the Government. We only hear about it when we are talking about the Victorian or New South Wales hospital system. </PARA>

If the Victorian Government system is not good enough for the Minister, I suggest that the Queensland Government system is not good enough for him and he ought to get stuck into the Queensland system. The Minister should be a bit consistent and not try, because of his ideological blinkers, to put a State Government under difficulties, and should not put the jobs of hospital workers in Victoria under threat just because of the insistence of the Australian Medical Association and the voluntary health insurance funds in this matter. He should remember that the hospital associations and others are very much in favour of the procedures used in Victoria. I think we should consider their views, the views of the Victorian people and the views of other commentators in the field just occasionally.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It appears that this matter can be relatively easily overcome because it appears from the answers given today by the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) that there has been some misunderstanding between the Commonwealth Government and the Victorian Government. The Minister said today that in June 1982 the Minister for Health in Victoria, Mr Roper, wrote to his counterpart in the Commonwealth Government, Mr Carlton, indicating that it was the desire of the Victorian Government that the question of the capacity of the State of Victoria to raise the revenue proposed to be raised should be referred to the Commonwealth Grants Commission. At that stage apparently the Minister for Health considered that matter and, in a response to Mr Roper in August of this year, indicated that that was not, in his words, appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Peter Baume, the Minister representing the Minister for Health, has stated clearly to the chamber that it is now the attitude of Commonwealth Government to facilitate this reference to the Commonwealth Grants Commission. It seems to me that under those circumstances the raison d'etre for the intoduction of the levy in Victoria is gone because the initial argument that was mounted by the Victorian Government over this issue was that the Commonwealth Government, in considering the arrangements to be made for Victoria in respect of tax sharing and health grants, had underestimated the amount of money that Victoria could raise and its capacity to raise revenue in respect of public hospitals. It seems to me, therefore, that the undesirable features of the Victorian levy would not be necessary if an objective analysis were undertaken of Victoria's capacity to raise that revenue. I think that the whole of the chamber would agree, and I suspect that the Victorian Government also would agree, that if it could have avoided the type of levy that it introduced and had passed through the Victorian Parliament it would have done so. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a situation in which the Victorian Government has a responsibility for health. It has undoubted tax gathering powers that the Commonwealth should not take away from it. On the other hand, the Commonwealth Government is using its undoubted insurance power under the Constitution to block that levy. I am concerned, as I said last night, about the flow-on effects of all of this. One point that was raised by the Minister last night is that the Commonwealth Parliament has an interest in this matter for another reason and that is that the real tax gathered by the Victorian Government in that way is tax deductible because the people who are paying the levy are in fact paying the contributions, and that is tax deductible. That, of course, affects the Commonwealth Parliament 's tax gathering rights as well. So in my view there is in place, under the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Act, a mechanism to overcome the very problem for which the Government of Victoria has mounted this levy. My understanding now of the Minister, and it appears to be a fresh policy that the Minister has stated in the House today, is that the Commonwealth Government, to use his words, 'would facilitate the reference to the Grants Commission'. Therefore, in those circumstances, I am prepared at an appropriate time, to seek leave for the Senate in some way-whether it be this Committee or at the third reading stage-to request the Government to refer to the Commonwealth Grants Commission the question of the capacity of Victoria to raise the revenue proposed to be raised by the proposed taxation of health funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister having stated his Government's policy on this issue, the Government surely should go along with that proposal. If it is prepared to go along with it, I am prepared to support the Bill as it is, because what worries me is the timing of this whole episode. The Senate is faced with either having to pass the Bill or, if it knocks out these clauses, having to send the Bill back to the House of Representatives. We all know that the House of Representatives is getting up today-or whenever. The situation is: All right; if they refuse it, it comes back to us. What do we do at the end of that line? If we then still take out those two clauses, the Government can say, with some justification, that we are holding up the pensioner health benefits which are incorporated into the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> All that I am proposing is that this seems to me a way out of the problem. It seems to go to the crux of the issue, to the problem where it first started-the underestimation by the Commonwealth of the revenue gathering capacity of the Victorian hospitals-and then the matter can be referred to the Grants Commission . Obviously, once the Grants Commission has considered that matter it is then up to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Victorian Government to give due consideration to that and to come in with supplementary legislation. That seems the obvious way of overcoming this problem. Therefore, it is my intention to vote for the legislation as is, and it will then be my intention to move that proposition, as outlined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate Senator Harradine's difficulties. I appreciate that he has gone through the same sort of soul searching as people in the Australian Labor Party and, I suspect, people of the Australian Democrats have gone through. He knows, as we know, that the Government will attempt to accuse us of preventing people with sickness benefits from getting pensioner health cards if the legislation does not go through. But there is one aspect of the legislation which I believe Senator Harradine has ignored, and it has been the thing that has held us up. Firstly, I believe we should oppose the Government's action in clause 23 and Part IV, because that is the right thing to do. Secondly, we must consider the immediate consequences of the legislation going through as it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first consequence is that the health funds in Victoria, as they have said repeatedly, will immediately stop paying this levy. The second consequence is that as a result of that, the Victorian Government will be in immediate difficulty with its funding of hospitals. The third likely outcome of that, I am afraid, is that numbers of hospital workers will have their jobs threatened. What the Victorian Government must do if the legislation goes through in its present from is immediately to assist hospitals and others to set up what I think even Senator Peter Baume will admit is this complicated and administratively cumbersome system of ensuring that it collects all these outpatient fees. The only group which will benefit from this legislation going through, certainly in the short term, is the voluntary health funds. That is why they are putting on the pressure in the way in which they are. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The voluntary health funds will immediately have great delays before they have to pay up. They will have this great advantage of having money in their funds, invested, and all the other things that they do with it, and the Victorian Government-the people of Victoria, if you like, Senator Walters-will be the people who will suffer from this. It is for that reason that I do not believe that we should pass the legislation as it is. It is for that reason that this House should take note of the views of the Victorian Government and remove these three clauses from the legislation. Finally, the Government could, of course, take this legislation to the House of Representatives, accept the amendments and have it come back here. As it is not a cash sum, the Government can make simple arrangements, as exist now with the disadvantaged health card, to ensure that the sickness beneficiaries get their pensioner health benefits card retrospectively and are covered for illnesses which occur beyond 1 November . This chamber should not be blackmailed in this way into passing this legislation because that small group of sickness beneficiaries might not be eligible for their pensioner health benefits card next week. We are in this situation because the legislation came in too late.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make one final point. This is the third time in my period as shadow Minister for Social Security that the Government has adopted this tactic. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle did it when the Government attempted to abolish the funeral benefits. She said in this place, 'If you people do not accept the Bill and do not accept that we are abolishing the funeral benefits, the pensioners and unemployed beneficiaries will not be paid', and people on the Government side of the House described that as blackmail, and that is what it was. When we had earlier in the year legislation about payments to families and wives of people involved in industrial disputes, exactly the same thing happened with Senator Chaney. We were here until 1 o'clock or 2 o'clock in the morning with the Government saying: 'If you do not go along with every bit of this legislation, including the bit tacked on to it, we shall not pay the pensioners or unemployment beneficiaries, and it will be your fault.' As the people then accepted, they will also accept now that if this legislation to provide a pensioner health benefit card for sickness beneficiaries does not go through, it is the fault of no one but the Government. The fault is on the Government's side , firstly, because the legislation has come into this chamber so late; secondly, because the House of Representatives is getting up early, when its program, which we were all given, provided that it sit for another three weeks; and thirdly, because if the Government was really concerned about the matter, it could take the legislation back and get it back here in time. </PARA>
<PARA> This chamber should not be stood over by these blackmail-type tactics. If the Government just refuses to cop this amendment at all, if the Government takes the legislation back and will not have it, eventually the legislation will go through in some form, and there is no reason why arrangements cannot be made for those sickness beneficiaries to receive their entitlement to their pensioner health benefit card retrospectively-that is, their entitlement to medical treatment and to free pharmaceuticals. It may be a nuisance, but I believe that it is better that we be not stood over in this way and that we continue to oppose clause 23 and Part IV of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats support what Senator Grimes, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, has just said. We believe the action of the Government, in tacking these two irrelevant, extraneous matters on to the Budget Bill, is a sneaky exercise. It is a snide exercise. It is loaded with hypocrisy and it is a heartless act-trying to score cheap political capital at the expense of sick people. I hope that honourable senators on the Government benches will take heed of those accusations. I wanted to read into Hansard-because I believe it has not been done yet-a statement released today, of which I have a copy, of the Victorian Minister of Health, Mr Tom Roper. Either Mr Roper is telling an untruth-I do not believe for one moment he is-or the Senate has to answer Mr Roper's statements. The Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) has to answer the statements and allegations that I am about to read out. Apart from other things, I am a Victorian senator. These are serious statements by a Minister of the Crown in Victoria. His Press release reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Government was posing a direct threat to the jobs of thousands of Victorian health workers in its attempt to quash the Victorian Government's health levy . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I am leaving out the political asides that Mr Roper inevitably makes in his Press statements. I know the chamber will excuse me for doing that. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Put quite bluntly the Federal Government is playing politics with the jobs of hospital workers and the health of many Victorians. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an extraordinarily serious allegation for a Minister of the Crown to make against the Federal Minister for Health (Mr Carlton) and the Minister representing him in this chamber. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA> If the Federal Government's legislation is passed it will mean a shortfall of $ 20 million in the State's health funding. This can only be met by laying off staff. The saving would have to be made in the second half of this financial year and this would mean that up to 2,000 jobs could be lost before Christmas.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to hear from Senator Peter Baume whether that statement or that estimate from Mr Tom Roper, the Minister of Health in Victoria, is correct. Is this an extravagant or a wilful misleading of the public or this chamber? Can the Minister prove those words to be wrong? Has he any solution if he can see there is some validity in that statement? The statement goes on to say that there will also be longer waiting times and less efficient services. One could well say that Mr Roper is doing this for political purposes. It would be a strange political exercise. He has just been elected. I cannot see why he would be doing this. I cannot see why the Federal Labor Party and the Democrats would be taking the stand they are because with the influence Mr Fraser has with the media-I am talking about the people who write the headlines-there is no question that he will come out tomorrow with a misleading statement that the Senate is being obstructive, disruptive and holding up Budget legislation. I would like to hear from Senator Peter Baume this time, not Mr Carlton. Senator Peter Baume is in charge of the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1982 in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA> Why does the Government not allow it to be split? Why does it go to the despicable, sneaky and snide tactic of tacking on two extraneous matters, which are totally irrelavant to a Budget, on to a Budget Bill? Obviously it was so that he could go to the Press with a cheap headline to say: 'Look, the Senate is being obstructive and disruptive again'. That is a pretty rotten sort of exercise if the jobs of 2,000 health workers could be put at risk before Christmas. I am not necessarily accepting Mr Roper's figures but I want Senator Peter Baume to deny them in this chamber, to say that they are not right. I am very attracted to Senator Harradine's proposition, in its philosophical thrust, of having the Grants Commission substantiate or otherwise this claim. However, I do not trust this Federal Government on this issue. I am not prepared, as Senator Harradine is-with great respect to him-to give the legislation a blank cheque and pass clause 23 and Part IV of this Bill. Once that is done the party is over; the Bill goes back to the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I plead with the media to expose any attempt by Mr Fraser, the Liberal Party, or above all Mr Anthony, to make out that this is a plot by the Senate to obstruct the Government. The House of Representatives is getting up tonight or tomorrow. For how long has it sat or will it have sat when it finishes? In the second six months of this year it will have sat for only eight weeks-24 days out of six months. Yet this legislation is coming in here now. I can hear those highly paid people in Mr Fraser's office rattling their typewriters typing out Press releases. They will be up in the Press gallery before 6 o'clock saying: ' Look what the Senate has done to us again. If the Senate obstructs this Bill today it will not be passed before 1 November or 1 January when the benefits accrue to the beneficiaries in this Bill'. The Government will say: 'It is the Senate's fault'. I am sorry to say that there will be some members of the media- not all, thank God-who will run that naked headline on page one tomorrow: ' Fraser says ''Senate obstructs again'' '. They will then eulogise the actions of the Government even though it is getting up after sitting only 24 days of the last half of the year. I would have thought that that is one of the most outrageous things I have seen in the many years I have been here. I can remember a few years ago in the House of Representatives when Dudley Erwin and Billy Snedden abused the Parliament by using the guillotine to rush legislation through. Every newspaper in this country carried an editorial condemning the deterioration of parliamentary standards, using the Parliament as a rubber stamp . They did that to poor old Dudley Erwin, whose major crime was to whip through 15 Bills in an all night sitting. What is this doing to the parliamentary institution? Why is this irrelevancy tacked on? Where is the Government's philosophy about States' rights? If it does this to John Cain in Victoria why does it not chat up Bjelke-Petersen in Queensland, whose system of health insurance is so much further down the track than what is proposed by the Victorian Government? I hope that the media will look at the proposition that the Senate has a right to review legislation. We very strongly believe that we are exercising that right now in a proper way and responsible way without being obstructive. If this chamber decides to knock out these two clauses then why should the House of Representatives not come back the week after next, or whenever, to contemplate that amendment and amendments to other legislation?</PARA>
<PARA> The suggestion that Senator Harradine has put could be a way towards a compromise between the Government parties in the Senate and those non-government parties in the Senate. I believe if the matter of whether Mr Roper's figures are correct is handled sensibly, with the idea of trying to reach a consensus, it should be referred to the Grants Commission before the legislation is passed. Why not? I make this final plea to Senator Peter Baume: Why not split off the irrelevancy today? We will pass the Bill in five minutes. I say that without having to get the concurrence of Senator Grimes because I am sure he would agree . The Government can have the Bill intact in five minutes without clause 23 or Part IV. All the benefits accruing can then be granted. We would agree to obey the umpire's decision, if that is the way it can be expressed, about whether the figures of Mr Roper are fair dinkum or not. I do not think we can be fairer than that. But we are not going to be stood over by the Government, which appears to be the case at this stage. </PARA>

Fancy asking me to comment in detail on what was, in Mr Roper's statement, a most blatant attempt to blackmail the Senate by trying to pretend that jobs are at risk in Victoria as a result of what we do today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me answer several points. First of all, if one goes back over the years one will see that this Bill has always been an omnibus Bill. It has always contained a number of provisions which have ranged across the area of health insurance and benefits. This Bill is no different. I confirmed a moment ago that the proper Bill in which the matter which is being disputed now should be contained is the Bill before the Committee. This is the proper Bill in terms of Government policy and legislation. Any claim that there is a tacking on is to ignore the quality of legislation of this sort over the years. It is to ignore the fact that this legislation always contains a variety of matters-matters such as the one we are now considering and matters related to the regulation of health insurance. Future legislation of this sort will do the same. There is nothing improper in including this material in the legislation before us. As I said yesterday when the question of divisibility came up, I was not arguing the question of divisibility; I was arguing what I thought was the proper approach on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain questions have come up about what will happen if Victoria does not have this excessive and punitive levy in place. First of all, Victoria still has a fee collecting mechanism in place. Uninsured persons, from whom a fee is collectable, are still attending hospitals. There is no reason why Victoria cannot charge the fees which are due to it for out-patients as well as inpatient services. There is no reason why Victoria cannot now put in place the mechanism for collecting fees which was not previously in place. But more than that-and this is what seems to have been missed by honourable senators; I think it has been missed by Senator Chipp-this matter does not just involve a choice between two methods, between a levy proposed by Victoria and a charge on every patient, as was the previous practice. I put it to Senator Chipp that a number of mechanisms are being developed around Australia. In South Australia negotiations between government and the funds are well in progress to try to arrange for the collection of out-patients charges by a form of direct billing. This arrangement may be made for administrative convenience, but at least it will relate the collection to the number of services rendered. There are various ways in which one might be able to collect revenue which might be suitable for a particular hospital system and a particular State and by agreement between the funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Government, of course, increased its charges very considerably from 1 July. We did our calculations on the charges as they then were. But I just remind honourable senators that the Victorian out-patient fee has gone up from $15 to $20, the multi-bed ward fee from $80 to $110 a day and the single room fee from $110 to $150 a day. Therefore Victoria's revenue raising capacity has gone up considerably as a result of what it has done. It has the staff to collect charges now. It can go back to collecting them. Senator Harradine has proposed that if the Government's provisions remain it will be appropriate for the Senate to seek to have a reference made to the Grants Commission. I would have no objection to following that course. The Government wishes to see these provisions retained. It is early in the afternoon; the Committee will do as it wishes. </PARA>

It was not a majority decision-the vote was even-nevertheless these provisions have been negated. I hope that, if the Government chooses not to accept the Senate's amendments the procedure I have foreshadowed will be adopted when the measure is returned to the Senate. It would be a very proper and effective way of overcoming a very difficult circumstance which faced the Victorian Government and which now faces the Senate also. Today for the first time, the Government said that it was prepared to facilitate a reference to the Grants Commission so that it could investigate the capacity of the State of Victoria to raise revenue-about which there was an underestimation by the Commonwealth Government itself.

<PARA> I wish to thank honourable senators for their indulgence in allowing me to table this Report on such a busy day. I regret that there is limited time for this report to be debated in the Senate but the Committee believes that it was more important to make the Report available for the information of senators so that informed discussion might ensue both in this place and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a most significant Report which impacts upon the whole of financial administration as it, for the first time, brings to the fore the question of proper standards that should be applied in Government accounting. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's 199th Report, on the Form and Standard of Financial Statements of Commonwealth Undertakings, is the third in its series of discussion papers on significant issues of accountability and management in the Australian public sector. The previous discussion papers tabled by the Committee were on Internal Audit, and the Collection and Dissemination of Statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1980 a Joint Working Party consisting of officials from the Department of Finance and the Auditor-General's Office published an exposure draft and abridged report on proposed guidelines for the form and standard of financial statements of Commonwealth undertakings. The Joint Working Party asked the Public Accounts Committee to comment on the guidelines and this report provides a substantive response to this request. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth considered that the Joint Working Party's request was timely because it has been apparent for many years that financial statements of many statutory authorities do not reflect the full scope of management accountability which devolves from Government. While acknowledging that reserve powers are usually granted to Ministers under enabling legislation for the creation of authorities, the Committee considers it is management which shapes the destiny of undertakings in everyday affairs and operations. </PARA>
<PARA> In such circumstances we cannot support propositions that statements of receipts and payments indicating legal and financial compliance with Statutes and appropriations properly convey adequate disclosure of operations in financial terms. Managers of undertakings should be accountable for the use of all resources over which they exercise control. Acquisitions and depletion of resource must be integrated with operating transactions so that informed decisions about potential solvency and the capacity to undertake objectives of the authority can be made. This theme is central to formation of the guidelines and modern concepts of effective public sector management. </PARA>
<PARA> The members of my Committee fully support efforts to increase relevance, uniformity and consistent application of sound accounting methods, so that financial reporting in the public sector will better serve the community and particular parties at interest. We believe that parliamentary support for this undertaking will enhance the commitment of statutory bodies to the proposed guidelines and strengthen co-operation needed for their successful adoption and implementation. The Committee is heartened to learn that the general response to the exposure draft has been favourable and encouraging. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of its deliberations, which have extended over nearly two years, the Committee has formulated several recommendations designed to improve the standard of financial reporting at all levels of government throughout Australia . The major recommendations of the discussion paper are that:</PARA>
<PARA> A genuine research effort should be mounted employing resources from both within the accounting profession and outside of it, to systematically construct a relevant theoretical framework for financial reporting by public sector authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Any adoption of private sector accounting standards should be seen as a short term solution. </PARA>
<PARA> Cash based accounting should be eliminated as the primary focus for financial reporting by authorities except for extremely small agency situations and accrual accounting should be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> Funds statements of Commonwealth authorities are to adopt a total resources rather than working capital or cash basis of funds and are to be published as part of the formal financial statements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Working Party should join with accounting and other interested groups to further evaluate the nature of financial reporting by public sector bodies. Government financial support at Commonwealth and State levels should be sought by a suitably organised proposal from the accounting profession. </PARA>
<PARA> Program statements should be prepared by all Government undertakings except where such a statement would disclose necessarily confidential information. </PARA>
<PARA> The audited financial statements of all Government organisations should be presented to Parliament within six months of the close of the financial year to which they relate. </PARA>
<PARA> An Accounting Standards Review Committee should be established to examine Government accounting and reporting standards, and to make recommendations for improvement. This committee should consist of representatives from the Parliament, the Public Service and the accounting profession. </PARA>
<PARA> Discussions should be held between relevant Commonwealth and State Government ministers and officials on the desirability of introducing a uniform set of accounting standards and procedures for public sector authorities at all levels of government throughout Australia. An appropriate mechanism for this issue to be considered would be for a working party to be established by the Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA>In considering the question of accounting standards for government, the Committee, by necessity, has had to examine the adequacy of many private sector methods. In its examination of the private sector standard setting process the Committee is concerned only with its relevance to the public sector. No judgments are made on the adequacy of the process or standards for the private sector itself. </PARA>
<PARA> In the longer term it may be possible to draw a closer link between private sector and public sector reporting. In the meantime, the Committee observes that differences, including the noticeable tendency of the community to identify operations of statutory bodies with the appropriate Minister rather than with management, are becoming more pronounced. If the control of these bodies is seen as a function of the Westminster system of government then accounting principles based on the separation of ownership and control may need modification. A distinct and rigorous philosphy of accounting in the public sector may need to be formulated. </PARA>
<PARA> At an early stage in the preparation of this paper the Committee decided that it was essential for government accountants throughout Australia to discuss and evaluate the issues addressed by the Joint Working Party's Report. To fulfil this requirement the Committee, in association with the Government Accountants Groups of the Australian Society of Accountants, conducted seminars in all State capital cities. These seminars were attended by over 1,000 accountants, which indicates that there is a high degree of professional concern on the issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The degree of enthusiasm shown by all sections of the accounting profession to participate in these discussions has impressed the Committee. We are conscious that a strong effort from all professional accounting interests is required if substantial progress is to be made in improving financial reporting in the public sector. The Committee wishes to take this opportunity to thank all those involved in these seminars. </PARA>
<PARA> In common with its other discussion papers, the Committee recognises that many of the views expressed are subject to disagreement and debate. We would therefore welcome further contributions or comments from interested individuals or organisations on any aspect of this discussion paper. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also wishes to express its appreciation to its senior advisor on accounting, Dr Max Aiken, also Mr David Shand, Dr Ian Ball and many others for their considerable assistance and advice in the preparation of this paper. The Committee also wishes to place on record its appreciation for the work of the Sectional Committee, which I was privileged to chair. Other members of the Sectional Committee responsible for the preparation of this paper were Senator George Georges and Mr Jim Bradfield, MP and Mr David Connolly, MP. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to thank honourable senators for their indulgence in allowing me to table this report on such a busy day. I regret that there is limited time for this report to be debated in the Senate but the Committee believed that it was more important to make the report available for the information of senators so that informed discussion might ensue both in this place and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, copies of this report are limited at the moment due to constraints in printing, but there will be copies for perusal in the Table Office and the Parliamentary Library. It is expected that there will be sufficient copies for distribution to all senators shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> The report has particular significance to the community and the Parliament on three counts. First, bilateral overseas aid is a major item in the Commonwealth Budget. Bilateral aid forms the major part of Australia's official development assistance budget, a budget which totalled $727,207,000 for 1982-83. This is nearly half of one per cent of Australia's gross national product, or over one and a half per cent of total Commonwealth Government outlays; that is, over one and a half per cent of all the moneys expended by the Commonwealth itself on Commonwealth programs and of moneys provided to the States, local government and other agencies to support programs they administer. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, the report is significant because it provides a rare opportunity for the Parliament to examine the way in which this enormous sum of money is expended. Such opportunities are unfortunately infrequent and a substantial part of the Committee's report is devoted to a description of the bilateral aid program, to suggestions as to how the aid program could be more effectively examined by the Parliament and, perhaps most importantly, how public and community awareness of the principles which guide the aid program and the resources devoted to it can be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the report has a significance in that it is the first report of the Public Accounts Committee on an efficiency audit. It treads new ground for the Committee and the Committee had devoted the final chapter of its report to the examination of some of the issues and problems raised by this form of auditing and suggestions as to how efficiency auditing could be made more effective and useful to administrators and the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has divided its conclusions in respect of the bilateral aid program into four. After a brief summary of the Auditor-General's recommendations and the resources devoted to the overseas aid program and its administration, the Committee has focused on four areas where it believes changes to current administrative practices and arrangements will have the greatest beneficial impact on the aid program. </PARA>
<PARA> While the report's recommendations form an integrated package designed to improve Australian and overseas perceptions of the 'quality of Australian bilateral overseas aid', I would like to highlight a few of the most significant recommendations and conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the Committee believes that, overall, the Australian aid program is adequately managed within the resources available to it; that it has a high reputation overseas and has provided an important input into development of Third World countries. The Committee believes that there is significant scope for improvement to the quality of the Australian aid in terms of the management of the bilateral aid program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that the audit report provides a blueprint for efficient and effective aid program administration and that with only limited exceptions, the Auditor-General's recommendations should be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee does, however, have reservations about the demands that the Auditor-General's suggestions will make on the staffing and physical resources of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will require special assistance at the parliamentary level to continue to fulfil his parliamentary and ministerial responsibilities. We have therefore recommended that the Department of Foreign Affairs urgently examine, in consultation with the Public Service Board, the staffing and physical resources available to ADAB. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also recommended that the Government consider the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary for Overseas Aid to assist the Minister for Foreign Affairs on overseas aid matters. The Committee believes that this latter recommendation and the recommendation that the Minister for Foreign Affairs issue policy statements to the Parliament, his Department and the public periodically, are essential prerequisites to the development of parliamentary and community debate on the nature and direction of Australia's overseas aid. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in respect to efficiency audits generally, the Committee has recommended that the Auditor-General prepare guidelines specifying in broad terms the scope of efficiency audits to assist the proposed government review of efficiency auditing and that the report of the Government review be referred to a parliamentary committee for further examination when completed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes that overseas aid plays such a significant role in Australian relations with developing countries and is such a significant proportion of Commonwealth outlays that it is essential that development aid issues should be widely understood and debated in Australia. I commend the report to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA>CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the Customs Tariff Bill 1982 now before the Senate provides for a new Customs Tariff Act to replace the Customs Tariff Act 1966. The requirement for a new Act results from the Government's decision to introduce a simplified tariff based on recommendations made in the Industries Assistance Commission's Report of 30 November 1981 on customs tariff simplification. The recommendations do not substantially affect the assistance afforded to Australian industry. In general the changes in rates of duty do not exceed plus or minus five percentage points with equivalent changes for rates not expressed in ad valorem terms. The bill contains some changes to the IAC's recommendations to take account of Government decisions taken on particular industry reports after the IAC had submitted its simplification report. It was also necessary to make a number of other minor changes in line with the overall simplification objectives. Other variations have been made to take account of obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and bilateral trade obligations such as those under the Papua New Guinea-Australia Trade and Commercial Relations Agreement (PATCRA) and the Canada-Australia Trade Agreement (CANATA). </PARA>
<PARA> On 13 April, the Government announced its decision to introduce a simplified tariff and indicated that the changes I have just outlined would be made to the IAC recommendations. In addition it was decided that the current tariff structures and rates of duty should continue for the time being. Where goods are covered by an IAC report not implemented at 2 July 1982 or due for report before 1 January 1983. It is intended that the new Act should come into operation on 1 January 1983. Amendments to take account of Government decisions made before then, together with amendments to provide for New Zealand rates and some developing country rates yet to be decided, will be made by gazette notice after proclamation of but before the date of operation. In its announcement earlier this year, the Government recognised that the Australian tariff had become, for the public and private sectors alike, an increasingly difficult document to work with. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill includes a major revision of the sections of the current Act and a reduction in the number of Schedules of rates of duty. Provisions for parts directions and concentrates orders have been eliminated, together with all references to support duties and primage duties. Significant reductions have been made in the number of tariff classifications and the number of different rates of duty contained in the present tariff. As IAC reports not yet finalised or still under consideration are implemented, it can be anticipated there will be further reductions. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the simplified customs tariff is easier to read with less complex Schedules, and improved precision and clarity in description of goods and rates of duty. I am confident that users will find the new tariff better to work with than the present document. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>CUSTOMS TARIFF (ANTI-DUMPING) AMENDMENT BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill amends the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975. It is complementary to the Customs Tariff Bill 1982 which I have just introduced. The Bill amends sections 8 and 10 of the principal Act where references are made to Schedules of the Customs Tariff Act which have been renumbered in the Customs Tariff Bill 1982. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>CUSTOMS TARIFF (MISCELLANEOUS AMENDMENTS) BILL 1982</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill amends the following Acts: Administrative Decisions ( Judicial Review) Act 1977; Consular Privileges and Immunities Act 1972; Customs Act 1901; Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935. The Bill is complementary to the Customs Tariff Bill 1982 which I have just introduced. The amendments take account of the redrafting of the sections and renumbering of the Schedules to the Customs Tariff Act to which references are made in the various Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> The only change of substance is the redrafting of sections 151 and 151A of the Customs Act 1901. These new sections need to be read in conjunction with the new section 15 of the Customs Tariff Act 1982 when determining the conditions under which certain goods from specified countries are eligible for preferential tariff treatment. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The primary Bill in this package is the Customs Tariff Bill 1982-a very substantial Bill of some 310 pages which, despite its bulk and despite the promise held out by its title, does not really raise the kind of fundamental issues one might expect to be raised about the shape and direction of the Australian economy in the future of manufacturing industry. Far from being an exciting Bill about the future of the economy and manufacturing industry, really it is essentially just a piece of housekeeping legislation aimed at clearing a very significant path through the jungle of provisions and Schedules which have constituted our major tariff legislation. The last time we debated tariff legislation was, I think, on 28 April of this year when we debated the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, which was particularly notorious for the increased tariff that the Bill imposed on wheelchairs in the face of very strong opposition from the Opposition side of Parliament and indeed from many people in the community as a whole. That Bill was the last, or perhaps the second last, in a long line of Bills which have been amending in one way or another the Customs Tariff Act 1966. The full list of those amending Bills-a very long list indeed-is set out in a Schedule to the Bill before the Senate at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill marks the beginning of a new era for customs tariff legislation insofar as it repeals and completely replaces the 1966 parent legislation and the welter of subsequent amendments to it. This Bill establishes a new and simplified tariff regime which is set out in the Third Schedule of the Bill. It is a rather lengthy Schedule, occupying 264 of the 310 pages in this document. In doing so, the Bill implements the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission which, in one of its less controversial documents, reported in November 1981 on the question of customs tariff simplification, a report which was tabled in the Parliament in April of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> When I spoke in the Senate in April of this year on the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill to which I earlier referred I made specific reference to the IAC report and, after incorporating in Hansard the summary of the Commission's recommendations, indicated that the Opposition looked forward very much to the advent of the legislative simplification there foreshadowed. In that spirit we now very much welcome the appearance of this Bill. In simplifying and streamlining the classification tables and the duty rates, involving as that streamlining does some marginal changes to the rates imposed in respect of particular goods but with no variation amounting to more than plus or minus 5 per cent and as such not attracting, I understand, much controversy, we see this legislation as going a long way towards eradicating the widespread and perfectly understandable lack of understanding of these matters-a situation which has led to a good deal of confusion and inefficiency and, in the words of the IAC and most importantly, 'a high level of misapplication of the tariff law'. Such administrative improvements, in addition to ensuring that Parliament's intention is in fact implemented, will lead we believe, as does the IAC, to cost benefits and greater productivity with consequent flow-on benefits to consumers and ultimately to the economy generally. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time we make the point that the process of simplification is a continuing one and, now that there is in existence this Bill introducing a simplified tariff, that progress should not be allowed to slip away. We acknowledge the various factors which were well identified by the Opposition's spokesman, Mr Hurford, in speaking on this matter in the other place, and which promote complexity in this kind of legislation. We make the point again that there is a need for continuing vigilance. Specifically, following Mr Hurford's contribution in the other place on 9 September, I urge on behalf of the Opposition that a unit be created within the Bureau of Customs to ensure that in all negotiations of trade agreements due consideration will be given to the implications of this exercise in simplification. Similarly, this unit could ensure that any revisions of tariff would take into account the need to maintain simplicity. It is all too easy in this kind of exercise for the pressures of the moment to result in a wilderness of single instances rather than the kind of broadbanding that is involved in this kind of simplification exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> I also repeat the call made by Mr Hurford, the member for Adelaide, for the computerisation of tariff information so that the industry can have accurate and up-to-date information at all times. One would think that that is a simple enough request or demand in this technological era but it is one which so far seems to have been beyond the resources of the Customs authority. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other reference I would make specifically to the provisions of this Bill is a quick one to a couple of matters raised by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills when it looked at this legislation, as it does with all Bills, with a view to its civil liberty implications. Points were raised by the Committee in relation to the ministerial discretion conferred in clause 25 of this Bill and also, although less obviously, in clause 9, conferring a particular ministerial power to in fact exercise a delegated legislative authority in a fairly spectacular way. I do not think it is necessary to go into the detail of the matters raised in the fifteenth report of the Committee in relation to these matters except to say that the Committee, of which I am a member, has a continuing concern about ministerial power being exercised in the way that is here drawn attention to. Continuing discussions are going on between that Committee and the relevant Minister to see what can be done about making some changes to the legislation to ensure that that ministerial discretion is not exercised in such a way that it abdicates parliamentary authority in the future, or in such a way as to ensure that there is a lack of avenue for parliamentary scrutiny of the way in which that legislative authority is in fact exercised. </PARA>
<PARA> The only remaining matter to which I wish to advert is again the matter of wheelchairs which, as I said, I spoke about, as did many of my colleagues in the other place, when the April amending Bill was going through Parliament. The Opposition's view then was and now remains that it is quite unconscionable for the Government to impose, as it has done, a duty on wheelchairs which amounts, in terms of its dollar implications, to something like $300 per wheelchair and which can and has been having the effect of putting the purchase of wheelchairs beyond the reach of many who need them. </PARA>
<PARA> We have taken the view that it is not appropriate for a tariff to apply. As with so many other goods, the better way of doing it would have been to have a bounty or subsidy for local production instead of placing a tax on imports which is the way this operates. The matter was raised by Joan Child in the House of Representatives when speaking to this Bill a few weeks ago. The response of the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, was that the Government would have a further look at this matter. That was seven weeks ago-in September. We simply ask: What is the answer? We hope that in the ministerial reply on this occasion the wheelchair occupants of the nation will get a slightly better deal and a more sensitive response from the Government than they have had so far. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Senate Select Committee on Industrial Relations Legislation was presented to the Senate on Tuesday of this week. For one reason or another a tabling speech was not made then. I now make that tabling speech. The Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1982 and the Commonwealth Employees (Voluntary Membership of Unions) Bill 1982 were referred to the Select Committee in May of this year. The Committee received 71 submissions and heard 42 witnesses, including the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Those submissions raised questions about the Bills going to the very heart of the Australian system of conciliation and arbitration. The Senate particularly asked the Committee to report on: Firstly, the desirability or otherwise of encouraging the development of industry-based unions in Australia, and the best methods of providing changes in the structure of the Australian trade union organisation; secondly, whether the provision of voluntary unionism and the removal of power to award preference to unionists will contribute to industrial peace and an improvement of the industrial relations climate and, thirdly, whether the right of employers to stand down employees as a result of industrial action without reference to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is consistent with modern industrial practices and will contribute to industrial peace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report goes into 119 pages or thereabouts. It is not my intention to dwell at length with the evidence which was presented to us. That evidence forms a body of information and opinion which merits considerable discussion among the industrial relations community and will provide a valuable base for further considerations by the Government. I go directly to the matters to which the Committee was specifically asked to direct its attention. First of all, I deal with industry unions. On this subject conflicting concepts were aired and the desirability of encouraging by legislation the development of industry-based unions was seriously questioned. It was the view of the Committee that union structures do not predominantly determine industrial relations outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the Committee considered the operation of section 142 of the existing Act, which has served to limit the number of competing unions thus reducing the incidence of demarcation disputes. The Government's proposed legislation provides that this section will have no effect where it might prevent the registration of individual organisations. This section, which is known as the conveniently belong section, has been in the principal Act for a number of years. Evidence indicates that the result of the Government's proposed legislation would be overlapping coverage between new industry unions and existing unions which would lead to further inter-union disputation and the possibility of further proliferation of unions. Evidence taken by the Committee supported the Committee's view that the proposed legislation would increase industrial disputation. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence was also given to the Committee which persuaded it to acknowledge existing difficulties of amalgamation, particularly evidence that was provided to us by the Australian Boot Trades Employees Federation and the Australian Textiles Workers Union. The Committee does not favour uninhibited amalgamations, but considers that these should take place only after a community of interest test has been satisfied. The Committee suggests that in amalgamation ballots 25 per cent of the membership should be required to record a vote and of those voting at least two-thirds should be required to vote in favour. Alternatively, at least 25 per cent of the total membership should vote in favour. For the reasons outlined in the report the Committee recommends that the Senate not pass the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbritration Amendment Bill relating to the encouragement of industry-based unions. The Committee suggests that, in the interests of smooth industrial relations, before any further legislative action is contemplated in this area the Government consult with the National Labour Consultative Council and registered organisations which are likely to be affected. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as the second specific matter to which the Senate Select Committee was asked to direct its attention is concerned-that is to say, the abolition of preference-that is dealt with in chapter 4 of the report. Firstly, let me say that although issues of preference and voluntary unionism enjoy a high political profile, the Committee received no substantive evidence from any employee claiming to have been directly aggrieved by the operation of preference clauses despite the widespread public invitations issued for persons to make submissions to the Committee. At least one general submission was received relating to conscientious objection rights of sub-contractors. This was taken up with the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. Honourable senators will recall that the interim report of the Committee was brought into the Senate last month. Since the tabling of that report, which raised serious doubts about proposed section 4B, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Macphee) has written to the Committee, but the doubts of the Committee have not been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee noted that the Government intends that its proposed legislation will weaken the power of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to deal with union membership disputes. The Committee shares the view generally expressed by witnesses that the proposed legislation would not be conducive to industrial peace and would further unsettle the industrial relations climate. The Committee again noted that the Government's intention for its legislation was-to use the Government's own words as appeared in the Minister's second reading speech-to provide a better balance in the powers, rights and duties of employers and employees. Clearly, this legislation would fundamentally disturb this balance in favour of employers. The Committee considers that the proposed legislation is an undesirable and unwarranted intervention into the field of industrial relations, particularly at a time when high levels of unemployment have already disturbed this balance. The Committee believes quite firmly that viable unions are essential for the operation of Australia's system of conciliation and arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee considers that the proposed new section 144A would undermine this viability to an unacceptable extent and it recommends that it not be incorporated in the Act. I emphasise that the Committee considers that the proposed new section 144A would undermine this viability-that is, the viability upon which the system of conciliation and arbitration depends-to an unacceptable extent. I recommend that proposed new section 144A be not included in the Act. For similar reasons the Committee recommends that the existing section 47-that is, the power to award preference-should be retained in the Act. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that the amendments proposed by clauses 3, 4 (2), 5, 7, 9 and 20 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1982 should not be incorporated in the Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to comment briefly on the report of the Senate Select Committee on Industrial Relations Legislation. I want to do so in the context of apprising the Senate of the environment in which this legislation was considered. I think the Senate will recall that the legislation was introduced some time ago. I cannot recall the exact date; it is recorded in the report. The legislation was referred to a select committee of the Senate. In a sense the legislation which was referred to the Committee came out of the ministry of Mr Ian Viner as Minister for Industrial Relations. Mr Viner developed a number of views about the Australian industrial relations system upon which he implanted what seemed at the time to be an indelible mark, but it now appears to be washing away. In a sense it was in that context that the Committee had to look at the proposals in the Bill before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to remind the Senate of the somewhat changed environment in relation to industrial relations considerations which is revealed in a speech of the current Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Ian Macphee, in a speech he gave to the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia on 24 September this year. On page 4 of that speech Mr Macphee made the point that the industrial relations challenge facing Australia was a major issue for the Australian community in the 1980s. That is something with which I agree. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> To come to grips with the issues raised we need to be willing to look at the options available with open minds. We need to be clear-headed about the nature of the industrial relations scene in Australia. We need to recognise that while some objectives might be achievable in the short term others will take some time . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, it is essential for employers and governments to have a close working relationship with the union movement, and thereby seek through this process to have the union movement accept the responsibilities that go with its position in society. </PARA>
<PARA>He referred to the practical limitations of the industrial relations legislation . At page 7 he went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> On the question of improving the framework--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the framework of industrial relations legislation-</PARA>
<PARA>I have asked my Department to undertake a wide ranging review of our existing industrial relations system. I have had discussions with the NLCC on the way this study will be carried out. It will be an internal review, although of course we will be consulting closely with the industry parties because of the comprehensive nature of the exercise. I expect that it will take some time to complete. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister went on to make some fairly favourable comments-I suppose I can describe them as that-about the desirability of having centralised wage fixation in Australia, a view which was quite contrary to the view expressed by Mr Viner last year. I want to make the intial point that the legislation which the Senate Select Committee considered was, in a sense, a brainchild of Minister Viner, a brainchild which was sort of 'euthenased' by the arrival of a new Minister with a somewhat different point of view. There is nothing new about that with respect to this Government and the sort of ad hockery that goes on in this area. It is in that context that this Select Committee report has to be considered. Senator Harradine has dealt-as much as he had time to do-with some of the major issues the report raises. Let me make one or two comment on one or two of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe very strongly that it is desirable that existing institutions in Australia be adapted as much as possible to changing circumstance. I do not believe in their destruction. I believe in continuity of institutions, particularly at the present time because of the very difficult circumstances with which this country is faced. One can look at some of the issues which arose in the context of this report and take what is perhaps the minor issue of the three major issues-the matter of the automatic right of stand down of employees. The suspicions the majority of members of the committee had about this matter are more and more relevant every day as the employment context in Australia becomes more and more difficult. In every day's newspaper one reads about employees in various places being asked to work a four-day week or a three-day week on four days pay or three days pay respectively and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> In that sort of economic context the automatic right of stand down by an employer I believe is much more susceptible to abuse than it has been in better economic times. I am not in any sense condemning the approach Senator Hamer and some of his colleagues on the Committee took on this issue. I understand it, but I am saying that I think it is very important that that issue be seen in the context of contemporary times and what are likely to be the times of the immediate future. If one goes back over the history of industrial arbitration in Australia and reads the cases on stand down of employees one sees the reason the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has intervened is that the right of employers to stand down without pay has been abused. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were fewer strikes this year because Senator Chaney's government has achieved a record level of unemployment in Australia. As long as the Government continues to run unemployment at the level at which it now is, and when it gets worse, there will probably be fewer strikes. The Government will be able to say: 'We have achieved a great thing. We have less strikes because we have half a million people unemployed'. I would not have thought that that is an advance in Government policy. The issue to be grappled is, of course, the strike and stand-down matter. I just make that comment about the stand-down provision because industrial relations is a dynamic thing and is very dependent upon employment in the country generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Harradine said something about the matter of preference. I congratulate Senator Harradine on his chairmanship of the Committee because I think he has done a very fine job. I did not agree with all his views and he did not agree with all of mine-none of us agreed on everything. It was a very good working Committee in the sense that I believe all of us learnt something from the experience of being on it, with the possible exception of Senator Walters. We were able to exchange views in a spirit of give and take. Many of the points which were raised by Senator Hamer and Senator Withers, although they have not ultimately agreed with my view in the final report, made an impression on me. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to turn finally to the question of industry unionism. So far as I am concerned the report is a little soft on that issue. I am a little keener about the encouragement of the notion of industry unionism than the majority of Committee members. What I would like to have seen happen is for something to have been written into the report-this is a matter for later debate-which would provide that community of interest be a criterion in amalgamations of unions and that unions should not be allowed to amalgamate unless it is a step towards industry unionism. </PARA>

I am glad to see that progress is now being made on the Committee on a unanimous basis. Agreement was reached that those provisions should be changed. I commend the other members of the Committee for their work in preparing this report. I hope we will have a further occasion to talk about it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chaney said that it will seem longer. Perhaps it will. Will it be longer for me or for him? I am not quite clear. I would like to make one point at the outset. In my view the Senate refers far too little legislation to our committees for public review. I think the whole system would be greatly improved if more legislation were referred to the Senate committees. I think some honourable senators would be aware that I think all legislation should be referred to such committees although that would require major changes to the structure and procedures of the Senate. What is peculiar about this situation is that on one of the rare occasions when we sent legislation to a committee we referred it to a select committee instead of one of the legislative and standing purpose committees. That is a most peculiar procedure. We have a network of eight legislative committees which are supposed to cover the full range of Government activities. Surely when a piece of legislation needs consideration by a Senate committee it should be referred to one of those committees. I think it was very regrettable-</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Industrial relations is very important. I want to spend some time on another point. In my view, the present structure of those committees does not cover some areas very well. Industrial relations is one such matter. I would be very sorry, for instance, to see it fall into the hands of lawyers and be an extension of the activities of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. We would never solve anything. That is a different matter and a matter about which I feel quite strongly. As a member of this Committee I have to go to great pains to show why in one area I agreed with the conclusions of the Committee but why I disagreed with it in two other areas. The fact that I disagreed might be less surprising than the fact that I reached agreement with the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was not happy with the proposals in the Bill regarding industry unions. In particular, I was not happy at the fact that at no stage had an industry union been defined. There was no clear thought by which the Committee could determine exactly what people were talking about when they referred to industry unions. I will give one extreme view. The Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union appeared to have the view that any job that involved metal should be part of an industry union controlled by them. At the other extreme, another group of people in the dry cleaning business thought that there should be a dry cleaning union. If we broke the unions down to that extent we would have thousands of them. </PARA>
<PARA> What is needed before we take this matter any further is some discussion, thought and consideration about what we mean by industry unions. Once we define what we mean by industry unions we can start to analyse the advantages, disadvantages and problems. I think that the advantages would be very great. We cannot conceal the fact that there would be problems. I should like to give two or three examples. It would change our present notions of comparative wage justice if we had industry unions. That in many ways would be difficult to apply . There would be problems about how staff and professional people would fit into an industry union. I think there would be problems about the transferability of trade qualifications from one industry to another. People could be doing the same sort of job in different industries. These are some of the problems but I do not think they are insuperable. All these problems have to be thought through . I do not think that we can look at models such as the West German and Swedish ones which are often spoken about. They have very large and complex unions but only a small number. They have less than 20 unions in each case. I cannot see that being a practical solution for Australia. I do not think that the Australian Council of Trade Unions industry groups are genuine industry groups. I understand that they were put together, not from the view of community of interest but in order-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was not for the community of interest of the employer but of the trade union leaders in the particular union concerned. It was done to give some people a good power base. It is not the basis on which I think we should define our own industry unions. I think that if we looked at the structure of industry unions we would probably decide that it was desirable to have something like 60 or 70 unions. That has to be looked at. I have advanced some of the problems but others also have to be looked at. Let me make this point quite clear. This will not be achieved only by amalgamation. If we are to have, say, 60 or 70 unions, there would have to be amalgamations and breakups of unions because many unions now straddle several industries by any possible definition of an industry for union purposes. Therefore, we would have to look at how that would be achieved. In the short term I think that amalgamations, when the community of interest test which Senator Button mentions applies, would be desirable. I think that if we can we should discourage amalgamations which would not help the establishment of future industry unions. The urgent task in my view is for the Government to set in process discussions about what industry unions are, how they would operate, what their problems would be and what their advantages and disadvantages would be. Although the Government, in my view, should not impose industry unions it should give a very strong lead in bringing them about.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I would like to turn briefly to the recommendation of the Committee with which we disagree. I think it is common knowledge that the Committee was divided on a number of matters. The first thing I would like to make clear is that we accept that the whole system of conciliation and arbitration is based on the understanding that unions must adequately represent all employees. Anything that would destroy the ability of unions effectively to represent all employees would be very damaging to our system. I do not believe that that would be done by what the Government proposes. We also have to consider the rights of individuals not to join unions. We have to consider how those rights can be made effective in the current industrial climate. If one could confine union activities to work place matters one could make out a very good case for unionism to be compulsory. I would not find that objectionable, but that is not a practical proposition. There is no reasonable way we would be able to confine union activities to the work place. Therefore, I do not think that is a worthwhile approach. Therefore, as we cannot confine union activities to the work place, we believe that the Government must do all that it can to ensure an individual the right to elect whether to join a union and to ensure that such a decision would have no effect on his ability to work in that particular job. If unions want to have members, what they should do is attract them by the services that they offer to their members. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter on which I dissented, together with other members of the Committee, was the question of automatic stand downs. When the original Conciliation and Arbitration Act was passed in 1904, it was widely believed that there would be an end to strikes. There would be conciliation and, if that failed, there would be arbitration which would be binding on all parties concerned. We all know that that system has not worked. But what the unions appear to be asking for, although they are not prepared to accept it is binding arbitration when they wish to go on strike. They wish to see binding arbitration decisions before employers can stand down employees who cannot usefully be employed. I do not think that is a reasonable distinction. I believe that employers should have equivalent rights to stand down workmen who cannot usefully be employed because of strike action as those same unionists have to go on strike. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate will recall that, when we first debated the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill, I described it in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Potentially the most dangerous, inflamatory and repressive piece of legislation introduced into this place in my term. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite the passage of five more very interesting months, during which time many pieces of legislation have been passed through the Senate, some of them with quite odious aspects, I believe that the original statement that I made about the industrial relations Bills is still broadly true. </PARA>
<PARA> Since we have very little time to debate this matter, I will be brief. Honourable senators will recall that, when the industrial relations Bills were originally debated, the Australian Democrats introduced a package of amendments which were designed to make the legislation more creative and more acceptable. We also supported the reference of this legislation to a committee, if that reference could be treated as a matter of urgency. I am pleased to say that many of the principles that we put forward at that time and a great deal of the detail set out in those amendments has been agreed to and incorporated in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Industrial Relations Legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me go briefly through three contentious areas of the report. One of the major purposes of the Bill was, so it was said, to encourage industry unions. Honourable senators will recall that the Government wanted originally to create a legislative environment in which it was possible for enterprise unions also to be registered. But, after a great deal of debate and criticism, the proposal in relation to enterprise unions was withdrawn by the Government. I have on many occasions advocated the importance of industry unions, if for no other reason than that I believe that to have fewer unions in this country was a very important step in the right direction. The Committee decided that the legislation in connection with industry unions, as now drafted, should not pass the Senate for the simple reason that it was not clear what was meant by the term 'industry union'. It was felt also that the net effect of the legislation could be to encourage more unions rather than fewer unions. That does not mean, nevertheless, that there is nothing we can do about encouraging fewer unions. </PARA>
<PARA> Much of the evidence that the Committee heard made it very clear what difficulties existed in attempting union amalgamation. I think every member of the Committee learnt a great deal in this respect. It was of great benefit generally, and I hope to the Parliament, that the Committee was able to agree to the original recommendation of the National Labour Consultative Council that in the first instance the unions should be allowed to amalgamate on a community of interests basis and that the barriers to amalgamation should be lowered so that only a ballot consisting of 25 per cent of the membership was necessary and that , providing that two-thirds of those voting agreed, an amalgamation should take place. That recommendation of the Committee is, I believe, a very important one and a step forward. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major aspect of the legislation was the protection of the rights of the individual to join or not to join a union. The legislation attempted to achieve this by the introduction of a draconian proposed new section 144A. That was considered and commented on at length by most of the organisations giving evidence before the Committee. It was generally condemned as a section that would cause additional industrial disputation. The Committee has been quite unequivocal in recommending that that draconian proposed new section 144A be objected to. </PARA>
<PARA> The question raised as to whether people should be encouraged to join a union or whether there should be a free choice is very delicate. It was one that the Australian Democrats addressed at its formation. We set out a detailed policy on this matter. Our policy paper states:</PARA>
<PARA> We are aware of the union principle from the past that 100 per cent membership was essential for effectiveness. We are also aware of Item 20 (2) in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights which states 'No one may be compelled to belong to an association'. We know too that many workers have accepted the benefits of unionism without paying dues. We will therefore legislate go give every union the right to impose a 'fee for service' on those workers who do not choose to join it but are working under wages and conditions which the union has achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommended that the original clause relating to conscientious objection should be retained in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. But it recommended also that an additional clause, based on the conscientious objection clause, should be included to allow people to object to joining a union if they had an objection in principle or a belief. The Committee recommended that in this case such people would be allowed to apply to the industrial registrar for a certificate exempting them from joining the union. Such a certificate should be forthcoming on the payment to the appropriate union of a fee not less than 10 per cent of the total union membership fee. That fee should be directed by the unions towards industrial matters only and not towards things such as donations to political parties. So, the fee for service in effect has now been recommended by the Committee for the attention of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point related to the right to stand down employees. This is a very major matter. The Committee recommended that the right to stand down should remain as a matter that has to be referred to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It has been a major tenet of Australian industrial practice for over a century that people have the right to work on a weekly basis. That was very largely what the major fight about industrial relations was in the 19th century and even later. It is simply unacceptable that in the 20th century people can be put in a position where they can be hired and stood down on an hourly basis. Nevertheless, we took on board the objection to delays in granting stand down clauses to employers where they were requested. The Committee has recommended that stand-down applications should be heard within a two-day peiod. The Committee suggested that many of its recommendations should be referred to the National Labour Consultative Council. The Committee felt that there was an urgent need for consensus in this area. That is important. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as time presses, let me say that I believe that the work of the Committee was constructive. It was a pleasure to work on the Committee. I commend the report as one that has many interesting comments to make on the Australian industrial relations scene. It outlines the basis of our system of conciliation and arbitration. Our 80-year-old piece of legislation has withstood yet another test of its continuation as one of the basic ways in which we fix wages. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I start by saying that Senator Harradine misunderstood the amount of time that had been allocated to him and asked me, as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Industrial Relations Legislation, to thank, on his behalf, Richard Tracey, the adviser to the Committee, Ron Wiber and Elton Humphrey. Richard Tracey came to the Committee at its beginning and did a tremendous amount of work for it. The Committee is very indebted to him for all the work that he undertook for it and for his professional advice. As has already been indicated, three main areas were looked at-industry-based unions, automatic stand-downs and voluntary unionism. The area of industry-based unions was the area in which the Committee agreed unanimously. I congratulate Senator Harradine for his chairing of the Committee and for being able to juggle us all around, as he did so well, and come up with one area--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I noticed that considerably. Senator Harradine juggled us around remarkably to come up with one area of unanimity. I congratulate him for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should like to concentrate on the minority report. In the media coverage that we got, we did not get any coverage of the minority report. It is important for the population to understand that this report was not unanimous. First, I deal with automatic stand-downs. As has been indicated by Senator Hamer, if the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission worked as it was intended to work, we would have no problems of the sort that we have today. Indeed, the Committee would not have had to sit. The point is that it was intended originally that the decisions of that Commission should be binding on both parties. That is not as it works. The unions have a right to strike as they see fit. I would not take that from them. But if they do not like the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission's decision, they still say that their right to strike against that decision and not abide by it is very justified. But the employers, once the awards are made, must abide by them. Indeed, action is taken if they do not do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Bearing in mind that there is this undisputed one-sidedness on the part of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission's decisions, we must even that up somewhat in the legislation and allow employers who, part of their work force being on strike, are unable to employ the rest of the work force, to stand-down immediately those people whom they are unable to employ. Senator Button said that in the present difficult climate that would not be possible. In this difficult climate, it should be all the more necessary, because if a small business is unable to stand-down people immediately but must employ them for several days-we found on our Committee that the average was 48 hours or it will be at a great disadvantage financially. If an employer is employing a large number of people in his work force and if only a few of them are on strike and those few on strike render the majority unable to perform their tasks, he will be at great disadvantage financially. We must recognise that profit is not a dirty word and that, unless the employer is making a profit, more people will be stood down. The employer must be protected against wilful strike action by a minority, a very small group, who know only too well that they can create a situation in which no work is available for the rest of the business. Senator Button said that he did not think that I had learned anything on the Committee. I certainly learned to live with Senator Button on a committee. Indeed, he even agreed with me, as he said-for which I give due credit to Senator Harradine- about industry-based unions. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to voluntary unionism. I mentioned this several times, and I nearly drove Senator Harradine to distraction every time I did so. I mentioned the report on 3 July this year, and again in August this year, of an opinion poll which indicated that 73 per cent of Australians believed that there should not be compulsory unionism. The question asked was: Should it be compulsory or not compulsory for workers to join a trade union? Of the replies, 73 per cent said that it should not be compulsory. It was argued before the Committee that we did not have compulsory unionism in this country, that really it was voluntary and that because it was voluntary there was no need for the Government to introduce the legislation. We also heard in evidence from the trade union movement that the employers made an agreement with their particular union and the result of that agreement was that if one did not join the trade union one did not work. </PARA>
<PARA> For some reason, members of the Committee still seemed to call that voluntary unionism. To me that is compulsory unionism-no membership, no work. Indeed, I pointed out that in the State of Tasmania, even though it is against the rules and against the decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, the Transport Workers Union of Australia signs up the owner-drivers. I assure the Senate that it is compulsory. Everyone in this place will know that that is against the decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It is against the union rules. It has been written out of the award. There is no way that it should be signing up the owner-drivers. But it is compulsory, because an owner-driver will not get his truck unloaded if he has not joined the Transport Workers Union. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not forget that 73 per cent of Australians want voluntary unionism, not compulsory unionism, and that 77 per cent of Australian Democrat voters, 86 per cent of Liberal voters and 58 per cent of Labor voters want that. Once this country accepts that there should be voluntary unionism, we shall not have these minority unions, such as the transport union in my State, being able to get away with forcing owner-drivers to become members of their union. Senator Siddons said-he will correct me if I am wrong-that we needed viable unions. </PARA>

But if he does believe that, he can only believe the majority of unionists do not want to join unions. If he believes that giving them a chance not to join their union means that they would take that chance, then they would get away from the union and no longer be members. We can only presume that the majority of unionists in this country, in Senator Siddons's opinion anyway, would not be members of that union.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I wish to speak to this report having been a member of the Senate Select Committee on Industrial Relations Legislation from 22 September 1982, at which time Senator Mulvihill had to resign because of other parliamentary duties. As Senator Button mentioned earlier, this legislation came before the Senate on an earlier date when it was introduced by a previous Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Viner. It now seems as though the Government is having a rethink in the whole of the industrial relations area . The main lesson to be learnt from the operation of this Committee in considering this legislation is that the legislation should have been reviewed and the review process should continue. The legislation is effectively a monument to the incompetence of the previous Minister, Mr Viner, and to his lack of understanding of the field of industrial relations. It was a rejection and an abuse of the consultative process that had been continuing at the level of the National Labour Consultative Council. In fact recommendations of that Council between 1978 and 1980 were disregarded by the Government in its formulation of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the outset I wish to acknowledge the work done on the Committee by the secretariat, together with the Chairman. As Senator Walters said, he did juggle the Committee, and did so quite effectively. Having said that I wish to turn to the three major areas in the short time I have available. The area of stand downs was one that was discussed quite deeply in evidence before the Committee. There were a number of problems with the legislation as it was put to the Senate in initial form. The first one was, of course, whether there was a need for this . In this respect I turn to no other authority than the Confederation of Australian Industry. Its representative before the Committee, Mr Polites, expressed the attitude of the CAI and said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is almost unique. We have 37 per cent of awards with stand-down clauses in them now and 67 per cent of them are in terms of the metal trades provisions, which say that you are entitled to stand-down anybody who cannot be usefully employed on any day because of an industrial dispute. Our experience is that in those awards those clauses are operative and effective. </PARA>
<PARA>So there is an acceptance to a certain extent by the CAI. There is also the problem under this legislation, which was recognised even by honourable senators on the Government side. One particular person who recognised that was Senator Hamer. In questioning Mr Polites on 28 July 1982-this is found at page 1119 of the transcript-he said:</PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, there are certain safeguards against unfair use. As this Bill stands, it gives the power without the safeguards. I am asking you: Do you think there should be safeguards?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Hamer acknowledged that the Bill, as it was presented, did not have adequate safeguards. What are the safeguards that we, as the Opposition, raised for consideration and which were accepted by the majority of the Committee? As it now stands the legislation would not acknowledge the fault of an employer in the process before stand downs. It is quite opportune that in the Senate yesterday the Government produced to me details of industrial disputes caused by managerial policy. Last year over one thousand disputes were caused by managerial policy, as assessed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. In all those disputes under the Government's provisions the employees would have not right of recourse. That is a particular problem that we, as a Committee, found should not be allowed to continue. We should not have such a situation without a fair trial of the parties involved in terms of the desirability of a particular stand down. We also have to take note of the dishonesty of the Government in preparing the legislation. Let us look at the catch-22 situation in which the Government put the industrial relations community. In introducing the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act Mr Sinclair said:</PARA>
<PARA> Every private employer in this country has an ability to stand down his employees. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement is totally inconsistent with what Mr Viner said in introducing this legislation, which he justified as giving private employers the same basic right as the Government had given itself. Mr Sinclair said that that right already existed. Mr Viner said that because of the legislation Mr Sinclair had introduced there was a need to make the provisions uniform. It is a dishonest portrayal of the provisions. I turn very briefly to the situation of industry unions, where the Committee found unanimity of thought. There seems to be some strange inconsistency between the Government's stated intention, as presented in this legislation, and the utterances of the Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) in respect of the dissolution of Solidarity. In Poland Solidarity is being reorganised and restructured by government authority. We have a situation under this piece of legislation where the direct effect and result of pursuing the legislation would be to restructure and undermine the trade union movement as it exists in Australia. The Government has shown no inconsistency at all. In introducing the legislation Mr Viner said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will provide a better balance in the powers, rights and duties of employers and employees. </PARA>
<PARA>That means that the Bill will deprive the union movement of some of its long held and existing powers. The direct effect will be to set up industry unions that are in many instances company based and in fact could very well lead to the preponderance of scab unions. The other problem with this legislation is that not only would it increase the number of unions but also, in conjunction with the Government's provisions in respect of preference-which I will come to next- there will be an increase in the number of unions and an arbitration machinery which is not geared and not allowed by government decision to handle the problems that will arise. Once again let us look at this aspect. Senator Hamer as recorded on page 1148 of the transcript of 28 July said:</PARA>
<PARA> It was troubling me that the Confederation of Australian Industry had come out in favour of industry unions but you were not prepared at all to say what you meant by an industry or how many you thought there might be. Is it correct to say that what you seek is employers to deal with as few unions as possible, preferably one, and that your only other requirement is that the union they deal with should be competently managed and of sufficient size to be efficient . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Polites replied:</PARA>
<PARA> That is right. That is essentially the position. </PARA>
<PARA>When one looks at the expression of opinion of the CAI together with the expression of opinion by the National Labour Consultative Council and the proposals put forward by that Council at an earlier date, one finds that the Government has disregarded those stated intentions. </PARA>
<PARA> I will turn briefly to the position of preference. By this legislation and by both the intended and unintended consequences of it the Government is essentially striking at the system of conciliation and arbitration as it now exists. Section 2(e) of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides:</PARA>
<PARA> That the policy of the Act will be to encourage the organisation of representative bodies and employers and employees and their registration under this Act. </PARA>
<PARA>This piece of legislation would strike very much at the core of that. I refer to the opinion of Mr Frank Cawthorne, a commissioner in South Australia, the ex- advocate of the South Australian Chamber of Manufactures, of the Metal Industries Association of South Australia and so on. In a review of the South Australian provisions which the State Minister in South Australia, Dean Brown, was pushing through Parliament, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> However, all things considered, it is suggested that unless one views unions and unionism in an entirely negative way-which is totally inappropriate-it can be fairly argued that industrial commissions should have within the discretionary armoury the power to award preference. </PARA>
<PARA>I have only seconds left in which to speak. I return to my initial point. This legislation was ill-conceived. It was presented to this Parliament by a Minister in an attempt to destroy the trade union movement and the rights of the workers in this country. The review of the Senate Committee shows both the intended and the unintended shortfalls and dangers of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly on this matter because I voted in favour of the amendment and motion moved by my colleagues Senators Hamer and Missen respectively last November to set up the Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills on a trial basis. Secondly, I wish to speak because, as a member of the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee, I have been able to make a contribution to the workings of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. Members of the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee have, of course, carried out their role as members of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee for a 6 months period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It appeared to me back in November that the experiment of having a bipartisan Senate committee to look at Bills for provisions that would trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties, make rights, liberties and obligations unduly dependent upon insufficiently defined administrative powers or non-reviewable administrative decisions or inappropriately delegate legislative power or insufficiently subject its exercise to parliamentary scrutiny would be a worthwhile experiment in extending the review role of the Senate. I was comforted by the fact that the Committee was not to have the power to impede or disallow but only to scrutinise and publicise. Thus, it was simply to be a watchdog to draw to the attention of honourable senators provisions of Bills that might be potentially undesirable from an interference with civil liberties angle. It appeared to me that it would give the Senate the opportunity to act more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> I was surprised at that time that the Government chose to oppose the motion, particularly in view of the amendment providing that it be simply set up for a trial period. The arguments put by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) on behalf of the Government appeared to me to be extremely vulnerable. In particular, his argument that the Committee might hinder the progress of legislation was vulnerable in that, as the Committee was simply to be set up for a trial period, that would in fact be put to the test. Similarly, the argument that the Committee would have difficulty in distinguishing invasion of personal rights and civil liberties that are justified by the policy and social purpose of the Bill appeared to fail to appreciate that the responsibility of the Committee was simply to bring these matters to the attention of the Senate which would, of course, remain the only determining body. </PARA>
<PARA> Other arguments, such as the assertion that the existing committees of the Parliament were adequately fulfilling the role, appeared to me, even after my short time in this place, to be not well founded. The schedule of Acts with questionable provisions tabled by Senator Missen on 17 November confirmed in my mind the impression that I was rapidly forming. The argument that the motion to set up the Committee would mean that questions of human rights and civil liberties would become the concern of only one small group of the Senate similarly appeared to indicate a failure by the Government to appreciate what was proposed. That failure appeared to me to be even more surprising in that the credit for the concept has been given to the now Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney. Thus, I was quite satisfied at the time in my own mind that I was making the right decision to support the trial of this reform.</PARA>
<PARA> I feel I have now had enough opportunity from the inside to assess the worth of the Committee in the total parliamentary process. It is an additional committee in a Senate which appears to be overburdened with committees. At the time of the debate the number was 37. It thus imposes a further burden on the staff of the Senate and on the time of senators who constitute the Committee. Additionally, it imposes a further cost burden in relation to professional and secretarial assistance. In such circumstances, it appears to me that the worth of the Committee and the justification for extra expense and effort require particular consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Before attempting to evaluate the Committee's contribution, I wish briefly to reflect upon how the Government's arguments have stood the test of practical application. I know of no case in which the Committee hindered or delayed passage of legislation. This point has now been conceded by the Government. Secondly, the Committee has been at pains to point out that a particular invasion of rights or liberties may well be consistent with policy objective whenever that has been apparent from a Minister's second reading speech or from a Bill. Not having to make the final value judgment has meant that the Committe has had little difficulty in this regard. Thirdly, the practice of the Committee to report to the Senate whenever possible before a second reading debate has meant that the province for consideration of human rights and civil liberties has become a subject of wider consideration in the Senate rather than the preserve of a few members of the Committee. It appears, therefore, that the concerns of the Government were not well founded. I am pleased that that has now been conceded by the Government's report. This, therefore, allows an unemotional bipartisan consideration of the value of the Committee as a tool of the Senate and the Parliament against the cost, financial and in time, of its maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA> As set out in the report, in the first six months the Committee reported to the Senate under its terms of reference on clauses of 27 Bills. Of those, nine were subsequently amended. In the case of another, a further Bill was introduced to overcome a difficulty perceived by the Committee. Amendments were foreshadowed by the Government in a number of other cases. Those figures appear at face value to be quite dramatic. It may be argued that the amendments would in any event have come about through the parliamentary process, but there must be considerable doubt in that regard. The Committee appears to be building up a good working relationship with Ministers, who are now comprehensively answering matters raised by the Committee in its Bills Digest and on some occasions even thanking the Committee for bringing such matters to their attention. In turn, this has enabled the Committee in its report to indicate justification that may be advanced by Ministers for particular provisions that might otherwise violate the Committee's terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has noted acceptance of its work by private organisations. This appears to be indicated by a slowly increasing number of submissions as the existence of the Committee becomes better known. One such submission, as mentioned in the report, resulted in an amendment to a specific Bill to overcome a difficulty publicly identified by the Committee as a result of the submission. The Committee has also noted favourable comment in debate by Ministers and senators. Additionally, there is evidence that draftsmen and departments are now giving closer attention to the provisions of their work which may fall within the scrutiny of the Committee under its terms of reference. I refer particularly to Drafting Instruction No. 5 of 1982 given by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel on the subject of reports of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. Media support for the Committee and its work is also noted. In particular, the editorial of the Canberra Times dated 15 September 1982 said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate regulations committee and its scrutiny of Bills Committee are particularly worth while, examining the effects of parliamentary measures on civil liberties, with the help of professional legal consultants, retained and paid for their advice. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, all these committees give members of Parliament a deserved sense of their value to electors which would be difficult to feel if their work were confined to the chambers. As members of committees honourable members and senators tend to work primarily as members of Parliament whatever their party affiliations; this gives them a fine, traditional purpose, which the people really need. Thus, it appears that the Committee is achieving what it set out to do. If, therefore, its task is worth while its existence is worth while. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack), in his contribution to the debate on 19 November, said:</PARA>
<PARA> I think we would all agree that the question of legislation infringing basic human rights or civil liberties is a most important one that should be in the minds of all members of Parliament when they consider legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I for one certainly agree and therefore argue that the Committee is worth while and should be retained. As to the specific recommendations, I agree with the Committee's report that it should now be established as a separate and distinct Committee in terms of the proposed new Standing Order. There does not appear to be scope for its absorption either within the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Standing Committee or the Regulations and Ordinances Standing Committee. To refer Bills to relevant legislative Standing Committee would be administratively inefficient, apart from the difficulty that such Committees do not cover the field, as was mentioned earlier today. Therefore, I believe that the experiment has proved successful and the existence of the Committee should be endorsed as a continuing tool for senators to fulfil more efficiently and effectively their review function in an area of great importance. That the Committee has been able to justify itself and to be an efficiently operating body within such a short period is in no small measure due to the contribution of its secretary during the period, Anne Lynch, and its consultant, Professor Dennys Pearce. Their efforts must be particularly acknowledged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity presented by the name of the Bill in clause 1 to make a couple of general comments which may be of at least partial assistance in the conduct of this debate. I say at the outset that this is rather the sort of debate that one needs to warm up for by having perhaps a day or two of total immersion in the materials. One almost wishes that one was an academic again, having those sorts of ample days at one's disposal, rather than having to contend as we do with matters being brought on at relatively short notice after a lapse of some months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But it may be of assistance if I draw to the attention of honourable senators just what documents they have before them and how, as a result, we might expeditiously proceed through the Committee stage of this Bill. There are, in fact, four printed documents that have been re-circulated to honourable senators today. Firstly, there is the original Bill, as introduced on 11 November 1981. Secondly, there is a five page document entitled 'Amendments to be moved by Senator Evans'. They are, of course, the amendments that are proposed to the original Bill and were foreshadowed in the Senate on 18 March and first circulated to honourable senators on 6 May of this year, some considerable time ago. There is a single page document also headed 'Amendments to be moved by Senator Evans', which simply corrects some typographical errors on page 4 of the amendments booklet. There is nothing of any particular substance on that single page document. It is simply to make typographical corrections and is circulated for the record rather than because of its substantive significance. The final printed document that honourable senators should have in front of them is an explanatory memo, circulated by me at the conclusion of the second reading debate, which sets out the provisions of the Constitution as they would appear if the Bill were passed with the amendments that I propose to move today. I suggest that it might suit the convenience of the Senate were our primary attention in the course of this debate devoted to that explanatory memorandum rather than to the text of the Bill and to the amendment sheets. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other general thing that I want to refer to in regard to this clause is to draw attention to what is an extraordinary circumstance. When last we debated this Bill, in August, there was intense speculation about an early election. One could hardly forbear at that time from suggesting that one way of coping with the manifest instability to which that speculation was giving rise in the political systems was to adopt this Bill. Once again we have a situation in which there is a fever of speculation about an early election. Whether it has been put to rest in the last half hour or whether it is to be set running again in the next half hour I am not quite sure. It is made possible, of course, by the fact that--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Hamer" NAMEID="4H4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator Hamer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point is not really relevant, Senator. There could still be speculation about a double dissolution.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Speculation is still rampant around the place. It is, of course, the kind of speculation that would, except in the context of a possible double dissolution as Senator Hamer points out and in the other circumstance that is provided for in this Bill, be impossible if this legislation were passed. Although the circumstance of a double dissolution would not entirely be ruled out under this Bill, it is provided for in one of the amendments to be moved today; namely, that any double dissolution would produce a new parliament only for the duration of the term remaining to be served out by the old one. With a mere 12 months of the Government's original term left, one suspects that it would be rather unlikely that under those circumstances the speculation about an early election would be as feverish as it now is. I am indebted to Senator Hamer for drawing attention to what is a central argument in regard to this Bill; we will come to it later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make the point at the outset of the debate that while I do not know whether the Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, prays any more or whether, if he does, there is anyone up there any longer listening to him, I cannot help suggesting that if he were really concerned about instability and destabilisation in the present political system, about the overweening power of this particular institution, the Senate, to create that climate of instability and make life difficult for the government of the day he would, of course, accept rapidly and with open arms the invitation being proffered to him by this legislation to change the constitutional system once and for all and make the kind of climate that we have seen over the last few months impossible of repetition. I hope that it will be possible for us to proceed expeditiously, at least in regard to most of the complexities involved, in getting this legislation through the Committee stage today. I suggest that if we devote our attention to dealing with the Bill clause by clause, referring primarily in the process to the printed explanatory memorandum, that may not be too difficult a task. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Evans, I take the opportunity of speaking at this stage on clause 1 of the Constitution Alteration (Fixed Term Parliaments) Bill 1981. Although I shall not move an amendment to the name of the Bill, I would like to move such an amendment, perhaps seeking to call it the Senate (Disembowelling) Bill or some such term. Although I shall not do that, I take the opportunity to respond to a challenge which was made to me the last time when this Bill came before the Senate. During that debate, I stated that, as a result of the Watergate affair in the United States of America, experts in that country had been critically examining the fixed term provisions of the United States Constitution and had advocated more flexible arrangements. Both Senators Evans and Macklin challenged me to produce some of those experts and I undertook to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1974, Congressman Henry Reuss of Wisconsin sponsored a Bill to amend the Constitution to provide that Congress could turn the President out of office and bring about a presidential election, the condition of this power being that the whole of both Houses go to an election also. That was one matter. I now draw attention to an article entitled 'Britain and America: The Institutionalization of Accountability' by William S. Livingston in the Journal of Politics, volume 38, 1976. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand Senator Evans's interjection. Of course it is not a name on everyone's lips but when I said that there were experts in the United States who were concerned about the United States provisions he challenged me to produce those experts and indicated that in his view there were no such experts. So I am afraid I shall have to explain to the Senate who those experts were and what some of them said. For example, this fellow, Mr Livingston, in a Presidential Address delivered to the annual meeting of the Southern Political Science Association held in Nashville, Tennessee, in November 1975, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the past few years, there has been a spate of proposals suggesting that various elements of the British system should be grafted onto our own, as a means of preventing any recurrence of that mixed bag of evils we lump together and call ''Watergate''. </PARA>
<PARA>So, he considered that there was a spate of proposals. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In the aftermath of Watergate, this admiration for the British system seems to be intensified, and many who believe that the solution to the problems posed by Watergate lies in institutional reform summon us again to adopt various elements of the British system. </PARA>
<PARA>* * * *</PARA>
<PARA> To many Americans from Woodrow Wilson on, that device has offered the ultimate solution to the problem of irresponsible government in America. In the old days, we had the testimony of William Y. Elliot and Thomas K. Finletter. Nowadays similar proposals come to us from Morley Ayearst, James L. Sundquist, and indeed from Senator Edward Kennedy. </PARA>
<PARA>We have finally found a name that Senator Evans will be able to remember. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> If Americans would only give Congress the power to expel a president by an adverse vote of various sizes, the problems of the irresponsible executive would be solved. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, in this article, he states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Watergate revelations have provoked a rash of reform proposals, many of which are drastic in character and extent. Some critics, like Leland Baldwin and James L. Sundquist would subject the President to a vote of no-confidence. Others--</PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to quote two or three others with other proposals. I am not putting forward this information as any argument in favour of my argument. I am putting it forward in response to the challenge which was made to me, during the debate on this subject, to show that there were Americans who were so concerned about Watergate that they realised that the problems of a fixed term parliament were quite desperate. I have not finished yet by a long shot. Let me refer to an article entitled 'Doing Away With Presidential Impeachment: The Advantages of Parliamentary Government' by one Harold C. Havighurst-they have incredible names , some of the United States people-who is apparently Professor of Law, Emeritus, Northwestern University, wherever that is--</PARA>

<PARA>. . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> We must start with the recognition that . . . Once a president is elected, he continues to exercise those powers for a period of 4 years. </PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to consider the problems of the American Constitution and, in the course of this consideration, he says:</PARA>
<PARA> Basic parliamentary principles require that when differences develop, either the legislature or the executive may at any time force a general election. </PARA>
<PARA>I just draw the Senate'e attention to those words:</PARA>
<PARA>when differences develop either the legislature or the executive may at any time force a general election. </PARA>
<PARA>He is saying that when differences develop between the legislature and the Executive either the legislature or the Executive may at any time force a general election. He then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> This is to be contrasted with our present system where the time of the next Presidential election is definitely known. Efforts to remain in office can be concentrated and pointed well in advance to a known date. </PARA>
<PARA>I would also draw attention to two other works, one entitled Reframing the Constitution: An Imperative for Modern America by a fellow named Leland D. Baldwin, published in 1972 and 'Needed: A Workable Check on the Presidency' by James L. Sundquist, whose name I have read out two or three times before, in The Brookings Bulletin, volume 10, No. 4, page 7. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, on this matter, let me refer to an editorial in New Republic of 20 July 1974 entitled 'Turbulence Ahead' when these words were used:</PARA>
<PARA> With a parliamentary system like Canada's, the United States could have dealt with Watergate two months after it was discovered. With our rigid government we have instead reached a point of public helplessness. </PARA>

I draw attention to the fact that what he was talking about and what was being talked about in those articles was the old argument between responsible government and presidential government. There are many arguments on both sides. None of those people was seriously addressing the issue of a fixed term for the legislature, which is the matter which this title covers and which is the matter before us. There is a great deal of argument, and I personally much prefer the Executive to be responsible to the legislature as it is in the Westminster system. The American system of separation of powers is in my view inappropriate, too rigid and unwork- able. All those people were addressing their remarks to that issue. It was a very interesting address but I submit that it was irrelevant to the matter before the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to rise again and say that I suport what Senator Macklin has put forward. There is some merit in the fixed term concept in relation to the Senate and the House of Representatives-in other words, the legislature-but Senator Hamer, in his response to the remarks I made earlier, failed to understand the significant defect which the fixed term concept has in relation to the Executive; that is, it takes away from a Prime Minister the right to go to the Governor-General and advise an election. That is the fundamental defect with fixed terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition senators interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can hear honourable senators on the other side of the chamber protesting. If those honourable senators had been in West Germany recently and found that the leader who represented their point of view in the West German Parliament was unable to organise an election in West Germany, notwithstanding his desperate desire to do so, I am sure they would be arguing strongly in favour of what I am saying at the present time. There is a fundamental defect in the fixed term concept-that is, that the Prime Minister of the day is unable to go to the Governor-General and advise an election. It may be that under our system at the present moment the Prime Minister's advice will not be accepted by the Governor-General. I am sure that Senator Evans would argue against that. As I understand it, in 1975 the Australian Labor Party said that the Prime Minister 's advice should be accepted by the Governor-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As things stand at present the Governor-General may not accept the advice. Therefore, when the Prime Minister of the day loses the confidence of the Parliament he has a number of choices. He can accept the decision of the Parliament to allow another government to take his government's place or he may go to the Governor-General and say: 'I have lost the confidence of the Parliament but I am sure that I have the confidence of the people. Let us have an election to decide this political issue'. If the Governor-General accepts that and the Prime Minister calls an election, the people of the nation are entitled to make the decision as to which party shall be the government of the day and who will be the members of parliament to represent them, not some members of parliament who just happen to have changed their point of view in relation to who they will support as Prime Minister in the House of Representatives. That is the fundamental defect of the fixed term system which, with all due respect, my colleagues behind me and Senator Evans opposite seem to fail to understand. </PARA>

I stand by everything I said in that speech, which is there for honourable senators to read. This is the first time that I have had a chance to say anything on this Bill. I agree entirely with Senator Macklin that this Bill is a fixed terms Bill and that it ought to stay that way. I hope that we will delete, in particular, clauses 8 and 9 when we get to them so that the Bill will be confined to this subject-a subject which then might have some chance of getting through in a referendum because it does not include extraneous subjects, such as the Supply question, which is very controversial. From that point of view I think that Senator Macklin is right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Lewis, in his speech today, made the point that the taking away of the prime ministerial right to go to a Governor-General and advise an early election is a defect in the Bill. To my mind it enshrines the real principle of the Bill. Surely it could not be more appropriate than at the present time to say that we do not need in this country the destabilising situation whereby a Prime Minister may or may not go at some early stage to the Governor-General and obtain an election. The removal of that provision is very timely indeed. This Bill is a very suitable method of ensuring that that is done. Today's Age states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister also said he was considering a new referendum to make it compulsory for elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate to be held at the same time. </PARA>

I believe it would raise opposition again. I think that honourable senators should hear me out on this. I am not advocating that this should be done. I am saying to the Prime Minister and others that there is a danger that a series of short parliaments will come one after another. The Senate could be cleared out quite quickly by that means. I have never thought it to be a real possibility but it is a possibility that that could be done by a government, perhaps an unscrupulous government. We want to get away from that situation of short parliaments and of uncertainties as to the terms of parliaments. The essential principle of this Bill is incorporated in the fixed term concept. I hope that with the removal of the surplus we will be able to do a by-pass operation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a bit surprised at Senator Evans's intervention in the debate. He complained about the contribution of Senator Lewis when he himself ranged rather widely in his contribution regarding the short title. I will try to avoid the same temptation and restrict myself to the short title. I was a little puzzled by the contribution from the Australian Democrats. It seems to me that the long title at least attempted to get across the rather varied provisions of the Bill, whereas the short title deals with one narrow aspect of it, albeit the aspect seen as the most important by some honourable senators and apparently by the Australian Democrats. I take the view that the short title should be amended to make it more aptly reflect the total contents of the Bill, but I can see the point which is made by the Australian Democrats when they suggest that if everything is removed from the Bill but those provisions which relate to fixed terms it becomes an appropriate short title. On that basis, and on that basis only, I would agree that clause 1 is in a satisfactory form. I would have thought that there would be government support-without knowing the detail of the Democrats moves-for the sorts of changes which would refine the Bill. I am sure that with those additional elements removed, whilst it might still not be acceptable to the Government, it would be in a form which was less unacceptable. My comments on the first clause of the Bill are simply that I agree with those speakers who have suggested that it is inapt. I note that amendments are to be put forward which might render it apt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also think that I would agree with Senator Lewis rather than with Senator Hamer on the relevance of Senator Lewis's comments. I think the whole concept of having fixed terms of the Australian Parliament-indeed, that is a concept which is not followed through in the Bill because, in fact, the terms can be foreshortened in circumstances which are indicated in the Bill-flies in the face of the concept of responsible government. I really do not see that Senator Hamer can have it both ways. I do not think he can be a wholehearted supporter of responsible government, as he professed himself to be, and a supporter of fixed term parliaments. That is clearly a view on which there are some differences of opinion among Government senators. My own view of the logic of the situation is that Senator Lewis was, in fact, quite in order and relevant in raising the broader considerations he raised for the reason I have just mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> I also thought there was a great deal of force in Senator Lewis's comments when he referred to various American authorities. In politics there is a tendency to see the grass as being greener on the other side of the fence. In Australia it is very easy to look to the virtue of a non-parliamentary Executive, to look at the virtues of fixed terms, and to say that they avoid some of the problems of Australian politics. It is also true that many American commentators are quite respectable. I think many of them are men of distinction. I did not quite understand the giggles that came from some parts of the benches opposite at the mention of people who I suspect are at least as notable authorities on constitutional matters as anyone in this chamber, although I am sure Senator Evans's name is on the lips of every serious constitutional commentator in the United States. I suggest that the authorities quoted by Senator Lewis are quite respectable. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to refer to one authority with some risk because I am not absolutely sure that I remember the name exactly. I think it was Representative Boland, who was a very experienced member of the House of Representatives and who was narrowly defeated in the election of Speaker of the House by Representative O'Neill. He wrote a couple of books about the American political system which were a very good example of Americans looking to our system and seeing its virtues as against the vices of their own system. I think those books were lent to me by the present Clerk of the Senate. I will not even guess at the titles, but I advise all those who are interested in Americans looking over the fence to see the Clerk and borrow the books. </PARA>
<PARA> Representative Boland pointed out that one of the besetting sins of the American political system was something we tend to look on as a problem in Australia-namely, the American absence of a caucus system. It was pointed out that the lack of any party discipline and unity in the United States had effectively slowed down the operation of democratic government in that country and had meant that electoral programs were seldom actually translated into enactments. It was a most convincing argument on why we should change very little in the Australian political system-otherwise we will pick up all the vices of the American political system. I thank Senator Lewis for his contribution to clause 1 and I share the misgivings that have been expressed about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are continuing this cognate debate on these Bills. The principal Bill is the Customs Tariff Bill 1982 which replaces the Customs Tariff Act 1966. One of the objectives of the Government's industry policy has been the development of a simpler and more stable tariff structure. The decision the Government has taken in this Bill is a significant step towards achieving that objective. The whole purpose of the legislation is to try to save a great deal of time and effort in determining the rate of duty applicable to imported goods. This will help not only the government sector but also private enterprise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is significant that the provisions basically follow the recommendations in the report of the Industries Assistance Commission. The reference was given to the Commission in 1978. It reported in 1981. The commencement date of these pieces of legislation will be 1 January 1983. One of the difficulties is that the Australian tariff has become increasingly difficult to work with for both the public sector and private enterprise. It has been proposed, and it will be implemented by this Bill, that the number of classifications be reduced from something like 2,500 to 2,000 and that the number of different rates of duty be reduced from about 700 to 250. </PARA>
<PARA> This IAC inquiry, which commenced in 1978, was different from most other sorts of inquiries in relation to the tariff in that it tended to cover the whole of the tariff and, therefore, all imported goods. But it did not involve a review of the level of assistance. In fact, we are told that the recommendations do not substantially affect assistance afforded to Australian industry and that the rates do not exceed plus or minus five percentage points with equivalent changes for rates not expressed in ad valorem rates. The 1966 Act was an extremely fragmented and complex document constituting five schedules divided into 16 operative sections and three inoperative parts, together with some covering provisions. Therefore, in the main Schedule alone, there were these 2,500 classifications to which I referred earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole objective of the IAC report was to try to make the Customs Bill a very much simpler document. Unfortunately, some of the problems with classification were that the use of the language was formerly fairly obscure or often vague and ambiguous. It covered a lot of commodities which were not actually intended to be covered. This Bill tends to obviate that particular problem. Further, the definitions of the commodities were in such terms that they did not really correspond to general commercial use. Honourable senators can see the difficulties that would apply in such a situation. The definition of the commodities made evaluation uncertain and sometimes fairly difficult. The setting of different rates of duty for commodities which would otherwise not be separated on commercial documents was a problem we had to face. That was the general scenario which we tried to overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like briefly to trace the history of tariff protection which we have had since Federation. In 1901 there were only about 300 sorts of classifications . Most of them were designed to provide a revenue base and to provide revenue. The next significant change came about in 1932 with the Ottowa agreement which gave tariff preference to British goods. While I am talking about preference I think I should emphasise the wide ambit of preference that is given but which is not generally recognised in Australia. Clause 19 of the Customs Tariff Bill 1982 gives preference to New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Forum Island countries, declared preference countries, developing countries and Canada. We have six groupings whereby substantial concessional rates are granted to those particular areas. For example, the Forum Island countries are not generally known. They include such places as the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Western Samoa and Vanuatu. In addition, we have declared preference countries. These comprise some 30 additional countries to which preference is given-such as Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka and so on. In addition, there are places which are treated as declared preference countries. Another 14 countries are listed as declared preference countries. A further 100 countries are declared as developing countries. They receive special concessions . Finally, there are places that are not developing countries but that are treated as developing countries. In this category we have another 16 countries. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about the problems of Australian tariffs and keeping out goods from the rest of the world I think we have to recognise that there is a tremendous number of concessions. I wonder whether the time is right now for us to start looking at our whole tariff structure in the light of the tremendous unemployment in Australia at the moment. Perhaps the time is appropriate for us to review the question of Australian government preference. Following the Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting and the so-called North-South dialogue this preference was lost. A lot of Australian manufacturing business has been lost to other countries as a result of action taken by the Australian Government to do away with preference to Australian manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the high unemployment in Australia at present I think that is the first step we should take to try to ensure that more business is done in Australia as a result of Commonwealth work. In other words, I think it is a tragedy that not only the Commonwealth but also the State of New South Wales currently is putting business outside Australia when thousands of manufacturing jobs are at risk and thousands of people are out of work. I think that is certainly an area at which we should be looking. I wish to refer also to clause 25 of the Bill. It is an important part of the Customs tariff legislation. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister may, by notice published in the Gazette-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) declare that he is of opinion that goods of a kind specified in the notice-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) are a substitute for goods of another kind specified in the notice;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) are intended to be or can be used as a substitute for goods of another kind specified in the notice;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) can be used for any purpose for which goods of another kind specified in the notice can be used; or</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) are an imitation of goods of another kind specified in the notice; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) direct that the duty in respect of goods of that first-mentioned kind is the duty that would be applicable in respect of them if they were goods of that other kind. </PARA>
<PARA>The whole purpose of this provision is to prevent an importer using the by-law type operation or bringing in goods of a similar kind but at a lower rate of duty, thereby undercutting the Australian manufacturer. We have seen plenty of examples of this. Although the words 'are intended to be or can be used as a substitute' are faily specific, in practice manufacturers have a great deal of difficulty with the Department. They have difficulty in proving that the goods are substitute goods, despite the fact that in the Queen's English the intention , the purpose, is particularly clear. I point to a recent example. Printed cloth was imported but after it had been washed a couple of times the print was effectively washed out. Although the importers are protected because it is printed cloth, the effect is that the cloth competes with an existing Australian product as a substitute product. These are the sorts of techniques that importers adopt to try to overcome the provisions of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that somehow we have to implement much more fairly the purpose and intent of clause 25, particularly at a time of high unemployment in Australia. Manufacturers complain daily about the problems of the operation of this legislation. The words are fairly clear but in practice it does not seem to be working very well. I note that the fifteenth report of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills dated 20 October 1982 made reference to the ministerial discretion in this Bill. I seek to incorporate in Hansard page 5 of that report which deals with clause 25, ministerial discretion. I think it has a great deal of relevance, particularly in the light of the amendment which will be moved later, a copy of which was put before us a few minutes ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 25-Ministerial discretion</PARA>
<PARA> In its original comments on this clause in Alert Digest No. 11 and the Thirteenth Report of 23 September 1982, the Committee noted that the effect of this provision is to allow the Minister to amend the Schedule. This clause empowers the Minister to direct that goods, which he determines to be substitutes for or imitations of other goods already specified in the Schedule, shall be dutiable at the rate of the Scheduled goods. The Minister is to exercise his discretion by notice published in the Gazette. </PARA>
<PARA> In a subsequent letter to the Committee, the Minister Assisting the Minister for Industry and Commerce states that the provision for Gazette Substitution and Imitation Notices ''is not new, and is presently contained in section 23 of the Customs Tariff Act 1966''. However, the Minister also stated that the current Government policy was that ''the provision for such Notices should remain, but that as normal practice, such Notices [shall] be viewed as temporary measures pending inquiry and report by the I.A.C. It is not planned that any Notice will be operative as at 1 January 1983, the intended date of the operation of the new Tariff Act.''</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister went on to invite the Committee to consider the following modification of the provision:</PARA>
<PARA> ''If it were to be considered essential, provisions similar to those in clause 26 (7) could be made in clause 25. In that event, rather than delay passage of the Bill, I am prepared to give an undertaking to amend the Act before it becomes operative. This could be achieved by a Notice of Intention to Propose Customs tariff alteration by Gazette Notice in pursuance of section 273EA of the Customs Act 1901.''</PARA>
<PARA> Although the Committee welcomes the Minister's intention to amend the Bill, it is concerned that the proposed amending mechanism is itself an example of a '' Henry VIII'' provision, to which the Committee has an in principle objection. The Committee would prefer to see the Bill improved by a substantive amendment before Parliament passes the Bill. The Minister's proposal attempts to correct one defective legislative provision by resort to a similar one in the Principal Act which, unfortunately, is not before the Committee. The Committee remains concerned that the unamended provision in clause 25 allows the Minister to amend the Schedule, and it draws this to the attention of the Senate under principle 1 (a) (iv) in that it might be regarded as imappropriately delegating legislative power, and under principle 1 (a) (v) in that it might be regarded as insufficiently subjecting the exercise of delegated legislative power to parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We can see the difficulty of this legislation so far as civil liberties are concerned. I think this was described as an Henry VIII provision. As I understand the amendment which will be moved later, its purpose is to have the declaration tabled as if it were a regulation. I believe that will tend to overcome some of the problems. I have been asked to keep my remarks brief in view of the fact that this Bill must be returned to the House of Representatives in the next half hour. I conclude with these remarks: I would like to see an early restoration of Commonwealth preference in relation to buying Australian rather than overseas goods. I am concerned about the application of by-laws. I believe that, at a time of high unemployment, we have to look much more closely at the issue of quota. I should like the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) to examine further the problems caused by this concept of broad banding , particularly in relation to the clothing industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on the Customs tariff legislation. This package of Bills replaces the Customs Tariff Act 1966 with a simplified tariff based on the recommendations made in the report of the Industries Assistance Commission of November 1981. It will take effect from 1 January 1982. The existing Customs legislation is amongst the most complex on the statute books. Since it was enacted a great deal has changed in the world, especially amongst Australia's trading partners. Britain has entered the European Economic Community and the gradual rise of Japan as one of our largest trading partners is perhaps the most significant trend in our trade relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other major change which has occurred in the last 16 years relevant to the Customs legislation is that there has been a gradual change in the nature of goods being imported. A whole range of new products in our modern world- electronic and other-are now in existence which were not even thought of in 1966 . The Bureau of Customs and the Australian Taxation Office have had great difficulty in reconciling these new goods with the old legislation. In fact, the Government has only recently recognised, with the announcement of a reference on computers and related materials to the IAC, that there is a need to move in this direction in relation to new products. I believe that this piece of legislation is probably one of the most loved pieces of legislation to enter this chamber. It is long overdue. It replaces a piece of legislation which is probably the most tortuous on our statute books. We support the Bills wholeheartedly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply -I rise to thank the Senate for its support of the legislation and to mention one item that was raised in relation to wheelchairs by Senator Evans during his speech. He spoke of the problem of import duty being applied to imported wheelchairs. I want to make the same point that I made during the debate on a similar Bill some six months ago when this matter was raised. The legislation then envisaged reduced, on a phased down basis, the import duty then applying from 36 per cent to a long term rate of 20 per cent. So in fact there has been a significant downturn in the amount of duty being applied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of a bounty in respect of locally manufactured wheelchairs was considered but was discarded on the grounds of administrative difficulty. It is, of course, to be acknowledged that the proper way in which to address care for the unfortunate handicapped people who find the need to buy wheelchairs is through the social security system. That is the way in which the Government would be endeavouring to help people in that unfortunate situation. I wish the Bills a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The preoccupation of Senator Lewis with the desirability of there being an early election in the event of a government of the day losing the confidence of the lower House-a point that he has made today as he has made on the second reading and as he has made on numerous other occasions-seems to display a lack of appreciation on his part of one of the most fundamental principles of the system of responsible government that we have inherited. That is that the composition of the government of the day should depend upon the confidence of the lower House, the directly elected popular House, and the government of the day should be determined by reference to whom it is that the lower House, at any given time, is prepared to vest confidence in . It has been entirely consistent with the history of the United Kingdom, as was demonstrated by the very example of Neville Chamberlain which Senator Lewis gave , because Chamberlain's replacement was accomplished without there being the necessity of an election but just simply by the vote of the House of Commons. Manifestly that was a sequence of events that was very much perceived to be in the national interest at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Not only has it happened in the United Kingdom, but also it has happened, on my calculations, at least eight times in the history of Australia, federally. It happened in 1903 with the replacement of the Deakin Ministry with that of Barton . It happened in 1904 when Deakin gave way to Watson. It happened again in 1904, in June, when Watson gave way to Reid. It happened in 1905 when Reid gave way to Deakin. It happened in 1908 when Deakin gave way to Fisher. It happened in 1909 when Fisher gave way to Deakin. It happened in 1917 when Hughes, wearing his Labor Party hat, gave way to himself in another capacity and with a differently constituted party behind him. It happened in 1941 with the defection of Coles and Wilson to the Labor Party, enabling the creation, at a time of national emergency when arguably an election would have been quite inappropriate, of a Labor Government commanding the confidence of the lower House. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that those examples do not impress Senator Lewis as having any relevance, but they are a demonstration that the system is capable of responding flexibly to an environment in which party allegiances shift and change. Mercifully, there have not been many examples of that in recent decades. With all due respect to the representatives of minority parties present in our midst, it is to be hoped that that is not a situation that will recur in the foreseeable future as far as the lower House here is concerned. But to the extent that it occurs, the system is perfectly capable of dealing with it, and the proposals embodied in these clauses to enable Parliament to continue its term even though a lack of confidence has been expressed in a particular Ministry-provided that a vote of confidence is expressed in someone else-are perfectly workable and perfectly consistent with the principles of responsible government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One point seems to have affected the judgment of those who oppose the Bill. Some of them seem to have the idea that in our present system a Prime Minister defeated in the House of Representatives has an automatic right to call an election. That is not true. There is no question of it being true. The precedents are utterly clear. In 1903, when Watson was defeated on a vote of confidence in the House of Representatives, he asked the Governor-General for an election. The Governor-General said that it was his duty to see whether someone else could form a government. A new government was formed and there was no election. In 1941, when Fadden was beaten by the defection of two on his own side who voted against him, a new government was formed. There was no election. The only instance when a Prime Minister defeated in the House of Representatives on a crucial issue has been able to go to an election was Bruce in 1929, when no alternative government could be formed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is exactly what would be achieved by these procedures. If a government can be formed, having the confidence of the House, that government takes over. That is entirely appropriate. It is what happens now. If no government can be formed, what happens now is that there is an election, and that is the procedure in the Bill. That argument is based, I regret to say, on a total constitutional misconception. </PARA>

The Governor- General may very well not accept that advice. The Prime Minister may decide not to go to the Governor-General and advise an election. But what this proposal does is to take away from the so-called elected government, about which we hear so much from the Opposition-I do not believe that there is any such concept as an 'elected' government, but the Opposition is always talking about 'the elected government' being sacked-the right of that elected government, which is, in other words, the Prime Minister of the day, any right to say to the Governor- General: 'I have lost the confidence of the House.

<PARA> I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that clause 5 in the original Bill deals with sections 12 and 13 of the Constitution. As regards the proposed amendment to section 13 of the Constitution, it is now proposed by me to amend the original terms of our Bill. The amendment has been circulated for about six months and I think that its content is familiar to honourable senators. The effect of section 13 as it stands-and it can really only be understood when read together with the proposed new section 28 dealing specifically with the duration of the House of Representatives-is to ensure, first, that the normal term of a senator remains the present six years, subject only to an earlier double dissolution. It is further provided that, in the event of an extraordinarily early election caused by the defeat of the Government in the House of Representatives, only the House of Representatives will be dissolved. In the original version of this amendment to section 13 the Senate went out too when the House of Representatives was dissolved by virtue of a no confidence motion. Now it is proposed, as becomes clear when one reads the proposed new section 13 together with the proposed new section 28, that a dissolution of the House of Representatives alone following a no confidence vote and the inability to form another government will have no effect on the terms of senators. We will go on as before. The reason that is possible is that, as I have indicated, the proposal now is that, in the event of an early dissolution of the House of Representatives, the House of Representatives when newly elected will see out the term that it would otherwise have done rather than commence a new three-year term. So it is still possible for the House of Representatives and Senate elections to remain synchronised. </PARA>
<PARA> To summarise further, section 13 ensures that to avoid unnecessary multiplication of elections where there is such an extraordinary dissolution of the House of Representatives less than three months before the scheduled fixed term election date, the ordinary election for the half Senate is to be held at the same time. So there is some modification of the existing rule in relation to half Senate elections in section 13 to accommodate that eventuality. Furthermore there is a provision built into section 13 that in the event of a double dissolution the newly elected Senate would divide into two classes, as is the case at the moment, with the so-called short term senators becoming due for re- election at the next scheduled ordinary House of Representatives-cum-half Senate election. There is a further provision there of appropriate transitional provisions. I do not understand any of these provisions to be controversial as between those who are keen on the fixed term concept. These provisions are controversial for those who oppose the fixed term concept, but for those who support it they are simply an improved, streamlined and more workable version of the concept contained in the original Bill. Accordingly, I commend the amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the amendment in the version Senator Evans has now put forward. I believe this is a much more workable way in which to provide for a fixed term. I think it would probably lead also to some lack of venture in the House of Representatives as those who would seek to divide parties, to force an election, to get rid of a Prime Minister and so forth would know that they are only taking up the period of the fixed term and therefore would have to face the electors at a later date. I think this amendment makes for stability as well. I believe it is desirable that as far as possible we keep to the fixed terms, as this amendment does, so that people will know from year to year when elections will take place and there is the same fairness and certainty for all parties.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The version that we now have of a fixed term parliament is, I think, far more satisfactory than the one which appeared in the Bill originally presented by Senator Evans. The defects of the original proposal were, I think, obvious when one attempted to suggest a particular hard case for presentation in relation to that proposal. The original notion was virtually a version of the rolling triennium idea in a sense in that there was not a fixed beginning or end but there was always three years in between. But that is almost precisely the current convention-that we ought to have a three-year space between elections. The original legislation sought to enforce that except under conditions which are almost identical to the propositions today. The amendment Senator Evans has moved is one which he has developed from the initial point I put to him in discussion. I think the development of that has now presented us with a very useful device.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a device which does not impinge on the ability of a government to seek a mandate under conditions already described in the previous clauses. If that government lacks the confidence of the lower House and seeks and gains from the Governor-General permission to hold an election for the House of Representatives alone, it can do so. But it would do so under this amendment with the proviso that it has only the rest of its term to serve. In other words, while it is open to a government to seek that mandate it has pressure upon it to think excessively carefully about it. I believe that is probably about as far as we are able to go with the parliamentary system we have. We are not able to go to the extent of the American system. It would be totally unworkable in a parliamentary system where the Executive is within the legislature. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this amendment simply says to a government which is seeking a new mandate and calls an election today or tomorrow, for example, that the incoming government would have only to the end of the next year in which to serve. I believe that would put enormous pressures on the government to think again about calling an election merely because the time is opportune or calling an election which is unnecessary in terms of the interests of the country. If it were obviously in the interests of the country and if the government held it to be so , the government could go with confidence to the people. That is an essential element that we must not lose sight of. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this amendment the government may go to the people and seek a renewal of its mandate. The only problem is that that mandate would be limited in terms of the duration of the three-year cycle. That would mean that the Senate's term would be unimpeded. The Senate would go almost invariably for a fixed six-year term. The only case in which that would not occur would be under a double dissolution, and it would be most unlikely that a double dissolution would occur . In a sense, while leaving the Senate alone, this provision is able to put pressure on the House of Representatives to look again at using an election as a totally political device rather than as an expression of the will of the people.</PARA>
<PARA> I think this is a useful amendment. It does not impede in any way the government from seeking an election and if the Governor-General agrees it would then be able to seek again a mandate from the people, but it does restrict it. This provision is one which operates in other constitutions. It seems to be one which is workable. It is one which I believe is certainly worth putting to the people of this country for their consideration. I again draw the attention of honourable senators to the fact that that is what we are talking about today. We are not talking about passing a Bill; we are talking about putting to the people for their consideration a proposal about fixed terms for the Parliament, which I believe is part of our democratic process. If the people reject it, that is their right. But I believe they ought to have put to them a good, workable proposal to see whether they want it. That is why I support this amendment. </PARA>

I should make it clear that, although I am prepared to support this matter, I am not entirely satisfied that this is the most convenient way of solving the problem. As I see it, our task here is to put forward for consideration, as Senator Macklin has just suggested, a possible way in which the fixed term Parliament might work. We all know that, no matter what this chamber decides today, it will not be proceeded with by the House of Representatives, so it will not in fact go to a referendum in the near future.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we should look at the possibility. This is a long term objective and I hope there will be many suggestions and criticisms of our work after we have finished. Although I am in favour of fixed term parliaments, I think the method by which we would get back to a fixed date in November after a double dissolution is unnecessarily complex. I believe the fixed term should run from the date of the election, whenever that may be. If there is an election the Senate should then run for six years and the House of Representatives should run for three years. If there is a double dissolution the starting point for the new fixed term should be the date of that double dissolution. I think a government can be relied on to pick a convenient date when it forces a double dissolution on that count and that would simplify very much the transitional procedures laid down in this amendment. I think also it is worth emphasising as often as possible that the provisions of the Bill, as they stand, make Senate obstruction less likely because under this Bill the Prime Minister would not have the power to hold an election. The Senate, by rejecting a Bill, would be giving him that power. Therefore, that would be an action which I think the Senate would consider very carefully. That, I think, would make for better government in this country. On the other hand, the provisions whereby the new Parliament sits for only the balance of a fixed term, except in the case of double dissolutions, would obviously make the solutions less likely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to draw attention to one point. I am not moving this as an amendment as we are really producing a discussion document. I would like to draw the attention of Senator Evans in particular to this. I think there is a very good case for allowing governments to store up the grounds for forcing a double dissolution. The purpose of having a double dissolution power is to resolve a conflict between the two Houses. To me, the word 'conflict' has a certain immediacy. If the government can live with a situation for months and even years , and then suddenly call a double dissolution using that as a ground, I do not think that is a proper procedure. </PARA>

After the present procedures have been gone through and there has been a disagreement between two Houses justifying a double dissolution, I would like to suggest-though I am not going to move this as an amendment-as a basis for future thought that if that ground for a double dissolution has not been taken up within six months that ground can lapse. I believe that after six months it ceases to be a genuine disagreement between the two Houses. If there were a genuine disagreement the Government would have to act more immediately than waiting for months or even years and storing up a great stock of double dissolution Bills. I put that point not as an amendment but merely as a subject that might deserve further investigation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the concept of fixed term parliaments and all that flows from that. Whilst I do not think that Senator Evans's Bill is the perfect Bill, we obviously face a difficult problem. Senator Evans basically accepts, except for a couple of points to which I will come later, the parliamentary system as it works in Australia today. In determining how one gets fixed term parliaments with a structure such as we have with the House of Representatives and the Senate, and the sense of the composition of those Houses, we have limitations placed upon us immediately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I rise at this point to state a couple of views. I have not raised specifics either in the debate today or in the second reading debate. I very strongly support the sense of a fixed term parliament. Earlier today in the Senate I asked a question of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Sir John Carrick) in relation to a statement made about the possibility of another referendum on so-called simultaneous elections. This Bill shows that it is possible to have simultaneous elections without the need for the sort of constitutional change which many people believe leads to a diminution of power. So I support the concept. Possibly it is not the perfect concept-I do not know what the perfect one is-but it is certainly one that is worth debating. As I have said, appreciating the difficulties of framing such a concept at all, this legislation shows that it is possible to have an alternative method of conducting simultaneous elections without necessarily tampering with the power of Houses. Without being in any way facetious, it was suggested today that it would be a good idea if I outlined some of the alternatives to others. I just commend Senator Evans's Bill to them. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment sets out, so far as the duration of the House of Representatives is concerned, the basic fixed term rule in its proposed new modified form. Indeed, it perhaps sets it out rather more clearly than was the case in section 13 where the debate on the proposed new modified fixed term rule in fact largely already occurred. I simply say that the effect of the new section 28 draft will be as follows: In the event of the House expiring in the ordinary way, after seeing out its full three-year term, the House is dissolved on the last Thursday in October and the election is held on the third Saturday in November. In the event of the House being prematurely dissolved as a result of the defeat of the Government in the House of Representatives and the inability of any alternative government to command a majority, the provision is that the newly elected House does not, unless the extraordinary election occurs within three months of the ordinary scheduled date, commence a new three-year cycle but merely serves out the remainder of the original term. </PARA>
<PARA> This revised version of section 28 further provides that in the event of a double dissolution which, of course, cannot by virtue of section 57 of the Constitution, which it is proposed should not be altered in this respect, occur within the last six months of the Government's term, the newly elected House of Representatives merely serves out again the remainder of the original term. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I draw the Committee's attention to the existence of complicated, but I assure the Committee, appropriate transitional provisions to cover the initial implementation of these provisions. I think that the debate on this clause is essentially exactly the same debate we have had in the context of section 13-the concept of the restoration of the cycle that is here involved.

This is simply a measure-a supplementary measure if one likes-to ensure that the fixed term timetable is in fact maintained and is not capable of disruption by the exercise of some discretionary executive power.

<PARA> I move amendment No. 3 circulated in my name:</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Page 5, clause 8, lines 10 and 11, leave out 'appropriating revenue or moneys or imposing taxation', substitute 'to which the seventh paragraph of this section applies'. </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of the amendment is as follows: The original proposal was, to put it bluntly, that the powers of the Senate with respect to all classes of money Bill -taxation and appropriation Bills-should be removed; that the Senate have no power at all to reject or in any other way block or obstruct the passage of such Bills. Of course, that is consistent with the philosophy of the Labor Party concerning the role of this place. I do not in any way seek to withdraw from that basic philosophy. However, upon mature reflection it seemed that the prospects for a successful passage of this measure might be enhanced if some modification of that original stance occurred. Therefore the proposal, as it is now put to the Senate, provides that only a relatively moderate further limitation be placed on the Senate's existing, already somewhat limited, money powers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed that the limits imposed be, first of all, in respect of proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government-which means in practice appropriations of the kind contained in our present Budget Appropriation Bill (No. 1), the supplementary Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Supply Bill (No. 1), which recur each year. I believe that the concept of ordinary annual services is sufficiently familiar to honourable senators as not to require any more elaborate treatment than saying that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is further provided by the proposed amendment to clause 8, in other words to section 53 of the Constitution, that a limitation shall be imposed on the capacity of the Senate in respect of those tax laws which are certified by the Governor-General in Council to be necessary for the purpose of raising revenue for the ordinary annual services of the Government. But rather than that being a provision at large, which would in fact limit the capacity of the Senate to deal adversely with, in effect, any tax measure that could be so described, it is provided that only one such message can be given by the Governor-General each year. </PARA>
<PARA> The practical expectation is that such a message would be given in respect of the annual package of Budget tax measures. What this is all about, when stripped back to plain language, is a proposal that the Senate's money Bill power should be limited in respect of the basic Supply Bills on which the survival of the Government depends; also, that the Senate's money powers should be further amended in respect of those money raising measures which are, in turn, necessary for the survival of the government of the day. What this proposal, if passed, would guarantee is that the Government's Budget package of Bills each year would survive the depredations of the Senate quite unscathed. This measure, which I presume would appeal to the present Government-and I would be interested to hear any view that Senator Chaney has on it-would further guarantee that the basic Supply or Appropriation Bills each year, those passed in May, October and November, after the presentation of the Budget and supplementary appropriations respectively, would also survive unscathed. To that extent, this measure is one which, unashamedly, seeks to limit one aspect at least of this Senate's power, a power that in 1974 was asserted in spectacular circumstances for the first time in our history and again was asserted in even more spectacular circumstances, and more controversially, in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> The measure, for reasons which I think it is necessary for me to explain, is very much a part of the fixed term concept. It might be thought at first blush that measures of this kind have nothing to do with bringing about fixed term parliaments. But of course, as I have said quite unashamedly right from the outset of this debate, I see fixed term parliaments as having not just one but two rationales. One obviously is to introduce a greater degree of stability, less uncertainty, into the election cycle and remove the capacity of the Prime Minister of the day to call elections according to his own opportunistic whim, but I and the Labor Party have also said from the outset that there is another cognate motivation for proposing this measure. That is, that it would solve the problems of 1975 which, in our calmer and saner moments, we readily concede to each other are still with us. We concede to each other, often only regrettably, off the record, that there are problems in the way in which the Constitution is structured, problems which can bring home serious consequences for governments of both political colours if matters should continue to proceed along the path that was mapped out in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> So the fixed term parliament concept has all along been motivated, at least partially, by a desire to find a solution of this particular aspect of the problem, which most people would agree to be one of Senate power. To an extent it can be argued that having a fixed term system in place creates a set of dynamics which will operate against the Senate exercising these particular Supply blocking types of powers, without the necessity to change the language of section 53 itself. </PARA>
<PARA> That argument has been put to me by many right from the outset, including even those who are quite sympathetic to the desire to limit the effective capacity of the Senate to block Supply. It has been said, and I have taken the point myself, that if the Constitution effectively prohibits an early election being called there is no point in the Senate exercising its Supply blocking powers to force to the polls a government that it does not like-there is a constitutional prohibition on that actually occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty about that argument is several-fold. One concerns the particular qualified model of a fixed term parliament for which we have opted. It might be a very strong argument in the context of a totally unqualified fixed term system , but that is not the model that, for a whole variety of other reasons which we have debated at other times, we propose. As a result, there are weaknesses in that scenario. For a start, if the pre-conditions for a double dissolution are there, if the trigger mechanism is in place by virtue of some prior rejection by the Senate of a House of Representatives measure, it is of course possible, as occurred in both 1974 and 1975, for the Senate to block Supply and in effect hold the gun at the head of the Government, saying: 'The pre-conditions for double dissolution are satisfied. You can go to an election technically right now without waiting for three months to elapse pursuant to section 57 as a result of our blocking of supply, and you must go.' So if the trigger is cocked in that way it will still be possible for the Senate to exercise that role. The second problem which arises is based upon the other qualification to the fixed term principle, and that is that an early election can take place, as we have agreed, where a government is the subject of a no-confidence resolution in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, it can be argued and has been argued that a Senate bent upon the destruction of the government of the day, even in the absence of a double dissolution trigger mechanism being in place, could say to the government of the day: 'We are blocking Supply. You must go to the polls.' To the answer from that government that the Constitution does not allow it to go to the polls, the Senate could then say: 'Well, you pass a resolution of no confidence in yourself .' That point has been made by Senator Lewis and others who have claimed that this was in fact a weakness of the fixed term system because it would always be possible for a government of the day to beat the system by passing a vote of no confidence in itself. Whilst it is difficult to imagine any sane government doing that of its motion, it is perhaps not difficult to imagine a government doing that in the context of a threat of national disarray and disruption of the kind that could be created by the Senate's blocking Supply. So there is that possibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are getting away from the basic argument which I would love to debate but this is not the occasion to do so about what the Senate can force the House of Representatives to do and not what the House of Representatives might be minded to do if it thought it could persuade the electorate that it was behaving rationally in so doing. So if we approach this issue from the point of view of seeking to find a mechanism to reduce the possibility of utterly disruptive 1975-type conflict, then there are weaknesses in the capacity of this Bill, in the absence of a section 53 provision of the kind I am proposing to secure that result. Of course, if one approaches this from the perspective of Senator Lewis, Senator Chaney and others who think that what happened in 1975 was terrific and would be only too delighted to have the opportunity to do it again, of course none of the argument, I am making will appeal very much to them ; nor perhaps will the further argument I make, which worries me a little, about a fixed term system coming into existence in the absence of a change to section 53. That is the argument that, far from weakening the powers of the Senate in a fixed term system, without some such modification to section 53 as I am proposing, may in fact strengthen the powers of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The way this would occur would be in the context of Budget negotiations where it is suggested that we might move to something like the United States scenario where the Budget would be initiated in the House of Representatives, come up to the Senate and the Senate would simply dig in its toes and refuse to pass the Budget, wanting thereby not to force the Government to the polls but to force changes in the composition of the Budget. The fact that the Constitution did not allow for an early election, and the fact that simultaneously the Constitution allowed the Senate to dig in its heels in this particular way, would create a situation that arguably could then be resolved only by negotiation over time. We would have a Mexican stand-off over the Budget with the Senate's insisting on its amendments, the House of Representatives refusing them, everyone knowing that time was ticking by and that ultimately the Budget would have to be passed in the interests of the nation, and ultimately some compromise being wrought, which is of course the thing that happens every year in the United States with the Budget. </PARA>

It might take some time to develop but it is something that we have to take seriously. Again, the Senate chauvinists in our midst will say 'whacko, that is a further development in the historical process of over-weening power being vested in the Senate and a further wholly desirable change in the direction of currupting the equality of Australian democracy'. I would hope that the saner heads in the Senate, among whom I hope Senator Missen counts himself, along with Senator Martin and Senator Bonner-there is no doubt at all about Senator Hamer-would reflect upon the point I am making and appreciate that really one does need some amendment modification to section 53 if we are to have a fixed term system in place which does not create potentially greater difficulties for this nation than even we arguably experienced in 1975.

That has long been recognised as one of the really unsatisfactory features of our present system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, there is a lack of an ideal situation in both the present system and what is proposed. It is possible that we might find disruption at some time because the Senate will not pass the Budget and cannot force an election but can cause embarrassment. I am inclined to think that political realities would soon force a Senate which no longer had the opportunity to cause an election to think twice about it. So far as the general power that is proposed to be modified by this clause is concerned, I made some comments on this on 25 March. I will just repeat a few words. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> I might say that, in any ideal climate, I would cheerfully see the removal of the Senate's ultimate power to refuse supply or defeat money bills. I do not see it as essential to the Senate's real work, as a house of review of legislation and as a powerful investigatory House. It is a weapon altogether too potent and destructive, a blunt instrument which may be used at any time by the politically ambitious-usually residing in the House of Representatives. I do not regard the use of this weapon in 1975 as a sign of Senate power but rather of weakness. </PARA>
<PARA>I stand by those remarks which I made then and I say that, as a separate matter, I think there should be some consideration of the Supply power. But one has to face realities in this matter. Any suggestion at present of a change of the rights of the Senate over Supply, which is exaggerated very much in the public eye as being some tremendously important thing rather than a blunt instrument around our necks, raises immediately the possibility of a host of enemies around Australia. If one is going to pass a sensible change-if there is any possibility of it-I say to Senator Evans that we cannot incorporate this excrescence, which it is, in the one proposal. He knows how difficult it is for constitutional referenda to be carried in any event, especially where they are complicated and where they cover a number of subjects. Indeed, this would be rolling into one Bill two very important arguments. I have not the slightest doubt where the basis of controversy would happen in a campaign. It would be exaggerated if this in fact were seen. It was seen in a mini way in the debate on the second reading in this chamber where the eloquence of Senator Crichton-Browne was devoted very substantially to an attack on the Supply power, on the precious power of the Senate and not on the fixed term issue. That is what one would expect to happen if this became a public debate by way of referendum. No matter what amendments and variations may be proposed, if the extraneous idea of changing the powers of the Senate is brought in, instead of doing what the concept of fixed terms really does, that action creates a by-pass operation. It enables us to get around the blockage which has been occurring in public thinking for a long time and ensures that there will not be much use in using the power over Supply or using that argument in the public controversies that occur. Therefore, I believe that we should stick to this as a fixed term proposal and have it rigidly expressed in that way before the public. For that purpose we should remove clauses 8 and 9. </PARA>

I should make it clear also that I will be opposing Senator Macklin's amendment. I will oppose each for the same reason. The clauses are extraneous to the Bill. They are not, in my view, necessary. Senator Evans painted a number of scenarios under which they might be necessary. The one to which he gave most weight was what he called the Mexican stand-off, that is, that this chamber could negotiate each year on the Budget knowing that the Government had to have the Budget through by the end of November or whatever date was appropriate. That is possible now. It does not happen now. It is a thing with which we live now. I find no very great difficulty in envisaging living with it under conditions of fixed term parliaments. Circumstances will be no different because of fixed term parliaments. If they were, the provisions for a double dissolution would apply in both circumstances. I am not fussed at all about that. The reason I do not like this provision is that I want the public and the people interested in this matter to have a look at the fixed term concept as a concept. Once we bring in this highly controversial and contentious issue, the Senate's power over money Bills and over Supply will receive attention; and this proposal will fail for that reason.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also will oppose clause 8. I fully support the proposition that Senator Hamer has put forward. I have circulated to honourable senators a substitute for this clause, if the Committee should so desire to have such a clause in the Bill. The proposition that I mentioned regarding clause 1-that it would be a far better Bill if it dealt with only one item-I still stand by. I believe that the amendment that I foreshadowed may very well meet all the problems that have arisen in debates on Supply since 1975. It is a proposition that ultimately increases the powers of the Senate. I believe that the part of section 53 of the Constitution which states 'The Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation' ought to be deleted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the Senate ought to have the power to amend and review any legislation. That is an essential development of our Federal system. On the other hand, we also need a workable Federal system. If one takes the notion that the Senate is a House of review, this may give us the clue as to where to go. The Senate ought to have the power to review every piece of legislation that comes before it. How that might be compatible in what Senator Evans is seeking to achieve with his amendment is that a government in the House of Representatives could have some confidence that it would receive Supply. I believe that could be achieved by saying that in relation to the Appropriation Bills-we really do not need to talk about taxation measures here since they flow on from year to year-the House of Representatives ought to be entitled to the level of appropriation that the Senate itself reviewed and passed in the previous year. That is the kernel of the foreshadowed amendments. If the Committee is so desirous to have such a clause within the Bill, I believe it would be preferable to that which Senator Evans has included. It is a political movement in two ways: It extends the power of the Senate to the position to which it ought to have been extended, that is, it gives the Senate the right to review every piece of legislation regardless of whether it is a money Bill or not. Essentially, that is what the Senate can do. </PARA>
<PARA> The difference between an amendment and a request, as we have seen within the last year, becomes an academic concern in that essentially what the Senate can do by way of request it can do by way of amendment to other Bills. The House of Representatives and the government in the House of Representatives-that is, the Executive wing of government, which is within the legislature-must also have some security of tenure. These are the contending propositions that we have had since 1975. I believe that all proposals to date, rather than to seek a consensus, have drawn the parties apart. I believe my proposal would extend the powers of the Senate and, at the same time, secure for the House of Representatives a level of appropriation that the Senate itself had considered adequate for the previous financial year. That might not be everything that the Government would wish but it would be held secure that no matter what, after 30 days, as my amendment suggests, the House of Representatives would be entitled to go to the Governor-General for the Queen's assent to the legislation as if it had passed both Houses. </PARA>
<PARA> If a government seeks to go beyond the mandate that the Senate itself in the previous financial year had granted, that is entirely up to the Senate. In other words, by extending the Senate's power over appropriation we are increasing that power of federation to query, to review and to reject anything that the Senate does not consider appropriate. On the other hand, by this method the House of Representatives could be content that the Senate could not prevent it from governing. It could not prevent it from receiving a due appropriation although it may not be able to receive that appropriation for all its new activities. The way out of this is to think laterally from the way we have been thinking. No proposal yet has actually considered that by technically extending the powers of the Senate we can secure for the Executive its appropriation. That is the amendment I foreshadow. If Senator Evans's clause remains intact, I will move this clause that I have circulated to honourable senators to replace it. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 5, after clause 8, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA> '8A. The Constitution is altered by omitting section 54 and substituting the following section:</PARA>
<PARA> ''54. Laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government shall contain only such appropriation, and any law which contravenes this section shall be of no effect.''.'. </PARA>
<PARA>The effect of this amendment is to put some teeth into the Constitution. Currently, of course, section 54 of the Constitution states:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposed law which appropriates revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government shall deal only with such appropriation. </PARA>
<PARA>Since we are dealing only with a proposed law then indeed there is no possibility of High Court intervention in relation to that item until it becomes law. I will admit that the amendment again contravenes the proposals that I have been supporting that we should deal only with one issue. I wish to raise it because I believe it is an issue that is current and does come within the purview of the discussions the Senate has been having. It would be more appropriate if we re-phrased the law so that a judgment could in fact be made in relation to those particular laws and they could be brought under the purview of the High Court. Hence, I have moved an amendment. I believe the indications are that the amendment will not be passed. I believe it is an item which we need to discuss at a later date, particularly the means by which the High Court is able to give interpretations in relation to the Constitution. I believe that as we move through our constitutional history this proposal may become more and more important. Many of the problems experienced in 1975 arose because of the inability of the High Court to give a deliberative type of judgment. It seems to me that now may well be the right time to look at how we can re-draw our Constitution to enable the High Court to give those types of judgments, before an event such as that which occurred in 1975 rather than after it. </PARA>

I do not see any utility in having it made justiciable in the absence of the kind of provision that Senator Macklin was seeking to incorporate in his previous amendment. It made some sense to have it tightened up in that context. In my submission, it makes no sense at all in the absence of the success of Senator Macklin's previous amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to raise a matter which I feel ought to be brought to the attention of all South Australians. It concerns the deliberate attempt by the Tonkin Government in South Australia to mislead the public about the State's economic performance under its leadership. Figures supplied by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show clearly that the investment figures used by the Government have been fabricated. Last week the Premier claimed that of total manufacturing investment in Australia, one-fifth or 20 per cent was in South Australia. The ABS figures show that this is totally untrue and that the real figure is 7.4 per cent, less than one-twelfth. The Premier claimed also that South Australia's share of total investment in Australia was now higher than it was under Labor. Again, ABS figures show that South Australia 's share of the national investment cake has fallen from 7.5 per cent in September 1979 to the current level of just 6.3 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Liberals have also deliberately tried to pull the wool over the people's eyes in relation to employment. The fact is that there are 51,200 people out of work in South Australia; that is, 5,300 more than in 1979. The Premier claimed also that employment has actually grown over the last three years. The fact is that total full time employment in South Australia actually fell by 1,700 between 1979 and 1982. According to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, in the last year total employment fell by nearly 13,000. Finally, the Premier has claimed that there are now more job vacancies in South Australia when in actual fact the number of job vacancies has fallen by more than 50 per cent since 1979. Therefore, as I have shown, the Tonkin Liberal Government is guilty of a malicious and carefully orchestrated attempt to mislead the South Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I want now to summarise briefly the economic performance of South Australia over the last three years under the Tonkin Government. As I have already mentioned, unemployment is up by 5,300 and is now running at 9 per cent in metropolitan Adelaide and even higher at Whyalla and Mount Gambier. Youth unemployment in South Australia is now up to 29 per cent, the highest level in Australia. The average duration of unemployment has skyrocketed from 32 weeks in 1979 to 40 weeks in 1982. The number of person unemployed for each job vacancy has risen from 20 in 1979 to 50 in 1982, an increase of some 150 per cent. Of course, the unemployment figures would be much higher only for the fact that thousands of South Australian have left the State to try to find work in other States. As I indicated a moment ago, total full time employment in South Australia has fallen by 1,700 since the Liberals came to power, while in Australia as a whole total employment has risent by 300,000. </PARA>
<PARA> In the building industry, the level of new dwellings approved in the three months to August was 32 per cent below the 1979 level. New dwellings completed in the 1981-82 financial year were over 1,000 units below what they were in 1978 -79 under the Labor Government. In real terms, new private business premises completed in 1982 were 20 per cent below the figure achieved in 1979. New foreign investment approved in South Australia in 1980-81 was $3.4m below the 1978-79 level. So much for the achievements of the Tonkin Government. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as State finances are concerned, the figures show clearly that the Tonkin Government has not honoured its 1979 promises to cut taxes. In 1982-83, according to the South Australian Budget Papers, total State revenue will be $ 552m, an increase of 44 per cent over the 1978-79 level. State taxes per head of population increased from $296 in 1979 to $414 in 1982, an increase of 40 per cent. Surely the clearest indication of the Tonkin Government's incompetence in economic management is the fact that the Budget outcome in 1982-83 will be a $61 .3m deficit, compared with a surplus of $6.5m in the last year of the Labor Government. It is as a direct result of the Tonkin Government's mismanagement of the South Australian economy that the total number of people directly employed by the State Government has fallen by 5,000 since 1979. South Australia is the only State in which such a fall has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The outlook for South Australia is certainly very poor indeed, with retrenchments now occuring almost daily. An article in the Adelaide Advertiser on Wednesday by industrial reporter Michael Grealy shows quite clearly that the dramatic worsening of the State's unemployment situation is one of the reasons why the Liberals decided to go to the people in November rather than in March. I quote a small portion of the article, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>South Australia is well into a serious downturn in the manufacturing industry. It has not been evident for most of the year, but especially since July. The Metal Industry Association of South Australia does not expect improvements until at least the middle of next year. Its director, Allan Swinstead estimates that 10 per cent of the 40,000 jobs lost nationally in the metal industry so far this year have been lost in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for Mr Tonkin's claim that South Australia is not doing as badly as other States. I quote further from the article:</PARA>
<PARA>Vehicle and automotive components manufacturers, so important to South Australia 's industrial base, have entered a slump that is expected to get much worse before any improvement takes place. The prospects for the housing and timber industries remain bleak. Consumer and service sectors, particularly South Australia's white goods industry, have deteriorated. </PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on. The fact is that South Australia, because of its heavy dependence on the car and white goods industries, will no doubt fare worse than the other States in the next 12 months. All that the Tonkin Government can deliver is pie in the sky mining developments which will not create jobs until 1990. For instance, in the Adelaide Advertiser today we find the headline 'U- plant unlikely before 1990: Group chairman'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> A uranium enrichment plant, either in South Australia or Queensland, was unlikely to be built before 1990, the Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia chairman, Mr E. F. Herbert said last night. </PARA>
<PARA> UEGA was looking at a time span of three to four years 'before any question of a decision to proceed with a plant is around the corner.'</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Herbert said last night it was 'difficult to envisage a uranium enrichment plant coming into production until 1990'. </PARA>
<PARA>What South Australia needs now is a government that has the capacity to restructure our industrial base and attract diversified industries to the State. If Mr Tonkin seriously believed what he has been saying lately, he would have accepted Mr Bannon's offer to debate the issues on television. If the Liberals seriously believe their costing of Labor's programs is accurate, why are they not prepared to have both parties' programs submitted to an independent body for scrutiny? The fact is that the Liberals are becoming so desperate that they will try any underhanded or sneaky tricks to mislead the people of South Australia. What they do not realise is that the people of South Australia know that they were conned in 1979, and come 6 November I am confident that Mr Tonkin will be scourged from office and South Australia will once again forge ahead confidently under the Bannon Labor Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That rather florid rhetoric, which was read so precisely by Senator Foreman, has some very selective defects, as I shall show. For example, let us take almost his last point-uranium enrichment. He said that what had been said was that uranium enrichment would create no jobs until 1990. But then he was careful to read what Mr Herbert had said, and that is that it was difficult to envisage it coming into production until 1990. The difference there is that building a uranium enrichment plant takes some 2,000 people quite some years, and it has to be built over those years for it to come into production by 1990. What Senator Foreman did not say, because it would have spoilt his argument, was that what the chairman of the Uranium Enrichment Group of Australia was indicating was that such a plant being built to meet the market of 1990 would create over the years some 2,000 jobs a year and, when in operation, some 800 jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The defect of Senator Foreman's argument is that history has shown that the great time of the expansion in South Australia in jobs and industry was under the Playford Liberal Government. You yourself, Mr President, being a South Australian, will recollect that it was the Playford Government that brought to South Australia the concept of development of industry, the automotive industries, the white goods industries, the decentralisation of towns and cities , such as Elizabeth, and the great growth of jobs for what had been a State that was dependent almost exclusively on rural matters. That impetus was stifled under the Dunstan Government. The decade of the Dunstan Government was such that there was no growth of industry to speak of, to the point that the Tonkin Government was elected to office because of the stagnation of the Dunstan Government. It is worthwhile for Senator Foreman to recollect why the people of South Australia put out the Dunstan Government. It was because it was neglecting bringing in new industries. Of course, one cannot rectify the errors of a decade in the brief space of three years, but let us have a little look at this matter, bearing in mind that Senator Foreman has been very selective indeed. I note that the Premier of South Australia said in his policy speech the other night:</PARA>
<PARA>We inherited the highest level of unemployment in Australia in 1979. </PARA>
<PARA>That is something that the electors knew had come about because there had been a decade of neglect. Honourable senators will recall that Senator McLaren said recently that there had been no new industries in the Tonkin era. Today I was able to give the Senate statistics to show that in the first two years of the Tonkin Government nearly 7,000 new companies were registered and that the number of companies actually on the register increased from 39,041 in June 1980 to 41, 570 in June 1981-a net increase of 6.5 per cent in the space of that one year. Here is evidence indeed. Those figures come from the South Australian Corporate Affairs Commission. Of course, one cannot give a list of some 7,000, but some 86 manufacturing projects have had a total project cost of more than $250m completed in South Australia since October 1979. Of course, these results will not show until they are in place, but the Premier of South Australia was able to say in his policy speech a few days ago:</PARA>
<PARA>Since we were elected to Government-a full three-year term ago-some $1,500m has been invested in the manufacturing industry in South Australia-almost one fifth of the national total. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that the investment of sums of money during that time will reap its benefit in the years ahead. It cannot be instantaneous. We cannot have the waste of a decade of the Dunstan Labor Government and suddenly create jobs. Let us look at the kind of projects that are now being lined up. It is very important to understand that the Labor Party is knocking these projects. Suddenly, several days ago, there was some suggestion that the Roxby Downs project might not be rejected by the Labor Party. But we cannot turn back the vote in the South Australian Parliament. History has that. We cannot turn back the decision of the Federal Conference of the Labor Party on uranium. History is there for that. Indeed, industry after industry overseas asks the question how it could be sure that it could establish in South Australia if there were a change of government, because clearly the policy is to prevent those things.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Foreman is very selective indeed. He forgot that the Cooper Basin-Stony Point project is something very real, because liquids are flowing down that project now to Stony Point. The installation there has created jobs. That project has a capacity for 3,000 jobs. Senator Foreman has forgotten that there is under discussion the establishment of a refinery and petrochemical industry there. All these things are tangible. There is a pipeline in position. The fluids are coming down from Cooper Basin. A very big infrastructure is developing at Stony Point. In that Iron Triangle there is the opportunity for more industries. </PARA>
<PARA> At Roxby Downs-which were dirty words to the Labor Party until the cool air of the election came upon that party because it was rejecting it-there is the opportunity of 1,000 jobs now, with the potential for many more thousands of jobs in the future. The tourist industry has an extra 3,000 jobs now and a potential for up to 10,000. It is not good enough to sneer and say 'Ah, Roxby Downs; that is for the years ahead'. The fundamental defect of the Labor Party is that it rejected any concept of lead time during the decade of the Dunstan Government. It did not put into place these large industries, as the Playford Government had done with the automotive industries and others. The Tonkin Government inherited a situation of stagnation. It came to office because the people rejected the inertia of the Dunstan Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not hold up honourable senators tonight. As I have said, the clear case is that the figures will demonstrate that what is being put in position now is a development of industrial infrastructure which will, under a Liberal government, provide some thousands more jobs. The Premier has said that his blueprint indicates the provision of some 30,000 more jobs in the years ahead, and that is where the solid base of government is aimed. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Information about the quantity and preparations of meat products purchased by pet owners is not available to my Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Small hydatid cysts in offal can pass close inspection undetected. Such offal could be sold to the public. If eaten by the human it would not produce infection. If offal is fed in the raw state to dogs or other Canidae, the human could become infected through the faeces of such animals. The signs and symptoms occurring in the infected human depend upon the size and location of the hydatid cysts. Whilst location of the cysts is frequently in the liver and lungs, most tissues can be the site of cyst development. Involvement of vital organs could prove fatal. Epilepsy and blindness could occur from invasion of the central nervous system, although the likelihood is small.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Such a campaign is the responsibility of State and Territory health authorities. Campaigns to highlight the dangers of hydatid diseases have been conducted by State and Territory health and agricultural authorities over many years. Pamphlets and other literature are available from these authorities as part of continuing campaigns. Repeated education reinforcement for the general public is the most effective means of increasing public awareness.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Health and Medical Research Council, at its 93rd Session in June 1982, issued the following statement which has been drawn to the attention of the relevant State and Territory authorities:</PARA>
<PARA>Sale of Raw Offal</PARA>
<PARA> The Council noted varying practices in the States and Territories for inspection and sale of raw offal, both as pet food and for human consumption.</PARA>
<PARA> Although offal may be passed as fit for human consumption it could still contain hydatid cysts. Although the cysts are harmless to humans, the disease could be transmitted to pets in this way. For this reason, no raw offal should be fed to pets. All raw offal, including liver, should be thoroughly cooked before feeding to dogs.</PARA>
<PARA> Council suggested that the States and Territories might consider the display of posters in butcher shops as a useful means of drawing this matter to the attention of the public.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am advised that Mr R. J. Smith has not made any threat against Mr D. W. Witheford. There is therefore no question of an investigation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2 and 3) Senator Primmer asked whether certain files or documents which he described as 'relevant' and as having been lost by my Department, had been found . I note first that with respect to the documents provided to the Department of Finance investigators, those officers stated at page iv of their report, which I tabled in the House on 26 August that, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Access to all documents requested was provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs. While there is no technical way of establishing whether the files consulted were complete, as the file folios are not always numbered, the investigating officers were not conscious of any significant gaps in them.'</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Witheford has referred to the fact that some documents relating to events during the period have not yet been located. In this regard I note that a substantial quantity of original departmental documents were attached by Mr Witheford to the statement of allegations which he submitted to me for investigation on 8 April 1982 (page ii of the Finance report refers to some 95 documents). Those original documents had earlier been in the Department's custody. The removal of these documents from their authorised storage place did result in some gaps in the Department's files. As mentioned above, however, in their report the investigating officers stated that 'access to all documents requested was provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs'.</PARA>
<PARA> If Mr Witheford or anyone else still has official documents in his possession, he should hand those over to the Minister or to the Department to whom they belong. In this regard I repeat my statement of some six months ago that if there is in the hands of individuals any information relating to this matter, that information should be brought forward.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Mr Witheford's allegations against the Federal Police are still the subject of investigation by the Police Internal Investigation Division. The report of that investigation will be transmitted to the Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) As to Mr Bowden and his children's taxation obligations, I note that this is now raised for the first time in relation to this matter. Matters relating to those taxation obligations are not matters for the Minister for Foreign Affairs but for the Commissioner of Taxation.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Although it is true that there was an inaccurate reference to Mr Bowden's arrival in Hong Kong in my statement of 26 August as a result of an error in the preparation of the final draft of the statement, the details of the matter and the investigations made into it are completely clear from the report by the Department of Finance which I tabled. It is clear from that report that there is no suggestion whatsoever that Mr Bowden was in any way personally responsible for or involved with the fraudulent conversion of the cheque in Hong Kong. The matter was fully investigated by both the Hong Kong and Australian police at the time. To attempt by innuendo or inference to link Mr Bowden with that fraudulent conversion is completely unwarranted.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Mr Bowden arrived in Hong Kong on 6 June 1972.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The cheque was drawn on 20 October 1972.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) The statement made by Mr Henderson to Senate Estimates Committee D on 10 September is a factual account of the enquiry and other matters.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) The question of what is described as 'restoring the careers' of staff withdrawn from the Tehran Embassy has been covered in my statement of 26 August.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) Neither Mr Henderson nor Mr Bowden has been suspended from duty because there is no reason for them to be suspended.</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="2034" SPEAKER="Messner Sen The Hon A.J." NAMEID="9I4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 August 1982 (Hansard, page 392) Senator Ryan asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question concerns the role that the Australian Federal Police will play at the forthcoming Commonwealth Games. Will members of the Australian Federal Police be sworn into the Queensland police force as special constables? Will any members of the Australian Federal Police be used to implement the much criticised Commonwealth Games Act in Queensland? Can the Minister guarantee that the Australian Federal Police will not be used at the Commonwealth Games to deny any person's right of peaceful protest? Will the Australian Federal Police be available to be used to ensure the security of National Aboriginal Conference members who will be meeting in Brisbane at that time?</PARA>
<PARA> Later that day, I advised that the AFP would be providing assistance for VIP protection, airport security, bomb search and mail screening-functions normally undertaken by the AFP. In addition, the AFP had been asked by Queensland to provide a liaison officer in the Queensland Police headquarters operations room and assistance in policing the marathon route. I undertook to obtain further information in relation to the assistance for the marathon route.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has now provided the following further information:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government, after carefully considering the matter, agreed to the Queensland request for AFP assistance in policing the marathon route. Approximately 125 AFP members were involved on the morning of 8 October 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> Although AFP members were made special constables of the Queensland Police to provide them with appropriate general police powers, the line of command permitted AFP members manning the marathon route to remain under the command of AFP officers.</PARA>
<PARA> The marathon route was not notified under the Queensland Commonwealth Games Act.</PARA>
<PARA> The assistance requested from the AFP was provided in a professional and unobtrusive manner. In this regard, it should be noted that the marathon event was in no way marred by any demonstrations or similar activities.</PARA>
<PARA> As it was not possible for a full reply to be incorporated in Hansard before the marathon, I wrote to the honourable Senator on 6 October advising of the Government's decision to provide assistance for the marathon route.</PARA>
