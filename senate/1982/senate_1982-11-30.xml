<TITLE>Tasmania Wilderness Areas</TITLE>
<PARA>To the honourable the President and the Members of the Senate, in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned at proposed future hydro-electric developments in South West Tasmania. As this area is on the Register of the National Estate it is therefore of national concern and your petitioners humbly call upon the Senate to conduct a Senate Inquiry into South West Tasmania. A Federal Inquiry has been recommended by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly call upon the Federal Parliament not to allocate funds or allow funds to be raised for development of roads or dams in the South West of Tasmania but rather to provide such funds as would enable the preservation of this area. This is a national issue and therefore Tasmanians should not be made to bear any financial burden resulting from its preservation.</PARA>

<PARA> That the continuing high level of tax avoidance and evasion is cause for grave concern for honest Australian taxpayers, and demands stringent and immediate action by the Commonwealth, noting in particular:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The latest estimate by the Australian Taxpayers' Association is that $7,000m a year is being lost in taxation revenue;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. In view of conflicting terminology which is being used, is the Government proposing to introduce a wages freeze or a wages pause? Which is it to be and what is to be its duration? Will there be provision for a catch-up at the end of the period of freeze or pause?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has made it abundantly clear that it seeks, throughout Australia, to get for a period of a year a cessation of the upward movement of wages. It has made that abundantly clear. Whether one wants to use the word 'freeze' or whether one wants to use the word 'pause', the fact is that what the Government aims to do is to bring about stability of the wage system over a period of a year. Quite clearly, the aim is to bring about a reduction, a dramatic reduction if possible, in inflation and, at the same time, to stop the shedding of labour by industries because of high costs. We hope that , by reducing the costs of industries, they will not only maintain their present work force but also in fact increase their work force. The aim, as Senator Button well knows, is to use the money saved in this regard by governments and by enterprise for creating jobs, new employment. The whole question of what should happen at the end of the pause is, of course, a very sensitive one. If indeed there were a sudden upsurge in inflation that could destroy much of the value of the pause. That is a matter which, no doubt, will be the subject of discussion at the Premiers Conference level. The Government needs the co- operation of the Premiers and it needs the co-operation of commerce and industry . Those discussions are currently taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to ask a supplementary question. In view of the Minister' s answer, I ask him whether he has seen the statement by Mr Powell of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures, as reported in yesterday's Press, that ' guaranteeing a rise' at the end of a wage pause would be 'in the best interests of industrial relations and stability'. Did Mr Powell say that the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures also thought that a six months pause was long enough with inflation running at 12 per cent or more? Does the Government agree that there should be a guaranteed wage rise, as advocated by Mr Powell, at the end of any pause?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not see the statement. I am aware that certain persons are advocating a six months wage pause rather than a one year wage pause . The Government takes the view that it would need a longer period to get true stability and to get the factors that would be conducive to re-employment. As to the question of what happens at the end of the freeze or pause, I have pointed out that this is a matter for delicate negotiation because if there were a very substantial rise it would re-institute a stimulus to inflation and so--</PARA></TALK.START>

It is finding now that the Australian Council of Trade Unions is seeing sense in stability of wages at this moment. One by one people are falling away from the Labor Party's stance.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy. I refer to the decision of the Queensland Government to pipe oil from the Jackson field to Brisbane. This would mean the construction of a 770- kilometre pipeline from Jackson to Moonie, probably at a cost of about $125m, in lieu of a pipeline from Jackson to Moomba of 150 kilometres at a cost of about $ 30m, whence the oil would travel the just completed pipeline to the Stoney Point fractionation plant. Is it in the nation's best interests that this extra $95m be expended, or does the Minister still hold the view he put to Estimates Committee E in September that the better economics would be to link the field to the Cooper Basin field?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think at the Estimates Committee I pointed out that this was fundamentally a matter upon which the individual States and the individual enterprises would make their decisions. It is one thing to look at economics. I am sure that it is cheaper, as Senator Hill said, to link the Jackson field with the general Cooper Basin pipeline. There is no doubt about that at all. Other matters may have a bearing, including the intentions and the decisions of the Queensland Government with respect to the developing of oil and gas fields and refineries. I would need more information on those matters before I made any judgment. My understanding is that some discussions are likely to take place with my Department and me. Really until that happens I think I had better not adjudicate on the fairly simplistic information before me at the moment. Of course, it must be cheaper to run a pipeline to the Moomba link and to connect there. That must be so. I would need to know more about some other factors before I adjudicated any further.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations. In the terminology that I use I am assuming that a freeze means a period of no wages increase, with no catch-up at the end of it, and that a pause is a period without a wages increase but with a catch-up at the end of it. If the Government has other ideas about those terms, I hope Senator Chaney will define them. When can we expect a definitive statement of Government policy on whether or not there will be a catch-up at the end of the wage freeze period? Will the Minister tell us whether the Government is proposing a freeze or a pause in the public sector only or in both the public and private sectors? If the latter is proposed, how will a freeze or pause be applied in the private sector?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The precise meaning of the terminology mentioned by Senator Walsh has been the subject of some discussions in the media as well as in this place. Clearly, if what the Government was proposing was something which permitted a catch-up at the end of whatever period was involved, whether it be six or 12 months, there would be no change after that time in Australia's competitive position. So, if the concern of the Government, among other objectives, is to improve Australia's competitive position, the question of a catch-up becomes one of real difficulty. Since I have been asked for a definitive reply, I will ask my colleague the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations to give it to me.</PARA></TALK.START>

Has the Minister indicated that this information, which includes even the actual delineation of the area to be nominated, has not yet been finalised and not yet forwarded to the Commission which meets in Paris on 13 December? Can the Minister explain why it was not forwarded when the nomination was lodged in June 1982? Does the Minister not find it strange that the Government has been unable to come to a decision to send the information when it has known of the nomination since November 1981 when the then Tasmanian Government passed on the nomination to the Federal Government?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have an answer for Senator Chipp which I hope will reassure him considerably. The nomination of the South Western Tasmania Wilderness National Parks to the World Heritage Committee was made by the Australian Government in December 1981 and the nomination then was supported with substantial information. On the basis of that nomination and that information the Bureau of the World Heritage Committee at its meeting in June 1982 unconditionally recommended for inscription on the World Heritage List the South West Tasmania nomination. In doing so the Bureau sought certain additional information. The World Heritage Committee has already placed the matter on the agenda for its meeting on 13 December 1982. It is on the agenda now. The information sought by the Bureau is presently being finalised and will be provided in time for the hearing. I repeat that the information will be available in time for the hearing. In order to support that hearing the permanent head of the Department of Home Affairs and Environment, Dr Don McMichael, has already left Australia to present Australia's case. He will be assisted by the Chairman of the Australian Heritage Commission, Mr Max Bourke. The Prime Minister has stated unequivocally that it is the Government's wish that the listing proceed.

But at the same time there have been considerable settlements which have given rise to wage pressures which we believe, and I think the Australian community believes, to have been utterly counter-productive. In those circumstances, and given the particular conditions which have emerged in Australia over recent months, I believe that most people would accept that extraordinary measures are called for. The seeking of this wage pause is an action of government which is clearly receiving widespread support. The sense of it is evident to the Australian community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I understand that a system is being developed in France, known as 'Sibyl', and that it is broadly as described by Senator Lewis in his question. The Government does not have full information on the matter. Therefore , no detailed evaluation has yet been undertaken. However, the Government is being kept informed on all decoy systems of the kind outlined. Presently, Royal Australian Navy FFG class ships are fitted with United States Navy chaff launchers, known as superrapid blooming off-board chaff or SRBOC. There is a further system, I understand, in development in Australia. This is being undertaken by Australian scientists and was announced in April as being set up in the format of a hovering rocket decoy system, and consequently it may indeed fit the Navy requirements in due course. As I said, that system is under development at present and it may be some considerable time before it comes to pass. The system that is being developed in this country would be significantly different from 'Sibyl'. The evaluation that is finally undertaken would be a matter of very careful consideration by the Government at the appropriate time.</PARA></TALK.START>

That has been recognised. The fact is that had we done this in the Budget it would have been necessary to increase the deficit by another $700m. We were not willing to do so. We are willing to bear down on inflation and, at the same time, widen the opportunities for jobs.

I think that is the point raised by Senator Kilgariff.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that the events which occurred are as follows: On 24 February $501 ,000 was paid from the ABTA to the Northern Land Council. This was a sum equivalent to part of the Ranger royalty payment. I understand that the NLC, under the appropriate Act, had six months in which to pay the money to relevant incorporated Aboriginal bodies, the members of which live in the area affected by those mining operations. I understand further that the Northern Land Council had intended to pay money to the Gagadju Association as it had done in the past but that legal advice was received to the effect that the membership of that Association did not meet the requirements of the Act. Because of that the Association may not have been a proper recipient of the moneys and the Northern Land Council had to reconsider its position. No payment was made within the six months prescribed by the Act. Further legal advice was sought on ways in which the money could be distributed to relevant Aboriginal bodies and court action was contemplated to resolve these various technical difficulties, which were thought to be quite significant. I understand that recently $281,500 was paid to Chudleigh Pty Ltd, a company which is to be renamed Gagadju Holdings Pty Ltd. It is said that the scheme under which the payment has been made does meet the requirements of the Act. I understand that the Minister whom I represent has sought details of the scheme and is also seeking some legal advice as to whether it does meet the circumstances of the Act. I am unable to say whether court proceedings will still be required to clarify the situation.</PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that payments have been delayed for technical legal reasons. It may become desirable to amend the Act later to enable the means of payment to be more flexible. Honourable senators will appreciate that one of the problems we face under this Act is to ensure that all moneys that are paid out are paid out properly and in accordance with legal requirements. The Northern Land Council, in the light of these facts, has acted quite responsibly. I understand that representatives of the Gagadju Association and the Kunwinjku Association were invited to attend and address a meeting of the Executive Council of the Northern Land Council a couple of weeks ago and that at that meeting harmonious agreement was reached on the scheme for payments to be made by the Land Council to companies in accordance with the Act. In the light of that meeting and that arrangement, I understand that the difficulties may be overcome.

The reason for that, of course, is that the benefit is available for people who are subject to the work test and it has been seen as income which ought to be available only if income cannot be earned. This Government has made a number of moves to ease that income test. The most recent moves were made in the last Budget when the free limit was raised from $3 to $10 a week for young unemployed persons and, I think, from $6 to $10 a week for others, making it uniform for all unemployed. At the same time the income over which there is a partial withdrawal of benefit was also extended. The unemployed may now earn, over and above the $10 a week, $50 a week and merely lose part of the unemployment benefit. At the level of $60 a week there is a removal of $25 of the unemployment benefit. So there is that incentive for the unemployed to undertake part time work where it is available. By that means they can improve their situation.</PARA>
<PARA> After earning $60 a week there is a dollar for dollar withdrawal. That used to apply right from the start. Under this Government it has been liberalised up to that $60 level. I can understand why, during a period when unemployment is more serious and where the application of the work test is obviously much more difficult because there is less work available for those seeking it, the matter of further liberalisation should be raised. I can say only that that is a matter which I will certainly bear in mind and which I am sure the Government will consider when it is looking at these questions of benefits. As far as the provision for children is concerned, in the same way I would accept that that is a matter which ought to be examined from time to time to try to make sure that the provision is adequate.</PARA>
<PARA> The idea that the Government should apply the same income test to the unemployed as it applies to pensioners is one which I think is only superficially attractive. The difficulty with it is that if we applied that income test one would go on paying part unemployment benefit to a person in employment with an income of over $15,000 a year. As far as the pension income test is concerned, a married pensioner continues to receive a part pension up to a private income of $307 a week. There would, I think, be some concern in the community if people who were employed part time and earning anything between $12 ,000 and $15,000 a year were at the same time receiving some supplement in the way of unemployment benefit. I think different considerations apply. I do not, however, in making that point, deny that we should review that income limit from time to time. We have done that in a number of Budgets, as I say, most recently last August.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the sort of question which again does no credit to the questioner. It remains true in Australia in 1982 that an unemployment beneficiary with a number of children can be better off on unemployment benefit than in a lowly paid job. In other words, the allowances which are made for married unemployed are such that a man working on the minimum wage with a large family may indeed be worse off employed than if he were unemployed. The Government has addressed that problem with the proposal to introduce a family income supplement for employed families. But the manner in which the question is asked adds nothing to our understanding of the problem which is raised. As I said before, all these matters are examined on a regular basis. In the last Budget adjustments were made to the earnings provision for the unemployed, which acknowledged the difficult situation in which many unemployed people find themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>

The suggestion that there is a relationship between those cuts and a wages pause and that therefore we cannot have a wages pause does not seem to me to have any validity. The tax cuts apply already. If there are no increases over the next 12 months, of course, there will be a decrease in anticipated earnings or disposable income. The honourable senator mentioned the advertisements which are appearing relating to a number of measures in the present Budget. These advertisements were designed to alert those who will be affected by the proposals in the Budget with regard to housing assistance or social security assistance, or to remind them of the tax cuts which are available. In particular , they alert people to look at those measures contained in the Budget which they are interested to hear about. I do not think there is anything new in advising people about information that is given in a Budget or at times of policy change.

I, and other senators, have already referred in preceding Question Times to the unfortunate flaring up of divisiveness over the otherwise resolved issue of state aid to non-government schools which has flowed from recent Australian Labor Party statements on education. Is it possible to assert, as the Labor Party does, that government schools receive less favourable treatment than non- government schools?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Central to the argument mounted by the Labor Party has been the assertion that government schools are poor and non-government schools are rich, or that government schools are not favoured and non-government schools are favoured. This argument, upon which the Labor Party bases its policy, is demonstrably false. Therefore the policy has no validity. There are two ways in which we can measure how government schools have improved over the last seven years. One is to look at pupil-teacher ratios-class sizes-and the other is to look at the total number of dollars applied to the running of schools. On both of those counts government schools have improved markedly and are doing better than non-government schools.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have two tables which set out these points. I imagine that honourable senators will not want me to go through the figures one by one. In a moment I will seek leave, after they have been seen by the Opposition, to have them incorporated in Hansard. They show, with regard to pupil-teacher ratios, that class sizes have been reducing in government schools; that the secondary level government schools have the most favourable pupil-teacher ratios in Australia; that Catholic schools are the poorer schools; and that the government schools have the most favourable pupil-teacher ratios at secondary level. At primary level and at secondary level government and non-government schools have shown marked improvement over the last few years. That is a fact which can be demonstrated and, of course, that demolishes part of the argument.</PARA>
<PARA> An equally interesting set of figures emerges in the table which sets out the total number of dollars applied to the running of schools. First of all, government schools have more dollars applied at secondary level than do Catholic or other non-government schools. Government schools at secondary level are the richest in terms of the amount of money available to run the schools. Of course, at primary level the government schools, although not the best off, are among the leaders. If we look at the changes which have occurred since 1974 we see that the gain in real resources, expressed in constant dollars, has been the greatest for the government sector. The government sector is the one that has improved. I am delighted by that improvement. We are all delighted to see government schools in that favourable position. But no one should try to construct a policy on the basis that government schools have less money available for their running costs-they do not; they have as much as or more than non-government schools- or say that they are operating with the poorest pupil- teacher ratios. That is not true. In order to save the time of the Senate I seek leave to have the two tables incorporated in Hansard.

That is understandable because of the nature of the condition which gives rise to the entitlement. It may well be that people may be resident in Australia for a relatively short time and be entitled to that benefit. It is certainly the case that the benefit may be taken back to New Zealand. The matter is one which has been drawn to my attention and which I have under examination. The reason I have it under examination is that it is evident that Australia has rather more generous portability arrangements in respect of that benefit than apply to other countries including New Zealand, which I think restricts to three months the payment of a pension of that nature which is taken overseas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we were discussing this clause last week, I was making some comments with regard to a matter that had been raised by Senator Evans. For the record I would like to conclude those remarks. In working out for the purposes of the excess consideration test the tax component of the formulas contained in paragraph (1) (d) or (2) (d) it is necessary in cases where no notice of assessment had issued at the date of sale to have a test to ascertain on objective grounds what a company's contingent tax liability is. If the excess consideration test is not satisfied, the recoupment legislation simply does not apply. It is true, as I said in my second reading speech on this Bill, that an effect of sub-paragraph 5 (7) (c) (ii) will be to allow a vendor-shareholder to argue that, because a pre- sale tax avoidance scheme was entered into, there was, in a case where the company's tax liability had not been assessed, no objectively viewed contingent tax liability at the date of sale. If objectively viewed it was reasonable to conclude that the company had no contingent tax liability at the date of sale of its shares, it could not, to use the words of the announcement of the Treasurer (Mr Howard), have been evident that the price paid for the shares was excessive. That is the crux of this recoupment legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is only where a person received a price for his or her shares which is clearly excessive when actual and contingent tax liabilities are taken into account that it is proper to effect recoupment of the evaded company tax from that person.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a somewhat more general question. I trust I can introduce it at this stage since clause 5 covers the question of liability to pay. I raised the matter in the second reading debate but no answer was given in the Minister's reply in that debate. While we are on a clause that covers the question of liability to pay tax under this or other legislation, I will repeat the question and hope to get an answer now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It refers to the statement by Mr Sainsbury which can be found on page 2796 of the House of Representatives Hansard of 28 October. He said that the Government' s intention-perhaps I should interpolate that Mr Sainsbury is, if not the Chairman, an active member of the Government's back bench taxation committee and therefore one would expect that he would have been very well briefed on the subject by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and probably by officials-was that this Bill should render liable to pay tax people who would have been affected by the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act of 1980 and that vendor-shareholders who entered into schemes that would have been outlawed by that Act, had it been in existence between 1972 and 1980, would be obliged to pay the tax under this Bill. Mr Sainsbury added that the original legislation went beyond that scope and picked up people who would not have breached the 1980 amendment to the Act. It follows from Mr Sainsbury's assertion that people who had sold shares in companies with current year profits, which were subsequently put into a failed tax avoidance scheme by the agent or promoter, would, under the original legislation, have been liable to pay. Under the Bill, as it was reintroduced on 21 October, they are not liable to pay because of the insertion of sub-clause (12) of clause 3. </PARA>
<PARA> I have neither confirmation nor denial of the accuracy of Mr Sainsbury's assertion so I am proceeding on the assumption that he is correct. If he is, my question is: As this Bill covers sales only between 1972 and, I think, 5 December 1980, what legislation, if any, now prevents a person with a company with current year profits from selling that company to a dealer who then puts it into a tax avoidance scheme which ultimately fails?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The situation as covered by Senator Walsh must be related to Part IVA of the legislation which is now in existence and stops schemes of the nature outlined by him occurring. Senator Walsh, I think, is developing the argument to the effect that, if sub-clause 3 (12) reflects Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act principles, the kind of situation that it excludes from the recoupment tax would , if it occurred now, fall outside that Act. But I think that we have to look at the typical case. Where at the time of sale a company has not been assessed to tax, the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act applies if there was a reasonable expectation that tax would be payable. I must repeat that: If there was a reasonable expectation that there would be a future tax liability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Entering into a tax avoidance scheme could, in theory, operate to prevent that reasonable expectation arising. As I said earlier, in shorthand, I say 'in theory' because the practical reality is that Part IVA, along with the Government's earlier anti-tax avoidance legislation, is so wide-ranging that it would be hard in the extreme to imagine that there could now be a paper scheme of avoidance which could reasonably be expected to succeed in a purpose of tax avoidance. </PARA>

Mr Sainsbury said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Howard) in his 25 July statement made it quite clear that this legislation was meant to catch cases of the nature of the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. It was well known when the first draft of the Bill came out and we examined it that there were many other cases that would be caught, cases which would extend well outside the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act. That was never the intention of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Referring to sub-clause (12) of clause 3, Mr Sainsbury continued later:</PARA>
<PARA> This has brought the Bill into line with the original intention. </PARA>
<PARA>Firstly, I seek confirmation from the Minister that that statement of Mr Sainsbury is wrong. If that is forthcoming, that leaves the Government with no rationale whatsoever-at least, no publicly stated rationale-for the insertion of sub-clause (12) of clause 3. If there is such a rationale, will the Minister state it publicly now?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Chairman, I am alluding to that clause. The matters to which I am speaking occur under other clauses as well. It seems to me that there are some problems about the definitions. The McCabe-Lafranchi report is still recognised as the most thorough study to date of events relating to bottom-of- the-harbour companies. That investigation took three years to complete. It involved the investigators in many hundreds of interviews with parties connected with all parts of the transactions, from vendors through to the ultimate and final purchasers. The conclusions of the report are most specific. I refer particularly to pages 12 and 13 of volume 1. Here the report says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no evidence the vendor directors or shareholders or agents knew:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) that the companies were on-sold by the dealer;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) that the remaining funds in the companies were removed by the dealer;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) that the dealer made no attempt to treat the contingent taxation liability of the companies;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) that the dealer did not meet prior year tax provisions in respect of which funds had been handed over by the vendor. </PARA>
<PARA>The legislation does not treat vendor-shareholders and agents in the same manner . Under the legislation vendor-shareholders are required to pay tax on the benefit they received-that is, tax on the net income of the company sold. Further, they are given the option of not contesting the assessment, thereby obtaining the opportunity to pay by instalments over a minimum period of 12 months, free of interest or penalty, the sum owing. Agents are not. They are treated in the same way as purchasers-strippers, by definition-contrary to the conclusions outlined in the McCabe-Lafranchi report. Agents are to share a joint and several liability requirement to return 100 per cent of all income. That is not taxation but confiscation. There is no provision in the Bill to admit to the taxation liability and the right to pay by instalments in the same manner as the vendor. As the Government will probably point out, some of these matters overlap into other clauses. I hope that the Government is taking account of the problems that there are with the existing definition of the promoters class. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect to liabilities and which legislation is relevant to particular schemes, the previous answer of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) was not as specific as I would have liked. She stated that the insertion of clause 3 (12) in the second edition of the Bill had restored the Government's original intention. She said that the matters of detail to which Mr Sainsbury referred were not correct. The Minister was less specific than I would have liked. Mr Sainsbury said:</PARA></TALK.START>

Would this Bill with sub-clause (12) of clause 3 deleted from it-that is the form in which it originally appeared-have gone beyond the scope of the 1980 Act and caught schemes and people who would not have been affected by the 1980 Act had it been in existence throughout the 1970s?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I state again that the statement made by Mr Sainsbury is not accurate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it from what the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) has just said that the Government does not regard as fraudulent a case such as the one I now outline. An owner of a company with current year profits sells off all the physical assets of the operating company to a parallel company also owned by him. The original company then has nothing but cash and a contingent tax liability. The cash is sold for 95c in the dollar along with the contingent tax liability of 33c in the dollar. The liability to pay tax is then determined by the actions of the dealer- promoter following the purchase of the company-actions over which the original vendor-shareholder has no control and of which it is continually asserted he could have had no knowledge. Arbitrary and capricious law could scarcely go beyond that. The real point I want to make is that somebody who sets up such an artificial and blatantly contrived arrangement as to turn into cash all the assets of a company in order to sell the cash to a promoter for 95c in the dollar, along with a contingent tax liability of 33c in the dollar, is in the judgment of this Government not engaging in a fraudulent scheme.

I am glad that Senator Withers agrees-I presume quite a few other Liberal senators agree-that once clause 3 (12) was inserted into the Bill the rationale for its existence evaporated. It went up in smoke. I ask one more question. Can the Minister for Finance refer me to the section in the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) of 25 July which says or even implies that it was not the Government's intention to recover contingent tax liabilities from vendor -shareholders where the dealer-promoter, at a time when the vendor-shareholder had no control of the company, attempted a tax avoidance scheme of which, so we are told, the vendor-shareholder had absolutely no knowledge? Are we falling back on this fraudulent excuse offered by the Government that the intention was only to catch those people involved in fraud even though the people who the Minister now tells us were involved in the fraud were not the vendor- shareholders at all but some other persons who were involved after the vendor- shareholders had disposed of the company? We are back in the situation where the liability to pay is determined by somebody else's fraudulent action, not by one' s own action. A few heads on the other side of the chamber are nodding. I do not know whether the Government agrees with me but a number of its senators obviously do. That is the absurd position into which the Government has now got itself.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think it is also an argument that is weighing in the hearts of honourable senators on the other side of the chamber. As I understand the situation, this sub-clause really draws a distinction between those who sold companies that were immediately stripped of their assets and dropped into the harbour-if I may use that inadequate expression-and those companies that were sold to promoters who sought, as an objective judgment, to use the words of the legislation, to offset or extinguish the profits in an avoidance scheme.

<PARA> (b) the person establishes that-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) before the sale of the shares in the company that brought into existence the vendors taxable amount, he did not know, and had no reason to suspect, that an arrangement or transaction that secured or achieved, in relation to the company, the result referred to in paragraph 5 (1) (h) or 5 (2) (h) had been entered into or was intended to be entered into;</PARA>

<PARA> the vendors taxable amount shall not be taken to exist or to have existed in relation to the person.'. </PARA>
<PARA>This proposed new clause has been publicised as a so-called innocence clause. But it goes further than the innocence clause proposed by Liberal Party senators . I believe they will be moving for the adoption of their own innocence clause if this one is defeated and I would support that clause also. I will not make a lengthy speech about this proposed new clause because the matter has been canvassed very widely by the Press, on television and on radio. My amendment simply has two components. It deals with those people who were involved in actions which are caught by the provisions of this legislation. They committed those actions genuinely believing that they were acting within the law on advice from professional experts-accountants or lawyers-or not believing that they were undertaking any actions that might be construed as immoral or improper. Those people should be excused from the provisions of this legislation provided they can now prove that they would suffer hardship under the tax liability that can be imposed by the Taxation Commissioner under this Bill. In other words the aggrieved person has to prove two components and the onus is on him or her. Firstly, the person has to prove that he or she was innocent and, secondly, that if the provisions of this new Bill fall upon him or her hardship will be caused.</PARA>
<PARA> I do have sympathy, on a matter of basic principle, with those who are to be protected by the innocence clause which is to be moved by some Liberal senators. I do have sympathy with that and will support it. I do not have a great deal of heart burning for-I will not mention names-the person who acted in innocence, who is a millionaire and who made another million out of these procedures. In principle I will support that, but I have a great deal more sympathy for the person who acted in innocence, who was advised properly and who was meticulous in asking his advisers: 'Is this within the law?', and was assured at all times that it was. To permit the Commissioner of Taxation to go back five years, eight years or whatever and impose several thousand or several hundred thousand dollars back tax is unjust. </PARA>
<PARA> I have given examples in speeches before in this Senate. To give a very over- simplified example I refer to a man and wife who had a small business.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment before the Committee moved by Senator Chipp seeks to relieve vendors from liability to recoupment tax if they establish a state of innocence about post-sale action that has made the company unable to pay its taxes, had no reason to believe the price of the shares was excessive and accordingly had so managed the assets that payment of recoupment tax would result in severe hardship to them. In other words there would have to be innocence, however people view that, combined with resultant severe hardship. The Government is not in a position to accept this amendment that has been moved by Senator Chipp because we do not think that innocence on the part of the vendors, however that is measured, warrants exclusion from the legislation. The legislation is here to recoup evaded company tax from those who have benefited from its non payment. That being so, their knowledge or lack of knowledge about post-sale treatment of the company is not a relevant consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed amendment does, I know, add another element to innocence, and that is some measurement of severe hardship. The Government does not believe that the considerations mentioned by Senator Chipp warrant adoption of the provision that has been moved by him. Insofar as the person has difficulty in meeting in a timely way the recoupment tax liability established by the legisation, the powers that the Commissioner of Taxation will have under the Bill to defer payment and even not to charge a late payment penalty, seem to the Government to be an adequate response to any difficulties that may arise. If hardship is so severe that payment would amount to a ruinous imposition the relief provisions in the income tax law and those that are to be adopted for the purposes of this Bill will allow relief from payment to be granted by the relief board. For these reasons the Government does not accept this amendment and I urge the Committee to reject it. </PARA>

Whilst I applaud and admire the integrity that Senator Chipp has shown in terms of making a value judgment about these things, I am not satisfied that hardship ought to be the only qualification for innocence. One is either innocent or not innocent. If being innocent and being wealthy is a disqualification, I find myself at some variance. If being innocent and poor is a qualification, I think that is limiting the scope too much. But I support the fundamental thrust and proposition that is put forward by Senator Chipp. He very clearly, like so many of us, identified, recognised and had communication with people in precisely the predicament mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>

What essentially happened was that many people sold companies, believing they were legitimately acting within the law, after obtaining the best legal and accounting advice in the land, and having fulfilled their legal obligations felt that they had discharged their commitment under the Income Tax Assessment Act. They are now being visited by the sin of this legislation, some 10 years later. Some still do not know whether they are going to be visited by this sin, but some do. As a result of prudent common sense and reasonable and pragmatic decisions concerning their financial affairs they now find themselves in a situation of absolute hardship. I find it terribly depressing. I am not concerned about the companies but it is bad for the community for a government to seek to impinge and impose on people in this way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those honourable senators who voted to leave clause 3 (12) in the Bill are obliged to support Senator Chipp's amendment because clause 3 (12) lets some rather arbitrarily selected-that is a charitable view-vendor-shareholders off the hook. This amendment seeks to let some more off the hook. The amendment Senator Crichton-Browne will move later on effectively would let them all off. For those who are interested in following a consistent line having voted to leave clause 3 (12) in, it is logically inescapable that they would vote for Senator Chipp's amendment. I might add that the Opposition, which tried to remove clause 3 (12) will, therefore, for the same reason, although from the obverse side, not be supporting Senator Chipp's amendment. The people who are in an utterly indefensible position are those-the majority of Government senators-who voted to insert clause 3 (12) and who will now vote against this amendment.

<PARA> How innocent were these people? I will say again what most of them did. They had an operating company-say it was a factory-and they sold off the premises; they sold the land; they sold all the equipment: They sold it as a going concern to a company which they also owned. So, the target company which was to be sold had nothing but cash and they sold the cash for 95c in the dollar. We are asked to believe that these people did not realise they were getting involved in something shonky.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to that in a minute, Senator Chipp. Senator Chipp has added to that the 'hardship' clause. He apparently has sympathy for people who, as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said, ran off with stolen money many years ago and now have to pay it back and might have difficulty in doing so. I suggest that Senator Chipp should save his sympathy for the people who conducted honest businesses or attempted to conduct honest businesses all the way along, who paid the tax which they should have paid and went bankrupt because they could not compete with people who were not paying tax. That is where the sympathy should be directed-to those people who conducted honest businesses and paid the tax that they should have paid and who could not compete with sleazy operators who used people such as Brian Maher to get them out of their tax liabilities. The sympathy should go to people who went broke because they could not compete with crooks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final point is that Senator Chipp's clause would I think guarantee that, if not all, certainly very nearly all of the individual cases went to court as the vendor-shareholders attempted to establish both their so-called innocence and their hardship. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have acknowledged that Senator Chipp's position on this, whether or not one agrees with it, is logically consistent. The rationale for this Bill, however, is that only people who broke laws which already existed will be caught. The Bill is only introduced, so the Government says, in order to avoid virtually every case being contested in court and to avoid the delays in collecting the money that that entails. So the honourable senator is consistent. But that is not his rationale; it is the Government's rationale, having accepted , of course, that it destroyed its own rationale when it wrote sub-clause (12) of clause 3 into the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said at the end of my speech in the second reading debate, the Australian Labor Party still supports the legislation because it is better than nothing, but only just better than nothing. It was weak legislation in the beginning and it has been substantially watered down by the Government since it was first introduced. But we will not support this innocence clause because the people concerned were not innocent. They knew that they were getting a financial benefit somehow or other because tax would not be paid. The sympathy should be reserved for the people who are in competition with the tax dodgers and the tax cheats, and who went broke because they paid their tax and they could not compete with those who did not. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, this clause, of course, would ensure that almost all cases, if not every case, finish up in court and no money at all would be recovered for probably a number of years. Our criticism of this legislation in its original form was that it did not go far enough. It was weak, limp legislation, as Senator Button said, and this is another attempt to water it down further. Therefore, we will not support the amendment. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DV4">Senator WITHERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what Senator Walsh is saying. He is saying that all vendor-shareholders are crooks, therefore they shall pay. I think it was Senator Chipp who said that these people believed they were acting within the law. They not only believed that they were acting within the law, they were in fact acting within the law, otherwise this legislation would not be necessary. This is the dilemma which the Government has been in from day one. If we do something which is philosophically wrong, we get into a legislative mess and a bigger administrative mess. Because the Government started in a way which was philosophically wrong, we are now in our present mess.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been said that there is no such thing as innocent people. Some 10,000 tax assessments will be issued. Even if only one out of 10,000 assessments is wrong, that one person ought to have some recourse. Are we just going to convict a whole class of people, irrespective of what the individual cases may be? If there are no innocent people, the Government has no worries about this clause because nobody will prove it and the Government will collect all of the money. Senator Walsh said that the Government may have to wait years for its money. I thought that under either the current or the proposed provisions, leaving aside some of the oddities contained in the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Bill 1982, under a normal assessment a person would pay 100 per cent now, and then quarrel about it. If the person does not pay the full amount, an interest rate of 20 per cent must be paid. So why will there be a delay in collecting the revenue? As I understand it, once the assessment is issued to the vendor- shareholders, unless they come under the 12 months clause, the amount is payable forthwith, even if they appeal to a board of review or to a court. That could still apply to the innocence clause, so the Government will still collect its money. The Government has no answer to the question: If there are no innocents, what is wrong with an innocence clause? Why is the Government worried about having such a clause put in? Is it because it is afraid that too many people will be able to show that they are innocent?</PARA>
<PARA> We are told that there are people who never knew. What about the ultimate vendor-shareholder in the public company where the public company owned subsidiaries that were sold off and bottomed? Did the 10,000 shareholders in that public company know what their directors were doing? I admit they may have got a benefit; they most likely did get an indirect benefit. However, there were shareholders in large public companies who would not have known that this was happening. I know of individual cases--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DV4">Senator WITHERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator is worried about Treamog Ltd. What about all the shareholders in Metro Industries Pty Ltd? Does the honourable senator think that every individual shareholder in Metro Industries knew what was happening? Does he think that the 30,000 shareholders in TVW Enterprises knew about the five companies? In fact, the board of directors did not know until the whole thing blew up because the companies had been disposed of by their accountants and lawyers. Neither Senator Walsh nor the Government is prepared to admit to what happens as part of practical commercial life. I would like Senator Walsh to tell me about those individual shareholders in Metro Industries, assuming that the directors did what they have been alleged to have done. Those individual shareholders did not have a clue what was happening. There was no way they could discover what was happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, the Government, admittedly for administrative reasons, has said that where the tax liability is less than $100 an assessment will not issue. But that is not being done as a matter of generosity, decency, morality or any of the other sorts of things. It is being done just because it is cheaper not to issue assessments, and for no other reason. So we have the ridiculous situation where I pay nothing if I have a liability of $99 but if I have a liability of $101 I pay $101. Where is the fairness between two taxpayers in that system?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DV4">Senator WITHERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Innocence or guilt depends on $2 either way. It is a remarkable situation that on the one hand we have a piece of legislation which has been trumpeted as being moral, fair and decent, to catch people worse than 1,000 Norm Gallaghers, to recoup stolen money and all the rest of the political hyperbole and rhetoric that has gone on, and on the other hand we have all the injustices at the margin. Unfortunately the Bill will pass unamended, but not without some struggle. However, I predict that all the hard cases will keep coming in. Remember Mrs Moo who was recently such an embarrassment to the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the Australian Taxation Office? A Mrs Moo is eventually going to turn up in this case. Everybody is going to say: 'But it was not my fault because I didn't know the gun was loaded'. That is going to be the excuse. I can see, eventually, some one-eyed, one-armed, one-legged World War digger, dying of terminal cancer in a wheel-chair, being evicted because he cannot pay $101 tax. This is sure to happen out of 10,000 assessments. I can see it sticking out a mile. The Treasurer will rush off to give him an apology and his $101 back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All we are saying is that occasionally we should just give the average taxpayer a go. The onus of proof is on the taxpayer. That proof is not easy to establish; it is very difficult to establish. He should get off. I would suggest that most of these cases will not get cluttered up in the courts. Some people will try lodging an objection. When that fails they will pay up if they have the money. If not, they will go before a taxation board of review. In any event, I do not see that the Government is going to wait for its money. </PARA>
<PARA> But irrespective of that, I come back to what I was talking about in my speech during the second reading debate. Are we on this side of the Committee such a party of materialists that we care only about money and not about guilt or innocence? The Liberal Party has driven itself into an interesting situation. It is almost as if we have adopted the Marxian doctrine of taxation. It does not matter who gets run over by the juggernaut of the sanctity of the Crown's revenue. That is too bad; individuals no longer count. It is all dressed up as the Crown's money, the state's money, the people's money, the community's money and the Devil can take the hindmost as far as the individual is concerned. I must confess that I am very disappointed with the Government's pig-headed attitude to this matter. It is logically incorrect, morally indefensible and, I believe, politically crazy to resist this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise briefly following one or two remarks made by Senator Walsh about the philosophy of this matter. I have admired tremendously the logic with which Senator Walsh has pursued his arguments in all the speeches he has made in this debate. As usual, I tune out when his remarks become personal. If only he knew how good he is when he makes a speech he would not degrade his speeches by becoming personal . If I might say so to him without being impertinent, his good speeches are excellent and he does not need to descend to dealing with personalities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also want to remark on the chilling honesty of his speeches and those made on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. I think it is time to say to all of those Liberal and National Party senators who are not in the chamber that they should listen to the chilling honesty of the speeches in this debate of Labor senators. They are 100 per cent honest in their belief about retrospectivity. There is a chilling frankness, a cold-blooded frankness, in what Senator Walsh is saying about this legislation. He has said, I think, that the legislation is weak, limp -wristed. No doubt Senator Walsh will become Minister for Finance or will occupy another senior position when a Labor government gets into office, which may be very soon. What Senator Walsh has been saying in all honesty is: 'Wait until we get into power in one year's time or five years' time. We will make this retrospective legislation look like a Sunday school picnic'. I hope Senator Martyr will forgive the allusion to a strange rite in the Protestant church. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party's policy has been laid out. The Labor Party was honest in the last election campaign when it said very frankly that it would introduce retrospective legislation to deal with tax cheats and tax dodgers. That comment was rebutted by the Liberal Party three or four days before the last election. I have newspaper cuttings in front of me which illustrate that. In a last minute plea, I ask Liberal senators to wake up to themselves. They should know what this legislation is doing. It is making illegal something which was legal when a person did it. It is being made illegal because it was immoral or because the intention was to avoid or minimise tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us assume that Senator Walsh is Minister for Finance or the Treasurer. Let us take the case of a person who is running a small business which is making a reasonable profit, which is expanding and doing very well. Let us assume that this businessman is a reputable person who has a reputable accountant who goes to him and says: 'You are now doing so well, I advise you to transfer your proprietorship business into a private company because in that way, by using the law as it exists, you will be able to minimise your tax or save tax.'. This man may then say to his accountant: 'I do not want to do anything illegal'. The accountant could say: 'This is the section of the Act; it is perfectly legal'. The businessman may repeat: 'I do not want to do anything improper'. The accountant may reply: 'There is nothing improper about it'. The businessman may then say: 'I do not want to do anything immoral'. The accountant could say: ' There it is in black and white. You are perfectly at liberty to form your single trader business into a company or a partnership if you like'. Let us say that he did it last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Next year Senator Walsh could be Treasurer and he might say: 'This was a transaction, an act, entered into for the main purpose of saving or minimising tax. Therefore, I will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to date back X number of years and catch the person who performed that act'. That sort of action is possible. What Senators Walsh and Evans are saying to the Liberal Party in crystal clear terms is that that is what the Labor Party will do because people are doing this for the purpose of minimising tax. The warning is there. If the Liberal Party sets the example by passing this kind of legislation, it will have opened a Pandora's box which it will never be able to close. Will people who 10 years ago took out insurance policies that they could not afford because the insurance salesman said that the Commissioner of Taxation would pay half be caught? Are we going to backdate legislation to catch them? I am not suggesting that the Labor Party has that intention. What has been done in terms of the principle in this legislation gives the Labor Party the green light so to do. I am very sorry that the only people now in this chamber on the Government side are those who, as I understand it, are committed to the civil liberties view which I am putting, a view which is in this place. I am disappointed that others who I know care about the protection of civil liberties as opposed to the extravagances of politicians and who are supporting this legislation are not in the chamber to participate in what has so far been a first class debate. </PARA>

<PARA> That in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency: The recovery of tax evaded by vendors who sold company shares at prices which made no allowance for the company's contingent tax liability, and the need for the Senate to unequivocally support this action. </PARA>
<PARA>I spoke on that matter, as did Senator Chipp. I well recall basing part of what I said in that debate on my belief that the innocent would be protected. During Senator Chipp's speech, by way of interjection, I quoted from a speech given by Mr Michael Baume, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Howard), which I believe set out the Government's attitude and plans in relation to this matter. I referred to a part of Mr Baume's speech which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This does not mean that all people who sold companies at higher than their assets backing are at risk; it is only in those cases where the companies' acknowledged tax liabilities were evaded by fraud, by milking them of their assets by such devices as making large loans to 'men of straw' which cannot be recovered. </PARA>
<PARA>I believed that the general thrust of the Government's intention was, to put it in the terms which have now become current, that those who could prove their innocence would be protected.

What the Government is saying-it is wrong-is that these actions were illegal at the time they took place and that this legislation is being introduced just to expedite the recovery of tax which should never have been evaded in the first place. The Government uses that word 'evaded' which, as I am sure Senator Chipp well knows, has connotations of illegality. Senator Chipp was correct when he said that the Labor Party regards this legislation as limp wristed; it is. But he was wrong when he said that a Labor government in a similar position would have done X, Y and Z. A Labor government would not have been in such a position.

I suppose that unfortunate minority has valid reasons to complain: 'Why should we be caught when everyone else got off?'. But it will not be subjected to any criminal penalty. So the analogy with Hitler is quite absurd . All that they will have to do is pay, in inflation-eroded dollars, money that they should have paid in tax anything up to 10 years ago. In the meantime they have had interest-free use of that money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As regards the innocence or otherwise of the vendor-shareholders, I believe what I said 15 or 20 minutes ago: Everyone who set up these schemes should be regarded as a crook. I am willing to go on record as saying that anyone who was a party to setting up such a scheme, whether they were vendor-shareholders or promoters, a scheme under which all the assets of a company were turned into cash, and the cash was sold for 95 cents in the dollar along with a contingent tax liability of anything up to 46 cents in the dollar, ought to be regarded as a crook. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought that there was no one to issue assessments to, in some cases at least, because the people did not exist. Before I was rudely interrupted, I was talking about the shareholders of companies. Those who set up the schemes should be regarded as crooks, no matter which side of the transaction they were on. Certainly there would have been shareholders, especially in public companies, who did not know the transactions were being set up, as Senator Withers said. But in most cases those people got the money. All that they are being asked to do is to pay back the money that they should not have had in the first place. If it was being said that these people should be put in gaol I would agree that certainly we should not do that. But all that a minority of them are being required to do is to pay back, as tax, money that they should have paid in tax many years ago, and to pay it off in inflated dollars at that. So I think that they have got out of it quite lightly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Certainly there were other shareholders who did not even get the money. There are 20 or 30 of them in Treamog. We know that Denis Horgan, showing proper directorial responsibility as a director of a public company, just let those shareholders be fleeced by Maher. As the McCabe-Lafranchi report said, they got nothing for their investment but scrip in a worthless company devoid of assets and with sham directors. That standard of directorial conduct is obviously approved of by the Government because the managing director of that company remains to this day a director of the Australian Industry Development Corporation. So the negligence of this Government did not end with the introduction of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> That matter leads me to the point raised by Senator Withers that the courts ought to decide innocence or otherwise. I agree. A criminal offence or perhaps something short of a criminal offence ought to be decided by the courts and not by the Parliament. I might add that 27 years ago two people were sent to gaol by this Parliament. I do not think that is anything of which the Parliament should be proud. In this case criminal sanctions are not being imposed. The most that anyone has to do is pay back the money that he should not have had in the first place. With respect to Mr Horgan, I note that the Government apparently does not share Senator Withers's view as to whether the courts should decide guilt or innocence. The Government has asked Mr von Doussa to determine whether the transactions organised by Horgan were illegal or dishonest. Mr von Doussa is being asked to determine that and not the courts. I believe, firstly, that Mr von Doussa would be reluctant to say 'Yes, they were illegal and dishonest', because he probably has similar views to Senator Withers about the courts making those sorts of decisions and not individuals outside the courts and, secondly, judging from what the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, told us last week, if Mr von Doussa were to make such a statement he could well be sued for libel because he does not have the protection of being an authorised investigator or royal commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the litigation that will certainly be greatly expanded if an amendment such as this is carried and because the most that anyone will have to do is pay back the money which he should not have had in the first place, we will not support this amendment or any related amendment. In my view the only legitimate ground to feel aggrieved which any vendor-shareholder who will be required to return money will have is being picked out to repay the money when on capricious and arbitrary, if not corrupt, grounds-in some cases I believe the grounds were corrupt-many other vendor-shareholders who did exactly the same thing will not have to pay. </PARA>

By way of interjection I made a comment which I would like to back up briefly without opening up a debate about something which is not relevant to the current proposed amendment. If anybody reads the transcript of 13 September, I think, of the public hearing of Estimates Committee A during which Senator Durack and his officers were questioned at length about these matters he will see that the validity of my interjection and the error of Senator Walsh's statement become very apparent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I noted two points which Senator Walsh made in relation to the amendment moved by Senator Chipp. He said that all the people who were engaged in such activities were crooks and that all they were being asked to do was pay back money that they should not have had in the first place. It probably depends very much on what type of judgment is given as to who are crooks and who are not crooks. The point of the amendment is to allow that judgment to reside in the place in which it normally does in society-that is, in the courts. If honourable senators want to pursue the discussion about who are crooks and who are not I have here a letter which was written to the Australian and which suggests that people in this chamber are crooks. Fair enough; that is this person's judgment. If everybody is allowed to go around in this society making judgments about who are crooks and who are not I presume he is. I wish to read part of this letter because I think it makes a contribution to the notion of innocence. The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . has revealed that federal politicans have been feathering their nests with tax-free travel allowances. The allowance is paid whenever an MP spends time away from a nominated residence in the course of his duties. </PARA>
<PARA>The writer of this letter then picks on the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), probably because of his noteworthy performance on television in relation to other crooks in the society. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> In this way, during 1975 Mr Fraser, by nominating Nareen as his residence, was able to receive travel allowance while spending most of his time living with his family in a house he owned in South Yarra. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether that is true; it could well be an error as there is a whole host of errors in the letter. The writer points out that other people have views about these things. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Although the letter of the law was followed--</PARA>
<PARA>That sounds familiar-</PARA>
<PARA>ethics and morals appear sadly lacking--</PARA>
<PARA>That is somebody else making a judgment about us-</PARA>
<PARA>to use terms in which Mr Fraser recently described the bottom-of-the-harbour scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, so that our leaders may one day understand: politicians must lead the country by example if they wish to remain credible . . . </PARA>
<PARA> So as not to describe a problem without offering a solution, why not amend the entitlement to travel allowance to whenever an MP spends time away from a residence partly or wholly owned by that member. </PARA>
<PARA> To add a touch of 1982 politics to the travel allowance business, why not make this amendment retrospective to, say, 1972 with pay-back clauses and penalties. </PARA>
<PARA>The interesting thing about that point, if one dwells on it, is that probably there would be no innocents. By definition, if such legislation were passed I suppose every one of us here would be guilty. If this person had been in this place as part of a majority, presumably he could have enforced that type of notion as to who was guilty and who was innocent. </PARA>
<PARA> The point of Senator Chipp's amendment is that it is not the place of the legislature actually to say that something in the past was illegal or legal. If the Senate passes this Bill-which I opposed at the second reading, and which I will continue to oppose-it is reasonable to suggest that a person be allowed to go into court and argue, if he can, that he is innocent. I take Senator Withers' s point, which I think has compelling logic about it, that if the Government believes there are no innocent people around and if the Opposition, which is voting for this legislation, believes there are no innocent people around, they have absolutely nothing to worry about. Why not allow people a day in court and so make sure that we do not perpetrate on even one individual an injustice? If there are no innocent people around we have nothing to worry about at all. If there are, I suggest that those people voting against this amendment have, themselves, a lot to worry about because by their actions they have perpetrated on other individuals in the community an injustice. </PARA>
<PARA> I go back to the letter that I have just read. We would quite justly feel aggrieved if in this society there were a citizens initiative appeal mechanism such as that which exists in Switzerland, whereby this type of legislation could be passed by citizens against the legislature. Indeed, the Australian Democrats have introduced a Bill which incorporates such a measure. That could well be an interesting mechanism. If it were available, this chamber might keep a much lower profile than it currently keeps in relation to imposing on individuals in the society its concept of what it happens to believe was illegal at some time in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, what an incredible afternoon we have had. We have heard from that Robespierre of the Australian Parliament, Senator Walsh. I note that he has left the chamber, probably to sharpen his knitting needles or perhaps to sharpen the guillotine. That is the role he takes unto himself in this Parliament. He names people. He calls them crooks and other things. He defines evasion, as well as other terms associated with income tax law. We are all expected to genuflect to this wonderful knowledge. It has been said before by Senator Chipp, and correctly I think, that Senator Walsh's logic in some of these matters is absolutely impeccable; in fact, as sharp as a guillotine. I wish his logic were as sharp in the latter part of his remarks. He keeps assuming that all of these people are guilty, that they are all crooks and tax evaders. He keeps telling the Government that it has not done anything at all for years about this problem. He cannot have it both ways. He has to accept that what people did in good faith was legal no matter its morality; we are not discussing that here. The whole logic of that is in the Government's position. As Senator Withers and Senator Macklin have pointed out time and time again the Government has had to introduce legislation making illegal what people thought was completely legal.</PARA></TALK.START>

He keeps on coming into this chamber and saying the same things over and over again. The record should not be left uncontradicted. The methods that he uses, as Senator Chipp has pointed out, are absolutely appalling.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to something else that Senator Walsh said. He mentioned Mr Denis Horgan about whom he seems to have an obsession. We have heard Senator Walsh say lots of things about Mr Horgan but never once has he suggested for what reason he ought to be prosecuted . There have been a lot of wild allegations about what Mr Horgan is alleged to have done. I would have thought that Senator Walsh would be decent enough to believe that the taxation matters of Mr Horgan are a matter between Mr Horgan and the Commissioner of Taxation. As is the case with me and everybody else in this chamber. I think in simple justice he ought to admit that first. Secondly, if he has any belief that Mr Horgan has broken the law I put it to him that he ought to go off and see the Special Prosecutor, the Australian Federal Police or the Commissioner of Taxation. He ought to go somewhere and lay his charge. It is unfair for him to lay these charges in this place day after day under privilege. He may have thought in the past that there was no use in his so doing. We now have a Special Prosecutor-Mr Gyles, is it not? I invite Senator Walsh to seek the permission of the Attorney-General, if it is required, to have an interview with Mr Gyles-if that is the gentleman's name-to put his charges and to ask that Mr Horgan be prosecuted. If he is not prepared to do that then he should please shut up.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will mention one of the things that Mr Horgan did. He was the Managing Director of a company called Treamog Ltd. Everything that that company owned was turned into cash-I believe it was a total of $6.7m. It is all set out in the McCabe-Lafranchi report. He sold that company on 10 December 1976 to agents of Brian Maher with a contingent tax liability of $1.7m. As I mentioned earlier, 20 or 30 minority shareholders were paid nothing but Mr Hogan and the other large shareholders who were in the know got 95c in the dollar for the money that they sold. That money had a current year tax liability equal to 33c in the dollar. The Government is saying that this sort of transaction is illegal. Here I refer to Senator Martyr's comments. His Government is asserting that the transactions were illegal-the same point that I made to Sentor Chipp. Senator Martyr can reject what his Government says if he likes. The Government says these transactions were illegal at the time they were undertaken. The rationale for this legislation was to expedite the collection of the money not, according to the Government, to make illegal now what was legal anything up to 10 years ago. If the honourable senator does not agree with that he can take it up with the Government and not with me because it was the Government which made the assertion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to the case of Treamog Ltd, the company which Mr Horgan controlled and which he sold with a contingent tax liability, according to the McCabe-Lafranchi documents, equal to 33c in the dollar of the money that was sold, because this Government inserted clause 3 (12) into the Bill when the second version came in on 21 October. Because Treamog Ltd was put into a tax avoidance scheme prior to its balance date of 31 December 1976 Mr Horgan will be exempted from the liability to pay that $1.7m or any other tax liability which the company has. The Government says those actions were illegal. The Government then wrote in a clause which exempted that transaction from the scope of this legislation. It then set up a special investigator, Mr von Doussa, and loaded the terms of reference in such a way that Mr von Doussa would be, to say the least, unlikely to find Mr Horgan guilty in accordance with the terms of reference set out. It appears that it then failed to give him-this does not appear if Senator Chaney's statement can be taken as correct-adequate investigatory power and also failed to give him protection against subsequent action for defamation should he report adversely. </PARA>
<PARA> In raising this matter Senator Withers appears to be saying that any person- whether he intends to say it or not, this is what he is saying-is fit to hold a Government position as long as he has not been convicted of a gaolable offence. I would have thought that the standards of the Government ought to be somewhat higher than that. Any director who controlled a company like Treamog, and with the facts that I have briefly detailed relevant to Treamog, and who allowed some 20-odd minority shareholders to be fleeced by the operators to whom he sold the money, which is all the company had at the time it was sold, ought not be regarded as fit to hold any discretionary government office let alone to continue as a director of the Australian Industry Development Corporation. Of course, it is quite clear that for some time the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), whether he really shared those views or not, did intend to terminate Mr Horgan's appointment to a total of seven discretionary government positions, but the Cabinet jacked up on him and did not allow him to proceed. </PARA>

Mr Horgan would not dare sue him, would he? Or would he not? Until Senator Walsh is prepared to go outside and chance his arm, I think he ought to shut up. If the honourable senator believes Mr Horgan has been indulging in fleecing or some criminal activity not associated directly with his tax liability, the honourable senator, as a citizen, has a duty to seek out the Commissioner of Taxation, the Commissioner of Police, the Corporate Affairs Commission or the Special Prosecutor.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Withers summed up my thoughts when he spoke. The sorts of comments that have been made by Senator Walsh in the last five minutes are regrettable. They are a reflection of and epitomise the Australian Labor Party's approach to this legislation from the outset. I do not think there is a better example of this than Senator Walsh's last reference to a grimy, grotty little newsletter which listed the members of the finance committee of the Liberal Party going back to 1979. He implored any pathetic reader who bothered to set his eyes upon this thing, other than for idle curiosity or to laugh at the obscene jokes in it, to provide information to him of those individuals, of their companies and of their activities. If that is the way in which he is seeking to bring down this Government, to destroy people individually and to conduct himself in public office, in public life, he ought to make the newsletter more widely available so that we can all have the pleasure of understanding just what sort of mind he has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He has an obsession with Mr Horgan. I have from time to time questioned his motive. I have come to the conclusion that Mr Horgan's greatest sin is to have been a Liberal and to have been a former member and chairman of the finance committee of the Liberal Party of Western Australia. As Senator Withers said, if Senator Walsh has some unique, special or divine knowledge or wisdom, why does he not tell the Special Prosecutor? Why does he not go to the Commonwealth Police? Why does he not stand on the steps of Parliament House and make it public? He is not prepared to accept that certain schemes and arrangements were in existence whereby companies sought to minimise or mitigate-extinguish in some cases-their tax liabilities through normal commercial arrangements and transactions. There has been a whole range of them. Over time the Government, with the change in morality as, I understand, the yardstick and the leading measure as to why, has sought, through a whole range of measures, to make it inapplicable to offset profits against losses in certain ways. But the fact of the matter is that there are perfectly legitimate schemes for offsetting taxation. No suggestion has been put by Senator Walsh or anybody else in the chamber that Mr Horgan had the slightest knowledge that any of his companies would end up in the hands of affiliates of the ALP or of crooks, thugs, pimps, prostitutes or anybody else and sent to the bottom of the harbour. It is hardly the sort of thing one would imagine was likely to happen to a company that one sold in a perfectly legitimate way. It ought to be remembered that Mr Horgan was a director of that company and a shareholder, not the exclusive beneficiary of it, and he did have a responsibility to ensure that the transactions were perfectly legitimate and proper. In the event that Senator Walsh has some special knowledge, I suggest that he let us all know about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some concern about clause 7 which refers to promoters. I expressed concern to the Government about the collection of the outstanding revenue that the Government alleges is due from promoters. I must say that I speak in the way of amelioration rather than on the matter of principle. I have said during the second reading debate and during argument beforehand that I believed all of these people are innocent. That being so, I adduced an argument about the necessity of the Government's legislation. So I believe that my remarks provide amelioration to which I hope the Government will listen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, the Australian Taxation Office and, indeed, some agents falling within the category of promoters, want to see outstanding revenue paid and collected expeditiously with the least amount of difficulty. The effect of the promoters' clause of the legislation does not achieve this aim. It gives no incentive whatsoever to those members of the eligible promoters' class who were not strippers to admit to any assessment or to make any payment without a fight. In fact, the opposite effect is achieved. Each person is jointly and severally liable for the gross fees in relation to each company purchased. This will be far greater than the actual fee that the agency received. The aim of the Bill is to recoup 100 per cent of such fees received. In order to join others who benefited-those who shared fully or in part in the fee split-only two options are permitted. The first is to pay a proportion of the amount assessed and then commence court proceedings enjoining others, or, secondly, to pay no amount and wait for the Commissioner to commence recovery proceedings and then join others in that action. In both cases the party concerned is still responsible for the whole of the amount claimed, including interest and penalties. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the legislation is drafted is such a way that there is no certainty that the court will exercise its discretion to allow the joining of other parties. The court is asked to consider both the benefits received and the nature and extent of participation in the arrangements without defining what the latter clause means. I think examples can be produced. I will not bore the Senate with the details of a case I have which shows clearly just the sort of thing that can happen. I am submitting that the agent has no alternative but to attempt to enjoin all of the other parties in his actions. They genuinely obtained a benefit from the money the agent received and paid tax on it. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that as the law presently stands there is no choice for an agent or anyone else in the promoters' class to do anything other than fight the Commissioner to the limit of their financial resources. Conceivably it might take several years for the courts to decide a minimum of, say, 500 cases. The Taxation Office itself refers to something like 4,600 cases. Those affected may as well enjoy while they can their assets on a diminishing basis relative to legal fees. Ultimately, whatever has been accumulated over a lifetime's work will be lost in legal fees and those defined as promoters will be bankrupted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Taxation Office will not receive any revenue and will waste many man-hours in contesting all of these cases. An additional side effect, of course, is that the whole process will result in the clogging up for years to come of an already overworked court system. There are many solutions to this problem. I simply have had the problem pointed out to me. I leave it in the hands of the Government and presumably the Taxation Office to come up with some solution. It may even be that a restructuring will achieve the Government's aim of fairness. </PARA>

<PARA> Page 40, after clause 8, insert the following new clause:</PARA>
<PARA> '8A. A primary taxable amount shall not be taken to exist in relation to a person in relation to the sale of shares or of an interest in shares in relation to an amount of ordinary company tax or undistributed profits tax payable by a company in relation to a year of income unless, immediately before the time of sale of the shares or interest in shares, the person knew or believed, or could reasonably be expected to have known or believed, that-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) ordinary company tax or undistributed profits tax, as the case may be, was payable, or would become payable, by the company in relation to the year of income; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) an arrangement or transaction had been or would be entered into or carried out for the purpose of securing or achieving the result that the company would not be able to pay to the Commissioner all of the ordinary company tax or undistributed profits tax, as the case may be, that was, or would become, payable by the company in relation to the year of income.'. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been put on more than one occasion, and presumably will be put again, that this legislation is not about innocence and guilt. Frankly, I find that argument at complete variance with the object and purpose of this legislation. The legislation does in fact cast a penalty which is to be imposed on vendor- shareholders retrospectively creating an artificial tax year-a new tax year-and transferring the tax liability of one person on to another. The real intent of the legislation frankly is to make one taxpayer liable for another taxpayer's debt. If honourable senators disagree with that proposition I suggest that they would have to disagree with the proposition that we have double taxation on company profits. There is a clear distinction between the tax entity of the corporation and the tax entity of the individual shareholder. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation, of course, has resulted directly from the fraudulent activity of certain members of the community. I believe it is absolutely bizarre to suggest that this new heavy retrospective taxation now being levelled on certain vendor-shareholders does not in fact impose a new liability. Of course, the facts of the matter are that this legislation is intended to strike not only at the innocent vendor-shareholders but also at the guilty-the fraudulent promoters , fraudulent directors and fraudulent shareholders. The point is that the legislation does not seek to draw a distinction between innocent and guilty persons. They are all subject to the same penalty. People who acted quite properly within the law, people who obtained the best legal advice and accounting advice-in many cases they had their transactions sanctioned by the High Court of Australia or the Supreme Court of South Australia-are now having cast upon them a new taxation liability, a new burden. Lumped together in this legislation are the honest and the dishonest, the avoiders and the evaders and the guilty and the innocent. They are all subject to this legislation. This legislation does not draw distinction between innocence and guilt. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad that certain members of the Opposition concede that innocent people are involved. In fact, Mr Willis, in a debate in the House of Representatives when a similar amendment to this was proposed, said that the Australian Labor Party rejected the amendment because there were not very many innocent vendor- shareholders. I disagree with his judgment as to the number involved. That, of course, is properly a matter for the courts to determine. We do share one common view-that is, that innocent people are trapped by this legislation. Not to accept that innocent people are involved frankly is not to understand this legislation. Whatever one's view, I would have thought that amongst reasonable men it is universally accepted that the courts of our land are the proper places to determine whether people are innocent or guilty. The laws of the land are meant not only to prosecute the guilty but also to protect the innocent, to provide clarity and certainty. The purpose of this amendment is simply to reinforce that principle. In fact, the wording of the clause is such that the burden of the onus of proof will be transferred to the taxpayer and he will be encumbered with the full responsibility of proving that he did not know or believe, or could not reasonably be expected to have known or believed, certain things. That burden of proof is considerably heavier than that which is normally imposed on a taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument has been put in some quarters that all vendor-shareholders are guilty. The argument has been put that if they received consideration for their shares in excess of the current year's profits less the contingent tax liability for that year they must have known that something wrong, something improper, was likely to happen to their company. I remind the Committee in the short time I have available that at that time there were a number of arrangements, a number of schemes, a number of transactions, which could quite properly and quite legally be entered into which, as I said earlier, extinguished, diminished or mitigated the tax liability. There was no suggestion at that time of any illegality or any impropriety in the way those companies were being treated. It ought to be remembered that we are not talking about 1981 or 1982; we are going back ten years. We are going back to 1972 or 1973, to a time when there was no suggestion that people were doing the sorts of things that have been demonstrated in the report of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union. </PARA>
<PARA> Many taxation lawyers and accountants of international and national standing recommended such schemes on the basis of the legitimacy of the financial transactions of vendor-shareholders It seems to me to be expecting a lot to presume that an unknowing vendor-shareholder would ask his lawyer about legal ramifications if subsequently criminals are appointed as new directors steal the money and throw the files in the bottom of the harbour. I must say that it is hardly the obvious question that a businessman would ask his legal advisers. To suggest that all the innocent vendor-shareholders who sold their companies should have known that the companies were going to end up in the hands of crooks , thieves, prostitutes, the underworld, the painters and dockers--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XF4">Senator CRICHTON-BROWNE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, they did not know they were getting too much. The honourable senator does not understand company law. I regret that because, if he did, he could make a valuable contribution to this debate. All the subsequent activities of people who finally ended up with the companies were blatantly illegal and subject to very serious penalties. I suspect that the average person would not believe that people would take their companies and conduct themselves in the way they have. I will remind honourable senators of what the McCabe- Lafranchi report had to say about the role of vendor-shareholders. The report stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no evidence the vendor directors or shareholders or agents know:</PARA>
<PARA> (A) That the companies were sold by the dealer,</PARA>
<PARA> (B) That the remaining funds in the companies were removed by the dealer,</PARA>
<PARA> (C) That the dealer made no attempt to treat the contingent taxation liability of the companies,</PARA>
<PARA> (D) That the dealer did not meet prior year tax provisions in respect of which funds had been handed over by the vendor. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact Messrs McCabe and Lafranchi stated:</PARA>
<PARA> No doubt from the point of view of the vendor it must have been almost unbelievable that the contingent tax liability of a company could be avoided in the manner provided by dealers such as Brian J. Maher and Co. and Commercial Securities Limited. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been much debate about and emphasis on the role of private companies. I wish to touch for a moment on the role of public companies, as has been done already this afternoon. I think that about 63 public companies have been identified and listed so far as falling within the framework of this legislation , with probably in excess of 10,000 shareholders. I put to honourable senators: Is there a real argument, a persuasive argument, that those shareholders had knowledge that companies were being sold by their corporations, would find their way, by whatever route, to the bottom-of-the-harbour, and would be stripped and treated in the way they were? Of course they did not know that, but that does not relieve them of any tax liability or of the responsibilities now cast upon them, subject, of course, as we know, to certain discretionary provisions. The facts are that these people are as innocent as those involved in private companies. Yet they now find themselves subject to a very heavy taxation liability for assets they may well have sold at a loss some years ago. Clearly, the innocent and the guilty are thrown into the same situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to a matter that Senator Walsh raised this afternoon. I am always terrified that I must be wrong when I agree with him. Clause 3 sub-clause (12) of the legislation tacitly demonstrates belief in the innocence of certain groups of vendor-shareholders. The explanatory memorandum states:</PARA>
<PARA> The sub-clause applies where, after a target company was sold to the promoter, it entered into a scheme which is ultimately found to be unsuccessful of its purpose to reduce or eliminate the company's liabilities for the income year during which the sale occurred, and that could reasonably have been expected to eliminate or reduce the company tax payable for that year. </PARA>
<PARA> In that case, provided the scheme was not part of, or connected with, the arrangement which rendered the company unable to pay its company tax liabilities , and the arrangement which had that effect had not been entered into for that purpose, the amount of company tax payable will, for the purpose of ascertaining the liability of former owners and promoters to pay recoupment tax, be taken to be the amount of the company tax that would have been payable if the scheme had turned out to be successful. </PARA>
<PARA>That simply means that, in the event that the company was sold off to somebody who sought to offset the profit for that year in a legal tax avoidance manner but failed and it subsequently went to the bottom-of-the-harbour, no liability will be inflicted upon the vendor-shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> I further repeat the words of the explanatory memorandum which states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is designed to ensure that the legislation will not operate to recoup unpaid company tax where the funds of a target company were removed-rendering it unable to pay tax-on the basis of an objective view as to the efficacy of a post sale tax scheme designed to reduce or eliminate tax liability. </PARA>
<PARA>That clause amounts simply to Russian roulette. If one was lucky or fortunate enough to sell to a promoter whose first object was not to strip the company and send it to the bottom-of-the-harbour but to seek to offset the profits in a legitimate or legal way and then it was stripped, one is safe. But if one was unlucky enough to draw the short straw and end up with a promoter who in fact immediately stripped the company and sent it to the bottom of the harbour then one suffers the sins of that person and gets caught by the provisions of the legislation. I hope the fact that that provision has been inserted by the Government demonstrates the bona fides of people who had sold their companies for a value which exceeded their value less their tax liability. I am sorry that Senator Missen has left the chamber after making an unintelligent observation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government concedes that there are perfectly legitimate and perfectly legal schemes under which companies were sold for a value in excess of their profits less their contingent tax liability. As I say, it is a regrettable element of the clause that it is qualified to the extent that it is a question of whether one is lucky or unlucky as to whether one is visited by the recoupment tax legislation. It is not a question of good management, of prudence, of integrity or of innocence; it is simply a question of good luck. The fate of the shareholders rests exclusively with the integrity of the promoter. </PARA>
<PARA> I will conclude with an observation which was made by G. Nash, Dean and Professor of Law at Monash University, who said:</PARA>
<PARA> History warns us to beware of those who would do something in the name of morality or truth, for the man who knows he is right can be absolutely merciless in implementing the right. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not have to go back to the Spanish Inquisition or to Cromwell's Major- Generals to recognize the dangers of men who know they are right. </PARA>
<PARA> If retrospective legislation is to be justified on the basis that it implements the moral sense of the legislator then gone are our liberties and gone is the rule of law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What Senator Crichton-Browne seeks to do with this clause is to finish the job that the Government started when it wrote sub-clause (12) of clause 3 into its original legislation. Sub-clause (12) of clause 3 exempts shareholders who were lucky enough to have flogged off companies to promoters who put them into some sort of tax avoidance scheme which failed, as Senator Crichton-Browne has said. What this amendment will do is let off almost all people, if not everybody, who evaded tax. It is most fitting that Senator Crichton-Browne should have moved this amendment because when he was President of the Western Australian Liberal Party no fewer than five members of its Finance Committee sold companies to the Maher organisation, the best known of all the tax avoidance and evasion promoters. So it is not at all surprising and it is most appropriate that an amendment to let off all the tax evaders should be moved by the man who was President of the Liberal Party in Western Australia during a period when five members of its Finance Committee flogged off companies to the Maher organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We only know the precise details of one of those companies because-fortuitously or otherwise; I suppose it depends on one's perspective-it was incorporated in Victoria and therefore investigated by McCabe and Lafranchi and the details were published in the McCabe-Lafranchi report. For financial details of the other transactions we will have to wait for a proper investigation by the Corporate Affairs Office in Western Australia. Of course, that will require the election of a Labor Government. Five members of the Finance Committee of the Liberal Party in Western Australia-it had only 15 members, or at least it did in 1979; I think that was the normal number-during the period that Senator Crichton-Browne was President of the Western Australian Liberal Party, flogged off companies to the Maher organisation. They were Sid Corser, Denis Horgan, Ron Woss who was a major promoter in his own right, J. J. Hughes and J. J. Delpiano. So it is not surprising that Senator Crichton-Browne seeks to finish the job started by the Government with sub-clause (12) of clause 3. </PARA>
<PARA> Two types of shareholders in some companies will be liable to pay tax under the legislation as it stands: Those who were actually parties to setting up the schemes, who had a controlling interest in companies-people such as Denis Horgan -and some, no doubt, who did not know what was going on. But all of them got the money and the legislation requires them to return what should have been paid in tax many years ago. If they did not get the money, that are not liable. The argument about innocence is spurious. It might have some validity if criminal penalties were being applied to these people, but criminal penalties are not being applied. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally spurious when it comes from the Western Australian Liberal Party is the retrospective moral outrage at retrospective legislation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to one which was certainly punitive to one party to a transaction. Most notorious of all was the Diamond (Ashton Joint Venture) Act 1981. The Ashton Joint Venturers' claim in the Kiberleys was disputed by another company. The action was actually before the court when the Western Australian Government, under the leadership of Charles Court, passed this special legislation which awarded the claim to the Ashton Joint Venturers, thereby pre- empting the court decision; and, I suppose, effectively that legislation was retrospective to when the original mining legislation was passed in, I think, 1906. And there was not a whimper from any Liberal Senator. Four of them put their names to this amendment based on the spurious argument of innocence or the spurious claim of moral outrage about retrospectivity. All of the Western Australian Liberals who are not in the Ministery have put their names to this amendment. At the time that the Court Government passed these 21 pieces of retrospective legislation, including the Diamond (Ashton Joint Venture) Act 1981 -which took a case out of the hands of the court when it was actually before the court, and was retrospective to 1906-there was not a whimper out of them. If Senator Martyr were the other claimant to that claim and had taken the case to court, he might have thought that he was punished by that legislation. So the attitude of the Western Australian Liberal senators has nothing to do with moral outrage about the principle of retrospectivity. What it has a great deal to do with is the sort of people who are affected by legislation which has retrospective effect.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> In November 1958 taxpayer made application for an authority to prospect for petroleum in an area in north-western Queensland. At that time he was endeavouring to raise sufficient finance to carry out test drilling operations and the application was said to be made on behalf of a company to be formed. The application was approved and taxpayer paid the required deposit of #2,000 and the first year's rental, #723. However, the authority was not immediately issued as the proposed company had not been incorporated. Taxpayer's attempts to raise finance were unsuccessful and finally, in April 1959, the authority was issued in taxpayer's own name. On 25 May 1959 taxpayer entered into an agreement with L Co. by which he undertook to form a company and to transfer the authority to it. The transfer was to be for a nominal consideration as it was the practice of the Department of Mines to refuse approval unless a transfer was for no more than nominal consideration. Under the agreement, L Co. undertook to purchase from taxpayer 51 per cent of the issued shares in the company to be formed for #12, 650 and to pay him 51 per cent of the deposit and first year's rental paid by him. The company, A Pty Ltd, was formed on the same day and the authority was sold to it for #2. The issued capital of A Pty Ltd consisted of two subscribers' shares held in trust for taxpayer. On the following day A Pty Ltd, revalued the authority to #24,804 and on 4 June 1959 it declared a dividend of #24,802. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the advice from Senator Chipp. It is entirely relevant, too. The fact is that we are supporting an innocence clause. That is what I am speaking to. It has been asserted that in some time past Western Australian senators did not utter one toot about certain items-some of them quite obscure and remote-which were alleged to be the work of the Western Australian Government. I asked Senator Walsh how many of those were punitive. He was able to suggest only one of them, the case of the diamonds. I suggest to the Committee that there is a lot of difference between punitive retrospectivity and beneficial retrospectivity. Our essential argument has always been that in following, accepting and upholding the principle of certainty, we are totally opposed to punitive retrospectivity. We have maintained a consistent line of argument in that direction ever since the debate commenced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come to some of the details to which Senator Walsh alluded. How could we be expected to debate in this place, and make public statements about State matters that have nothing whatsoever to do with us? For Senator Walsh's information, some years ago a government of his particular colour in Western Australia, the Tonkin Government of which Don May was the Minister for Mines, actually confiscated from me and some partners of mine a mining lease. This was confiscated after there had been a fair and equitable hearing in the warden's court of that State which awarded it to us. That was done by a Western Australian Labor Minister. So when Senator Walsh starts talking about what is happening in State parliaments he ought to remember what his own mob did. They were absolutely disgraceful in their confiscations, particularly the retrospective confiscations they went in for. Senator Walsh should not give us any of his latter day morality. He should not come in here thinking that he can answer every single good argument that we put up with a counter-accusation. It has been going on for years. We have been warned by Senator Chipp and others not to take any notice of Senator Walsh but we just cannot help it sometimes because there has to be some justice in this world. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the argument about retrospectivity and the necessity for it is a silly one to offer against the principle of certainty. We are talking about innocence and guilt. None of the comparisons that I have heard Senator Walsh make relates to individual innocence or guilt such as is defined in this measure . There is no doubt at all that there is a necessity for this innocence clause. As Senator Crichton-Browne has pointed out very eloquently, there are people who will be caught by this legislative dragnet of the Government. It is far too comprehensive and fine-toothed in its application. Instances have been given of where people will be dragged in. Senator Withers has given examples of people who will be dragged in. I think it is essential for the Committee to consider this. It is almost the last chance that we will have to put a bit of decency into this very bad Bill. I commend this proposed new clause to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief because most of the argument has already taken place in the debate on Senator Chipp's amendment. I just want to answer a couple of the almost imputations that Senator Walsh attempted to make. Firstly, I make it clear to Senator Walsh that I intended to put down this contingent notice of motion. The only reason that I did not do so was that I had to return to Western Australia for a family funeral. I asked Senator Crichton-Browne to put it down for me. It was not put down by Senator Crichton-Browne as a result of pressure from any honourable senator but as a result of a request by me.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is not able to accept an innocence clause of the kind that has been expressed in the proposed amendment. As has been said by other honourable senators, the debate on this matter really took place during the debate on the previous innocence clause moved by Senator Chipp. I certainly recognise the motives that have influenced those honourable senators who have moved the proposed amendment and who supported the previous amendment. I understand that a number of honourable senators would support such an amendment but it is not a view which the Government holds. Perhaps we differ mainly because of the appropriateness of the amendment. It seems to the Government that the case for an innocence clause proceeds from something of a misconception of what this Bill seeks to do and the way in which it expresses its objectives. This Bill does not brand the people to whom it applies as criminals or delinquents. When its technical complexities are put to one side, the Bill says quite simply that there are those groups that benefited from the evasion of company tax which are now required to pay that unpaid company tax. Questions of guilt or innocence of a person from whom recoupment is sought have nothing to do with it. We are dealing with a situation where, by fraud on the part of some of the people concerned, company tax has been evaded. The amount of the evasion having been determined and the groups that gained from it having been fixed, the Bill simply calls for them to pay back the benefit that they ought not to have enjoyed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is, I suggest, no proper place in those conditions for former owners who would otherwise be liable to recoupment to be let off because of their innoncence and the unsavoury things that happened after the shares in the companies were sold to the promoters of these schemes. To put it bluntly, they should, innocent or not, be called on to pay to the revenue the benefit that they enjoyed because the Commonwealth revenue was deprived of the company tax concerned. If that general argument is not accepted there are some significant practical considerations also leading to the conclusion that an innocence clause should not be included in this Bill. One could take all sorts of instances but in the typical family company where perhaps only one or two of a larger number of proprietors make the effective business and investment decisions of the company and the family, an innocence clause of the kind now before us might operate to free from liability some, but not others, of the members of the family. More significantly, an innoncence clause would be most likely to cause the administration of the recoupment tax to grind to a halt. I think that has been said in other ways today. Instead of the work of recouping the unpaid tax being as relatively straightforward as the Bill would have it, it would be necessary, at assessment and review stages, to make inquiries into the presence or absence of the relative purposes or benefits on the part of the persons sought to be made liable. That is not the intent of this Bill when it is seeking to recoup tax. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Administratively I would think it would be very difficult. We have said before, and I have said it today, that questions of guilt or innocence are really beside the point of whether former owners of stripped companies should be liable to pay the recoupment tax. The real point is that they have received a benefit from the evasion of the company tax and hence should simply be asked to recoup that unpaid tax. Guilt or innocence-we have been talking about it in a number of ways today-is irrelevant to this legislation. I want to repeat that. Company tax has been evaded and those, particularly the vendors who benefited by the non-payment of the company tax, are simply being asked to pay. There are those who argue that if there were an innocence clause the late payment penalty of 20 per cent will accrue and will lead to payment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to point out that the nature of an innocence clause is such that there would be litigation about innocence. The tendency would be for each case to become a matter for litigation. I think it was also admitted during the debate on the earlier amendment that vendors did get a benefit; even shareholders in public companies gained a benefit. What the Government is saying in the whole of the philosophy behind this legislation is that those who did get a benefit by the evasion of company tax should simply return that part of the benefit which represents tax due to the revenue under the provisions of this Bill. For those reasons the Government rejects the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle has set out a good answer to those people who are supporting the amendment. The essential thing is that nobody is going to have to pay back money in excess of the money which they ought to have paid in tax anything up to 10 years ago. We support the Government entirely in seeking to achieve that end. What the honourable senator has not explained is why the Government is allowing certain classes of vendor-shareholders who happen to be lucky enough or cunning enough to sell to a promoter after the vendor-shareholders have been party to setting up a highly contrived scheme which turned everything into money and then sold the money-and the promoter subsequently put the company into some failed tax avoidance scheme-not to have to repay the money that they ought to have paid in tax anything up to 10 years ago. No matter which way the Government turns, since the insertion of clause 3 (12) every escape route is a blind tunnel. I believe it is absolutely outrageous that that clause was put into the legislation belatedly, after it had first been introduced. Clause 3 (12) is arbitrary and capricious law at its worst. It is utterly disgraceful that some vendor- shareholders should pay while others get off just because they were lucky or cunning enough to sell to promoters who used tax avoidance schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I submit there are two possible reasons why clause 3 (12) was inserted. The first is that the Government is feeble minded and cannot follow the logic of the argument, and the second is that it was written in to get particular people off the hook. One who demonstrably it does get off the hook is Denis Horgan. I might add for Senator Withers's benefit, if he is interested, that I put out 12 Press statements on this subject between the first week in June and the end of July. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were pretty punitive if one was a shareholder of Afro-West Mining and Exploration Pty Ltd, a company which had a case before the courts contesting the legality of the Ashton Joint Venture diamond claim. An amendment was pushed through the State Parliament which awarded it to the Ashton syndicate , principally to CRA Ltd, thereby nullifying legislation which had been in existence since 1906. Senator Martyr might have thought it was punitive. I believe-although I do not have the details-that a number of the other pieces of legislation from the Western Australian Government on the list which I have had incorporated were also punitive, particularly those which concern the Metropolitan Water Supply Sewerage and Drainage Board. The essential point on this so-called innocence clause is that nobody is going to have to do more than repay the money that he ought to have paid in tax many years ago. Therefore there is no justification for an innocence clause other than the fact that rather a lot more people who have evaded and avoided tax will not have to pay it back because of the limp legislation which the Government introduced and subsequently watered down; most notably sub-section (12) of clause 3.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we are going to throw any sympathy around I suggest again that it ought to be saved first for those who were conducting businesses honestly and paying the tax which was due on their profits but who were forced into bankruptcy because they could not compete with other companies which were not paying tax they should have been paying. Sympathy should not go to those who very belatedly are to pay tax in inflated dollars which ought to have been paid years ago. The second group of people for whom we should reserve our sympathy, who are much more numerous, are the millions of ordinary families who, according to estimates by authorities of the eminence of Mr Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers' Association and Professor Mathews, have been paying $30 a week more tax than they ought to have paid because a minority have paid little or none. A minority of that minority will now have to pay some because of this legislation. That minority ought to be very much larger, but the legislation as it stands is better than nothing. If this so-called innocence clause were included I suggest it would be completely useless. Therefore, the Opposition will not be supporting the amendment. </PARA>

People ought to be reminded of what some of the implications of this legislation are. I have to admit that the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) also said that it is just a matter of people paying back a benefit they ought not to have enjoyed. One gets the impression that people who have enjoyed this benefit did nothing but put the money in the bank and sit and wait for the Government to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Missen, you are tedious. Take your turn. It is not enough just to say that the people who have benefited are not criminals or delinquents. The fact is that they are people who entered into business arrangements. They made what they thought was a quite legitimate profit. They took advice; they acted in good faith. In some cases it is possible that they could have believed that the company they were selling was to be put to a very specific purpose which carried a particular tax benefit and to them the transaction might well have looked to have been a piece of sound business on the part of both the vendor and the purchaser. Were the vendors then obliged to ensure that what happened to that company was what they had been led to believe would happen to the company? There are circumstances under which people could have acted in good faith.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is also the fact that simply getting this money that should have been paid, this benefit that should not have been enjoyed, could lead to some very complex results. I will not take up a great deal of time of the Senate outlining what they are. I think everybody here knows. But I just do not think it should be allowed to pass as being such a simple matter to extract this money that Senator Walsh says these people should pay. They should pay back what they owe, he said, as though somebody gave them something and now they have to pay that debt. It was not a debt at the time when they got the money. It is far more likely that the money has been invested in various ways, perhaps in further business ventures, perhaps in property, perhaps in homes. Who knows? There are indications already in some areas of the country where some of that money may have gone by what has happened to the property market. I do not pass any comment on the morality of that because I do not know the individuals involved and nobody here does. </PARA>
<PARA> The simple fact is that this legislation will cause hardship and it will cause hardship to people who acted in good faith and who are innocent in the terms of this innocence clause that we talk about and, indeed, to the heirs of some of the people who acted in this way. Undoubtedly a number of these people have died -that would be in accord with the law of averages-and their widows or their children will have received that benefit that, in the words of the Minister, they should not have enjoyed. That is entirely possible. They are in those terms having a benefit that they should not be enjoying. But they were not the parties to the arrangement. As I understand the legislation, they will now have to find the money to pay this tax, regardless of what were the motives of those who entered into the arrangement. The simple situation is that the Bill in total is objectionable but this clause would at least recognise the position of those people who acted in good faith, those people who believed they were not doing anything wrong but were acting strictly within the letter of the law as it then applied, as advised to them by their lawyers and their accountants, the people whose services they were hiring to give them good business and financial advice. They may have been led to believe that the arrangements that were to be entered into by the purchaser were such as would be quite persuasive. Some people suggest that everybody must have known that something was wrong. Senator Crichton-Browne in his speech gave us a couple of examples of arrangements that people might have believed were possible. The simple fact is that, as long as we give major taxation incentives to people in certain industries, the argument gets weaker. If we give a 100 per cent tax benefit, as we do in the case of certain areas of activities, and it was believed that the person purchasing the company was involved in that area of activity, it would be entirely persuasive and plausible to have sold one's business venture under these circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is not enough to reject the notion of innocence. I believe that there was some innocence. Some people perhaps might have suspected sharp practices and not asked their accountants and lawyers the right questions. Some people, I am sure, suspected sharp practices, asked their accountants and lawyers the right questions, were not satisfied with their answers and so did not proceed. A whole range of activities was possible. It was not an intention to defraud. It was not a negligence of inquiry on behalf of the people whom we are talking about. There was genuine innocence and they should not be hounded, be open to hounding or, indeed, now suffer a financial disadvantage which may have an effect far past taking back the benefits that they have enjoyed but which, because of circumstances-of timing or whatever-may mean that the price that they pay is far heavier than if they had paid their tax. Some people might say: 'Well, serve them right'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am afraid that Senator Martin finds interjections disagreeing with her tedious. I am afraid that she has now provoked me into saying a few words on this matter, not having spoken on any of the innocence clauses. It seems to me that a sidetrack is going on with regard to this debate. It is quite right, as Senator Martin said, that some people will suffer hardship. But on the other hand many people who got more than they should have from these companies and the sale of these companies have had the money for years and have invested it. She said that people seem to think that they put it all in the bank. I do not think that they all put it in the bank. I think they turned it over and made profits. They are not being taxed for those profits. They have had the money for some years. An amount of $580m has been calculated as being not paid by the frauds and disgraceful behaviour of people. The people who are now being brought to book in this are not necessarily people who were involved in that fraud. They may be, in a sense, 'innocent'. They may not have known where the money was coming from and why they were doing so well. But somebody must suffer. Is it to be the ordinary pay-as-you-earn taxpayer of this community who has suffered in the past because of these defalcations; or is the money to be collected or not?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The merging into a question of innocence is, in my view, very serious. It is one thing to be opposed entirely to this legislation. I understand the sincerity of a number of honourable senators on this side who think that. But to then promote an innocence clause is, to my mind, a much more serious thing. It is to degut, to take away everything from the Bill. It is to ensure that because things are in the minds of people, governments are expected to prove what was in the minds of people 10 years ago. Of course, we know that the collections will not be made. We know that the success of an innocence clause inserted into this Bill would make the Bill a sham and the Government, of course, would thereby--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not because they are innocent, but because we cannot prove the things that are in people's minds. But innocence is not the question. It is a question of collection of tax moneys. Those people who have inherited these moneys by reason of the frauds of others and who are now called upon to recoup that money are the people who should pay and not the really innocent taxpayers of this community who pay more tax and who do not get tax reductions because of the clever frauds that have been made in the past. That is the simple proposition; all the nonsense about innocence and so forth in this matter today has nothing to do with it. It is a matter of who in fairness is going to repay this money. The Government is right to resist to the hilt any idea of an innocence clause because that actually would wreck this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting to observe that one hears that there is no such thing as innocence, that everybody is guilty and that the money that has been improperly kept by certain people ought to be repaid. It is very interesting to observe how consciences sway from one side of morality to the other. We hear people talk about the poor old pay-as-you-earn taxpayers. I do not hear rage, indignation or criticism of the PAYE people-so far untouched because it is politically wise not to do so-who think it is very appropriate to accept a significant discount if they are building, a pergola, a barbecue or an extension to their home. Such behaviour is socially acceptable. We have not yet arrived at the level of morality where such behaviour is retrospectively outlawed and subject to outrage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to touch on two matters raised by Senator Walsh. As usual, Senator Walsh never spoils a good story with the truth. He made some claims about members of the finance committee of the Liberal Party of Western Australia being tax evaders. I put it to him, as I have put before, that if he knows that to be the case I think he quite properly ought to notify the Commissioner of Taxation. He ought to declare who these people are. They will be subject to section 86E, or whatever the appropriate provision is, of the Income Tax Assessment Act. It already provides for such action. I find remarkable any suggestion that people in the Liberal Party have provided funds in any unnatural way; given the events of the Iraqi funny money scheme that the Australian Labor Party tried to launch itself into. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation really comes down to a question of innocence. If people entered into schemes and arrangements that have subsequently been found to be illegal, given the heavy onus of the burden of proof that has been cast upon them, and it has been demonstrated that they did nothing wrong or had no reason to believe anything was improper in their transactions, I do not believe they should be visited by legislation which is retrospective to 1972. </PARA>

I am also concerned when people who could be best described as professional bleeding hearts in this place and who are always complaining about infractions of human rights get up and also lump everyone, innocent and guilty, into one Bill and the penalties that come from it. Let us stop all the sophistry about this legislation being a recoupment measure. The legislation seeks to impose extra taxation on people who in some cases complied with the law as it stood at the time. It is true that, to use Senator Walsh's words, there were crooks. Let us get them under the legislation that exists now and which has existed previously. We have no need for a Bill of the sort we are considering.

He said that he knows that the pay-as-you-earn taxpayer is evading tax wholesale because everybody who has a barbecue built or an addition to a house built pays in cash and gets a discount. If he knows of such cases it is his duty to tell the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation about them, and I hope he will. He then said that I mentioned that at least five-we have found five; there could well be more- members of the Liberal Party's finance committee in Western Australia sold companies to Brian Maher when he was President of the Western Australian Liberal Party. He said that if I know about this I ought to tell the Commissioner. Unfortunately, all that I know is that they sold companies to the Maher organisation. I do not know the financial details because there has been no investigation in the Corporate Affairs Office in Western Australia as there has been in Melbourne and Sydney, although the results of those investigations have not yet been announced.

Frankly, I am much more concerned about the heirs of the people who did pay the tax that they ought to have paid many years ago than the heirs of the people who did not. I am even more concerned about the millions of ordinary families who have been ripped off for years by people who were not paying the tax that they ought to have been paying. Nobody is going to be responsible to pay more tax than ought to have been paid years ago. They have had the use of the money for anything up to 10 years free of interest and they will pay it off in inflated dollars. I think they have been treated very lightly by this legislation. Regrettably, of course, a lot of those who are equally guilty will not be affected by the legislation at all and they ought to be.

<PARA> (1) Page 57, clause 18, after sub-clause (8), insert the following new sub- clause:</PARA>
<PARA> '(8A) Sub-section (8) applies whether or not an objection against the assessment was made by the company and, where an objection was made by the company against the assessment, that sub-section applies notwithstanding that the objection by the company has been finalised or is to be taken to have been finalised for the purposes of paragraphs 5 (1) (f) and 5 (2) (f).'</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer (Mr Howard) in this second reading speech, when introducing the revised legislation on 21 October, indicated that the Government had concluded that all former shareholders should be served with a company assessment notice, 'the only qualification being that the person's whereabouts is known or, in the case of a company, it is not dormant'. In fact, the legislation does nothing of the kind. The legislation retains the exclusion included in the initial legislation; that is, the service on the shareholder is not necessary if the Commissioner has reason to believe that prior service on the company brought the contents of the assessment to the shareholder's notice. If the vendor had been aware of the assessment after the sale, as has been said already many times in this debate, there was no basis on which he or she could have objected because that vendor then did not hold any office in the company nor had any rights in that company. Consequently, under the law, although they may have been aware of the notice, they were deprived of any legal remedy to undertake action. The effect of clause 18 of the legislation is one of Russian roulette in that those who by chance happened to have received a company notice of assessment before this legislation brought about the assessment which they could do nothing about, will now be denied the right to object against the liabilities of the company. I believe this ought to be rectified. The amendment that I have moved aims to give to each person liable to pay the tax that the Senate has voted that they should now pay the same rights that the company had whether or not that company had lodged an objection. In some cases appeals might have been abandoned by the buyer of the company whereas, if the vendor had retained that company, the appeal may have been pursued. Each person who is potentially liable for the recoupment tax that the Senate has now decided upon I believe must be given the opportunity to pursue any objection which the company may have pursued in relation to any company tax outstanding or claimed to be outstanding. I believe that it is only in that way that the justice and fairness about which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and others have spoken will be able to be pursued in a legal way. Each person ought to be able now to make that objection which could have been made by the company, notwithstanding the other clauses upon which we have already voted. If this clause were added, it would enable that to occur. The Senate ought to allow this amendment so that at least one area of possible anomalies can be removed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government does not accept the amendment. The terms of the amendment are based on the faulty premise that in a case where a company has already exercised rights of objection and appeal against an assessment there are no further rights of objection and appeal against the copy of the assessment served on vendor- shareholders. The Government's advice is that an earlier or concurrent exercise of rights of objection or appeal by the company would not exclude a vendor- shareholder nominated by a majority of those in the representative class from also exercising the rights of objection and appeal given by sub-clause 18 (8). Therefore the amendment is unnecessary and the Government rejects it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Page 63, clause 23, sub-clause (1), line 33, leave out ''conclusive evidence'', insert ''prima facie evidence''. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 23 refers to a certificate signed by the Commissioner of Taxation and states that an amount of company tax specified in a certificate is due and payable by a company and that on a date specified in the certificate that company tax remained unpaid. This document is to be taken as conclusive evidence . My amendment to clause 23 would change the wording to refer to prima facie evidence that this was the case. It is a minor amendment but it would mean that a person could at least contend that a tax is due and payable or that the tax is unpaid. I can understand one of the reasons the Government may wish to have what is an unusual clause in there. Similar clauses are normally handled on the basis of prima facie evidence rather than conclusive evidence being available. I understand that one of the reasons might be that the Government has aimed at overcoming the problem of a lack of company records. I think that the price of the provision surely is the denial of a fair defence in relation to at least two items by vendor-shareholders, who themselves are also at a severe disadvantage because they do not have records either. Let us not forget that what was actually done to the companies about which we are talking was not done by the vendors but by somebody else. When the vendors seek to pursue their objection they are at as much disadvantage as the Government is in relation to this matter . It seems to me to be at least fair and equitable that we should not put this additional impost on them regarding the notion of having conclusive evidence, which seems to me to be a very odd type of proposition anyway. Senator Missen has drawn this to our attention concerning another Bill in which such a provision was attempted. It was changed from conclusive evidence to prima facie evidence. I believe in this situation that would be sufficient to carry the Government's will in relation to this clause. Surely it would be cleaner all round to have that normal provision included. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government rejects this amendment to clause 23 that has been moved by Senator Macklin. The purpose of this clause is to ensure that in proceedings in relation to recoupment tax the amount of company tax and the fact that it has not been paid are not matters which can be raised as a defence. That is entirely appropriate in circumstances where the company tax assessment is capable of being made subject to objection and appeal processes and where a recoupment tax assessment can be disputed by a similar process. Clause 23 has been varied from the form it took in the original Bill introduced in the House of Representatives and not proceeded with in that it has now been made clear that a certificate is not conclusive evidence in cases where the company assessment itself is subject to appeal proceedings. Clause 23 is modelled on and complements section 177 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 which is incorporated into this Bill by clause 4 (1). In combination that clause and section ensure, in accordance with the long accepted practice, that assessments to tax are capable of challenge only through the established appeal mechanisms and not as a defence to an action for recovery of the tax.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My friend refers to Custer's last stand. It reminds me of a reply Senator Withers gave the other day. I do not know that it is entirely in conformity with the Standing Orders, but I draw to Senator Missen's attention that Custer's last stand was at a place called Little Big Horn. I say no more than that because I would not want to outrage the Standing Orders or the sensibilities of anybody concerned. It seems to me that, as I am in total opposition to this Bill, I have to keep trying in the hope that maybe the final words will have some effect on the silent civil libertarians on my side of the chamber of whom I have not seen very much during this debate. I am wondering whether latterly in listening to the debate, some of them have come to the conclusion that this is essentially bad legislation because of its retrospective element and because a new tax has to be established. It was with some shock that I actually heard speakers on both sides of this chamber asserting quite definitely and quite strongly that there was no element at all of retrospectivity in this legislation. I do not know how they could possibly come to that conclusion when two lots of explanatory memoranda are available, one put out by the Treasurer, Mr John Howard, and the other by the Minister representing the Treasurer in this place, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. Both of them adverted in their explanatory memoranda to the retrospective element in this legislation. I do not know how anybody could possibly assert that there is no element of retrospectivity. But people have done so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Missen is muttering again. It seems to me that he has spent most of his time during this debate muttering about how disloyal people are to the Government and how they cannot see that all these people are guilty, that they are all crooks and have all evaded tax and all have to pay. I simply say to all those people who keep telling me that there is no element of retrospectivity in this legislation and that the money was always owed: Why is it necessary for the Government to make fresh legislation to create a new tax and to apply it retrospectively? There is only one reason for that, and that reason is that what these people did-I am not talking about the morality of it-was perfectly legal at the time. The whole proof is to be found in the collective Bills and in the explanatory memoranda. It is all there for anyone with basic common sense to see . The essential point about this legislation is that it is retrospective and a new tax has had to be created in order to get what the Government says is owed to it. There is not any doubt at all that it is a new tax and that it is retrospective. That is the only point I am trying to make. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;People on our side of the chamber. I have seen one after the other stand up and I have heard them say that this really is not retrospective legislation. I have also heard people on the other side of the chamber say that. Senator Walsh has been saying it during almost all of the Committee stage. He has been saying that this money was always owed. He said that the people who evaded tax are all crooks. He is making all these judgments. He is making judgments about people when he says that they evaded tax. We all know that evasion of tax is illegal; that is stated on all the taxation forms. Senator Walsh cannot say without any qualification at all that people evaded tax. The fact is that he just does not know; he is just guessing. With a fertile mind for making slander in this coward's castle Senator Walsh has been very successful in naming people so that their reputations are just simply ruined forever. They have had no trial at all except the one given them by Senator Walsh. No charges have been laid, except in this place under parliamentary privilege. Senator Walsh has been challenged time and time again to take his charges into the street, into the public forum, and just see how long he would last in law. It is all very well for him to use this coward's castle. It is all very well to use the privilege of this Parliament to defame people, to make charges against them, to accuse them of being tax evaders and crooks and to keep naming them week after week. But Sentor Walsh has not done this out in the open forum. He would get a writ at law if he did. He knows that so he keeps using this coward's castle. This has been the standard of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose that I at least can be grateful that I am a poor man, financially anyway, and probably always will be. But the charges have been made by Senator Walsh and others that people in the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party and in the State Council have taken money from all sorts of places in order to fight the retrospectivity that is embodied in this legislation. I would have to say that I have received no money. I have seen no one passing out this money. Indeed, if Senator Walsh and people on the other side want to blame certain people in Western Australia for opposing the retrospective legislation they had better start blaming me because I have had quite a deal to do with the framing of a strong opinion in Western Australia against this dreadful legislation. I tell the Senate and anyone else who is interested that I have not received a penny for that except my parliamentary salary. I think that salary was well earned. This is what I am here for-to protect the people of this country against legislation which is as bad as this. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject utterly the charges of Senator Walsh and anybody else in this place who suggests that the Western Australian Council of the Liberal Party of Australia has been bought by people who are against retrospectivity. Those charges are utterly unsuitable. My standing here and saying what I am saying is the rejection of charges by Opposition members. They are not worth a snap of the fingers. It is easy to come in here and point the finger and make charges. That is the whole burden of the Opposition's case. It is a shameful thing that our Government should be dragooned, pushed and pulled into such legislation as this in order to catch up on people who are presumed to be guilty when everyone in this place knows that under the ordinary rules of evidence they are totally innocent. No charges have been presented by anybody. I have always said that if these people are as bad and as dangerous as the Government and others have said they are, let them be prosecuted according to the law as it is now.

Indeed, Senator Withers spoke in his speech the other evening about what the called the gamekeepers theory. I call it the creation of a scapegoat. Scapegoats have been created in order to draw attention away from things that perhaps ought to have been done, and done sooner. I say no more about that but scapegoats are being created in this community. As I said before, charges have been made in this coward's castle under privilege but not one single thing is said outside.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Thursday night last during the adjournment debate Senator Haines read into Hansard a telegram from the Chairman of the Point McLeay Community Council. In my brief remarks in response to that I said that I would like to know who solicited the telegram. I had certain information given to me over the weekend. No doubt Senator Haines will be able to verify whether it is correct. I understand that a message was received from either Senator Haines or her office seeking certain information and wanting to know in what way I had upset the people of Point McLeay. As I said the other night, I have not upset the people of Point McLeay in any way. They have approached me over many years to get some assistance for them. As members of this Senate who have been here for nearly as long as I have would know, I have consistently brought forward here matters on behalf of the people of Point McLeay. I have never done it on my own accord.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I am concerned about-I did say this the other night-is that Senator Haines , in reading the telegram, referred to a document which allegedly was a report of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. That document, which is so often quoted in many cases, is a 29-page document which is entitled 'History of the Ralkon Company operation and dispute-Events leading up to complaint to Commonwealth Ombudsman'. Of course, there is a whole series of details in that document. But in no way, shape or form is it a report from the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Senator Peter Baume knows that because he has received letters on the subject. I will have to delay the Senate for some time to read into the record a letter from the Ombudsman so that people who are being misled and used by others can see for themselves what the position is. I am prepared to make a lot of documentation available to these people, as I made it available to Senator Peter Baume when he was Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare many years ago. I have to say that, much to my concern, my files have increased tenfold since then. However, I did acquaint the people of Point McLeay-the directors of the Ralkon Agricultural Co. and, particularly, the Chairman-with the text of that telegram and the text of Senator Haines's remarks. Over the weekend they delivered a letter to me by hand and asked that I read it into Hansard. I will do so at the request of Mr Spencer Rigney, who is the Chairman. It is written on Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd letterhead and dated 27 November. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Geoff McLaren,</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA>27.11.82</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator McLaren,</PARA>
<PARA> We have read the telegram sent to Senator Haines on 25.11.82 and signed by Henry. It makes sorry reading and only shows that a proper inquiry into this is long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA> Why Henry put his name to it we would not know. It is not the first time he has signed something that he knew was not true. The last time it concerned ourselves and he told us that he signed because he was afraid of losing his job. We can only assume something of the same this time. The people of Pt McLeay knew nothing of it and it does not reflect their feelings. The people of Pt McLeay are by now heartily sick of the whole filthy business. </PARA>
<PARA> Henry may have signed this telegram. He certainly did not write it. Whoever did write it is obviously afraid of a proper inquiry and is trying to use Senator Haines for their own ends. </PARA>
<PARA> This Company represents the whole community of Pt McLeay. It is their company. On behalf of the people we ask you to continue to seek for the inquiry and we thank you for your persistence. </PARA>
<PARA> We would hope that Senator Haines will now join with you in seeking justice. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,  SPENCER RIGNEY  Chairman</PARA>
<PARA>I say here and now that I have a notice of motion on the Notice Paper-it has been there since about May last year-seeking to set up a Senate select committee to inquire into all of the problems. I think the proposed terms of reference cover just about every aspect that could be covered, going back a very long time . In view of the concern that Senator Haines expressed in the Senate the other night in making accusations against me-unsubstantiated, I might say, by anybody from the Point McLeay community-I expect that the Australian Democrats will at least support me if that notice of motion comes on for debate. I expect also the support of Senator Teague, who has had some interest in this matter. I have documentation of his visits to the area. By way of his interjections last Thursday night he accused me of setting black against black. I never use the word 'black'. I talk about these people as Aborigines, as they should be talked about. Senator Teague said:</PARA>
<PARA> Black against black as well. </PARA>
<PARA>That was in response to the use by Senator Haines of the expression 'black against white'. I have never endeavoured to divide the people of the area. At all times I have endeavoured to bring about a peaceful solution to the problems that have existed at Point McLeay for a very long time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not the first time that telegrams such as this have originated from the Point McLeay Community Council. On 13 March last year I received a telegram at my office, then at 6 Third Street, Murray Bridge. I have never been one to hide anything that comes to my notice to try to solve this problem. The telegram reads:</PARA>
<PARA> This Aboriginal council protests vigorously against the remarks made by yourself under parliamentary privilege in the Senate, March 3rd, 1981. You have obviously been misled in fact to the detriment of this council's community affairs and well being. We hold you to your statement 'if I have been wrong in what I have been saying on behalf of these people I will be quite prepared to apologise to the Senate for what I have said over the years'. </PARA>
<PARA>That telegram is signed by Councillor Ronald Wilson, Chairman, Point McLeay Community Council. That is the telegram that I received. On the same date I sent a telegram to Mr Ronald Wilson. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Wish to acknowledge receipt your telegram on behalf of your council. Please advise me immediately of the full text of the resolution passed by your council and the date on which council meeting was held. </PARA>
<PARA>That telegram has my signature attached to it. On the same day I checked with Telecom Australia as to the origin of the telegram I received. I was advised that it was phoned from an office. My staff did some further checking and I found that that telegram originated from the office of Deloitte, Haskins and Sells in Murray Bridge, a firm of accountants just around the corner from my office. The people who sent the telegram journeyed to Murray Bridge, which is a long way, and instead of talking to me they went to their accountants and lodged a telegram by phone to be sent around the corner to my office. I received a reply telegram by telephone on Saturday, 14 March 1981 at 8.30 a.m. It was lodged at Narrung on Friday, 13 March 1981 at 6.20 p.m. The text of that telegram reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Acknowledge your telegram of 13th. Relevant minutes will be posted as requested . Suggest meeting between ourselves to discuss this resolution and all other problems affecting the Aboriginal community at Point McLeay. </PARA>
<PARA>That telegram was signed by Ronald Wilson. To this day I have not received a copy of the minutes of that meeting. I am led to believe, but I cannot substantiate it, that no such meeting was ever held. There may have been a meeting of one or two people. One of those people is still there. I refer to the administrator at Point McLeay, Mr Probyn. To this day I have not received a copy of the minutes and the people at Point McLeay are not aware whether any official meeting was held. On 16 March an unsolicited petition-I did not ask for it-was delivered to my office. It was signed by 42 residents of Point McLeay. I also received a copy of the local council roll-that is, the people entitled to vote at the Point McLeay Community Council elections. That petition, dated 16 March 1981, states:</PARA>
<PARA> We, the undersigned People of Point McLeay want to have free and open Council Elections on 28th March as we have always done. We do not agree with certain members of the Council who are going behind our backs on important issues. We wish to thank Senator McLaren for standing up for us in Parliament, especially for what he said on 3rd March 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>My speech in the adjournment debate of that date is documented in Hansard. I have a copy here. I advise any people who are now starting to show an interest in the problems of Point McLeay to read it. They should go back through the Hansard indexes for many years and look at the problems which I have brought before the Senate. When I looked at the names of the people who signed this petition, I noticed that one was an H. J. Rankine, J.P. So 18 months ago Henry Rankine who signed this petition was saying that he agreed with what I was trying to do for the people. It should be borne in mind, as I said on Thursday, that Henry Rankine was among the first group of people who visited me and asked me to do something to assist them. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said in the Parliament before that they wanted me to contact the reporters of the This Day Tonight program and ask them to go to Point McLeay to do a program on it. I talked them out of this. I explained to them and convinced them that an exercise like that would only be a 24-hour wonder and then people would forget about it. I said that I would raise it in Parliament which I did, firstly during the Estimates committee hearings. That is all documented. People who read the answers will see that the Aboriginal enterprise grants which had been stopped would be paid if the Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd would sack the white manager. I note in the message that has come from Senator Haines that I am sticking up for one white person at Point McLeay. That has never been my desire at all. I have asked the Aboriginal people while Mr Hillock was not present whether they were satisfied with the work he was doing and whether they wanted him removed. They have always said they are satisfied with him. It is the decision of the directors and shareholders of the company that he should continue to be the manager of that company. I can do no more than accept the word of those people for whom I have great respect. </PARA>
<PARA> The petition that was sent to me was signed by 42 people out of 61 people entitled to vote at the Council. I think that that is conclusive proof that the majority of people at Point McLeay are not concerned, as Senator Haines said when she read out the telegram, that I am causing trouble at Point McLeay. I would say that over 90 per cent of the residents of Point McLeay are shareholders by law of this registered company. They have won court cases on this subject. It takes a very small number of those shareholders to call for a special extraordinary meeting to discuss the problems. That has never happened. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bob Randall, who was a Liberal Party member of the State Government until the last State election, and I visited Point McLeay during the year before last by invitation of the Ralkon Agricultural Co. to attend its annual general meeting. That meeting was advertised, as it should be by law. When we got there we found that the administrator, Mr Probyn, had locked the community hall and put some people in a bus and taken them to Adelaide. If it had not been for the good offices of the principal of the school who unlocked the school so that the meeting could be held there, that meeting would have had to be held under a tree . Many things need to be answered at Point McLeay. </PARA>
<PARA> I have documentation of resolutions passed by the Council that the administrator, by an instruction or a motion passed by the Council, should be a resident of the settlement. I ask the Minister for Education (Senator Peter Baume) who represents the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs whether he will check to see whether Mr Probyn is a resident of the settlement or whether he travels a great number of miles each day to attend to his duties and whether he gets paid a travelling allowance which involves a certain amount of money. It is a large amount of money. I ask Senator Baume to check that out. I also ask him whether a white person is employed as a bookkeeper who again travels each day from Murray Bridge to the settlement. Further, I ask him whether the money-as I have said before, this is the reason I asked a lot of these questions during the Aboriginal Development Commission estimates-which is appropriated by this Parliament to both the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the ADC is being wisely spent. I think it is my duty as a member of parliament to pose those questions. We come now to 18 August 1981. I refer to a telegram I received from Mr Spencer Rigney, who is Chairman of the Ralkon Agricultural Co. The telegram states:</PARA>
<PARA> ADC interference has established procedures causing unnecessary dissension within this community. Urgent that select committee of inquiry requested by you earlier be got under way as a matter of urgency for the good of this community. </PARA>
<PARA>The telegram is signed by Spencer Rigney. I did not solicit that telegram. Senator Haines has read into Hansard a telegram from the present Chairman of the Council, Mr Henry Rankine, claiming that I am causing problems. Mr Spencer Rigney, who has been a resident of Point McLeay all his life, was not, by some manipulation of the electoral roll at the last election in March, allowed to stand as a candidate for the Council. This is something that the State Government has to look at to see that there are no further malpractices at election time. Every March when the annual election is due to be held there are problems. I have oodles of correspondence about that. There is also a documentary film in the Parliamentary Library which contains certain accusations which were made by the returning officer's wife as to some pressure that was brought to bear on the returning officer. I will not go into all that. All of that will come out if the Government will agree to hold a public inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> It may well be, as I have said, that people who are members of the company will finish up with egg on their face; I might finish up with egg on my face. But I am so convinced of the problem that exists there and I am so determined that justice be done that I think an inquiry should be held. I take offence at the remarks made by Senator Haines that I am trying to gain some cheap political kudos. They are not her exact words but that is what she really meant about my raising the matter of Ralkon. Senator Baume would know, as would the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Wilson), that no political advantage is to be gained by any politician who stands up in public and fights the cause of Aborigines because eventually one will find that one's head will be on the block . </PARA>
<PARA> I have been pursuing this matter for many years. People have said to me that I am a fool to keep it going. I came into this Parliament with the desire to represent the underdog. I have tried to do that on all occasions. If I am wrong, as I have said-this also relates to the telegram which I have read into the Hansard-I will apologise to the Senate and anybody else whom I might have offended. But, of course, we will not know whether I have accused anybody falsely until a public inquiry is held. It is not beyond the capabilities of the Government to have an inquiry. It could be that we may not need a Senate select committee, as I have suggested, to look into this matter. Another form of inquiry could be held. The committee of which Senator Baume was chairman felt that this matter was out of its jurisdiction and it therefore gave it to the Ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I think what the Ombudsman said also has to be read into the record. I refer to a letter from Professor Richardson to me dated 2 March 1981. I hope again that this will lay to rest these false accusations which have been made. A document is continually surfacing which, it is said, is the final report of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Anybody who reads the Commonwealth Ombudsman Act would know that there is no way that the Ombudsman can bring down a final report unless the people of Ralkon change their mind. Due to the lapse of time the people of Ralkon asked him to discontinue his inquiry. The Ombudsman wrote to me on 2 March in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator McLaren,</PARA>
<PARA> On 19 January 1981 I wrote to the Chairman of the Ralkon Agricultural Company Pty Ltd following conversations between you and this office and Mr Bob Randall and myself. </PARA>
<PARA>I mentioned a while ago that Bob Randall is an ex-member of a Liberal government in South Australia. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> My letter to Ralkon contained the following:</PARA>
<PARA> I sought from the Secretary comments on the apparently unauthorised circulation of Mr Crotty's letter of October 1978 addressed to Mr Koolmatrie. </PARA>
<PARA> The Secretary's response, not unexpectedly, is to the effect that he is unable to ascertain whether the copying and circulation of the letter took place within his Department. He has provided details of the enquiries he made which show that the relevant files are recorded as having been in storage for many months previous to our enquiry, and there is no further information which would enable him to speculate fruitfully on how the document came to be circulated. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand your company's concern at the circulation so long after the event of a letter which contained only the preliminary views of this office in relation to your complaint, but I have to say that if, as seems possible, people with interests opposed to the company are responsible, the likelihood of action by this office being successful in preventing the activity is small. I should, therefore, be interested to have your reaction to another possible course, which while it will not guarantee that the document ceases to be circulated, may go some way towards nullifying its effect. Should you wish it, I would be prepared to furnish you with a statement to the effect that the letter in question, dated 25 October 1978, represented preliminary conclusions only by this office, and that those conclusions and the evidence upon which they were based were contested by your company. It would be open to you to use such a statement to counter the effects of the circulation of the document. Beyond that, however, I find it difficult to perceive any other solution which could be of much assistance to you. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not heard further from the Company but if I do, of course, I will, if requested, provide the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,  J. E. RICHARDSON  Commonwealth Ombudsman</PARA>
<PARA>Again I have read into the Hansard record this letter from Professor Richardson which shows that there is no such thing as a completed Ombudsman's report. Yet people repeatedly say that there is such a report. I do not know why they are doing it. I think Professor Richardson hit the nail on the head when he said in part of his letter that they have a grouch, or words to that effect, against the company. I have another letter which I think should be read into the Hansard record. It is signed by Mr Spencer Rigney, Chairman of the Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd. It was written to the Adelaide Advertiser in response to a letter to the editor by Mr Charles Perkins. Unfortunately, Mr Rigney's letter was never published. I will publish it now. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd. Loveday Bay Road Narrung, S.A. 5259 29 September 1981</PARA>
<PARA>The Editor</PARA>
<PARA>Advertiser Newspapers Ltd</PARA>
<PARA>King William St.,</PARA>
<PARA>Adelaide, S.A. 5000</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to set on record certain facts relating to matters raised in the letter from Mr Charles Perkins (the Advertiser 28/9/81). </PARA>
<PARA> Ralkon was established in 1975 at the instigation of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs following our representation to conduct farming operations on behalf of the aboriginal people of Point McLeay. The Department advised those residents that after the formation of the company they would each receive shares in the company. Following the formation the Department advised that the shares should be held by the Point McLeay Community Council on behalf of the residents and not by the residents themselves. This upset the residents who had paid money for the shares in the company. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1979 the company's articles were changed to enable the shares to be issued to residents so that they would have a direct say in the operation of the business of the company in farming lands purchased at Point McLeay. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1980 Ralkon made a submission to the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs which was conveyed to the Aboriginal Development Commission requesting that the land held by the Aboriginal Development Commission be transferred to it if necessary by purchase with adequate safeguards imposed to ensure that any public funding was properly protected. This transfer would enable long term development of the land to take place for the benefit of the aboriginal residents at Point McLeay. On the 23rd March 1981 the Aboriginal Development Commission without reference to Ralkon and the people of Point McLeay offered a lease of the land to the Point McLeay Community Council. </PARA>
<PARA> On the 28th March 1981 an election was held for the Point McLeay Community Council and after the election the Council reflected the views of the Point McLeay residents. At a number of Council meetings during March, April and May 1981 the Council resolved to reject all agreements between the previous Council and the Aboriginal Development Commission and requested that the farm land be transferred to Ralkon. </PARA>
<PARA> On the 29th May 1981 I visited Canberra with the Chairman of the Council to discuss this matter with Mr Perkins who stated there was nothing wrong with the company's Articles of Association and if the company could show that it could manage the farm the Aboriginal Development Commission would look to giving freehold title in the land. A majority of the Point McLeay community signed a letter to the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs on the 12th June 1981 requesting that the Department should not interfere further in the activities of the Point McLeay people. This letter also requested that the land be transferred to Ralkon . </PARA>
<PARA> On the 27th July 1981 following further persuasion from the Aboriginal Development Commission the Council signed a lease with the Aboriginal Development Commission which endeavoured to exclude Ralkon from any farming operation in respect of the property. The Directors of Ralkon believe that this decision was made against the wishes of the majority of Point McLeay residents and have sought to have the matter raised at various levels to ensure that the wishes of the majority of people are carried into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The company has not caused any split amongst the people at Point McLeay. This split has been brought about by outsiders interfering in the affairs of the Point McLeay residents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Company has not unlawfully retained control of the farmlands at Point McLeay as on a number of occasions the community council have requested the Aboriginal Development Commission to transfer those lands to Ralkon. </PARA>
<PARA> Ralkon has managed the farming operation at a profit and has carried out proper accounting procedures, it has not refused an audit and it is not opposed to its account being audited. </PARA>
<PARA> The Directors of Ralkon who are all Aboriginals have been very happy with the management and assistance given by Mr Ian Hillock who has been the company manager for six years. Mr Hillock has, on a number of occasions, indicated that he would leave if so requested by the Directors but the Directors and shareholders have expressed their desire for him to stay and have been grateful for his continued support. The company is capable of managing the farm operation profitably and has sought to have the land transferred to it with appropriate controls to ensure the long term development of the land. The Aboriginal Development Commission has ignored the request of a majority of residents at Point McLeay to lease or transfer the land to Ralkon and has sought to impose its own will upon the people of Point McLeay. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours faithfully,  S. RIGNEY  Chairman Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA>I have endeavoured as quickly as possible to condense the problem that confronts us at present. I have no doubts that there was some communication between Senator Haines and the Council. It is regrettable that whoever initiated what arose here last Thursday-I have my suspicions but I will not make them known here tonight-took that action. It is quite obvious that certain people want to cover things up and will oppose all the way along the line any public inquiry into the problems that exist there. I am concerned about that because it was said in the telegram which Senator Haines read out that I was causing problems and that the residents were disturbed at the way in which I had attacked officers in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. All I have said about officers in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is on the record. At this stage I do not back away from it. From the information in my possession I could say many more things, but I am not prepared to do so at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Government will not agree to setting up a select committee, I make a humble request to the Senate that some means be found whereby the people on both sides of this problem and the officers of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs can get around the table and give evidence under oath so that we can get to the bottom of the problem. It goes back a long time. In 1975 the Labor Government paid for Bartlett's Farm, the property in question. That is on the record also. I repeat: I am sorry that I talked the people who came to see me initially out of making this matter public. They included Bill Koolmatrie and Andy Sumner. Both of those gentlemen are now dead, but three of those people are still alive. I have exercised the only means I know to get an inquiry into this problem. I only wish it could be held so that the whole matter could be laid to rest. As I said last Thursday and as Senator Peter Baume said, 'in emotional remarks', during debate on the Appropriation Bills, I wish the people who live down there could get together and farm that property for what it is worth. I am sure that the people there will be happy if only we, the legislators of this country-the people who have the means available to do something about it-can give them the assistance they deserve. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that what I have said here tonight will be read by Senator Haines. As I said to her in the corridor after she spoke the other night, if she wants any further information I suggest that she talk to Bob Randall and get his views, not mine. She should get an independent point of view from him because he is on the opposite side of the fence. She should talk to Bill Nankivell who was the member for Mallee, which electorate encompasses this property. I have said before and I say again that Bill is a man for whom I have very great respect. He was the chairman of the consultative committee. I have letters on file from him, as I am sure Senator Peter Baume has-I know that he wrote to Senator Peter Baume -pointing out the problems that exist between the company, the Council and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. So it is not only my word. Two ex-Liberal members of parliament have taken up the cudgels for these people. Like me, they have been prepared to put their heads on the block and probably get them kicked in by people who are not fully conversant with the problems that exist. I am sure that, before an inquiry was set up, if Senator Peter Baume were to approach Bill Nankivell and Bob Randall and the people on the consultative committee-Mr Wayne Sanders, for instance, is a well respected farmer in the district down there-they would be prepared to come and talk to him. In future let us try to keep this out of the public arena. Let us have an inquiry into it and see if we cannot settle the problem for those very worthwhile people at Point McLeay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I think I should mention to Senator McLaren, through you, that I also received a telegram signed by Mr Rankin. I received it after the Senate rose the other night and I was not able to disclose its existence at that time. It may be advisable to seek to have it incorporated in Hansard. I think it is in the same words as the telegram received by Senator Haines. But rather than read it out, it might be appropriate to incorporate it. I think it adds nothing to what was already in the Hansard record. It would give Senator McLaren and others , in developing this issue, a chance to see what was sent to me. I seek leave to have the telegram incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Senator Peter Baume</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House, Canberra</PARA>
<PARA> As Chairman of the Point McLeay Community Council and as a representative of the Point McLeay Aboriginal Community over the past twenty years I strongly deplore the political antics and ill informed grandstanding on Aboriginal matters by Senator McLaren in the Senate as reported in Hansard dated 17th November 1982. Senator McLarens views are biased towards a minority faction and certainly do not reflect the beliefs of my council or that of many Aboriginal people within this community. Senator McLarens unsubstantiated attacks on hardworking and longserving officers of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Aboriginal Development Commission which he so vigorously castigates are totally unwarranted and certainly devisive in our relationships with these Departments. The senators savour would be better channelled to more useful purposes from the Aboriginal Development Commission was a direct response to resolutions passed by my council seeking support in its endeavours to regain control and use of its lease holdings upon which Ralkon Agricutural Co. has continued to occupy in defiance of all previous attempts by my council to remove a small faction that occupies council lands to the detriment of the Council and the Aboriginal Community as a whole. I particularly bring to your notice that in 1974 I originated the concept of a farming project on council lands and as a result of this concept the council negotiated the purchase of Bartletts Farm through the then known commission (now A.D.C.) to compliment existing council farm lands. It was never intended that the farms management be other than as a sub-committee to the council and under the direct control of the council for the general benefit of the Point McLeay Aboriginal Community. The dispute between the Council and Ralkon Agricultural Co. is of many years standing and is currently the subject of litigation. Therefore these intrusions by Senator McLaren can only be harmful to the settlement of the dispute. Clarification of many issues now the subject of litigation can be obtained by reading the Commonwealth Ombudsmans Report on the dispute and to which document I respectfully refer you. </PARA>
<PARA>H. J. RANKINE J.P.  Chairman Point McLeay Community Council</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I responded to Mr Rankine and I will read the letter. It is very brief. It reads as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thank you for the telegram you sent to the Parliament where I received it on 25 November 1982. You may know that your telegram was raised in the Senate on the Adjournment Debate and I listened carefully to the remarks that were made.</PARA>
<PARA> You will know that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs have agreed that I should handle, at Ministerial level, all matters within government that relate to the Point McLeay Community Council and its relations with the Ralkon Agricultural Company. I therefore regard your telegram as an important input and will seek advice from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs on the matters which you have raised. </PARA>
<PARA> I remain,</PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely  PETER BAUME</PARA>
<PARA>That went out on 29 November. I read that only to advise Senator McLaren of the action that I have taken for the reasons which he will know. The difficulty about this whole matter is that it all depends onto whom one looks as being a reliable correspondent and who is regarded as being unreliable. That involves value judgments and I think Senator McLaren has made that clear in what he has said today. It involves value judgments by the particular listener and that bedevils an appreciation of what is going on at Point McLeay. The issue really is that there are three Aboriginal groups in conflict one with the other. There is the Aboriginal Development Commission, which has the title to the piece of land in dispute; the Point McLeay Community Council; and the Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd, which is of but separate from the Point McLeay Community Council. There is no pleasure for us that that situation should exist but the three groups are locked in conflict and that conflict has become deep and bitter. It seems to me that the available judicial processes, through the courts, through the Ombudsman, through other kinds of existing processes of a judicial nature, are being used and that they represent the proper way to resolve the matter. I believe that it may be difficult to try to interpose non-Aboriginal white politicians into what is a difficult situation between three Aboriginal groups and to have us try to sit as judges-no matter how good our motives are-in a matter which is a conflict between three Aboriginal groups. It is really quite difficult in terms of our whole approach to self-determination and self- management. Also, I think it is fraught with danger as to whether it would resolve the problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Like Senator McLaren, I have been to Point McLeay. I have not been there nearly as often as he has but I was there in 1974 and again in 1981 when I was there as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. On that latter visit there was a meeting with the community and we discussed some of the issues involving the Ralkon Agricultural Co. and the community and some other matters. I had the occasion then to meet Mr Probyn and to meet Mr Hillock. I must say, just to put it on the record, that I formed a very positive view of Mr Probyn and the response of the community to him at that meeting. That is just an impression I gained at a meeting and, I must say, in the context of the meeting-this may have nothing to do with the management of the farm-I found Mr Hillock difficult to deal with. But I think he might have felt under some pressure or under attack and he responded in a rather prickly way at the meeting. That is as may be. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the honourable senator has asked a number of questions in relation to where people live, whether they draw travelling allowance and so on. I undertake to try to get that information for him and let him know. As to whether there is a white bookkeeper, I shall find that information for him. But I must say that it is not unusual for Aboriginal communities to employ non- Aboriginal skills if that will help in the running of an enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said all that, I come back to the point that this is a very unfortunate situation. It is unfortunate for Aboriginal people and for Aboriginal advancement in that area. It is a conflict between three Aboriginal groups, and we who are non-Aboriginal, though we are concerned and worried, are outsiders looking in, not quite sure how to resolve it. With the best will in the world, I am not sure that the mechanism suggested by my senatorial colleague will be appropriate in the circumstances that I have outlined. Nevertheless, I shall read very carefully in Hansard what he said. Like him, I should like nothing more than to see the whole situation resolved to the satisfaction of all the parties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) The schedules of tax instalments incorporate a loading to allow for payment of leave bonuses without deduction of instalments at the time of payment , and another loading to cover tax on small amounts of income not subject to tax instalments and not subject to provisional tax. In addition, the amounts payable in the schedules are calculated on the basis of the top of each step of earnings . The leave bonus loading generally compensates for the payment of the bonuses ( which of course are assessable) without further instalments being deducted at the time of payment. However, if the other adjustments had not been made in the design of the schedule, 1981-82 PAYE collections could have been expected to fall short of the estimate by about $200m. That amount would, of course, have to be collected in 1982-83.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) If PAYE tax instalments had been adjusted to reflect the rebate allowable for basic health insurance contributions, it is estimated that 1981-82 PAYE collections would have been $370m less.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Reductions in 1981-82 PAYE collections as in (1) would have been expected to result in corresponding increases in the budget deficit and reductions in the Budget domestic surplus for 1981-82.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2947" SPEAKER="Guilfoyle Sen The Hon Dame M.G.C." NAMEID="6D7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="SA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The McCabe-Lafranchi report disclosed information in respect of 923 Victorian companies which, it was asserted, indicated that the companies were ' dumped' and their taxation liability thereby avoided or evaded. It was also asserted that as many as 3,000 companies were involved in this kind of stripping arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA> The secrecy provisions of the income tax law prohibit the Commissioner of Taxation from commenting on the affairs of specific persons and consequently comment in respect of the alleged activities of B. Maher is not possible. However, the Commissioner has advised that his officers are looking into the affairs of over 4,000 companies of which some 3,500 have been identified as having been stripped of pre-tax profits before the enactment of the Crimes ( Taxation Offences) Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As disclosed in the Treasurer's press release of 27 June 1982, which commented on the McCabe-Lafranchi report, a case of company stripping came to the attention of the Australian Taxation Office early in 1973.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) The Treasurer's Press release of 27 June 1982 indicated that the Australian Taxation Office referred a representative case to the Crown Law authorities for the institution of proceedings against persons associated with the stripping of the company. The role of the Crown Law authorities in such cases is to examine the matter and to determine whether a prosecution should be initiated. In relation to the various possible actions considered, the Crown Law advice was to the effect that there was insufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case or that no substantial benefit was likely to result from prosecution proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Crown Law authorities later re-examined the relevant facts and law and the question of launching prosecutions is again under consideration. A Special Prosecutor is to be appointed for the purpose of taking action against those responsible for company stripping operations.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Statistics are not readily available of the total number of companies that have been subjected to some degree of investigation action. However, at least 15 representative cases were investigated at length and steps were taken towards the possible institution of legal proceedings with a view to the recovery of unpaid tax and/or the prosecution of offences. The cases were representative of various factual situations involving companies with pre-tax profits being effectively stripped of all valuable assets and being left with tax liabilities unpaid. The Commissioner's practice in dealing with wide-spread scheme cases is to investigate selected cases of a representative kind so that the substantive issues can be resolved and the decisions used as precedents in other cases.</PARA>
<PARA> (6), (7) and (8) The secrecy provisions of that law prohibit the Commissioner from commenting on the affairs of the specific taxpayers mentioned or on specific actions taken regarding those affairs. However, the Commissioner has advised that, without agreeing that the assertions made are accurate, he is of the view that the actions outlined in reply to questions (3), (4) and (5) represent an adequate and proper response to the general situation.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) As indicated in the Treasurer's press release in May 1978 the Commissioner of Taxation brought to the Treasurer's attention the apparent need for criminal penalties to deal with practices which resulted in companies being denuded of assets and consequently being placed in a position of being unable to pay any taxation liability. The Australian Taxation Office put proposals to the Treasurer once it became aware that stripping of pre-taxed company profits was occurring on a wide scale.</PARA>
<PARA> During the period from May 1978 to November 1980 there was considerable reserve and caution within the Government as to whether the proposed criminal penalties were really appropriate and as a consequence further effort was devoted to establishing whether or not some method of coping with the problem could be found without resort to specific criminal penalties.</PARA>
<PARA> In deciding to present this legislation to the Parliament the Government also had the benefit of advice from its Taxation Advisory Committee and following presentation of the Bill many representations were received stating that the introduction of criminal penalties was an over-reaction on the Government's part . In the final analysis, the Government came to the conclusion that there was really no alternative but to enact specific criminal penalties.</PARA>
<PARA> The processes leading to the introduction of the legislation were, of necessity , detailed and time-consuming but, as was stated by the Treasurer, from his own point of view and that of the Government there was no avoidable delay.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The New South Wales Government imposes a royalty of 4 per cent of ex-mine value on sapphire production in that State. The Queensland Government imposes a royalty of 5 per cent of the value of production of saphires in excess of $10, 000.</PARA>
<PARA> The position with respect to Commonwealth taxation is that if a non-resident purchases goods in Australia, at current ruling prices, so as to process and sell the goods outside Australia, the profits arising from the processing and sale do not have their source here and no liability for Australian income tax can arise in respect of these profits. See also part (3) as regards sales tax.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The available information indicates that the sapphires are generally sold by way of direct bargaining between the parties. The seller is not forced to accept any particular offer by the buyer.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There is no sales tax on goods, including rough gemstones, that are exported from Australia. If, after cutting and polishing in an overseas country, the gemstones are reimported into Australia for sale here, they are liable to sales tax at the rate currently of 32 1/2 per cent, as is the case for locally cut and polished gemstones.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (2) (3) and (4) In the administration of the policy as it applies to rural property acquisition, it is the practice to establish firstly that a property has been advertised or otherwise offered for sale in a way normal for the industry so that any interested Australian purchasers have the opportunity to bid for it. If this is established, approval would normally be restricted to the following types of proposals: Those where the purchaser has firm plans to establish residence in Australia; those which offer significant economic benefits; and those where the economic benefits are small but which provide for an effective partnership (usually a 50/50 partnership) between Australian investors and the foreign investors in the ownership and control of the property .</PARA>
<PARA> In March 1982 the Government, on the recommendation of the Foreign Investment Review Board, decided that a proposal for Eastlorden Pty Limited, a company wholly owned by a Japanese resident, to acquire from the Higgins family a property known as Leslie and located near Warwick, Queensland, was not consistent with its foreign investment policy. Whilst Leslie had been unsuccessfully offered for sale to Australians, it was noted that the venture involved neither an intending migrant nor any Australian participation and it was considered that the project did not appear likely to offer significant economic benefits. The parties were advised of the government's decision. Subsequently the vendors, the Higgins family who I understand had owned the land for over a century, sought reconsideration of the decision because the family was experiencing difficult circumstances. It was in the light of those cirumstances and the fact that it had been unsuccessfuly offered for sale to Australians that the Government decided to approve the purchase by Eastlorden.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The FIRB was informed that Eastlorden intended to spend moneys on improving the property and to use it to fatten cattle, and grow vegetables and grains, specialised fruit crops and seedling trees.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) New South Wales-Dingoes are declared noxious. The owner or occupier is responsible to suppress and destroy (Pasture Protection Act). The Crown is not bound by the Act and dingoes are protected in the National Parks and Wildlife Service areas although there is some control where there are problems on adjoining land.</PARA>
<PARA> Queensland-Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> South Australia-The dingo is classified as a vertebrate pest but management policy requires eradication only in the southern (sheep) half of the State, and control only when numbers become excessive in northern (cattle) half of State.</PARA>
<PARA> Victoria-Yes. In the wild state the dingo is classed as vermin and land owners are obliged to destroy vermin on their land.</PARA>
<PARA> Western Australia-The dingo is classified as a declared animal. An obligation is placed on landholders to reduce their numbers and keep them under control. There is no requirement for total eradication. State policy dictates that control takes place only on and adjacent to pastoral sheep properties. Elsewhere little or no control is practised. Dingoes are not under threat from man's activities on vacant crown land and cattle properties in pastoral areas.</PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania-Dingoes do not occur in the State.</PARA>
<PARA> Northern Territory-Dingoes are protected in Arnhemland and on parks and reserves. They are classified as unprotected wildlife outside these areas. They are not classified as noxious and there is no obligation on landholders to destroy wild dogs.</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Capital Territory-The dingo is not classified as noxious.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There is no evidence of any large scale export of dingo pelts. State and Territory Wildlife Authorities and Vermin Control Authorities consulted are not aware of such activity in their jurisdictions. The Australian Bureau of Statistics maintains statistics on the export of dingo pelts subsumed under the classification for dog hides and skins. It advises that for the 12 months ended June 1982 no exports were recorded under this classification.</PARA>
<PARA> The CSIRO advises that there is strong evidence from studies by the Division of Wildlife Research that there has been cross-breeding with domestic dogs in the wild in south-eastern Australia, but very little was detected from central Australia. The degree of cross-breeding is probably related to the closeness of human settlements and possibly to the continual exercise of control measures for dingoes. Whether cross-breeding will proceed to the extent that the dingo proper is bred out in any locality is unknown.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) A total cost of dingo control programs in Australia is not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The CSIRO advises that there are indications from its studies that predation by dingoes may help keep down populations of some vertebrate pests at times. However, more research is required to decide the issue, especially the stage in the population fluctuations of prey when predation is most effective. Studies in central Australia indicated that dingoes may have kept rabbit and rodent numbers low for a year of so after those prey populations had declined during drought. In parts of Kosciusko National Park it is possible also that dingoes have kept feral pig numbers low. There are reports that in several parts of Australia feral pigs and wallabies have become noticeably more numerous after successful dingo baiting campaigns. CSIRO has not studied these situations to verify if this is true.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Studies carried out by the CSIRO Division of Wildlife Research on the biology of dingoes indicate that few dingoes, if any, live in the very large areas in central Queensland, New South Wales and southern South Australia which are protected by the dingo fence. A study is underway to assess the status of dingoes in Victoria. Further inland and in northern Australia populations of dingoes fluctuate naturally, except when control measures are occasionally imposed. There is no indication that the dingo is an endangered species at present.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The protection of wildlife is principally a matter for the State and Territory governments. Various State and Northern Territory governments have considered declaring the dingo a protected animal but have declined to do so. However, the animal is protected in most national parks and reserves and in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) It is an offence to kill dingoes in the Australian Capital Territory, and in Uluru and Kakadu National Parks which are managed by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service for the Commonwealth Government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The legislation now before the Parliament which introduces the tax on bank account debits provides that an account on which cheques may be drawn that is operated by a local government authority will be exempt from the tax unless:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the sole or principal function of the Authority is to carry on an activity in the nature of a business; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) debits to the account are made in connection with a business activity carried on by the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) As noted, local government authorities generally will not be subject to the tax on bank account debits in respect of their local government functions. As regards the two other measures mentioned by the honourable senator, evidence available to the Commonwealth suggests that their financial impact on local governments will not be serious when set in the broader context of the Commonwealth's increased overall assistance to local government.</PARA>
<PARA> As illustration of the increased level of Commonwealth assistance, $27m will be made available under the ABRD Program in 1982-83 to assist the upgrading of local road systems. When combined with the funds already being provided under the Road Grants Act 1981, this will bring the total Commonwealth contribution for local roads to about $200m, an increase of some 24 per cent over the 1981-82 allocation.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1983-84 a further $51.6m will be made available for local roads under the ABRD Program.</PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that in recent years, the Commonwealth has provided increases, in real terms, in general revenue assistance to the States, the Northern Territory and local governments. Local government has been allocated over $420m in 1982-83 (an increase of 21 per cent over 1981-82) under the Commonwealth's 2 per cent personal income tax sharing arrangement and are, of course, free to spend this allocation on road works to the extent that to do so would accord with their own priorities.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Gold Coast City Council has made representations to me to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Local government authorities will be generally exempt from the tax on bank account debits in respect of their governmental functions and, for the reasons outlined above, it would be inappropriate to exclude them from the two other measures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the generality of cases the income tax law permits a deduction for the amount actually paid by a taxpayer in respect of subscriptions to a trade union or professional association.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a specific provision in the Income Tax Assessment Act, section 73, which limits the deduction for subscriptions to a trade union or professional association to $42, an amount which was last fixed in 1960. Some years ago, however, a Taxation Board of Review expressed the view that subscriptions by employee taxpayers to trade unions and professional associations qualified for deduction under section 51 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Section 51 is a general provision which allows income tax deductions for losses and outgoings incurred in gaining or producing assessable income other than losses of a capital, private or domestic nature. The Taxation Board of Review expressed the opinion that subscriptions to trade unions and professional associations clearly fall within the operation of the section.</PARA>
<PARA> Ever since that decision it has been the Commissioner's practice to allow deductions to employee taxpayers for subscriptions to trade unions and professional associations under section 51. For this purpose it has not been necessary, nor is it now necessary, to increase the limits specified in section 73.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 August 1982 (Hansard, page 392) Senator Missen asked the Attorney-General the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question relates to the work and future plans of Australia's Human Rights Commission which commenced operations in December 1981. Because of the important role which it was envisaged the Commission would play in the advancement of human rights in Australia, I ask whether it is correct, firstly, that there are no plans to locate any of the 28 officers who have commenced, or will shortly commence, work with the Commission outside of Canberra; secondly, that the Queensland and Western Australian governments have applied pressure to prevent the opening of offices in those two States; thirdly, that one Human Rights Commissioner recently told a meeting in Perth that so far 60 per cent to 70 per cent of complaints could not be handled by the Commission as they related to State matters? If this statement is correct, in the light of our obligations under the Covenant, what action is the Federal Government taking to persuade State governments to establish State Human Rights Commissions?</PARA>
<PARA> The Acting Attorney-General has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Human Rights Commission has a staffing complement of 25 full time and 6 part time persons. This includes 3 officers posted in the States-one in Sydney and one in Melbourne, who were formerly part of the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations and are now officers of the Commission and one officer in Perth. The present establishment for the Commission is designed to provide it with a headquarters staff in Canberra. Staffing in the States will depend upon arrangements still under negotiation with the States and their agencies for co-operative action, particularly in the handling of complaints. The Commission's headquarters staff includes a small group of conciliation officers who spend a good deal of time on tour investigating complaints. Such a team has recently been involved in lengthy visits to Northern New South Wales and Queensland. During a substantial part of one of those visits, the team included a member of the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not aware of any pressure applied by either the Queensland or Western Australian governments to prevent the opening of offices in those States. In fact an office is now operating in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Attorney-General mentioned in his interim reply to the honourable senator's questions, the figures the honourable senator quotes in regard to complaints which could not be handled by the Commission relate to the first month or two of its operations. The Commission has advised that an analysis of its human rights complaints to 30 June 1982 shows that some 25 per cent were outside jurisdiction because they related to State matters (a further 30 per cent were outside jurisdiction because they related to rights not covered in the Commission's Charter).</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not taken any particular action to persuade State governments to establish State Human Rights Commissions. However all States are aware of the wish of the Human Rights Commission to co-operate with them or their agencies for the better protection of human rights and discussions have been continuing since the establishment of the Commission to this end.</PARA>

<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no substance to the honourable senator's suggestion that there was political manipulation of the Budget figures on the last day of 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> The event to which he may have been referring was the coincidence of the last day in the financial year of 1981-82 with the normal schedule of payment of salaries of Commonwealth Public Service employees and some social security payments. The due date for these payments was Thursday 1 July 1982. In accordance with normal practice as laid down in the Finance Directions made pursuant to the Audit Act 1901, these payments (estimated in total at $430m) were debited to the Government's accounts on Wednesday 30 June. Accordingly, they were recorded as expenditure in the financial year 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> To the extent that the payments were made by cheque there would be, as usual, some delay between the time that the cheques were written and when they were presented for payment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 September 1982 (Hansard, page 683) Senator Hamer asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning the Commonwealth Grants Commission's inquiry into State tax sharing relativities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The general review recently completed by the Commonwealth Grants Commission was the first comprehensive review of the relative distribution of general revenue assistance among the States to be published. Previous reviews have been conducted by the Commonwealth Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA> In terms of reference transmitted in June 1978, the Grants Commission was asked to consider the appropriateness of the relative distribution of States' tax sharing funds on the basis of the principle of fiscal equalisation. This principle seeks to ensure that tax sharing grants are distributed among States so as to enable each State to have the fiscal capacity to provide a standard level of services without having to impose taxes and charges appreciably different from those generally imposed by other States.</PARA>
<PARA> Following an extensive inquiry and two reports, the Grants Commission came to the view that a change was desirable in the then existing State tax sharing relativities.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's 1982 assessments were the subject of discussions between the Commonwealth and the States at a Premiers' Conference held on 24-25 June 1982. At this Conference, the Commonwealth and the States settled upon new tax sharing relativities based largely on the acceptance of the Commission's findings.</PARA>
<PARA> The relativities preferred by the Grants Commission were only modified in one respect. It was decided not to offset against their tax sharing grants any financial gain accruing to South Australia and Tasmania as a result of their hospital cost-sharing agreements with the Commonwealth. These States are entitled to keep any such gains until 1984-85 by virtue of Clause 7.1 of these agreements which stipulates that any above-average per capita cost-sharing grants paid to them are not to be offset by the Commonwealth against general revenue payments to those States. The Commission chose not to take into account the legal entitlement of these States, as it regarded it as a matter for decision between the Commonwealth and the States.</PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the new arrangements settled at the Premiers' Conference was the decision to phase in the relativities as modified over a period of three years in conjunction with a guarantee that no State would receive less than a specified real terms increase in its grants in any of these years. This took account of the fact that immediate implementation of the new relativities would have involved some States receiving significantly smaller grants. This was acknowledged by the Commission itself as constituting a case for phasing in any new relativities over three years.</PARA>
<PARA> The agreed relativities will apply in 1984-85 except to the extent that they turn out to be modified by the application of the real terms guarantee in that year.</PARA>

<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that the allegation of inaction contained in the statement is inaccurate. The fact is that the Australian Taxation Office took the initiative in getting information from the Corporate Affairs Commission regarding the tax schemes and has been pursuing action under the taxation and other laws for a considerable time. The Commissioner also advised that taxation officers regularly use the facilities of the Corporate Affairs Commission and enjoy a good day-to-day working relationship with officers of the Commission.

<PARA> Market research has shown that the majority of customers are aware of the special Commonwealth, State and local government sections in the front of the directories. Many entries are lengthy and the repetition of the complete entry in the body of the directory instead of a cross-reference to the special section would be very costly.

<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. By way of preface I refer to the disturbing evidence received in relation to Christmas Island and the inability of the Phosphate Commission to meet its share of the bargain in relation to booby bird habitat conservation. In view of the evidence that was received by Estimates Committee B, will the Minister undertake that upon the return of Mr McVeigh from the Cocos (Keeling) Islands expedition he will convey to him our concern in relation to the worsening of the position in view of the clear-cut environment program that was presented to the House earlier in the form of a report?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> During 1979 and 1980 a survey of the distribution and status of the Abbott's Booby on Christmas Island was conducted under the auspices of the British Phosphate Commissioners who were then responsible for the Island's mining operations. During the course of that survey and while the results were being appraised, a moratorium was placed on jungle clearing in all areas west of survey grid line 90,000E.</PARA>
<PARA> The results of the survey of the survey were assessed by an expert panel comprising Professor J. D. Ovington, Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, Professor J. M. Cullen of the Zoology Department, Monash University, Melbourne, and Dr J. B. Nelson of the Zoology Department, University of Aberdeen, the world's leading expert on the Abbott's Booby. The recommendations made by the expert panel were accepted by the Government and the Government's plans for the preservation of the Abbott's Booby were announced on 4 February 1982. Under management option 6 recommended by the expert panel, and accepted by the Government, some areas have been excluded from mining and revised mining plans are to be adopted in respect of other areas. Under this option, over 97 per cent of nesting sites recorded during the two year survey will be protected.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Government decided that guidelines for jungle clearing and rehabilitation would be incorporated in territorial legislation. Those guidelines have been agreed between the parties and I am assured that they are being adhered to pending the preparation of appropriate legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> In their joint statement of 4 February 1982, the Ministers for Administrative Services and for Home Affairs and Environment emphasised that, coupled with restraints on mining, a monitoring program of the breeding success of Abbott's Booby would be implemented so that protection of the bird and the continuation of mining could be jointly reviewed on a continuing basis. A program has been developed by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (ANPWS) and agreed to by the Phosphate Mining Company of Christmas Island (PMCI).</PARA>
<PARA> I need to correct Senator Mulvihill's misapprehension about the PMCI's contribution to the program. The PMCI has been and remains ready to meet its share of the bargain.</PARA>
<PARA> I am taking steps to ensure that the program commences as scheduled in March 1983.</PARA>

<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has received a number of representations from the Queensland Government and other State governments concerning, inter alia, the exclusion of State railways from the scope of the diesel fuel excise rebate scheme announced in the 1982-83 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister is replying to the Premiers' representations but, as such correspondence is of a confidential nature, it would be inappropriate for it to be publicly released.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the last part of the honourable senator's question, the Queensland Railways are now paying 6.155 cents per litre on excise on their diesel fuel. In that respect, they are treated the same as all other industries outside the scope of the rebate scheme announced in the Budget, including other transport such as road transport and coastal shipping.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has withdrawn exempt status from some diesel users (including State railways) as one of a number of steps towards reducing its reliance for revenue on personal income tax through a modest broadening and deepening of the indirect tax base.</PARA>
<PARA> The total cost of the excise on diesel fuel to Queensland Railways will be a function of its future fuel usage, which the Commonwealth is not in a position to estimate.</PARA>
<PARA> Of the 6.155 cents per litre excise on motor spirit and distillate, 1 per cent per litre is a surcharge for 1982-83, the proceeds of which will be paid into a special trust fund to finance expenditure totalling $150m in 1982-83 on special road and urban transport projects under the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Program. The Government sees the Program as a major initiative to bring about a lasting improvement in the road and transport system of the nation by 1988.</PARA>
<PARA> While the Government will monitor carefully the overall operation of the diesel excise arrangements, and has noted many representations to broaden the scope of the rebate, it recognises that any such moves would narrow the revenue base from which, among other things, the ABRD Program is to be funded.</PARA>

<PARA> I direct my question to the Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General. Is it correct that, since the Commonwealth first proposed the establishment of a national crimes commission many months ago, no State or Territory has supported the proposal in its present form; the States and the Northern Territory have acknowledged that there is a serious problem of organised crime which ought to be tackled as a matter of priority; and both the Australian Police Ministers Council and the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General have approached the matter very positively and have, in accordance with their own initiative and the direction of the June Premiers Conference, undertaken detailed consideration of a number of options? Is it correct that at a joint meeting of the Australian Police Ministers Council and the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General on 24 September substantial progress was made and there was substantial consensus on the kind of structure which might be established to deal with the problems, and that at that meeting it was agreed that further work would be undertaken by officers prior to another joint meeting to finalise an agreement? Finally, is it correct that, notwithstanding the extensive process of consultation and negotiation which has been undertaken between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory in relation to a crimes commission, and notwithstanding a substantial measure of consensus, the Commonwealth proposes to proceed with the establishment of a Commonwealth crimes commission in the current session, having now unilaterally suspended further meaningful discussion with the States? Why has the Federal Government taken such action and what was the purpose of the negotiations and discussions in the first place? Were the States misled about the seriousness of these meetings?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> From the inception of its proposal for a National Crimes Commission, the Commonwealth has been very conscious of the desirability of involving the States and the Northern Territory in this national effort to combat organised crime. There has been a growing awareness on the part of the States and the Northern Territory of the problem represented by organised crime and the Commonwealth has welcomed the interest of the States and the Northern Territory and their participation in a series of discussions on this subject.</PARA>
<PARA> At a joint meeting of Police Ministers and Attorneys-General on 24 September 1982 the States put forward an alternative to the National Crimes Commission proposal of the Commonwealth. This alternative involved the establishment of ad hoc royal commissions, possibly co-ordinated by the Office of Special Commissions and the upgrading of the ABCI. Commonwealth Ministers agreed to give further consideration to this suggestion although making it clear that, for the time being, the Commonwealth maintained its position.</PARA>
<PARA> After giving serious consideration to this possible course, the Commonwealth concluded that in the interest of an effective fight against organised crime, the Commonwealth must continue with its proposal for a National Crimes Commission; at the same time it decided that provision should be made in the legislation for participation by the States and the Northern Territory in several possible modes. The National Crimes Commission Bill introduced on 21 October 1982 makes this provision. Discussions have continued with some States at officer level on the subject and the Government moved certain amendments to the Bill to accommodate particular concerns of some States to the Bill as introduced.</PARA>
<PARA> So far from unilaterally terminating discussions with the States, the Commonwealth is anxious to continue such discussions with a view to reaching appropriate arrangements for State participation in the fight against organised crime.</PARA>

Could the Minister inform the Senate how these figures are arrived at, who decides which costs are included in the basket and whether the Australian Bureau of Statistics could publish a detailed analysis of all costs included in the calculation of the CPI and explain which are influenced by State or Federal government decisions?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following supplementary information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Statistician is responsible for producing the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and for determining its composition and method of construction.</PARA>
<PARA> The Statistician recently published an up-dated version of a booklet 'A Guide to the Consumer Price Index' which describes how the CPI is constructed and includes details of the areas of expenditure included in the index, the relative weighting assigned to each in compiling the index, and information on the goods and services for which prices are collected. Copies of the Guide are available in the Parliamentary Library.</PARA>
<PARA> A large proportion of the items included in the CPI are influenced to some extent, directly or indirectly, by changes in State or Federal government taxes and charges. A number of government charges which are paid directly by consumers are represented in the index, among them: government-owned dwelling rents; electricity; postal and telephone charges; motor vehicle registration; and rail fares.</PARA>
<PARA> Because changes in prices from one period to another usually reflect a combination of various effects, such as changes in costs, profit margins and government taxes and charges, it is generally not possible to separate the different effects with any degree of accuracy. For this reason, the Australian Bureau of Statistics considers that it is not possible to quantify the overall impact of State or Federal government decisions upon the Consumer Price Index.</PARA>

<PARA> The Acting Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is appreciative of the work done by Mr Grassby during the seven years in which he occupied the position of Commissioner for Community Relations . However, the Government believes that the nature of the position requires a change of occupant after several years so that new ideas can be injected into the work. Mr J. Long, a former Deputy Secretary in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, has been appointed to the office.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 November 1982 (Hansard, page 2032) Senator Gietzelt asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning an International Monetary Fund loan to South Africa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> On 3 November 1982, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF) approved a request by South Africa for two drawings totalling SDR1,000m from the Fund.</PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the approval of these drawings, the United Nations General Assembly had forwarded a resolution to the IMF stating that the drawing should not be permitted in the light of the policy of apartheid in South Africa. Australia abstained from the vote on this resolution.</PARA>
<PARA> The IMF is a specialised agency of the United Nations. Under the terms of its Relationship Agreement with the United Nations it is, and is required to function as, an independent international organisation, and accordingly is not bound to implement recommendations of the UN General Assembly.</PARA>
<PARA> The IMF considers requests for drawings in terms of its Articles of Agreement. The conditions of eligibility attaching to drawings from the IMF, as set down in the Articles, are essentially financial and economic in nature. The Articles do not provide for the withholding of a member's access to IMF resources for reasons of the domestic, social or political policies of the member.</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with usual IMF procedure, the Executive Board's decision on the South African drawing was reached on a consensus basis. No vote was taken.</PARA>
<PARA> It is relevant to point that, although there is an Australian Executive Director on the Board, he also represents eight other countries apart from Australia. Thus, any views the Director may put forward on matters coming before the Board will not necessarily be those of the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government remains firmly opposed to the system of apartheid and is ready to lend its support to internationally supported measures which will exert effective pressure on the South African regime to change its policies. In this regard, we appreciate the objections which many countries have to the provision of financial support to South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government respects the legal independence of international financial institutions, such as the IMF. The Government has no basis for objecting to the South African drawing given the terms of the Fund's Articles of Agreement and given the terms of the Fund's Relationship Agreement with the United Nations.</PARA>
