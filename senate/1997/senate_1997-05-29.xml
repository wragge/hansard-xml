<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is just over a year since the Senate disallowed the government's regulation to remove the Commonwealth government responsibility for controlling the export of some of Australia's most important commodities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arguments that were made by the opposition last year to maintain Commonwealth controls, the arguments that I made in the chamber at that time, I believe are still valid today. I think they are in fact more powerful when they are considered in the context of the Howard government's woeful mismanagement of the environment over the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3946"> past 14 months. The Senate made it clear last year that it did not support the abandoning of export controls on alumina, bauxite, mineral sands, coal and liquefied natural gas. I must say, since that time, the government has done nothing that would convince us that the removal of export controls is a responsible action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition maintains its support for export controls at the Commonwealth level for three very important reasons. Firstly, there have been a number of occasions in the past where the Commonwealth powers over export licences have led to improved prices offered for our exports. That is true particularly for coal. At various times, previous resources ministers have secured better returns for Australia's minerals by refusing to approve licences until the industry obtained a better price.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the opposition believes that there is a very important role for the Commonwealth government in resource planning. In our view, it is not in the national interest to have these matters and responsibilities entirely in the hands of the states. There must be some level of input from the Commonwealth government. While we concede that export control powers are a clumsy mechanism, we do believe that they are better than no mechanism at all. Until the Commonwealth government develops an alternative means of ensuring that the Commonwealth has a role, the opposition will not support the removal of export controls from these minerals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the removal of Commonwealth export controls over these minerals has enormous consequences for the management of Australia's environment. It is this responsibility for the Australian environment which I believe the Howard government would be only too happy to relinquish. I would remind the Senate that the Commonwealth's control over the export of mineral sand products enabled the Fraser government to ban sandmining developments on Fraser Island in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this government's policy, the Commonwealth would have no power to step in and act as it did in the case of Fraser
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Island, unless some other piece of legislation, such as the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act or the Australian Heritage Commission Act happened to apply.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the case of Fraser Island, that is true. It is a world heritage listed property; that is true, Senator Parer. But you have to get your chronology right and you have to get your history right in relation to this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I would make to Senator Parer is that they are limited in themselves. Both those mechanisms are limited. In relation to the Australian Heritage Commission Act, it can be effective only if the Commonwealth minister or a Commonwealth department or agency is involved and, of course, only if the relevant proposal satisfies the criterion that it might affect to a significant extent part of the national estate. I think most senators would appreciate that it can be very difficult to prove that criterion prior to the commencement of a mining activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act, that is also limited, because currently there are only 11  properties that are inscribed on the world heritage list. The World Heritage Properties Conservation Act of course is limited to protecting those areas. When the previous Labor administration moved to use powers under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act, this government&mdash;the current government&mdash;of course opposed the previous Labor administration tooth and nail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You see, Senator Parer, you have got real form on this. I must say that it is no surprise  that the opposition cannot have any faith in the government in relation to its commitment to protecting Australia's environment. I do acknowledge, Senator Parer, that you, as the Minister for Resources and Energy, are the de facto environment minister for Australia. I do acknowledge that. I think it is unfortunate that the current Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) appears unwilling or unable to play the traditional role of custodian and protector of the environment in this country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3947">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I made those points in a debate on a similar disallowance motion last year, and they still stand today. The points are still valid. Senators would recall that during the debate last year the resources minister, Senator Parer, made the remarkable assertion that the previous Fraser government's use of the export control powers to protect Fraser Island was, to quote Senator Parer, `an abuse of power'. That is exactly what you said.

But we do not believe that the blanket removal of liquefied natural gas from Commonwealth export controls is the appropriate way to resolve that difficulty in relation to LNG on the North&hyphen;West Shelf.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3948">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is inappropriate for this government to request that the Senate relinquish its powers over the export of important commodities without the government first implementing alternative mechanisms to ensure that the environment is protected and without proposing alternative mechanisms for resource planning. Until we see those alternative mechanisms to ensure the environment is protected, resource planning is undertaken and the prices our mineral exports receive on the world market are as high as possible, we will be absolutely unwilling to remove these export controls. In the absence of any alternative mechanism proposed by government, the Senate has little choice but to reaffirm the position it took last year. It is for that reason that I am proposing to disallow these regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Export controls on minerals are important for environmental and economic reasons, and they should be maintained. The government's determination to abolish these controls is based, in my view, on mainly sectional interests. It is not based on the national interest.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am specifically looking at minerals here, Minister. I believe it is crucial, it is critical, that the Commonwealth retain this mechanism&mdash;a mechanism that has in the past been so important, as Senator Faulkner has already said. Who in this chamber is going to stand up today and say that Fraser Island really should have been a sandmine? Indeed, as we look at the decision of the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, to protect Fraser Island&mdash;it is now a world heritage area&mdash;he looks incredibly enlightened
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> compared to this government and its actions here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Senator Parer's last speech on this issue&mdash;I presume we are going to get a similar speech today&mdash;he characterised the actions of this place as basically an abuse of power. I characterise this government's failure to protect the environment as a gross dereliction of duty. Senator Parer also argued that export controls were an inadequate mechanism for environment protection. But what is he suggesting replaces it? State management? Hopefully not. Thanks, but no thanks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our concerns about the ability or willingness of the states to protect the environment are precisely why we want to keep what limited power the Commonwealth has, why we want to keep these controls in place. State legislation has been shown over and over again to be inadequate to the task. Indeed, federal legislation is often not up to the task. The Democrats argue that we must put in place better mechanisms, particularly mechanisms that involve community consultation, so that we can protect this country for future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year Senator Parer also stated that export controls would remain on uranium for environment and heritage purposes. So what are we saying here? That somehow the area around a uranium mine is inherently of more importance and needs protection, needs a mechanism, and not other areas? I suggest he look at some of the devastation caused in other areas by other mining activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has made no changes to these regulations since we rejected them last year. Indeed, I would suggest that their reintroduction is quite arrogant. Perhaps the  minister was hoping that nobody would notice, that they would slip quietly through this place without anybody noticing what the government was up to. The only thing that has really changed with these regulations since they were rejected is the government's record on the environment. I would argue that that is on a steady downhill spiral.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is no way the Democrats are going to change their mind, their stance. That is because of our concerns about the whittling
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3949"> away, the erosion of, the ignoring and the subverting of, the way this government can find ways through and around, environment protection powers. That is why we are moving to establish the Senate committee inquiry into Commonwealth powers to look at the balance between state, local and federal government powers on the environment&mdash;to find where the cracks are, where the buck&hyphen;passing is able to be used as an excuse for not protecting the environment. So at this point in time, taking away a Commonwealth power is the last thing we are going to be interested in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government said that it is not interested in the Senate inquiry because it is off reviewing environment powers on its own. Perhaps that is part of what is going on behind the scenes. Maybe they are, Senator Faulkner, reviewing environment powers out the back on the quiet. I think that is a major concern for all of us. It makes the Democrats fear for the worst as to where this government is pushing the ability to control environmental damage in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I believe this government is trying yet again to get through regulations which it knows will tie one hand behind its back, which it knows will make it easier to buck&hyphen;pass, to pass it off on to the states. These regulations would abolish an important mechanism by which we can, even if not perfectly, at least offer some environment protection. The reintroduction of these regulations makes the intention of this government crystal clear. I hope the Senate will reject them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So here we are, acting like we are from another century, trying to throw away what is&mdash;yes&mdash;considered to be not a particularly adequate protection but&mdash;yes&mdash;one of the few that still exists within the Commonwealth legislative provisions, and the government is trying to throw it away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Parer interjected earlier on and said we have had 22 years of environmental laws since these regulations were first put in. Well yes; however, he overrules them all. He has actually made a point of overruling environmental laws on every occasion that I can think of in recent times. So we have an environment minister who has been gagged or who does not wish to speak up, we have ministers who want to push resource extraction at the expense of everything else&mdash;and we are being told that the Commonwealth no longer wants this overseeing capacity through the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations. It is not good enough, and I think the Senate, in this instance, will be the voice of the majority of citizens of Australia if this disallowance is carried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in Australia believe governments have a role to play in protecting the environment. In fact, until ecological sustainability is a right of citizenship under the constitution, this Senate has an obligation to stand up on every single occasion when this government is trying to turn its back on its environmental responsibility, and speak up for what I believe the majority of the citizens of this country demand of governments. When you see the EPAC surveys, that is what people are saying. They do believe that governments have an important role and they do believe that spending on environment should actually be increased rather than decreased, because that is what they pay their taxpayers' money for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, I strongly support the disallowance motion today, and I certainly hope that we are not here again next year trying to do

I suppose what we are really doing is retaining that power for some future government which will be responsible about the environment. In the meantime it is left to the Senate to a degree in this parliament and to the community watchdog organisations to fight as best they can against the excesses of those corporations which do the wrong thing in the pursuit of profit, when the environment must be taken into account as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a goodly number of mechanisms for the government to protect the environment. I think both the Labor and Liberal parties have fallen well short of utilisation of those mechanisms.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just cover some of the points that I think are worth making. The original export controls were introduced by the Whitlam government because they believed that they could somehow control the price on world markets. I was very much involved with that. It was an abject failure from go to whoa. It not only was a failure but cost this country, I would say in retrospect, billions of dollars and thousands of jobs. I will tell you why. Let us take them one by one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coal industry is our biggest export industry, about $8 billion or a bit more. It is a fifty-fifty split between coking coal and steaming coal, coking coal going to the world's steel industry. The advent of export controls and the heavy-handed approach, I might say, taken by the then minister, Mr Connor, were such that countries such as
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Japan and Korea were forced to diversify their supplies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year I had the opportunity to go to Korea to talk to all the various groups involved with purchasing out of Australia. It was very interesting that one of the persons I spoke to who has no axe to grind anymore was the chief purchasing officer for Pohang Iron and Steel. When I mentioned to him that we were looking at getting rid of export controls, he came over and he actually shook me by the hand&mdash;he is now retired. He said to me, `Do you know that, if you had not had export controls, we would be importing from Australia about 70 per cent or 80 per cent of the materials required for our steel mills rather than 50 per cent?' So they diversified into the United States, not a very good investment, I agree, but they were prepared to pay that cost of diversification because of the very existence of export controls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same thing happened with Japan. Japan invested in Canadian mines at great cost to themselves. Again, they were prepared to pay that additional money to diversify. It was an insurance policy. So export controls are not just symbolic in the coal industry. If people in this chamber are interested in increasing our export income, if they are interested in addressing our foreign debt, if they are interested in creating more real jobs, you would at least expect they would say, `Let's do this for the coal industry.' Obviously there is no interest. There is some ideological thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hypocrisy of the Labor Party is that they themselves removed export controls. Export controls now apply in the absence of uranium to only four minerals. What is the difference between coal, bauxite alumina, iron ore, copper and manganese? I ask you that question. It is just nonsensical. It does not make any sense. They have the freedom to go and make arrangements without the possibility  of some hostile government sometime down the track holding them to ransom. If you are a country, if you are a buyer, that has no inherent materials to feed your steel mills, or whatever, you are concerned that this thing sits there not in a symbolic sense but in a real sense that could some day cause problems.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner talked about the environment. Let us take the coal industry. What did he do in government? What did his government do? I will tell you what they did. They accredited the states to do the environmental impact assessment under the intergovernmental agreement on the environment&mdash;a sensible decision, done very quietly. It is one which I agree with, and it has worked. But you still have the stupidity, as happened to me last year, with a mine in New South Wales that had been going for 19 or 20 years that was shut down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moonie was the name of the mine and it was resurrected. Nothing had changed. I was

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next one is bauxite alumina. The reason for the bauxite alumina had nothing to do with the environment and it still does not. What it was all about&mdash;and I have heard Senator Brown talk about this&mdash;was transfer pricing. That is the reason it was there. With the passage of time what has happened is that transfer pricing is now under the control of the taxation department. The role of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy is to act as an honest broker so that the taxation department does not go too far and there is some sort of balance. With the removal of export controls on bauxite alumina, at the request of the industry, that process will continue to occur. That is the way it operates  right now; it really has nothing to do with export controls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the environment, as I mentioned, the original introduction of controls was based on price. The government of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3953"> day somehow thought that the industry was not capable of doing its own pricing. I can recall, because I was in the industry at the time, coming to talk to the head of the department on a price settlement with the Japanese. We spent two days talking, not about the price but about the sort of wording that would sound all right once it got out into the arena.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was also pointed out to me by senior officials at the time that, `This is a fragile flower.' Of course it is a fragile flower. Could you imagine any government knocking back a major contract with countries such as Japan or Korea? The industry, as it tends to do and always will I would imagine, tries to work with incumbent governments. We did at the time. But it was always a charade. So that was the original intent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mechanism introduced by the Commonwealth Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act had the effect of adding an environmental consideration to the ministerial decision making process in relation to the controls. The original Commonwealth environmental legislation was introduced because of the concern of the government of the day that state and territory governments did not have in place adequate environmental legislation. The Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, the Australian Heritage Commission Act, the Endangered Species Protection Act and the World Heritage legislation were all passed after the introduction of export controls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 22 years since 1974, state and territory governments have put in place strong environmental legislation. This has been recognised in the intergovernmental agreement on the environment. It is what the previous government did. The agreement provides for full faith and credit to be given to state environmental processes and aims to streamline the process. The intergovernmental agreement is, in fact, a creation of the previous government. This government honours the commitments made by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was an efficient way of doing things. It removed duplication. Even on the mineral sands side, the previous government went
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> down the route of approving basically life of mine processes. I have no objection to that. But what we are saying here&mdash;as I think the Leader of the Opposition said&mdash;is that improved price is nonsense. It never worked and it never will. A lot of pretence went on and the net result of it all was that it cost this country and it is continuing to cost this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, officers of my department were in Taiwan. They have a requirement over there that they will only import 35 per cent out of Australia. Underlying that is the uncertainty that exists because of the very existence of these export controls. Hence the remark I made early in the piece: they are not just symbolic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner claimed there are no alternative mechanisms. There are a series of mechanisms in place and you know that, Senator Faulkner. You know we have environmental laws federally that we did not have many years ago. You know the states have environmental laws they did not have years ago. You know they are working&mdash;that is why you accredited them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My plea is for the Senate to oppose the opposition's disallowance motion because&mdash;and I have no axe to grind&mdash;I have a power I do not want. The reason I do not want it is that I believe it is to the detriment of our industry, it is to the detriment of the nation and it is against employment in this country. I would like to reiterate, because of the misnomer that came through from a lot of the debate today that export controls apply to all minerals: they do not. They only apply to those in the regulations&mdash;namely, coal, liquefied natural gas, bauxite alumina and mineral sands. They do not apply to any other mineral. They used to; right back in the beginning they applied to every mineral. But, with the passage of time, they have been eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask again: what is the difference between mines for coal or bauxite or iron ore or zinc  or manganese or copper? At least you would expect the opposition, after its term in government, would have some sense of balance. Instead, they have lost the plot. There is no commonsense in their opposition to this,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3954"> although there might be something ideological about it. I know, for example, that the CFMEU, over many years, wanted to maintain the export controls. This was not for the environment; rather in their own hearts they thought that it might be the vehicle to set up a marketing authority. The previous government, quite correctly, would not have a bar of a marketing authority. I can remember a famous story about former Senator Walsh being approached by them saying, `This would be a good idea. We think you should start a marketing authority.' In the typical Walsh fashion, my recollection is that he threw them out. But that was the intent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say that neither the previous government nor any future government is going to introduce a marketing authority for the coal industry. The CFMEU probably understands that. There no logic behind the Labor opposition opposing this regulation unless it is still there as some sort of an icon for the CFMEU and when they yell Senator Faulkner says, `How high?'</PARA></SPEECH>

It is a little rough having those allegations made by the Howard government whose record on the environment and export controls would be one of concern to very many Australians. This is the government that went to the last election after Mr Howard and the then environment spokesman, Senator Kemp,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> traipsed through a forest in Victoria and promised the world to those who were interested in the environment in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What have they delivered? A record level of export woodchips; all but given the green light to uranium mining adjacent to the world heritage Kakadu National Park; given Hinchinbrook the go ahead; made cuts to energy efficiency; and stated its position in relation to greenhouse gas emissions, the control of greenhouse gas emissions and the issue of climate change in the international community. This is the same government that has cut the environment budget by $55 million over three years and has dramatically slashed core environment funding when it promised something very different through the National Heritage Trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear from Senator Parer that the opposition is hypocritical. But I would have thought that senators in this chamber and many outside this chamber have every reason to be concerned at the hypocrisy of this government and the way they deceived the Australian people prior to the election in relation to their environment commitment&mdash;the way that Senator Brown correctly has described some in the environment movement as being conned by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said very frankly and honestly in my earlier contribution proposing that these regulations be disallowed that we see the export controls as an inadequate mechanism for environmental protection in this country. I do not resile from that. I acknowledge their deficiency, but in so many areas it is the only opportunity the Commonwealth government has to exercise its judgment and its responsibilities in relation to the protection of Australia's environment. I do not accept that state governments in Australia have the necessary level of the environmental commitment that is required for the protection of the Australian environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that the former Labor administration put in place many mechanisms, including  as Senator Parer says the intergovernmental agreement on the environment and a raft of legislation to ensure that Australia's environment is protected. But you never saw the previous Labor administration proposing that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3955"> these export controls be lifted, because we acknowledged their importance in this area&mdash;however inadequate and however deficient they might be. We believe it is important that the Commonwealth government have a role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that this would be a retrograde step for the Commonwealth if it were to abolish these export controls. It would have serious consequences for the protection of the Australian environment. The only objective and rational conclusion that we can come to, having seen the performance of this government in office and its lack of environmental commitment, is that the Commonwealth has to hold on to every power it has to protect the environment.

<PARA STYLE="Para">In moving this disallowance motion, can I say that I do not do this lightly. I do not like moving disallowance motions in relation to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3956"> regulations, particularly in respect of the forest industry, but I am doing this because the government has reneged on a number of very important aspects of the national forest policy statement. Before I go too much further, I wish to say that I understand Senator Harradine will be moving an amendment to my motion, and I indicate that that is acceptable from my point of view. As I said, the reason I am moving this disallowance motion on behalf of Senator Brown and me is that the government has reneged on a whole range of areas that are associated with the development and implementation of the national forest policy statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I just go to the national forest policy statement itself and the vision that it had&mdash;a vision that was signed on to by all of the state governments ultimately. The statement of vision said there would be development, including:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A range of sustainable forest based industries founded on excellence and innovation will be expanding to contribute further to regional and national economic and employment growth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In relation to wood production and industry development, the statement said that the national goal was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . for Australia to develop internationally competitive and ecologically sustainable wood production and wood products industries. Efficient industries based on maximising value adding opportunities and efficient use of wood resources will provide the basis for expansion in wood products manufacturing which in turn will provide national and regional economic benefits.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I very much agree with those objectives. Also, the national forest policy statement committed state governments on the issue of wood pricing and allocation by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State governments will encourage the use of logs for their highest net value end use.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In terms of wood production and community service obligations, the statement said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To effectively account for these different responsibilities, the costs of meeting community service obligations and commercial wood operations should be clearly separated and accurately reported. In this way, the governments and the community will be able to determine the commercial and community service performance of the forest services in accordance with the stated management objectives.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A very important part of the national forest policy statement was the plan to implement a wood and paper industry strategy. As part of that, the previous government and this government committed themselves to the setting up of a Wood and Paper Industry Council that would be representative of all stakeholders. It, in turn, would develop strategies, look at market opportunities for the forest industry and hopefully drive and head the industry towards having a stronger manufacturing base in this country. That would satisfy the intent of the national forest policy statement&mdash;that is, more economic and employment benefits for regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just like to read a couple of letters. The first one is dated 17 July 1996 and is written by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr Moore, and addressed to Mr Trevor Smith, the national secretary of the Forest and Forest Products Division of the CFMEU. This letter is a response to a letter Mr Smith sent to the government about his concerns relating to the development and implementation of a wood and paper industry strategy. Mr Moore's letter says in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 13 June 1996 concerning the implementation of the wood and paper industry strategy. The government has endorsed the strategy which includes a $38 million package to promote development of internationally competitive wood and paper industries based on ecological sustainable management practices. The strategy is complementary to the development of regional forest agreements and the forest industry structural adjustment package which will create resource security for the industry and facilitate restructuring. It will help to create a stable policy environment allowing industry to confidently plan and invest in value added activities. The government recognises the importance of effective communication between all stakeholders and to this end is currently reviewing the consultative arrangements covering the major forest issues. Details are expected to be finalised in the near future and, once the new arrangements are put in place, I am sure that they will ensure the wood and paper industry makes a  significant contribution to the economic development of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then there is a letter from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet signed by Mr Phillip Glyde, the assistant secretary of the forests task force. Again, this letter is addressed to Mr Smith, the national secretary of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3957"> the Forest and Forest Products Division of the CFMEU. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Trevor</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of July 16, 1996, concerning stakeholder participation in progressing the comprehensive regional assessment process and the wood and paper industry strategy. The Commonwealth is committed to the effective involvement of key national stakeholders, including the CFMEU, in the implementation of the national forest policy statement and the wood paper industry strategy. Ministers are currently considering options to facilitate meaningful stakeholder involvement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">it is very important to note that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have forwarded your views to the ministers responsible for developing stakeholder participation mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A letter dated 11 September 1996, again to Trevor Smith, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing in relation to your appointment to the Wood and Paper Industry Council which was announced on 29 January 1996. The government has made a commitment to expedite the implementation of the national forest policy statement. The government has also endorsed the four-year wood and paper industry strategy as an important part of its forest policy objectives. Consultative arrangements in the forest industries and wood and paper sectors are currently subject to a comprehensive review and it is anticipated that new arrangements will soon be finalised. As part of this review&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">this is the really surprising part&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Wood and Paper Industry Council has been abolished.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government made a very clear commitment prior to the election to continue to implement the national forest policy statement in accordance with the previous government's program. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to thank you for your willingness to serve on this body and I hope the government will be able to call on your knowledge and expertise at another time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There still has been no advancement with respect to the Wood and Paper Industry Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the principal reasons that I have moved this disallowance motion is that the government has failed to act. In recent supplementary estimates I asked some questions of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy with regard to the involvement of an industry development strategy and how it was being linked into or fed into the RFA, regional forest agreement, process. They were
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unable to explain that to me, yet they have principal responsibility for the development of regional forest agreements that have as a very important part of them an underlying commitment, indeed a principal commitment, to ensure that forest based resources are used in a way that will benefit employment and thus the community from both an economic and a social point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that around this country employment is significantly declining. In my own home state it is particularly difficult. We have the highest unemployment rate in Australia. In its forest based industry there are significant opportunities for the creation of jobs but, because no progress has been made and no initiative taken to develop a proper strategy, one that will lead to the creation of employment, the jobs in the industry continue to decline.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as an indication of some of the things that have happened, on a number of occasions in the Senate I have criticised not only aspects of the national forest policy statement and the progress of it but particularly certain companies which have come up with a plethora of proposals for downstream processing when they have applied for and been issued with woodchip export licences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Labor was last in government, in the issuing of licences some importance was placed on downstream processing and a commitment being given to downstream processing over the long term in either paper manufacturing or sawmilling and processing of timber. I criticised a number of companies but two in particular: North Forest Products and Boral. I made particular points about both of them but referred to Boral specifically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said some time ago in this place that that company had put up straw man proposals for $160 million worth of development. The company wrote to me after I made those statements in the Senate and accused me of being dishonest and said they were very committed to implementing those proposals. Indeed, they requested that I have a meeting with them so that they could explain to me exactly how committed they were.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3958">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had the meeting, and I understood their concerns and they made their point. I indicated to them at the time that when I saw the first sod of soil turned I would accept their position but until that time I would continue to express my views and concerns in relation to companies coming to government and saying they are going to do this and that and then nothing happens. That has really been the history of companies seeking export licences. And, of course, what did Boral do just recently? They announced that they were scrapping the $160 million worth of proposals they had put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to refer to a person who has sought to purchase resource from the Tasmanian Forestry Commission. He was going to proceed&mdash;indeed, he actually built one sawmill&mdash;and could have employed 35 people. But he was told by the commission that there was no resource. I have here a document dated 2 June 1994, a little while ago now, from the Tasmanian Forestry Commission relating to an assessment of wood&mdash;that is, logs&mdash;going to three woodchip mills. This person was seeking to purchase wood which has now become known as category 8 sawlogs. This document was signed by a Tasmanian Forestry Commission officer, and it says in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The assessments have been continued for the last six months with the following results&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and this is to identify what has become known as category 8 sawlogs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Triabunna&mdash;13 per cent&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">of the total volume going into that mill could meet the specifications for category 8 sawlogs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Longreach&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10 per cent</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">which is a railway siding but a location for the dumping of logs that are then railed to the Longreach mill&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Forty per cent of the resource that was destined for the woodchip mill had been identi

<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="BROWN" NAMEID="QD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator Brown</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Shayne, will you incorporate that letter?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I may well seek to have that letter incorporated, Mr Acting Deputy President. I want to also refer to a letter of 5 May 1994 to a company called Asia Pacific Resources. The company had written to the Forestry Commission seeking to purchase category 2 sawlogs. The letter in response to that in part says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 20 April 1994, about crown category 2 eucalypt sawlog tenders. Your position with respect to category 2 sawlogs is acknowledged. However, you should be aware that the market for sawn timber has improved considerably and it is likely that all category 2 sawlogs offered in the recent tenders will be placed within the existing sawmilling industry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The problem with that letter is that Forestry Tasmania, formerly the Forestry Commission of Tasmania, has never been able to tell even its own state parliament the amount of category 2 sawlogs that are produced. When the forest is harvested, the commission makes an assessment of the type of wood that will come out of the coupe. It will categorise the wood as category 1, category 2 and pulpwood. It has never been able to identify&mdash;which I believe is untrue&mdash;the volume of category 2 sawlogs. It says, `We sell some 50,000 cubic metres per annum,' but probably three or four times that amount is produced. Every state in Australia, bar Tasmania, has a capacity to identify those volumes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rule of thumb generally applied across this country in terms of cutting trees out of the bush is that with top grade sawlogs, being category 1 in Tasmania, the ratio for the next category down will be two for one. That is the accepted rule of thumb ratio&mdash;two for one. In Tasmania we cut approximately 300,000 cubic metres of category 1 sawlog. So one could say, `Even to be conservative,  even if we say the ratio is one for one, we ought to produce around 300,000 cubic metres of category 2 sawlog.' But the Forestry Tasmania has never sold more than 80,000 cubic metres of category 2 sawlog&mdash;never.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3959">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the state parliament, the commission went through a scrutiny process like our estimates process. When it was asked to identify the volume produced, it said, `We can't identify that because sometimes the specifications go up and sometimes they go down.'</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kemp, you say it is very repetitive. You, as the Assistant Treasurer, ought to be very interested in generating jobs in regional Australia. I know that you are not, so it does not really matter. All of those things are then, I suppose, issues for debate; but they are the facts. We know in our own region of the world that, with regard to hardwood sawn timber products, there is a shortage. Indeed, I have the main findings of a most recent report prepared by Margules Groome Poyry for ABARE which looks at the Tasmanian forest industry growth potential to 2010 and 2020. This was part of the RFA process. With regard to hardwood sawn timber products, it says just these things. But we did not need this report, because there are any number of reports that will indicate the same thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Within the Asia-Pacific region, because of the overcutting of their hardwood forests, their exports will continue to decline and indeed they will become net importers of hardwood sawn timber products. We know there is a huge shortfall already. We have a real capacity to actually supply some of that market&mdash;maybe not a lot of it, but certainly we can supply a reasonable amount of it. That will in itself create many thousands of jobs in rural and regional Australia. So we ought to be trying to head the industry in a direction that at least, if we are going to have a forest industry and we are going to utilise resources from the forest, maximises the resources to the best of our ability and ensures that we deliver the best social outcome and the best economic outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I got a letter from the country sawmillers in Tasmania today. They would be under more pressure than anyone else with regard to supporting me and a motion I moved to disallow regulations. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note your notice of motion to disallow Minister Anderson's regulations to remove all controls over
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> woodchip exports. It would seem that we share a common point of view on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So they have a position. They are concerned about it because it does have a real potential impact on their future. For very good reasons, I urge senators to support the disallowance motion. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="3959" TIME="11.13 a.m." SPEAKER="Brown, Sen Bob" NAMEID="QD4" ELECTORATE="TAS" PARTY="AG" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME><STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(11.13 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion, which is now jointly hosted by Senator Murphy and me, brings together the interests of people working in the industry, as we have just heard&mdash;the sawmilling industry itself and environmentalists. What is happening here is that the government is moving to lift the lid on any control of the export of unprocessed timber out of this country. The control authority moves out of this parliament and out of the responsibility of the ministerial offices in this parliament to the head offices of the big woodchip companies in Australia&mdash;in Melbourne, in Sydney and in Perth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not good management. That is not what the Australian people want. That is not what the people working in the industry want. It may suit the profit lines of this resource extractive industry, but it is not in the interests of the people who own these forests&mdash;that is, the public of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say at the outset that, if these regulations were to go through&mdash;if this disallowance motion were not to succeed&mdash;the outcome would be that, as regional forest agreements are signed around the country, ministers will have no control mechanism over the export of whole logs and woodchips. With the support of Senator Harradine, already regulations have gone through to lift control on plantation forests in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This would immediately extend the lifting of regulations, as far as ministers are concerned, to East Gippsland, where a regional forest agreement&mdash;which comprehensively sold out the environment of the East Gippsland forests&mdash;was signed by Mr Howard and Mr Kennett earlier this year. After June or  July this year, it would also apply to the forests of Tasmania, to Victoria's central highlands and, a little further down the line, to the forests of Western Australia, where at the moment citizens in the forests&mdash;in the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3960"> Giblett block in particular&mdash;are trying to protect some of the most statuesque forests in the world from the very woodchip companies that these regulations hand control to. It is a remarkable affront that the government would present these regulations to the Senate and to people who have any sensitivity at all to the good management of the forests, let alone to the wild forest environment in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The negative effects on both the environment and jobs are obvious. I point out to the Senate that, for every 100,000 tonnes of sawlogs exported overseas, 1,000 Australian jobs go with them. Let me put that again to the three government members who are in the Senate: for every 100,000 tonnes of sawlogs exported, 1,000 Australian jobs are exported with them. Also, hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars, of value added profit are exported to the manufacturers in the Northern Hemisphere. So environmentally, economically and employment wise, opening the log and woodchip export industries to even greater export of jobs and profits is a stupid and irresponsible way for the management of our forests to be going. If allowed, the regulation would usher in an acceleration of the export of whole logs. As I have said, that already is being allowed to happen out of plantations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us see how the situation has changed recently. It is unsung to the wider public and unreported by the press gallery, nevertheless it is actively pursued by this government and was by the previous government. In 1992, North Forest Products in Tasmania began export of whole logs from its pine plantations in the north-west and promptly closed the Massey&hyphen;Greene  Sawmill.  It  now  exports 200,000 tonnes per annum. In 1994, a 1,100 tonne load of whole logs from native forests was exported from Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, earlier this year the government lifted the control on export of logs and chips from plantations irrespective of whether they were covered by a regional forest agreement. Some Tasmanians have been shocked by the news in recent months that there is even export of whole logs of Huon pine&mdash;the rarest and most valuable of Tasmania's rainforest timbers and which have grown for
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hundreds, if not thousands, of years by the rivers in the wetter areas of Tasmania. They are being exported as whole logs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is no investment in the future of the craft and high quality design industries which are special to Tasmania, which create jobs and which create enormous value added profit for the island state. As Senator Murphy has said, we have the highest rate of unemployment in the country. For these reasons, we do indeed need a wood and paper industry strategy as indicated in Senator Murphy's motion. I would like to move an amendment to Senator Murphy's motion. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Motion No. 2, paragraph (a), after `investment' add ,`in Australia's existing plantations'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I hope that the Senate will accept it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really need the concentration of this whole industry to be focused on the resource which is not only the resource of the future but is the existing wood resource in this country&mdash;that is, the plantations. That is where the jobs and investment ought to be from here on and into the future while we protect, as promised by past governments and this present government, the high conservation value and wilderness forests in the four states that are threatened by the woodchip industry in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has to be put across to many parliamentarians and then to the public that the plantation resource in this country is adequate for the whole of the nation's needs. In fact, it is in excess of Australia's needs. One of the driving components of the idea that we should be lifting the lid on any restrictions on the export of whole logs is that we have too much resource in our plantations to meet our domestic needs. Recent figures show that existing now in plantations&mdash;these are mature plantation sawlogs which have passed their commercial harvest dates&mdash;are 24 million cubic metres of sawlog timber. That is 2&half; times the annual cut of sawn timber from both native and plantation timbers right around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There is existing there, past its commercial cutting date in plantations in Australia at the moment, 2&half; times the nation's requirements on an annual basis for sawn timber. We can,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3961"> with our massive plantations beyond those coming to their commercial harvesting date, meet our nation's needs and, in fact, allow for expansion in the industry. The big woodchip companies know that. Entities like Forestry Tasmania, the former Forestry Commission of Tasmania, know that. But they want to continue to exploit at give away prices the native forests in Australia while continuing to make money out of those plantations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There should be management brought into this process. Eighty per cent of Australians want what is left of our wild forest protected. There is a government responsibility to meet that huge public impulse to protect our forests and to move across to the plantation forest base, which is not only adequate for the whole of the industry's needs but in excess of what the industry needs in 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I moved the amendment so that we would get, through a wood and paper industry council&mdash;to use Senator Murphy's words&mdash;a council to drive a wood and paper industry strategy and encourage industry development, downstream processing and investment in Australia's plantations. What we do not want to see is the past obscene drive by the big companies like Boral, North and Wesfarmers to continue to decimate the magnificent wild eucalypt forests and rainforests of this country. It is totally unwarranted. It cannot be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is irresponsible, whether one is looking at the country's environmental wellbeing for the future or whether one is looking at a long-term sustainable industry, which must be transformed into a plantation based industry immediately. The resource is there and we have no need to continue to maraud world heritage value, national heritage value, state significance value forests in Western Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales and indeed, if the industry has its way, Queensland as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recommend the minor amendment I have made. I support Senator Murphy's added clauses, which would cause the government to establish a wood and paper industry council. Of course, above all, I would support the disallowance motion whereby the Senate insists that the government maintain the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> responsibility to the elected people for the proper management of our forest and the protection in particular of Australia's wild forests, the wildlife and the ecosystems, which are there and which ought to be there for all future generations to enjoy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will be supporting this disallowance motion for two basic reasons: firstly, because, as Senator Murphy has said, it will further put jobs at risk and indeed, I believe, further ensure the loss of jobs in our forests and, secondly, because already we are seeing, and I speak here in particular about East Gippsland, the decimation of our old&hyphen;growth forests in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While parts of East Gippsland have been cut over and over for years, there are sections now on the Errinundra that they are deliberately cutting up. Basically, they are ringbarking the Errinundra National Park. The borders look something like an octopus. They are going up into areas they can barely get traction on just to make sure that the national park is never extended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will speak briefly today. I want to look firstly at what is happening and give some examples of the relationship between woodchipping and the loss of jobs that has occurred both in the southern forests of New South Wales and in East Gippsland since rampant woodchipping became the way our forests were being `used'. The head of NAFI, Dr Robert Bain, at a debate at Melbourne University a couple of years ago, admitted that 80 to 90 per cent of the logs coming out of East Gippsland were woodchipped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You only have to sit at the turn&hyphen;off to the mill on the Pacific Highway at Eden to see how many of those logs are of the type of category Senator Murphy was talking about. They are at least category 2 style logs. They are certainly logs that some of the small mills which have now closed down or are working with only person&mdash;because they cannot get access to logs in the forests; they are all going  to the woodchipping companies&mdash;could have actually used for timber, particularly with some of the timber that is sought after for furniture use. But, no, they are off to the mill.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3962">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at what the Victorian government is actually doing as a result of recent forest agreements, you will see that they still have not managed to sell all the timber they were hoping to sell, and the price is rapidly going down. Indeed, prices for woodchips have fallen 50 to 60 per cent&mdash;some suggest a little more than that&mdash;in the past 18 months. The Victorian government, it seems now&mdash;I have not found anyone who will refute this in the Victorian government&mdash;is trying to give away, virtually, at somewhere around 20c to $2 a tonne, our old&hyphen;growth forest in East Gippsland. Even a firewood permit is going to cost you $5, or if you are a pensioner, $3.60&mdash;a tonne. But they are offering it at even cheaper prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened to employment? We are now sending something like 40 per cent of our forests out as chips, but that 45 per cent of forests is only employing about two per cent of the work force. But at least the work force is having to put the logs onto the mill for the seven seconds it takes for them to be chipped. This regulation will allow those logs to be tipped straight into the hulls of the ships. So we would presume that even more logs will go and that even fewer people will be employed per coupe of forest that is destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not deal in this debate with any of the many other environmental issues other than to look at endangered species and the way threatened species are being dealt with in East Gippsland. Under the forest management plans we have now put in place, they are basically limited to zero population growth&mdash;or, if we look at many of the scientific papers, the most likely result is negative population growth. For instance, in the entire area protection is afforded to only 100 powerful, sooty and masked owls, about 50 tiger quolls, and 20 endangered Orbost spiny crayfish&mdash;apparently each of those are assumed to have a mate. Most scientists agree that the minimum number for long&hyphen;term genetic viability of this species is closer to 1,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The owls, in particular, do very badly. To make up the 100 owl sites to be protected, `pretend' owls have been mapped in areas
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> where there is no conflict with logging. In other words, if you have a national park, you can put an owl over there. The small number of real owls often receive smaller areas than are viable. They can, in many instances, still have their habitat logged in what are called `special management zones'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where a species is detected outside a park or reserve but within several kilometres of the boundary, it is assumed that the species will move, but I do not know how it can be encouraged to do so&mdash;presumably the department knows something we do not know. The species is presumed to have protection in the nearby reserve or national park. The fact that many of that species are already inhabiting that area hopefully and may, therefore, not accept newcomers is irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where real owls have been identified, after the imaginary owls have been given protection, the pretend owls are still given preference. I give one example here: the three threatened owl species of Martins Creek are ignored in favour of the department's strategically assumed owls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 500&hyphen;800 hectare site which may be reserved&mdash;if an owl is lucky enough to score protection&mdash;is, effectively, a circle or hoop put around the owl and it is kept around that owl until the owl finds its way to an area of forest that is not particularly wanted for logging. Then it is allowed to settle, and that area is marked off on a map as a protected area. Powerful owls have only 19 sites with an actual owl that receives the full 800 hectares in East Gippsland&mdash;and I stress that 800 hectares is believed by many to be far too small. Sooty owls have only 21 areas with actual owls that score the full and unloggable 500 hectares. Masked owls have only 12 sites with positively identified birds which lie fully within non&hyphen;logging zones of the required size.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could go on and talk about a range of other species. I will not do that today. I will simply say that, if we let these regulations through today, even more pressure will be put on these species than is on them currently. As I said before, the Victorian government is  trying to sell vast quantities of wood from their forests as quickly as they possibly can and as cheaply as is necessary to get rid of it.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3963"> These regulations will only help them in their task of destroying the forests.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is ironic that, in the lead&hyphen;up to World Environment Day 1997 we are seeing yet another example of the government's apparent lack of understanding of the issues involved. They do not seem to understand the issues of ecological sustainability and they do not seem to understand the issues of social sustainability in terms of industry policy and employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regulations we are debating would lead us to view Australia in a similar way to what we used to view countries like Burma or Borneo in relation to the pillage of whole logs from their forests. This is what we are seeing for Australia in 1997. We are not seeing a policy where what we are trying achieve in terms of the industry has been thought through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environment movement has been saying for some time&mdash;for years, in fact&mdash;that we were going to reach the point where woodchip prices would be depressed. We were always told, `It is not about the woodchip industry; it is about sawlogs.' However, the regulations that are before us prove that the policy on woodchips was not about sawlogs at all. It was about volume export of old growth forests which are assumed to belong to the companies. But they do not belong to the companies; they belong to the people of Australia. But we are still assuming that they belong to the companies, because we are saying that governments do not want to have control of what happens to the whole logs that come from our forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are exporting employment. We are going to reach a point where the companies can turn around and say, `We have got to continue to have access to old growth forest because we do not have the resources for other value&hyphen;adding from the existing plantations or agro&hyphen;forestry.' Certainly in Western Australia, we have got to have incentives for onward agro&hyphen;forestry. We have got to be looking forward. We have got to be looking at soil quality, water quality and the whole issue of ecological sustainability.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That phrase&mdash;`ecological sustainability'&mdash;is not necessarily understood by the government. This is also about social sustainability. It is about where we, as a nation, plan to be in 10, 20 or 30 years time and whether we want to be like Burma in the 1960s or 1970s. I think that is where this government thinks we ought to be&mdash;simply giving away our resources with very little control. We are going to have even fewer controls on such things as the multilateral agreement on investment in relation to the ownership of resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an assumption that these resources do not even belong to Australia&mdash;the indigenous people or the rest of the Australian people; that somehow they belong to the companies who want to come and exploit them for whatever lowest value bulk commodity they want. This is not good enough and, in the interests of the conservation of employment, of a strategy for industry in the future and of Australia's valuable forest eco&hyphen;systems, I strongly support the motion of disallowance.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we adjourned last, Senator Murray had asked me some questions with regard to shipping. I inform Senator Murray that the legislative basis for not collecting customs duties and excise on fuel used by a vessel on an international voyage is section 130 of the Customs Act. This exemption is longstanding practice and is understood to be consistent with international practice. Given that domestic legislation is not applicable to flagged foreign vessels in international waters, it is not appropriate to levy Australian taxes on fuel uplifted by vessels and to be used during an international voyage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1987 High Court decision in BP, Shell and the Collector WA confirmed that an international voyage from Australia required a vessel to be on a voyage to a place outside Australia. The consequence being that a vessel departing an Australian port for an area of water outside of Australia&mdash;for example, fishing grounds&mdash;irrespective of the distance travelled, has not undertaken an international  voyage and is not entitled to the exemption of customs duties and excise if it returns to Australia. Annex A(4) of the Kyoto convention deals with ship stores including the tax free treatment of fuel so long as it is not
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3967"> discharged. While Australia has acceded to the Kyoto convention, it is not a signatory to annex (4).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another point that I think is worth making with regard to excise on fishing vessels&mdash;that is, the amendment would actually deprive certain Australian fishing operators of the diesel fuel rebate. The point is that not all Australian fishing vessels are required to be on the Australian register, unless they make overseas voyages. As a result, a number of Australian fishing vessels are not on the register. Therefore, the amendment would prevent Australian fishing operators from receiving the benefit of the DFRS. I think you pointed this out, Senator, in your remarks, but the Japanese fishing vessels operating in international waters purchase duty free bunker oil and do not receive the DFRS, and the amendment would not result in these vessels paying excise.</PARA></SPEECH>

I really put it up as an amendment because I, and I think all parties, recognise that this is an unsatisfactory situation, where large numbers of foreign vessels are fishing in our territorial waters and are getting a taxpayer funded rebate which often is not available to our own people. We feel that the unsatisfactory nature of this situation, as I spelled out in my remarks the other day, does need to be addressed more carefully by government and that a way needs to be found to close the loophole because it does cost the taxpayer a lot of money.

My understanding is that, to use your term, a knock&hyphen;for&hyphen;knock policy is the case. What makes me recall it is that, when there was talk of the diesel rebate and getting rid of it for the fishing industry, I happened to be in Cairns. The fishing people up there told me at the time, `That's fine. We'll just move our operations to PNG where we won't have to pay it.' I presume that answers your question on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The answer I gave to Senator Murray was in relation to the claim made about international agreements. The Customs people have searched for that international agreement and have not been able to find one. That is the answer I gave to Senator Murray earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As regards Japanese fishing vessels, to a large extent this relates to that commission for the bluefin tuna. That is very important to this country in a number of respects. I am sure both the Democrats and the Greens are interested in that because it is part of the sustainable recovery of the tuna stocks. Year in, year out there are pretty tough negotiations that go on. But it is often not recognised that, when those quota figures are set, they cover not just Japanese fishing vessels or any vessels that are part of the commission operating in Australian waters but also those operating on the high seas. That is the importance of that commission for the southern bluefin tuna.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know I am deviating a little bit but it is important for tuna that we get the three other countries that are not currently involved with the commission involved with it. We have had discussions with them and they are at observer status. We are trying to get them to come into the commission. It is estimated that on port visits alone&mdash;and Senator Cook will be aware of this because it comes up on a year in, year out basis; perhaps not every year because last year the Japanese vessels boycotted the Western Australian ports&mdash;those vessels coming into our ports, mainly Fremantle and Hobart, generate in port about $40 million worth of expenditure.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment limits the rebate for fishing purposes to ships registered in Australia. This is a sensible action with regard to the problems of flags of convenience ships and potential situations where foreign crews are being used on foreign flag vessels by coastal fishing operations for the Australian market. The tax and customs and excise acts are in part designed to put political and social agendas into action. I know that the government does not understand this, but it is my understanding that that is why these acts are there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mining rebate is part of this and a conscious decision to offer incentives to this sort of production and foster and increase emphasis on mining. The acts are full of incentives and disincentives for various activities or to create certain social outcomes. It is entirely appropriate to use the rebate to support Australian registered fishing ships and consequently Australian crews operating under Australian industrial awards and conditions. I do wonder whenever I see amendments like this for how long it still will be possible to even conceive of this kind of action before various vested interests seek to use international agreements prohibiting discriminatory regulation of foreign investment or trade to try to overturn these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I imagine this might be challenged in the future under both the World Trade Organisation's trade related investment measures regime and the multilateral agreement on investment, of which we still have no details and about which the government said, `Trust us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a problem with this amendment. If we are legally bound, I do not think we can then move an amendment to a bill which tries to escape that legal binding by any international agreement. My problem arises in the first place because no-one is able to identify what that international agreement might be and in which way we are specifically legally bound. That is the first point in explaining my dilemma.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that there is a degree of legality and justice here. One of the amendments that we will come to shortly, time permitting, is an amendment lodged by the Labor Party which concerns offshore vessels for oil rigs. I remember starkly when I had  your responsibilities many years ago the Piper Alpha catastrophe in the North Sea when an oil rig was engulfed in a fire ball and blew up killing quite a number of people. As a consequence of that event, we reviewed offshore
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3970"> regulations for safety in Australia for offshore oil rigs and promulgated a regulation requiring a vessel to stand off an oil rig as a safety precaution in case there was a need for an emergency evacuation of that rig.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australian waters you can take the North West Shelf or the Bass Strait as examples where there are oil drilling platforms offshore. That is a safety requirement. I know the North West Shelf better than Bass Strait, so I would like to hold the example there. If a foreign owned fishing vessel calls into the port of Dampier and collects diesel fuel under this international agreement&mdash;that we have not yet sighted and are not clear about&mdash;it would get the rebate, but the operator of the oil rig requiring to send a vessel out to stand off the oil rig for safety precautions under Australian law would not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the legality of what we are talking about. My question is: is that justice? Is that fair? It strikes me that it is not. My dilemma is that I am not going to do anything that internationally would put us in a situation in which we could be accused of trying to escape our lawful obligations. Of course that would be wrong. If we are bound, we are bound, and then I think I am bound, ergo, to vote against the Democrats' amendment, no matter what sympathy I have with it. It would be an irksome task for me to do so, given what I think is a perceived lack of justice here if we cannot accommodate the Australian vessels in offshore positions whereby they are also required to be on station for safety purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do understand that it is quite a complicated and costly, to quote Senator Murray, bureaucratic process to get on the shipping register in order to qualify. I understand that that is complicated. To go to that argument for a minute, there is no reason why, in the face of that knowledge that we now have, we could not contemplate a further amendment to grandfather in or provide some way in which bona fide fishing vessels, which were not on the register but, nonetheless, operating in the appropriate way, could access this rebate. If we accept the terms that they have to be on the register, it is difficult. But, if you find a way of overriding that, it is less difficult. It
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is a question of what is fair at the end of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming back to the fundamental point for the Labor Party, if there is an international convention or agreement, we will vote with the government&mdash;that is, if we are bound by it. If we are not, I think this matter is then at large and we should consider our situation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were two further aspects before we draw my own remarks on this to a close. Yesterday or the day before when we were discussing this, I outlined that the way in which the diesel fuel rebate is dealt with is different from the way in which excise is either not charged or is refunded when it is a matter of international treaty. They are not one and the same pieces of legislation or treaty or requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicated to you that when an international vessel calls at an Australian port, they either get fuelled from an in&hyphen;bond excise&hyphen;free source or, if they pay excise, they get refunded the total amount. In contrast, diesel fuel rebate actually gets refunded slightly less than the excise. I wonder whether we are not getting confused between two separate provisions in the legislation that do not apply.</PARA></SPEECH>

Hence, if they are an international vessel coming in, they get it duty free anyway. As  you know, you either pay customs or excise. That is where it sits.</PARA>

As a consequence as well of the Senate inquiry, there have been further amendments. I just reiterate the point that I made at the Senate inquiry: it would have been far better if the government had got its house in order, presented to the Senate inquiry all of the amendments that it was wanting to make, the ones that it wished to withdraw and the ones that it wished to modify, so that the Senate committee could have had a look at what was in fact being proposed by the government, rather than a partial look at what the government was proposing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, it would be a bit of a dog&hyphen;in&hyphen;the&hyphen;manger approach for me if I were not to support this, because it is an improvement and it does mean that we are substituting a definition of minerals where `minerals naturally occurring formed by geological processes' is reinserted in favour of `minerals in any form'. I understand that encompasses, therefore, solar salt as a mineral for the purposes of this act and synthetic or other emeralds as part of the definition of minerals for the purposes of this act.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment will add the words `or limestone mined for minerals' after the words `for agricultural purposes', referring to limestone. I want to say a few things about this. This issue has been the subject of some hot contention between my colleague Senator Shayne Murphy and the minister at various times and yesterday we had another example of that as to whether or not Labor in government had in fact removed from the act the issue of limestone where it affects the cement industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the themes of our amendments will be to reinstitute within the act the eligibility of the cement industry for the rebate. We wish to reinstitute the eligibility of the cement industry for rebate because the cement industry mines limestone in order to get at the mineral calcinite, which is the principal ingredient in the manufacture of cement. I recognise that the government, in seeking to limit the cost of the rebate, has eliminated, by virtue of these amendments, the cement industry from eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue for us is that, by so doing, it imposes on the cement industry an input cost which translates to building and construction in Australia as a hidden tax, which means, as well, that our cement industry, in a more open, free trading environment, has a government imposed tax on it when foreign imports that contest the market with it do not have that tax imposed on them. As a consequence, our cement industry is put in some jeopardy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue here is: what is the nature of their activity? Going back to the argument between Senator Murphy and the minister, and in an effort to try to set the record straight, what Labor in government did was to insert in this act that quarrying was not an eligible activity, and we stand by that. The process by which you get at calcinite may be held by some to be quarrying, in which case the same process by which you might get at iron ore or coal in an open&hyphen;cut mining operation could also be held not to be classically mining but also quarrying. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in order to avoid that argument, what Labor in government did was to retain the words about extraction of minerals, and what is involved here is not limestone as the principal agent but the mineral calcinite as the principal mining objective.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me just complete my remarks then and I am sure that the minister will respond if he wishes to argue that I am wrong on a technical point. If I am wrong on a technical point, obviously, I would have to reconsider my position, but I do not believe that I am wrong on this technical point. The whole point therefore is that we see this as extraction for minerals and that that ought to be able, therefore, to render the cement industry eligible for the rebate. The purpose of this amendment would be to make that explicit within the act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I realise that the government has been through a process with the mining industry at the high-level negotiating group and negotiated a package. I am not aware that in that negotiation the cement industry were represented directly. At the end of the day an agreement was reached, but from what we know about the agreement&mdash;and there is controversy about the details of it even now, but leaving that aside&mdash;I think it is reasonable
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3973"> to say that a whole revolution was fought on the principle of no taxation without representation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the cement industry were not at the table and involved in the negotiation and their interests have been overlooked, in which case they are going to have to pay a tax when before they did not have to, I think they have a fair case to say that as they were not represented and their views were not properly considered in the negotiating process the government cannot therefore claim to have the endorsement of this industry or of all of the players in an agreement to extend the tax in the manner which they seem to be suggesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons&mdash;and because, by removal of the rebate, we would be imposing on this industry a tax which did not exist; because the government has not conducted, by its own admission, any study of the economic effect or the jobs and employment effect that that tax might have on this industry; because this industry is an essential industry to the national construction effort and a tax would be ergo a tax on housing or on buildings in construction; and because of the regional nature of this industry, which is a major employer certainly in Tasmania but also in other regional sectors around Australia, in my own state of Western Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia&mdash;I have moved this amendment and I trust that my colleagues in the minor parties and the Independents will support it even if the government will not embrace it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With cement it seems clear that it has been the government's intention to keep quarries and cement works out of the rebate scheme. This was absolutely clarified in 1995, and the current government addressed some issues of limestone quarrying for land care last year. Do you remember those reassurances? Now we see a further push to apply rebates to limestone quarrying. The argument is that cement production involves an extraction of a mineral from limestone but, regardless of rhetoric, nearly any mining may involve some measure of extraction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bluestone production may involve washing and screening, which, incidentally, eliminates
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> earth. Coal production involves almost no extraction of any mineral. In fact, there is no real principle in this legislation, just a set of included and excluded minerals&mdash;but I have said that before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We might be interested in a proposition that only extraction of ores which must be subsequently refined is considered as mining because it would eliminate coal or see it reclassified as quarrying. In such a case we might consider the claims of cement companies. As it is, the scheme may as well remain as it is. Cement and limestone extraction is basically excluded from the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the frustration of some other senators who see the illogic in the scheme and ask why coal mining should get a subsidy and cement and manufacture not. By the same logic, why not subsidise manufacturing industry? We export minerals; we export manufactured goods. I am certain we would export more manufactured goods if we gave manufacturing industries a billion dollars in fuel subsidies like we do to mining&mdash;and it would undoubtedly improve employment and the balance of trade figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree the mining rebate scheme is illogical but see no reason to subsidise yet another mining venture at taxpayers' expense. As my amendments indicated, I would like to have phased out the entire scheme. I will also indicate now that, for the same reason, the Greens (WA) will oppose ALP amendments 5 to 7 since we see no reason to extend the rebate to include processing of minerals that are only dressed, not beneficiated. As I said, the Greens (WA) will oppose the amendment. I believe Senator Brown will speak for himself and, as he represents Tasmania, he may have a different viewpoint, but viva democracy!</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Margetts: the illogic is flawless. We should not have this diesel fuel rebate, this billion dollar handout to the mining corporations. When Goliath Portland Cement from Railton in Tasmania came to see me about this, I made it clear to them that the Australian Greens were opposed to this rebate. However, the government has the support of the opposition and therefore the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3974"> numbers to enable this rebate to continue. That being the case, I find it quite an artificial cut-off that limestone mining in Tasmania, for the purpose of that company, should not get the same largess that the government is offering to the other mining corporations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One could expect a very tenuous flow-on, trickle-down effect. Of course, most of this money will bounce straight out of Tasmania into the pockets of shareholders elsewhere. That is the way this rebate works. However, as a Tasmanian senator, I stand by a commitment to that company that I would support this particular amendment because it is logical to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That said, I want to say I was also impressed by the efforts of Goliath Portland Cement to address the environmental problems involved in mining operations. I got an assurance from them that they would not expand beyond their general vicinity of mining at the moment and in particular would not be involved in the hum at Dogs Head Hill at the western end of the Mole Creek valley. This is one of the most outstanding geological formations in the country, but it has been eyed off by limestone miners for some time. It is quite a rare geological phenomenon. It is a limestone hill with caves in which owls, amongst other things, are nesting, is incredibly important and should be in a national park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrast that with the history of Central Queensland Cement, a company in Rockhampton which was involved in one of the most deplorable episodes in Australian environmental history, let alone mining history, when in the mid&hyphen;1980s it fought tooth and nail to continue mining Mount Etna, 30 kilometres to the north of Rockhampton. Mount Etna was a similar limestone hill with caves in it which were the habitat of a range of bats including the ghost bat, the largest carnivorous bat in Australia&mdash;in fact, it was the southern&hyphen;most range of the ghost bat&mdash;and the earliest wintering brooding site of that bat because of their north-easterly aspect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very important caves which were the habitat for that species of bat were the target of Central Queensland Cement. As the mining corporations so often did, the company yelled,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> `Jobs,' from the treetops. When speleologists went into the caves and had a sit&hyphen;in to protect the caves from being destroyed, the company had alarm loudspeakers dropped into the cave to flush the speleologists out, some of whom emerged with blood dripping from their ears. The cave sitters were then arrested and their supporters were put under threat of huge legal action and damages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The day after the speleologists were brought out, Central Queensland Cement dynamited the pivotal elephant's tube cave and destroyed it, again yelling, `Jobs.' Within 24 months, it packed up, left Rockhampton, left the destruction behind it, left a trail of joblessness, thumbed its nose at all the things that it had claimed it was doing and left yet another black mark on the mining industry's so-called avocation for environment and civic responsibility in this country. It is one of those things that everybody involved in the industry ought to hang their heads in shame about. It is just a disgusting episode in the mining industry's history of treatment of the environment in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt any reparations as far as what can be done to ameliorate the impact of that company's dynamiting of those caves would be done at public expense, as so often is the case. However, having put that on the record, I support this amendment for the self-invested Tasmanian interest that I have. But I make it clear that I oppose the whole idea of this billion dollars going across on a platter to the mining corporations.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am somewhat amazed by the support for this. At a Senate legislation committee hearing, the cement industry sought an amendment to allow rebate for use in the manufacture of cement. Limestone was excluded from the definition of minerals with effect from 1 July 1995 under the previous government. Customs have maintained that if a mineral is extracted from limestone then rebate is available, as the activity has been undertaken as mining for minerals. That is the point Senator Murphy
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3975"> and I were having a slight difference of opinion on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cement industry maintains that the limestone it extracts undergoes a process where the mineral calcite is obtained. Customs dispute that calcite is obtained from limestone in the manufacture of cement. The cement industry has taken the matter to the AAT, but hearing of the case has been deferred at the industry's request until other major cases, including those involving other types of rocks, are resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment requested by the cement industry is reflected in the opposition's amendment. I would like to point out that the amendment will not resolve the issue that is currently before the AAT. The test to be applied is whether the limestone is mined for minerals. The information available to Customs indicates no mineral is extracted in the production of cement. That was the little technical discussion that Senator Cook and I were having.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just like to make a quick remark, and I do not want to inflame you and get you up to give a big speech with regard to Senator Brown's comment about logic. He is supporting it because of a local issue. He is extending the use of diesel fuel rebate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The International Tax Agree
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3976"> ments Amendment Bill (No. 1) proposes to give legal force to the amendment of the double tax agreement between Australia and Vietnam, which was agreed by exchange of notes on 22 November 1996. This exchange of notes was undertaken pursuant to a commitment given by Australia in 1992, when the double tax agreement was entered into. The undertaking related to Australia granting tax sparing for specific Vietnamese tax concession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tax sparing occurs when the tax forgone by a country in providing certain tax concessions to Australian investors is deemed to have been paid for the purposes of the Australian tax system. That is, tax sparing allows Australian investors to invest in another jurisdiction&mdash;in this case Vietnam&mdash;and obtain the tax concession provided by the other jurisdiction without having to pay the equivalent amount of the Vietnamese tax concession to the Australian government when the profits are repatriated to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This agreement lasts for 10 years from the commencement of the double tax agreement on 1 July 1993. There is no provision for it to be extended at the end of the 10-year period. I am aware that there were some recent announcements in respect of this in the budget in the broader context of the taxation of foreign source income. We will deal with that at the appropriate time. It is noteworthy that Australia provides tax sparing to nations other than Vietnam, namely, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, China, Kiribati and Korea. We regard this as non-controversial legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) is one of those generally innocuous bills that gets non-controversial status because they are effectively putting into legislation agreements made with other nations to recognise tax paid and avoid double taxing in various cases. These bills rarely attract much attention or objection, but occasionally it is worth taking a second glance at them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this bill, for example, we are recognising that a tax incentive scheme in Vietnam should be given a tax credit here. Under normal
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> foreign tax credit rules, companies operating here and in another country are given a tax credit for tax paid in the other country for an activity. The rule is basically that the tax paid is recognised and then topped up to Australian standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case where tax concessions are given overseas, the risk is that it will not be considered tax paid, so the concession in Vietnam will simply result in a greater tax obligation here. This bill seeks to extend a tax credit for unpaid tax under the concession scheme so that the concession offered is actually received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where does that leave us? There is a justice issue involved in this sort of bill, which is the reason they generally pass without question. However, such bills reflect and support a general trend by both ex&hyphen;imperial and ex&hyphen;colonial nations to attempt to win the investment of transnational corporations by offering incentives such as cheap power and infrastructure, tax concessions, cooperative environmental programs, and so on&mdash;cooperative governments that hold down wages and overlook environmental problems. Of course, the more nations there are which are willing to cut tax, offer incentives or overlook exploitative practices the greater the competitive pressure becomes. Here we are talking about competition between governments to attract capital&mdash;and capital rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that this is an agreement with Vietnam, a nation that has a minimum wage in foreign corporations of about $1 a day. A couple of years ago, BHP&mdash;the big Australian&mdash;was in the news because it was basically demanding subsidised natural gas before it would invest. Vietnam has also been getting a lot of investment from Thailand and other nations for its textile, clothing and footwear industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A few years back, Thai manufacturers found it was cheaper to have clothes made in Vietnam and simply have them relabelled in Thailand to get around the sanctions that were then in place. International competitiveness was also used at the time to oppose any increase in the minimum wage for Thai workers, which was then about $4 a day. Unfortunately for Thai workers, Thailand was
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3977"> also busy promoting its export markets for food, so the food prices rapidly began to reach international standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thai workers were competing as consumers directly with Australians and American workers. If the prices for food skyrocketed&mdash;they did&mdash;that is the free market. It has obviously reflected consumer choice that the Thai workers `chose' not to buy so much food.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, unfortunately for Thai workers the minimum wage was not always obtainable. Real unemployment was high enough that workers working within a system without a social safety net were desperate and would pay big fees to unscrupulous employment agencies in the hopes of getting a job. They did get a job. It was often paid at around 25 per cent less than the minimum wage&mdash;that was if they were lucky. The unlucky ones, especially women, found themselves held captive in textile factories, fed swill and sleeping in rags in the corners of work rooms. The Thai press was full of stories of both the exploitative employment rackets and the periodic escapes or discoveries of workers basically being held prisoner and treated as slaves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vietnam is seen as a mecca for transnational corporations. Labour is dirt cheap; environmental protection is at the level of an ex&hyphen;communist satellite&mdash;that is to say, virtually non-existent. The World Bank and others, including Australia, are involved in supporting Vietnamese infrastructure so that corporations can get a better deal. Incidentally, if villages of the Vietnamese get in the way they are sacrificed to progress and the greater good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Vietnam has a cooperative government and even offers tax incentives. What is not seen is that support for this kind of market-driven, transnational orientated development of Vietnam creates a tremendous toll on workers and ordinary people in Thailand, Malaysia and other developing nations. It also does little for actually improving the status of workers in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People do not realise the significance of these bills. Investment of so-called Australian transnational corporations are also flowing heavily to Vietnam. BHP, Kambrook,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Wesfarmers, Telstra, Australian Consolidated Press, the Australian Wheat Board and the Australian Manufacturing, Engineering and Construction Industry Association&mdash;even law firms and media companies&mdash;are all flocking to Vietnam to grab their share of that market. We wonder why saving ratios go down here and investment does not seem to happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The whole process is incredibly ugly. The corporate world looks at Vietnam and sees a fertile area for exploitation. The World Bank and other development agencies are so convinced of the correctness of free market fundamentalism that they support the notion that transnational investment based on exploitation equals development, and they must facilitate development. We see no justice in supporting continued handouts to those who dominate the investment in transnational corporations and control the transnational corporate agendas. The consequence is a further squeeze on ordinary people everywhere from Thailand to Australia in the interest of surviving in this exploitative international marketplace we are busy creating and supporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not good enough. There is nothing good or just in it. It increases the inequity within each nation and between nations and, most basically, it serves the global rich, who are no longer remotely nationally aligned. This is what this bill is about: making provisions for yet another turn of the screw, which is tightening on ordinary people in all nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I oppose this bill. I do so not because I oppose the principle of tax justice, but because I oppose the underlying agenda of this&mdash;and all similar measures and their agenda&mdash;devoted to exploitation and the dominance of the transnational new international ruling class.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of prisoners convicted of war crimes, this bill complements Australia's commitment to prosecuting international war criminals. Australia has vigorously assisted the international efforts in this regard through our participation, pursuant to the International War Crimes Tribunal Act 1995, in the tribunals established to deal with war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda. That legislation was moved by the former Labor government and received bipartisan support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that some concerns were expressed at the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs hearings into the bill that the bill might undermine the efforts to fight serious crime, particularly drug&hyphen;related crime. These arguments seem to rest on the erroneous assumption that the transfer of these prisoners will result in prisoners receiving less severe sentences. This is clearly not the effect of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst it is true that in being closer to home prisoners are more likely to be held in more culturally sensitive conditions and closer to their families and friends, these conditions are hardly likely to promote criminal activity. It would be a rather strange individual who decided that they were prepared to commit a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> serious criminal offence where previously they were not, simply because they knew that, pursuant to this bill, they might ultimately be returned home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather, this bill recognises that, despite the serious wrongdoings these prisoners have committed&mdash;wrongdoings that may be deserving of the gravest censure and punishment&mdash;those prisoners have rights to humanitarian treatment. It also recognises that the best way to rehabilitate these prisoners is to return them to culturally appropriate and supportive environments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the general community is concerned, surely that is one of the prime considerations we should be concerned about: to minimise the prospects that criminals will offend again; that other innocent people will suffer from any future action. Punishment is an important part of the criminal process. However, punishment that increases the prospect of recidivism is not in the interests of society nor the prisoner concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill also facilitates greater cooperation between Australia and foreign law enforcement and custodial agencies. This increased confidence in and support of international law enforcement and custodial agencies, will ultimately increase our combined ability to tackle the ever growing rate of international crime. This will help to ensure that more criminals are brought to justice, and help to make the world, including Australia, a safer place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the aspects of this bill relating to the transfer of prisoners convicted of non&hyphen;war crimes and related offences will ultimately rely for their success on the cooperation of the states and territories. I note that the state and territory attorneys&hyphen;general have given in&hyphen;principle agreement to the operation of the legislation. I urge all attorneys concerned to conclude the final agreements with the necessary legislative support as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that the government's proposed amendments to the bill clarify the wording of clause 24 in accordance with recommendation 7 of the unanimous report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The opposition supports the bill and the amendment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it today a bill concerning the international transfer of prisoners. This bill provides a framework to enable Australians imprisoned overseas and foreign nationals imprisoned here to be returned to their home country to complete their sentences. Many honourable senators would be aware of my long&hyphen;held interest in the welfare of Australians who are in prisons overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the bill's long gestation, I am pleased to see it reach this stage. It is some 20 years since the United States first negotiated treaties permitting the transfer of US prisoners who were incarcerated overseas. Now 30 countries and nationalities are party to treaties for prisoner transfer with the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treaties for international transfer have been prepared by the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations and the Council of Europe. Australia has been urged to participate in such a scheme now for some years. We can go back as far as 1983 to find reference in this parliament to a scheme for prisoner transfer. This concept was debated in the context of the Transfer of Prisoners Bill 1983, which provided a method for the transfer of prisoners within the Commonwealth of Australia. In a speech addressing the Transfer of Prisoners Bill 1983, John Spender, the then member for North Sydney, noted, and I quote from the House of Representatives <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 1 November 1983, page 2124:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also provision for transfer on cases of welfare; for example, where it is in the welfare of the prisoner because he is in a part of the country which is quite a long distance away from the part of the country where his family may live.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Given that enthusiasm for a domestic transfer scheme to a large extent was predicated on the intra&hyphen;country distances which potentially hampered the welfare of a prisoner, it is strange that it has taken so long to arrive at a scheme aimed at overcoming the same fundamental problem at the international level&mdash;that is, the welfare and rehabilitation of a prisoner when the distances involved are so much greater and necessitate international travel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nor has the enthusiasm of the previous government been without its contradictions. On 24 October 1984, in responding to a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> question on notice concerning Australian prisoners in overseas prisons, the then Senator Gareth Evans, on behalf of the Attorney&hyphen;General, noted that the Standing Committee of Attorneys&hyphen;General was considering the international transfer of prisoners. He expressed the hope that a final negotiating position could be reached by the end of 1984 or early 1985. Thereafter, it was expected that affected prisoners could be transferred as early as 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1991, however, when confronted with a question of the return of Mr James Savage from the United States, Senator Tate, the then Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, was quite hesitant to commit Australia's entry to any treaty which would facilitate the international transfer of prisoners. Senator Tate concluded his remarks by noting in relation to possible treaties that&mdash;and I quote from the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 9 October 1991, page 1655:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A very considerable number of legal hurdles . . . would stand in the way of their being negotiated successfully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 18 August 1993, in response to a question I asked in the Senate, Senator Bolkus, representing the Attorney&hyphen;General, acknowledged that the Commonwealth remained in favour of a transfer scheme although he foreshadowed it might take two or three years from that date to put one into place. I raised the question again on 8 February 1995 at which time it was anticipated that the legislation would be introduced in mid&hyphen;1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now find ourselves approaching the halfway point of 1997 and it would appear that, many years after the issue was first raised in this parliament, legislation to implement a scheme is imminent. The Standing Committee of Attorneys&hyphen;General and the officers who have assisted in the task of having this legislation and complementary state legislation drafted are to be applauded for their persistence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his second reading of the bill in November 1996, the Attorney&hyphen;General, the Hon. Daryl Williams, noted the advantages in  Australia's participation in the international transfer of prisoners. These included the scheme's humanitarian objectives, the possi
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="3983"> bility of assisting in the rehabilitation of the prisoners, its potential for relieving pressure on Australia's consular posts and the possible savings to the states if there is a net outflow of prisoners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There appears to be little dissent from the bill's humanitarian, rehabilitative and economic objectives. There remains, however, a degree of scepticism among members of the general public. Some consider a scheme facilitating the transfer of prisoners presents criminals with a soft option&mdash;that in committing a crime overseas they will be afforded the luxury of a safety net to return home. Some recent high profile cases, such as the arrest and subsequent imprisonment of three Australians in Thailand, have revealed that a significant number of members of the public believes that Australian citizens who commit crimes overseas should be subject to the laws of the country in which the crime was committed and should serve their sentences in that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addressing this bill I wish to raise three points. First, in supporting this bill, I reassure the public that the Commonwealth is not going soft on criminals. Second, it is absolutely essential to create and maintain a high level of trust between authorities and the public in participating countries. Third, given the persuasiveness of the financial advantages of the scheme, I shall examine the issue of the number of prisoners who might be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going back to the first point, I make it absolutely clear that this bill does not give those considering crime overseas a soft option of returning home. Even though these people are Australian citizens, we cannot condone the activity which led to their detention. Furthermore, in becoming a party to international prisoner transfer treaties, as Australians we must not cast aspersions on the judicial systems of other countries. We have to respect the right of other countries to set penalties as they see appropriate. The primary goal of transferring prisoners under this scheme is a humanitarian one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although it is often glossed over, facilitating the rehabilitation of a prisoner should be given a high priority. To those who continue
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to maintain that Australians should complete their sentences overseas, I reiterate some points I made in this chamber about 12 months ago. At that time I said&mdash;and I quote from the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 6 May 1996, page 378: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A most distressing aspect of having a family member imprisoned overseas is that many people simply cannot afford to go overseas to visit their loved ones. Some do make supreme sacrifices to keep in touch, but even then they can see one another only on an irregular basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If prisoners were allowed to complete their sentences in Australia their parents, their friends, their spouses and their immediate families would have more ready opportunities to visit them on a regular basis.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And I re&hyphen;emphasise a further point I made during the same speech when I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we subscribe to the notion that prisons should be a place of rehabilitation, it could be argued that a person who is going to re&hyphen;enter Australian society would be better rehabilitated here than in some overseas prison.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing has occurred in the intervening period to change my mind on the importance of the family in rehabilitating prisoners. Indeed, I have been particularly encouraged by the outcome of one case with which I was involved for several years. This former prisoner in a foreign gaol is now leading a normal life in Australia, having taken up the profession she pursued before leaving this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we can never condone criminal activity committed by Australians overseas, it would be a vain hope to think that we could never have some of our citizens in overseas prisons. Whenever this occurs, however, foreign incarceration is a devastating experience for those families who remain in Australia. I earnestly hope that such misfortune does not need to befall those who remain sceptical of the transfer of foreign prisoners in order for them to review their position. Surely, in this case, the traumatic personal experiences of some of our fellow countrymen and women can serve as a lesson to us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My second point is that of engendering a sense of trust between all those involved. Criminologist and leading commentator on the issue of the international transfer of prisoners,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3984"> Mr David Biles, is one who has made this point quite clearly. He reminds us of the mockery made of judicial trust in the case of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rainbow Warrior</EMPHASIS> bombing where the French authorities failed to enforce the sentence imposed on two French nationals by New Zealand authorities. In an article in the journal, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Criminal Lawyer</EMPHASIS> of December 1994 and in subsequent discussions with Mr Biles, he has emphasised the importance of mutual trust and respect between participating nations. In that article, entitled, `The international transfer of prisoners: issues and challenges for the 1990s', he made the following point on pages 3 and 4:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if the receiving country has genuine doubts about the judicial standards that are followed in the sentencing country, the treaty which established the transfer program would require a total and uncritical acceptance of sentences imposed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Additionally, adherence to this unquestionable principle of trust might go some way in allaying the fears of those who still need to be convinced that prisoner transfer is not an easy option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do have one qualification. In this respect, I welcome the provisions of section 44 of the bill which allows that returning prisoners, under some circumstances, will not be obliged to serve the full term of their original sentences before, perhaps, being eligible for release or parole. In this country, for example, in contrast to some of the terms meted out to Australians imprisoned in foreign jurisdictions, we rarely hear of 50&hyphen;year terms, which could well mean incarceration for the term of a person's natural life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In order to maintain the integrity of a prisoner's sentence and, therefore, the scheme, it may be in the interests of the Commonwealth to investigate the feasibility of establishing an office specifically charged with overseeing the program. I have visited a similar office in Washington DC and it appeared to operate quite effectively. The office need not be a large one, but it could serve as a central point to coordinate state, federal and inter&hyphen;country matters as appropriate. I raise this simply as a matter for consideration.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now turn to my third point, namely, the question of numbers. One aspect of the bill championed by its proponents is that the scheme is expected to be cost effective; that is, it is estimated that the number of Australian prisoners transferring to Australia will be fewer than the number of foreign prisoners transferring out. Yet, in its advisory report, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs noted that there is considerable uncertainty about the number of prisoners who would transfer in and out of Australia under the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 6 May 1996, in the Senate, I presented figures which showed that there were 157 known Australians imprisoned overseas. At that time, I noted that such figures were indicative only. Prisoners are released from time to time, and others are charged and convicted or held in custody while they are awaiting trial. Furthermore, under the terms of the Vienna Convention, where any Australians state that they do not want the Australian Embassy or High Commission informed of their arrest, the arresting country is not obliged to inform the Australian post.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is with that qualification that I present the following figures, current to 9 May 1997, kindly supplied to me by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The department estimates that there are currently 192 Australians, comprising 170 men and 22 women, either sentenced or awaiting sentence overseas. Sixty&hyphen;seven of the 192 charges are drugs related.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is more difficult to obtain accurate figures for the number of foreign citizens in Australian gaols. Again, I refer to the work of Mr Biles, who estimated that, in 1994, there were approximately 380 foreign prisoners in Australian prisons who were perhaps eligible under the proposed international transfer scheme. He noted, however, that there is no national record of the number of foreign citizens in Australian gaols. His estimate of 380 was arrived at by extrapolating figures collected from a survey conducted in Queensland by two prominent prisoner support  groups in 1992. On the other hand, in its submission to the House of Representatives
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3985"> Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs estimated that at least 632 prisoners currently held in Australian gaols would be eligible for transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the case, as these figures might initially suggest, that the scheme would facilitate the annual transfer of some 200 Australian prisoners to Australia and some 600 foreign prisoners back to their homeland. As Mr Biles has pointed out, the total of 200 Australian prisoners represents a group which has accumulated without a transfer scheme being in place. Furthermore, prisoner transfer cannot occur in cases where a prisoner is yet to be tried, who is awaiting the outcome of an appeal or where there is insufficient time left to serve. Therefore, after the first year of operation, Mr Biles estimates the annual figure would settle down to somewhere in the region of 20 to 30 prisoners seeking transfer back to Australia. Of the approximately 600 foreign prisoners in Australian gaols, there is no indication of, first, how many prisoners would be eligible to take advantage of the scheme; and, second, how many of those who are eligible would seek transfer back to their own country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until there is more certainty regarding the numbers of prisoners involved, we need to guard against undue enthusiasm for the scheme based on its presumed financial advantages. Indeed, such a position may only serve to reinforce the scepticism to which I referred earlier. Nevertheless, at a time when the humanitarian nature of our society is being questioned and self&hyphen;interest seems to have totally overwhelmed our concerns for a person's fundamental wellbeing, it is my sincere hope that the humanitarian imperatives of the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill could overcome our society's constant deference to fiscal considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I wish to make two points. The first of these is that I indicate my support for this legislation and I look forward to its implementation, together with the necessary complementary legislation of the states. Such an outcome will give hope to those of our fellow countrymen and women who languish
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in foreign prisons and to their loved ones who await their return to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, and importantly, I express my appreciation to Australia's consular officials around the world whose work, often in trying conditions, usually goes unnoticed. Their duties involve far more than attending to the needs of Australians who are in foreign prisons. Nevertheless, it is these officers whose efforts are vital for the welfare of imprisoned Australians and they approach this task with a degree of diligence which far exceeds their official responsibility in this area. The professionalism of these men and women is integral to the implementation of this legislation, and I acknowledge their untiring efforts in their work overseas.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Responses to comments, and questions with regard to the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill 1996</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rights of Indigenous People</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clarification was sought on how the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill 1996 (the Bill) will address the unique situation of some indigenous Australians imprisoned overseas. Advice was also sought on the changes that might be needed to the Migration Act 1958 to ensure that people in this particularly vulnerable position are not denied the rights that the Bill seeks to provide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not the intention that indigenous Australians imprisoned overseas will be denied the opportunity to transfer to Australia under the Bill. Such persons will simply have to satisfy the same conditions for transfer to Australia which apply to any other Australian imprisoned overseas. Transfer of prisoners to Australia entails the entry of persons to Australia, and is therefore inextricably linked to the migration legislation. Accordingly, prisoner transfers cannot proceed independently of migration policy Considerations .</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains a number of prerequisites which must be satisfied before prisoners can be transferred to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3986"> Australia. Clause 13 of the Bill sets out the eligibility requirements in relation to migration policy concerns. It provides that, for transfers to Australia, a person must be:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an Australian citizen; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">permitted to travel to, enter and remain in Australia indefinitely pursuant to the Migration Act 1958 and have community ties with a State or Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, it is possible for indigenous Australians imprisoned overseas to satisfy these requirements. If, for example, an Australian-born indigenous Australian imprisoned overseas has not ceased to be an Australian citizen (for example, by taking out the citizenship of another country), he or she would satisfy the first limb. Alternatively, if the person is no longer an Australian citizen, he or she could satisfy the second limb by being entitled to return to Australia pursuant to the migration legislation. In each case, the prisoner could be transferred to Australia if all other conditions are satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An issue which was extensively discussed during the inquiry into the Bill by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs (the Committee) was whether these limbs would be sufficient to cover indigenous Australians who had been forcibly removed from their families as children and taken overseas by their foster or adoptive parents. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) noted that such persons might not satisfy either limb of the eligibility requirements in clause 13, and suggested that a third category of eligibility should be added to cover such persons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As pointed out above, it is possible for such persons to satisfy the eligibility requirements in clause 13. Furthermore, it would not be appropriate for the international transfer of prisoners legislation to make special provisions relating to entry to Australia in relation to indigenous Australians. The Bill is drafted in such a way as to interact with the present migration legislation. That is, after all, the overarching legislation by which persons are enabled to enter Australia. If a person is not able to enter Australia under the migration legislation, then this Bill should not create a separate right for convicted persons within a particular class of persons to enter Australia. The incongruous result would be that, for a particular class of persons (indigenous Australians), those who have been convicted of offences overseas would be automatically eligible for return to Australia, whereas law-abiding persons of the same class would have no such automatic right under the migration legislation. Therefore, if special provision is required in relation to rights of entry to Australia of indigenous Australians, this issue should be addressed in the context of the migration legislation. The real issue is whether all indigenous Australians overseas (whether imprisoned or not) should have an automatic right of return to Australia. This is clearly a wider policy issue relating to the migration legislation, and is not limited to the International Transfer of Prisoners Bill. Accordingly, the Government does not consider that this issue should delay the passage of the present legislation.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee accepted these arguments (see paragraphs 2.12 to 2.28 of the Committee's report), and recommended that the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs initiate an examination of the issues surrounding the eligibility of persons, who have been removed from Australia as children, to have a right of entry to Australia (recommendation 3).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General has raised this matter with the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The minister has advised that he considers sufficient scope already exists under the migration legislation for persons to be given a right of entry to Australia in circumstances where they were taken from Australia as a child, and had lost their Australian citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Need for participation by all States and Territories</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concern was expressed about the situation that will arise if one of the Territories or States fails to agree to participate in the scheme, and it was suggested that some form of federal intervention might be appropriate in order to ensure that the legislation applies equally throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear for a number of reasons that national application of the legislation is the ideal position. The issue of Australian participation in international prisoner transfer has been on the agenda for the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General (SCAG) for many years. The Commonwealth initially adopted an "all or nothing" approach whereby it was decided not to proceed with the scheme unless all States and Territories participated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the Northern Territory deciding not to participate, however, it was decided that, on balance and in light of the humanitarian considerations, proceeding without the Northern Territory's participation would be preferable to not proceeding at all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HREOC suggested to the Committee that the problem of fragmented implementation could be overcome if the relevant State or Territory minister's consent was not necessary in order to transfer a prisoner into Australia. However, this would fundamentally change the nature of the whole scheme. The scheme is premised on a consensus agreement involving cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States/Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since there are no federal prisons, incoming prisoners will need to be imprisoned in State/ Territory prisons. It was suggested by HREOC that  this problem could be overcome by the fact that incoming prisoners would be regarded as federal prisoners, and there is a constitutional obligation on the States to take federal prisoners. This argument, however, is flawed in relation to this scheme, since incoming prisoners are deemed to be federal prisoners only for sentence enforcement purposes. As explained in the Explanatory Memorandum (paragraph 128), deeming of incoming prisoners as federal prisoners is not designed to affect the agreed financial responsibilities. States and Territories agreed in SCAG to pay for incoming prisoners. If the States/Territories are to bear costs for incoming prisoners, then their consent needs to be obtained for transfers.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3987"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been suggested that federal intervention to force the States or Territories to participate would be an alternative way of overcoming the problems associated with fragmented implementation in Australia. Options involving the overriding of a consensus agreement have not been seriously considered because the Government simply does not consider anything other than a consensus arrangement to be viable in the particular circumstances of the legislation and the whole scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted above, incoming prisoners will need to be housed in State/Territory prisons (at State/Territory expense). In addition, many of the prisoners who will seek to take advantage of the proposed scheme to leave Australia will be serving sentences for State and Territory offences. Accordingly, the successful participation of Australia in international prisoner transfers will depend to a large measure on the cooperation of the State and Territory authorities. SCAG has, therefore, been used as a forum over several years for consultation and discussion on this matter. The Bill is the culmination of a long and intensive consultation process with the States and Territories. It has involved an enormous amount of work and cooperative effort on both general and detailed matters at the Commonwealth and State/Territory levels. It is a delicately balanced arrangement based on a consensual agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of these considerations, the Government agrees with the Committee's conclusion that delaying the scheme until all States and Territories have agreed to participate would be undesirable and may even lead to the collapse of the scheme, and that this is not an appropriate situation for the Commonwealth to use its constitutional powers to compel all States and Territories to participate. (For further clarification of this issue, see the discussion at pages 108 to 110 of the transcript of evidence, and at paragraphs 2.4 to 2.11 of the Committee's report.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In all the circumstances, the Government considers that the best approach is to proceed with the scheme, and to strongly encourage the Northern Territory to participate in it. In accordance with the Committee's recommendation, the Attorney-General has recently written to his colleagues in all the States and Territories. He has drawn the Committee's report to their attention, emphasised the value of the scheme, the need for it to operate on a national basis, and the need for all States and Territories to enact complementary legislation as a matter of priority. Further follow-up action on this issue will be undertaken as necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Risk of torture</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some concerns have been raised relating to ensuring that prisoners cannot be transferred to a situation where they may be subject to human rights abuses including torture, and ensuring that prisoners experiencing human rights abuses in overseas prisons are not prevented from being eligible for transfer back to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This raises issues relating to informed consent, the type of information required to be provided to prisoners, and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> whether the Attorney-General should refuse a transfer because of possible human rights abuses notwithstanding that a fully informed prisoner has expressed his or her willingness to transfer (for example, in order to be closer to his or her family, etc). These issues were exhaustively addressed during the Committee's inquiry. (See particularly paragraphs 2.83 to 2.94 of the Committee's report, paragraphs 13 to 18 and 41 to 48 of the Attorney-General's Department's submission of 17 February 1997 and pages 107 to 108 and 117 to 118 of the transcript of evidence.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the sort of information that will be provided to prisoners, it is envisaged that the regulations will stipulate that appropriate information on prison conditions in other countries (for example, reports and information from independent organisations like Amnesty International or International Prison Watch) must be provided before a prisoner makes a decision. The regulations could also require prisoners to be given contact details, etc in order to give them the opportunity to obtain further information on prison conditions from relevant international organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to the query about whether prisoners will be able to reverse a decision to be transferred up until the time that they leave the country where they are originally detained, clause 6(6) of the Bill confirms that this is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been noted that prisoners being transferred from Australia would be protected from being sent to unsuitable destinations by virtue of the fact that Australia will be negotiating a list of "transfer countries" which, by definition, will meet some agreed standards of imprisonment and treatment of prisoners. A question was raised on how this will help an Australian citizen who might be imprisoned in a country that is not on the "transfer list", possibly being held in conditions that violate agreed standards for treatment of prisoners. The Government accepts that this will need to be considered as part of the process of negotiating prisoner transfer agreements with other countries. It may be that agreements will be entered into with particular countries that would, in other circumstances, not be considered as appropriate treaty partners. This would enable prisoners to be transferred to Australia from those countries (subject to the satisfaction of all the conditions, including consent by the other country). Outgoing transfers to these countries would be subject to the protection arising from the need for full consent and the fact that transfers will always be considered on a case-by-case basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Death penalty</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clarification was sought on how prisoners will be protected from being transferred to a country that may wish to apply the death penalty. As has been correctly pointed out, this is again tied in with the issue of informed consent.

However, in relation to tribunal prisoners, the Bill (in Part 5) provides only for transfers of tribunal prisoners to Australia. There will be no outwards transfers of tribunal prisoners. It should also be noted that the Statutes of the International War Crimes Tribunals do not enable the death penalty to be imposed upon conviction by the Tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general prisoner transfer cases, the prisoners will have already had a sentence imposed and may have served some of that sentence. The purpose of a transfer will be to ensure that the prisoner continues to serve that sentence in another country. Prior to the transfer taking place, there would be discussions between Australia and the other country as to how the sentence will be enforced in the other country. If the other country proposes to enforce the sentence by way of the death penalty, then Australia would not consent to the transfer.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very important question from Senator Coonan, because this government, unlike its predecessor, has a commitment not only to supporting the community broadcasting sector but also to expanding it. We have already delivered on our election commitment, which was to provide an additional $3 million over three years to expand the community broadcasting sector. It had languished under Labor, it had
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been going backwards in percentage terms, and we came to the party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is much more serious about Labor's default in this whole area is that they cruelly led the community sector on into believing that new licences would be granted. The licence area processing plan, which was put in place as far back as 1992, was designed to ensure that there would be new broadcasting licences throughout all licence areas in Australia by June of last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That simply has not happened. We are now looking at a 3&half; year slippage in that licence area planning process. That is an absolute disgrace. It is something we are not prepared to accept for any greater length of time. We are therefore prepared to amend the Broadcasting Services Act to allow the majority of aspirant community broadcasters to have the capacity to commence full-time broadcasting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, up until such time as the planning process is completed they will able to broadcast on a full-time basis&mdash;not this silly nonsense of periodic temporary test transmissions for a maximum of 90 days per year, an approach which has been in place now for something like 20 years and which has caused enormous frustration, start-up and turn off, with people going out of business not being able to be sure when they could ever convert to full-time. We are determined to stop that and to provide a level of viability  for many community aspirant groups that simply has not been there to the present time. I am very confident that that will lead to a significant increase in the diversity and range of broadcasting and media services in the community sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But over and above that, we are also prepared to make a decision in relation to the sixth television channel. As senators would know, that matter has been the subject of inquiry by me and my department now for some months. We have taken advice from the ABA. We expect to be in a position to make a decision on that fairly soon. But again, it is important to ensure&mdash;</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3991"></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure you can make representations if you are missing out. What we will do in that area is to allow for an extension of 12 months to allay the concerns of current licence holders who are seeking renewal after 30 June 1997 pending the making of that decision. In other words, it will enable the four existing operators and four others who already have licences but have not commenced broadcasting to continue for a guaranteed period of time. If a final decision is made in favour of community access it may, of course, take some time to put it into place. That will give them a transition path. Conversely, if a decision is made to leave the channel vacant then they will have plenty of time to embark on the necessary wind-down arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So these measures are designed to ensure that there is greater diversity in new media services. We have digital radio and television just around the corner. But in the short-term it is very important that there are new licences in the commercial area for analog services. That will occur when we are able to catch up with the licence planning process. In the meantime we will ensure that those community aspirants who have been missing out to date on permanent arrangements will start to have them. We are busy transforming the sector. We are not prepared to put it in mothballs as you did.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<ANSWER PAGE="3992" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Chapman for his question. It is true that for 13 years in government Labor saw the problems that indigenous Australians faced. It is also true that for 13 years they cried crocodile tears but in the end offered no effective solutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After 13 years, we can all look back on Labor and their achievement or failure&mdash;an indigenous unemployment rate of 40 per cent; the infant mortality rate unchanged at two to three times the rate of non&hyphen;Aboriginal children; and the life expectancy of an Aboriginal male is still 16 to 18 years&mdash;nearly 20 years&mdash;less than others. There was a small glimmer of hope between 1985 and 1992  when the retention rate of year 12 indigenous students rose 11 points, and we welcomed that. But the retention rate for the rest of the student population in that period rose by 20 points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all remember Richo's conversion from Labor number cruncher to concerned politician, genuinely taking an interest in indigenous health. We remember the photo of him at Wallaby Creek near Katherine in 1994, but Labor hardly progressed the issue of water supply to indigenous Australians at all. Perhaps Richo should come back. He put a bit of spine in Old Jellyback, and he could give Labor a few good ideas now. In this, as in so
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3993"> many other areas, we inherited Labor's failure and we are determined to address it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994-95, Labor's last full year of government, there were a mere 817 indigenous trainees. This year there will be about 4,000. We have increased funding by $80 million over four years for indigenous education in the preschool, primary, secondary and TAFE sector. There will be recurrent funding to educational institutions only if their annual performance targets to improve indigenous education outcomes are met, so that we will get real results. We have extended funding to encourage parents to help their children at school, including making that available at the preschool level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In higher education, we have allocated an additional $72 million over three years for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander education&mdash;including a number of special initiatives such as indigenous higher education centres, developing on-line delivery arrangements for indigenous communities and $1 million for innovative technologies to deliver university courses to indigenous communities. We sponsored the youth reconciliation award&mdash;which we were very pleased to do&mdash;at the reconciliation conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> But Labor did not just fail the indigenous population. They failed the Australian population. They destroyed, in the recession we had to have, 420,000 full&hyphen;time jobs. They destroyed the livelihood of 330,000 men and the futures of 220,000 young Australians in the recession they said we had to have. It was a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of that recession, there was a rise in youth unemployment from 14 per cent to 30 per cent, and the number of long&hyphen;term unemployed increased by 235,000. No tears and no apologies for the wrecked families and ruined lives&mdash;ruined because of Labor's shocking financial mismanagement. It was just an absolute disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned that we sponsored the youth reconciliation award. I know Senator Chapman has a particular interest in the reconciliation issue and, since my time is running out, I just advise him that I might not be able to give him the whole answer. But I saw a photo

The act already allows states and territories to confirm ownership of natural resources, to confirm access to waterways, beaches and public places and to regulate water which will be strengthened under the 10-point plan.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Wednesday, 28 May 1997 (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  page 3501) Senator Kernot asked me a question without notice about pastoral leases administration in relation to point 4 of the 10-point plan. I took the question on notice and now provide the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Government is aware that there have been at least seven reviews or inquiries at state or territory level over the last twenty years touching on land tenure in the pastoral zone. Of those reviews that addressed actual tenure issues, several recommended that leasehold tenure be retained in pastoral areas and that it be refined in various ways, (for example recommending that term leases be upgraded to perpetual leases).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Point 4 of the 10-point plan reflects the Wik decision that native title is extinguished to the extent of inconsistency with rights granted under a lease, that it can co-exist to the extent that the rights are not inconsistent, and that leaseholders' rights will `prevail' over those of native title holders. It also ensures that leaseholders can operate and manage their primary production businesses within the terms of their lease, notwithstanding <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">any</EMPHASIS>  native title that might be claimed or found to exist. Native title holders or claimants will not be able to interfere with such management decisions as the siting of a dam.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where permitted under state or territory legislation, the Native Title Act <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">already </EMPHASIS> allows a state or territory to <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">acquire</EMPHASIS>  native title rights for the benefit of third parties, including for the purpose of granting freehold tenure. Under the proposed amendments, where the states or territory provides procedural rights to native title holders equivalent to those available to the lessee, the `right to negotiate' will not apply in relation to such an acquisition. Land management issues will remain a matter for state and territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a state or territory proposes to upgrade a lease to freehold, or to a tenure which involves exclusive possession, it must acquire the native title rights over the lease or that part of the lease, by agreement or by means of compulsory acquisition, with compensation being payable by the relevant government where native title is proven.  It is relevant in this context that the Queensland Premier, Mr Borbidge, as recently as 22 May, spoke about the proposal in terms of acquisition and re-issue of the lease in a form of `perpetual exclusive' lease, which I note is not freehold."</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4004"><TITLE>Aboriginal Affairs</TITLE>

What about the quarantining of  provisions for the community development employment projects, CDEP, allowing for over 30,000 places and allowing for a growth of 600 places? But of course the opposition does not want to hear about constructive things that this government is doing for indigenous Australia. All it is interested in is whether the minister read a photocopied report or not. Shame on it!</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4007">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why don't you look at the job in hand? You do not want to, do you? You do not want to look at the fact that this minister initiated a partnership between the Department of Health and Family Services, the army and ATSIC to service remote communities where there is a lack of water. In July this year that will be started in six remote communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the opposition that that is what counts. It is things like water, the environment, health, education and employment. Five million dollars is being spent on reducing the high level of incarceration of Aboriginal Australians. That is what is important&mdash;not whether the minister read a photocopy of a report or not. Shame on you, I say to the opposition. By their deeds you shall know them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know the deeds that you did not fulfil in the last 13 years of government. In 13 months this minister has fulfilled those programs that I have just outlined, not to mention the private business program for indigenous Australia where, over the next four years, they will be encouraged to enter projects of their own. We have seen a number of successful ones. The Jawoyn community in Katherine is a case in point. That is the way to cure the high level of unemployment in indigenous Australia which was a legacy of this opposition. Labor's legacy of 13 years in government was 38 per cent unemployment for indigenous Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the fact that some of these communities did not even have fresh water? The minister has announced this partnership, which I have mentioned, between the army, the Department of Health and Family Services and ATSIC. That is what this minister is doing. This opposition fails to see that. It is like what Marie Antoinette said&mdash;`Let them eat cake.' That is the unrealistic attitude we have from the opposition here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are asking, `Did the minister read a photocopy of the report or did he not? Did the minister read it a week ago, or when did he read it?' Let us devote the Senate's time to looking at this rather than looking at what has been done for indigenous Australia and seeing that these programs are being fulfilled.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister mentioned on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> that Gareth Evans said that we have simply thrown money at it. That is what his government did. They did not even bother to see where the money was going. They did not even bother to see whether the benefits were being delivered on the ground to indigenous Australia. That is why this minister, Senator Herron, wants to ensure accountability, not just for the taxpayer but also for Aboriginal Australia. He wants to say to them, `We are spending this money and we are going to ensure that it is delivered on the ground to you. We want to ensure that you do get your housing and fresh water and that you do have chances for employment.' That is what this government is about and that is what this minister is working to.</PARA>

Last night  on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> , Senator Herron, amongst a lot of gobbledygook and incomprehensible language, made a couple of statements that were clear. One related to the timing of his receiving the report. He made it quite clear today in question time, having in my view misled the community last night on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> , that he received not the final report but a photocopy of the report some time

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also very concerned about this developing as a pattern on the part of the minister for Aboriginal affairs. Yesterday in question time, Senator Cook asked Senator Herron whether he was aware of a Western Australian politician's view that Aborigines are the bottom colour of the civilised spectrum and whether he would take the opportunity to dissociate himself and his party from that obnoxious view. It was a clear question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was asked about it last night on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> by the presenter, Kerry O'Brien. Senator Herron, in response, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But when I was questioned about it I didn't know the context that they were given in, nor when they were said, nor had I seen it on television or heard him say those things.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was a clear statement from Senator Herron in relation to the comments of Senator Lightfoot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was asked again because the presenter, Mr Kerry O'Brien, obviously could not quite understand this response from Senator Herron. He had pointed out that they had been very widely reported and that the senator had made them in 1993. Senator Herron went on to say this:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a storm in a teacup it is if the best attack that the opposition can mount on Senator Herron is to do with when he got a report or what sort of form he had it in&mdash;whether it was a photocopy or whether it was any kind of final document. As if in this sorry history of the plight of Aboriginals in Australia, in our country, a matter of weeks or days really matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not as if the plight of the stolen children was a closely held secret over the past 13 years&mdash;or indeed over the past 30. It is demeaning, to say the least, to reduce what is clearly an important public debate in this country involving very complex issues to a bay for an instant response and a complaint that a minister had a document a week or so earlier than he may have done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only has this debate not surfaced in the last few days, but also it is pretty clear that for the past 13 years nobody said `sorry' to the stolen children. Nobody has gone on, as they have in the last few days, with the semantics of how you say sorry and how symbolic it is. Most of the debate over the past few days has been about semantics. Collective guilt is, I believe, rather different from collective responsibility and an acknowledgment, as a community, of past wrongs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take this opportunity, because it is the first opportunity I have had, to say that as a parent I can see the horror of what happened to the stolen children and to express my personal regret for what has happened. The government has said, and I acknowledge it, that it will give a considered response to the report, as indeed it should. This is not about, and does not raise issues about recent
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4009"> wrongs but wrongs that have been going on for many, many years, that have not been remedied in past years. This is not the time for a knee-jerk reaction and a quick response that will have vast consequences and significant consequences for the foreseeable future for our indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However lofty and well intentioned the ideals and sentiments of the reconciliation convention&mdash;I acknowledge the fact that some very fine sentiments were expressed, some of which I would endorse&mdash;I think we do need to acknowledge as a community, and to try to get this above party political cheap shot scoring, the enormous frustration felt by many Australians, in fact I would say most Australians, at the obstacles that have been placed in the path of reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a high level of frustration felt by both black and white Australians that, despite an expenditure of a little over $10 billion over the past decade, Aboriginal Australians still live in the most appalling conditions of shame. However fundamental symbolic gestures may be, let us not forget that this is all hollow rhetoric unless it actually gets translated into real commitment for the future&mdash;real commitment to addressing, for example, the delivery system that will produce practical programs for reconciliation, practical programs that I suggest should have been undertaken long before 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all the blaming that is going on in the reconciliation debate, let us not forget that there is a big measure of collective blame that we share as a community. This is a matter that affects us as a community and ought to be above political party process, other than of course bipartisan support for some real attempt to address the wrongs of the past. Of course it means that it is not a one&hyphen;way process. For the delivery system to be effective and to help indigenous Australians, we have to of course have programs that will help indigenous Australians to better help themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a strong community desire for reconciliation that produces positive and sustainable outcomes for our indigenous Australians. The community demand is
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coming across the board, and it is not just by Australians who have some memory of these past wrongs. It is from young people. It is from young Australians. I commend this to the Senate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

There is now evidence that the minister was not, and that is the point that we are going to&mdash;not the distraction of whether it was glossy or a photocopy, but whether or not the minister has misled the Senate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the contradiction is out of his own mouth. You saw the report, Minister, and then you say you cannot speak about it, because you have not seen it. Did you or did you not see the report, Minister Herron? That is the confusion, that is the question and that is the great worry we have on this side. This

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is to be remembered that almost before Senator Cook had finished his question&mdash;in which he did not name the Western Australian&mdash;Senator Herron said, `Poor old Senator Cook hasn't the guts to stand up and say it is Senator Lightfoot.' He knew it was Senator Lightfoot. He knew those remarks were attributed to Senator Lightfoot. Then he spent a lot of time saying that Senator Lightfoot had the right to say what he liked&mdash;that was free speech in this country. He went on to say, `I have not seen the report and I am not going to comment about it if I have not really seen it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron has been obfuscating. He has been misleading this place. He has got it so wrong, so tortured and so knotted that he has to come in here immediately and apologise or cop the consequences. It is not a question of glossy&hyphen;paged reports; it is not a question of photocopies; it is a question of whether or not the minister has been telling the truth. That is our major concern, because what we are talking about is the capacity of a minister to deliver, on behalf of the people of this country, very significant responsibilities.</PARA>

I only intend to make a couple of brief comments because it will be debated in the chamber later. Some important things need to be said today at the tabling of this report on this bill because a number of people who gave evidence to this inquiry undoubtedly would want to know what was in the report because it will affect possible decisions that they make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer in particular to some comments that were made in the minority report signed by Senator Sherry. I want to refer to the points Senator Sherry made. He made three main points in the minority report. They were, firstly, that no abuse of the infrastructure borrowings arrangement had been demonstrated. Secondly, he proposed that transitional arrangements be provided which allow for all projects which have been certified by the DAA to retain that certification and that further opportunity for certification be provided for certain projects including the basis of regional development and regional employment. Thirdly, he said that the proposed bill may be retrospective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make a couple of comments on each of those points because it is important that they be refuted. Senator Sherry is certainly in a minority in claiming that the infrastructure borrowings arrangements were not  subject to abuse. He only needs to ask his colleague Senator Carr, the current Manager of Opposition Business, who himself commented in the Senate on 28 June 1996 on the use of infrastructure borrowings. Indeed, he described some schemes as sordid arrange
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4013"> ments that were being used `to feather the nests of friends of the government and the private sector'. So Senator Sherry probably needs to consult with Senator Carr, because  he says that there is no abuse in place, yet Senator Carr says that there were some sordid arrangements in place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was actually sitting next to me when he said it.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, he can confer with you right there. In an article on 19 February 1997, shortly after the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) abolishing the infrastructure borrowing scheme, David Walker in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  wrote that the features of the IB scheme `have proved irresistible to financial engineers large and small, who have tweaked into it something different from the government's original intent' and `some experts were saying the rorts had gone too far'. So if Senator Sherry in his minority report believes that there is no abuse of infrastructure borrowing arrangements, I think it is very clearly demonstrated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the transitional arrangements, which is the second point that he makes, Senator Sherry has not grasped why the government acted in the way it did. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) indicated in his 14 February 1997 announcement that if all applications for infrastructure borrowing certificates were to proceed, based on the details of their current applications, the cost to the government would be in the order of $4 billion. This was not disputed: the cost to the government would be in the order of $4 billion. Senator Sherry's amendments have the potential to allow a large number of these projects to proceed, at an excessive cost to the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of retrospectivity, the Treasurer's announcement on 14 February made it clear that no more infrastructure
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> borrowing certificates would be issued after that date, except where a letter of undertaking had been given, and we heard that in evidence. Applicants who have pursued the issue of certificates since 14 February 1997 have done so in the knowledge of the Treasurer's statement and on the basis of advice from the DAA that certificates would later become void on the passage of the government's legislation. Let me make it quite clear that those people who were issued certificates after 14 February were advised by the DAA that they would become void on the passage of the government's proposed legislation. So I find it very difficult for Senator Sherry to argue retrospectivity when in fact these people were advised and notified that this would be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard evidence in particular that placed much emphasis on the proposed projects at Redbank and the Oakey power station.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with you, Senator Conroy. There was emphasis on the roles that National Power and Siemens have played in both of these projects. But I think that the minority report which was put down by the opposition really ought to take note of two particular sentences in the report where the government confirms the commitment in the 1997&hyphen;98 budget, with details provided of an infrastructure borrowings rebate. Then it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence provided to the Committee from these projects appears to indicate they would sit well with the criteria outlined by the Government to apply to the new IB rebate programme.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is important to note that, although the new program relates to road and rail infrastructure, in fact all of those people who have applied through the other broader criteria will be eligible, which means that both Oakey and Redbank will be eligible under this scheme.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to realise that, in closing these loopholes identified by Senator Carr on 28 June 1996 when he said there were some sordid arrangements feathering the nests of friends in the private sector, and when other people have commented that the rorts have gone too far, it is the government's intention to make sure that those rorts do not continue. For that reason, the recommendation that the government has made in tabling this report is that the legislation proceed and that the new program that will be put in place in the spring sittings will then cover those people, who will be eligible to apply under the new scheme once that legislation is put in place.</PARA></SPEECH>

You had Treasury officials who said, `Well, we have looked at a few of the projects and a couple of them might have been tax aggressive, but what we are actually worried about is the capacity to change the guidelines that are approved after the approval has been given.' When asked whether Redbank or Oakey contained any of the tax aggressive positions that they were suggesting, the answer was, `We haven't looked at them.' So we are throwing out good projects; projects that are about jobs in regional Australia, which is crying out for them. They are being thrown out, not on the basis&mdash;</PARA>

You sign contracts, you comply with the government guidelines and the government says, `Come and use these infrastructure development bonds.' And what happens? After they have put in their application forms, signed the projects, it is ripped out from under them. They are shaking their heads in disbelief at this government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fleecing of motorists; that is right. That is what happened with City Link; it was the fleecing of motorists. The kindest words that could have been said for the new system that Senator Ferguson champions were vague. It was described as a beauty contest because it is going to delay projects for another six months. It has to go through some committees. It is all subjective. There are no objective guidelines. It is all about picking winners. Some government committee is going to make the decision without objective guidelines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I would like to talk about the conduct of the DAA&mdash;the Development Allowance Authority. Their evidence to the committee was at best unclear and completely unsatisfactory. When asked what the written
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> criteria were that they used to determine which projects they were working on, they admitted they had none. Even after the flood of applications, which clearly increased their workload&mdash;and, interestingly, almost half of those applications came from one financing company, and we will come back to that&mdash;they admitted that to this day they have no written criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did clients using the DAA not know what the criteria were? DAA's answer was, `We don't understand why they misunderstood what the criteria were.' They actually set out criteria including the likelihood of the project proceeding, the expected draw down date of the infrastructure borrowings, the expected date of commencement of construction and whether the financing was consistent with the symmetry originally contemplated by the government in introducing the concession. That is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Redbank and Oakey met all these criteria, but their applications sat waiting for months while projects that were not even close to completion got approved. Some of them had not even lodged a development application with their local council. Some were for tenders and they got approved. Some still do not have an EIS approval from the government about whether the project will begin, like the rail link in Brisbane. They do not even have Queensland government approval for the project to go ahead, and they got approval.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what has been going on down at the DAA? Why did one company, one financial adviser, succeed in getting projects like that through the DAA when legitimate projects that would have started construction this week, would have drawn down their bonds before the end of the financial year, did not have approval? These are the questions that DAA were not able to answer. The only suggestion that they were able to make was that they gave out their certificates on the basis of need by their clients who were applying.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4016">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is miraculous&mdash;in fact, unfounded&mdash;that no-one other than one company seemed to have understood that. Only one company went to them in the required time and said, `We need these projects.' AIDC contacted DAA between eight and 10 times from November through to February to say, `Where's our certificate?' but they did not seem to understand that all they had to do was say, `We need it. We'd like it shortly. It's urgent.' That is all they had to do. They went through the process of answering letters, putting documentation in and making eight to 10 phone calls to the DAA to say, `What's happened with our applications? Where are they?' The furphy of the lot from DAA, before I am cut off, was they said, `We still need information in March.' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

A joint government&hyphen;industry plantation 2020 vision to provide a framework under which investment in plantation timber is encouraged is being finalised. The goal is to treble the existing area of land devoted to plantations by the year 2020.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been the progressive removal of export controls on plantation sourced wood from states where codes of forest practice have been assessed as adequately protecting environmental values. The controls have already been lifted in Victoria and Tasmania. The allocation of an additional $22 million under the Natural Heritage Trust for the farm forestry program is intended to encourage timber production on cleared agricultural land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The making of the Export Control (Regional Forest Agreements) Regulations in April is another plank in this raft of positive measures being actively pursued by the government. The opposition's move to link the future of these regulations to its support for union calls to establish a wood and paper industry council lacks credibility. The two cannot be reasonably linked. However, I can inform the Senate that the government will establish such a
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> council. Indeed, I can confirm it will be up and running by mid&hyphen;July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murphy made, in his speech, a number of statements, assertions and observations to which I am happy to respond. First was his criticism that the wood and paper industry council had not been established. While I have addressed this already, I would make the point again that we have not been idle. The government has been examining market opportunities for the forest industries and the potential for us to build a strong manufacturing base in Australia. It is part of the RFA process. A good example of this is the study conducted recently by Margules Groome Poyry in Tasmania. Senator Murphy mentioned it earlier. It has clearly identified significant growth opportunities for the Tasmanian forest industries which, if realised, would provide a major boost to the state's economy and job creation. Of course, the RFA process is all about achieving this outcome. That is why the study was done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth will be pressing very hard for the Tasmanian government to ensure industry has access to the wood resources necessary to make these value&hyphen;adding opportunities a reality. But we will not use our export powers to force this to happen. The export powers have never been used this way and Senator Murphy would know that. They have never been anything more than a blunt, ill&hyphen;conceived and ineffective instrument. The sovereign risk they have created has significantly damaged investment in the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does agree with Senator Murphy's view that we need to maximise the value added to our wood resources domestically to deliver the best social and economic  outcomes. Where we differ, however, is as to how this can be achieved. We intend to do it by working cooperatively with the industry and the states, not by beating them about the head and effectively sabotaging their operations. It took a lot of effort to restore Australia's international reputation and begin recovering the markets lost by the decision of the previous government to impose commercially stupid export restrictions.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4019">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murphy has alleged that no work has been done to develop an overarching national strategy for the development of the forest industry but, as I have already indicated, he has chosen to ignore the very good preliminary work done in the RFAs. The wood and paper industry council, when established, will be given the role of coordinating the strategy nationally, drawing in the information gathered in the RFAs and providing guidance for industry development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth will play a constructive role in this process&mdash;as we have done in the past 12 months&mdash;but I have to make the point that, at the end of the day, you cannot force industry to invest. Our major role will be to ensure 20&hyphen;year access to resources through the RFAs, something the previous government could not deliver.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murphy indicated he had received a letter from the Tasmanian Country Sawmillers Federation expressing support for the retention of controls over woodchip exports. What Senator Murphy has not told the Senate is that concerns expressed by the sawmillers can only be addressed by the Tasmanian government. The Commonwealth does not manage the forests. Tasmanian forests are owned by the state and managed by a state agency. We are involved in the RFA process because we want to ensure our forests are managed sustainably. The issue of how the Tasmanian government chooses to make the state's wood resources available to industry is a matter for it, although obviously we encourage the state to give preference to domestic processes. This is one of the points that the Commonwealth will be making very strongly in the upcoming negotiations with Tasmania over the regional forestry agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forestry Tasmania has commercial contracts of sale to supply pulpwood logs to each of the woodchip export companies based in Tasmania. These contracts have specific clauses that ensure a preference for domestic processing of suitable logs. Forestry Tasmania also has had commercial contracts of sale to supply pulpwood logs and of course veneer logs and sawlogs for domestic processes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Category 3 logs, to which Senator Murphy referred, are sold to businesses that have approached Forestry Tasmania with commercial proposals for the processing of these relatively low-grade logs. Forestry Tasmania currently has a number of such contracts of sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murphy also referred to a Queensland based business known as Asia Pacific Resources and to its principal, Mr Al Corbet. This business approached Forestry Tasmania in 1993 with a proposal to process category 3 logs at a new site near Hobart. Forestry Tasmania provided significant assistance to the proponent; however, Asia Pacific Resources was unable to deliver its agreed commitments for establishing and commissioning the new processing facility. This failure to perform was despite an agreed extension to the original terms of the agreement with Forestry Tasmania. On this basis, the contract of sale for category 3 logs to Asia Pacific Resources lapsed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Supreme Court of Tasmania has recently ruled in favour of Forestry Tasmania in a dispute with Asia Pacific Resources over the currency of the contract. A longstanding and proven timber business, Tasmanian Timber Engineering, has now developed a firm proposal with Forestry Tasmania for the purchase of the resources that were the subject of Asia Pacific Resources' failed proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to turn to the role of the regional forest agreements in achieving sustainable forest management. As senators will be aware, regional forest agreements will protect native forests through two key measures&mdash;firstly, by establishing a world-class forest reserve system that protects biodiversity, rare and endangered species, a substantial proportion of old&hyphen;growth forests  and wilderness and, secondly, by ensuring that the whole of the forest estate is managed in an ecologically and economically sustainable way for the benefit of this generation and future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">RFAs, as exemplified by the East Gippsland RFA completed in February, provide for ongoing monitoring and a review of forest
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4020"> management practices within an agreed framework to ensure they are up to scratch. RFAs provide the community with the confidence that our forests are being well managed. They are based on excellent science and represent a responsible balance between environmental protection and economic development&mdash;a balance that has been absent in this country for too many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As well as providing secure conservation outcomes, RFAs provide security for the forest industries and the local communities dependent upon them. The 20&hyphen;year agreements, reviewed every five years, will help generate the confidence to make investments in the industry that has been missing for so long, with obvious benefits for regional employment. This security comes from knowing that each RFA will establish a process for working out the long&hyphen;term sustainable yield of the working forest, providing a basis for investment and, importantly, from knowing that, once the Commonwealth is confident that the forest management systems are sustainable, the Commonwealth will sign off on this in each RFA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It needs to be noted that the export controls are ineffective in achieving both environmental protection and industry development goals. The export licensing system implemented in the past could not hope to achieve the level of certainty and security that is being achieved through the RFAs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Resource Assessment Commission and the Industry Commission have both criticised the use of export controls to achieve environmental outcomes as being inappropriate and damaging to the interests of the national economy. These and other reviews have realised that controls on exports do nothing to protect important forest values. Such controls do nothing to stop rare or vulnerable habitat or other important forest areas being harvested or cleared. Controls on exports have no impact, for example, on the clearing of land for agriculture or on the harvesting of forests for processing domestically. The substantial shortcomings of the export control approach are now being rectified by the government through the RFA process. As has been said already, RFAs will ensure areas containing
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> important forest values are protected through the national forest reserve system and that the areas available for commercial harvesting are managed sustainably.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to discuss the relationship between the Export Control (Regional Forest Agreements) Regulations, subject to this motion of disallowance, and the actual RFAs. With RFAs in place, conservationists, industry and the community in general can be confident that environmental and heritage values are being carefully balanced with economic and social values. It is a win&hyphen;win outcome, with gains for regional industry, communities and jobs and substantial gains for the environment as the reserve system is expanded and ecologically sustainable forest management is secured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Export controls are, at best, superfluous in a region where an RFA is in force. The Export Control (Regional Forest Agreements) Regulations, therefore, remove such controls for a particular region while ever that region is subject to an RFA. In such circumstances, access to timber will be controlled by the relevant state authorities within the protections and limits agreed between the Commonwealth and the specific state under the RFA in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Should an RFA cease to have effect, export controls under the Export Control (Unprocessed Wood) Regulations and the Export Control (Hardwood Wood Chips) (1996) Regulations will be reactivated automatically. Under the hardwood woodchips regulations, no export of hardwood woodchips will be allowed from 1 January 2000 unless these woodchips are sourced from a region covered by an RFA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These regulations will help secure the industry investment which is so critical to economic development, and the job creation in rural and regional areas. They will provide  the industry's security that accompanies the security for conservation outcomes that are being achieved in RFAs through the CAR reserve system and ecologically sustainable forest management. As the regional forest agreements come into place over the next two years, industry will be able to make decisions about future investment, secure in the know
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4021"> ledge that the government will not seek, yet again, to move the goalposts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government looks forward to the support of the opposition to defeat this disallowance motion as the regulations are consistent with the intent of the national forest policy statement and the RFA process, which were, of course, developed and initiated by the previous Labor government. They represent good policy and are deserving of ongoing bipartisan support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At present we have a motion before us that deals with the particular issue and also a matter of concern expressed by Senator Murphy. The Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer, has given to this chamber a detailed response to the motion, as it was moved, the reasons for the motion, and a number of matters that were raised in the debate. I know he would be confident in what he said because I am sure that that speech will be used far and wide to ensure that the government holds to what it has said to this chamber. I was impressed by what Senator Parer said to this chamber. It has helped me to clarify my views.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murphy, in part (a), has noted the continued failure of the government to meet an express election commitment to establish a wood and paper industry council. As I understand it, Senator Parer, on behalf of the government, has indicated that that will be up and running by the middle of July. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, I was proposing to move at the end of the motion `and further resolves that if the wood and paper industry council is established within six months of the date of this resolution, the Senate will give favourable consideration to

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I express some disappointment about that, Senator Harradine, because a lot of what Senator Parer said was inaccurate. I do not think it is his fault that it is inaccurate; I think he has been given bad advice. I would like to address some of those things. If I can go to the issue of the Country Sawmillers and the letter that I have from them, you said, `Their problem is not our problem; that is a problem for the Tasmanian government because they are the ones responsible for the management of the forests.' But the reality is this: that it has been the Commonwealth government that has issued export licences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even with the regulations that we are debating, if you go to subregulation 3, Senator Harradine, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, this is the problem. This is one of the principal reasons why I set about moving a disallowance of these regulations. Subregulation 3 says, `Maximum aggregate  mass for year not to be increased'. If you are about removing from the control of regulations the export of wood, how do you do that with any equity? How do you then do that if you have licences that are only issued to the few? That is the problem. Senator Parer said that they have embarked upon an initiative that will bring about investment and industry
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4022"> development and downstream processing. Until that problem is fixed up, that will never occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government cannot understand that, then that is a problem for the government. I urge the minister and the government to withdraw this proposal for the removal of the regulations until they have addressed those problems. It is all well and good to say, `We want to remove the export control over the export of woodchips and wood'&mdash;but only for the few. What about all of the private forest owners and the sawmillers that have to go cap in hand to the three or four export licence holders and say, `Will you buy my wood?' How do they plan for investment? How do they plan for security? Those are the questions that you have not answered, and your department ought to be ashamed of itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will accept the criticism of Senator Parer that we did not do so well, because we did not. We did not deal too well with the export woodchip licences either, but that is no excuse for a government now to continue to not fix it up. That is what you ought to be about. Until those things are addressed, you will never be able to meet the goals and objectives of the national forest policy statement. That statement commits governments&mdash;this government included&mdash;to doing certain things. It commits the government to community service obligations and some of those obligations are&mdash;and very fundamental they are&mdash;about creating employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know, Minister, that you know that, in regions of Australia, and in Tasmania in particular, jobs are going down the drain. A letter that was sent to me today raises that very point about the export licences because your subregulation 3 says that the minister shall not issue further licences. How does that help the people plan?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can recall you mentioning a particular case, namely the one of Asia Pacific Resources, and I did not mention Mr Corbet. And I should correct you, Minister: it is category 8 logs, not category 3. Category 3 logs are actually veneer logs. He was not seeking to saw up veneer logs; he was seeking
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> category 8 logs. I was also referring not to the Bridgewater proposal that the court case was about in Tasmania&mdash;and I will correct some of the things that you have also said about that. I was talking about a sawmill that he owns which is sitting there idle with over $1 million being spent on it at Wynyard in the north&hyphen;west of Tasmania, which he could not buy category 2 sawlogs for. Why don't you ask the forestry commission to address that question, if they are so good at managing a state resource?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the Bridgewater matter that you referred to and the court case that took place, which is subject to appeal, that addressed a technical point on contractual obligations. Nevertheless, that company had to pay, I think, on that particular occasion, a sum of $20,000, which was a bond. What happened was, for the factual record, that the land that the person purchased to build the mill on unfortunately was part of where the national highway was supposed to run. This was not known. Websters, the company that sold the land to him, did not know about it and it had to be the subject of further investigation by the council. It was not under that person's control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But let us put that aside. It does not matter that he was just a bit behind time. It is not as though we have so many people popping up proposing projects in Tasmania that we say, `Look, if you don't stick to the timetable that you've got, then we will knock you over.' There are no proposals; there are no people proposing to do certain things. We have had a number announced by the Liberal government in Tassie, none of which have got up&mdash;including a very major one in the form of a pulp and paper mill. Do you know why it didn't get up? Because the stupid government told the proponents from Taiwan that they would have to go and talk to North Forest  Products about where they would get the resource from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me refer to a letter that was sent to Mr Corbet and other proponents of developments in downstream processing in my state. They say that you have to talk to the exporter for
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4023"> the purposes of getting rid of the residue from your downstream processing activity. Anyone with half a brain will know that you will, in preparing your financial proposal for your development, take account of the market price&mdash;that is the world market price&mdash;for export woodchips. If it comes down to a residue that needs to be then processed as part of your financial package, then you will make an assessment on what that residue is worth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But no person apart from those very lucky few who have an export licence can sell their wood&mdash;Senator Harradine, this is what is important&mdash;because they are offered a piddling amount of money for it. Quite often, as is pointed out in the Country Sawmillers letter, they are under pressure when the major exporters, North Forest Products and Boral, say, `Look, your wood does not meet our specifications, so we're not going to take it,' or `Yes, we will take it, but we will give you $20 a tonne.' How are people in downstream processing in the sawmilling industry supposed to manage under those sorts of circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the very points that I think a government has a responsibility to address. Surely a government must address the problems associated with an industry. We have done it with a number of industries over time. We ought to be thinking about that&mdash;and the national forest policy statement commits governments to doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine is right that I did put a very specific clause in the disallowance motion that relates to the Wood and Paper Industry Council and the setting up of it. I thank the minister for the indication that he has now made. It is totally contradictory to the letter that Minister Moore sent to the union saying they had abolished the council, but I thank the minister anyway and the government for at least taking that step. But that does not solve the problem. If you remove these controls totally across the board, then you will have no capacity to ensure that the very things that Senator Parer talks about will occur. You will have removed all right to have a say.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been involved with the industry for 16 or 17 years. I have stood beside many company executives and copped a lot of flak from both within and outside my own party for defending the industry. I continue to defend the industry. I think it is a good industry and it has great potential, but I think it needs a lot of help. It needs some guidance, and that guidance should come through governments. I think it is obligatory upon governments to do something, if they can, to improve the process of industry, improve its expertise, improve its opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, we have done that across a wide range of industries by providing assistance, whether it be in terms of R&amp;D incentive programs, access to market initiatives through the development import finance facility scheme, although DIFF has now been scrapped, or a whole range of other things we had in place to assist industry development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with this industry is&mdash;and we are as much to blame for this as anybody, and I quite freely acknowledge that; I used to have some rather hectic debates within my own party about this&mdash;that a process has been put in place where&mdash;and this is the only industry in the country that has this set of circumstances&mdash;people growing or harvesting something for export have to sell it through one or two others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not say that to wheat growers or to the coal industry. I heard Senator Parer go on about wanting a coal authority.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Originally, point (b) read:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> calls on the Howard Government to amend the commencement provisions of the Aged Care Bill 1997 to reflect this.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">By virtue of a statement made by the minister, (b) has now been effected, so it is no longer necessary in the motion. As we have seen in its budgets of last year and again this year, this is a government that leaves no section of the community untouched with its
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policies of abolition of services and applying greater costs to members of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have done it in areas such as child care, which has affected families and their children prior to their going to school. They have done it in education&mdash;at school, tertiary and post&hyphen;school levels. They have hit the battlers and the families&mdash;those people who, prior to the last election, the then Leader of the Opposition, the now Prime Minister (Mr Howard), promised to stand up for, protect and make feel relaxed and comfortable. I think most insidiously of all, they have attacked probably the most vulnerable group in our community&mdash;the elderly and the frail, aged people, particularly those with illnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the government announced that it would rip hundreds of millions of dollars out of the aged care sector and introduce a system whereby elderly people wishing to get access into nursing homes would have to pay substantial up&hyphen;front contributions. This is what this motion is about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government was intent on introducing these changes by 1 July this year. But as there is so much uncertainty and concern out in the community, particularly within the elderly community, and as the Aged Care Bill is yet to be passed by this parliament, the government has at least acknowledged the necessity to delay the implementation date of these measures. Of course, that is small compensation for the people who will be affected by the government's proposed legislation, which proposes to make the elderly pay&mdash;and pay substantially&mdash;for access to nursing home care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1985 the previous Labor government set in place an aged care strategy which set out to improve standards in nursing homes and aged care, and which set out to achieve the appropriate balance between the different forms of aged care, whether it be nursing homes, hostel accommodation or care in the home. The program that we set in place, which injected massive expenditure into the system, certainly went a long way towards achieving those goals.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4026">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, in dealing with the neglect that had gone on in the many years beforehand, and recognising that we had an increasing demand for aged care accommodation due to the aging population factor and that many facilities were in need of upgrade, we knew that this was a task that would take some time. The Labor government had a strategy in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of course what we have seen since the election of this government is a change in direction, a change away from the federal government, in cooperation with the states, recognising its responsibility to provide quality care&mdash;particularly, we are talking here today about nursing home care&mdash;for the elderly population, for people who have made their contribution to our community and to our economy and for people for whom it is not a choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an important factor to remember, because this government talk all the time about choice. They talk about the need for smaller government, for less government intervention, for promoting the private sector and for promoting deregulation. Those things are what motivates the proposals that they have in store for the aged care sector and particularly in nursing homes. But what are those things going to mean? They are going to mean lower standards in accommodation and nursing home care. They are going to mean the establishment of a two-tier system, because the proposal will force people who, as I said, do not choose to go into nursing homes but actually need to go into nursing homes because of their age and their particular health concerns to, in many, many cases, sell their own home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government makes all sorts of promises that nobody will be forced to sell their own home. But I can tell you from all of the representations that I have had right across the spectrum&mdash;the industry and the elderly community&mdash;they do not believe this government. They are fearful that that is what is going to happen. When you look at the proposals, that is indeed what is in store for them. What we are going to end up with is a system whereby the wealthy, who can afford to put up bonds, payments, up-front entry fees&mdash;which have no
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> limit on them under the legislation&mdash;will be able to gain access to nursing homes. But the poor, the less well off and those that probably have their home as their only asset will be faced with that terrible dilemma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What a time in their life to have to face that dilemma. What a time for their families to have to face the issue of whether they can get their loved ones, their mothers and fathers, into a nursing home when they need to be in that type of care. The only way that that can happen is by selling off the family home. You can imagine the stress and the pressure that these people are going to be under. That is being reflected in all of the communications that are coming through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I attended a conference in Sydney on Monday, 7 April this year. Unfortunately, the Minister for Family Services, Mrs Moylan, could not attend. She sent along one of her departmental representatives, who was unable to allay any of the fears of the people there. I can tell you that there were hundreds upon hundreds of people at that meeting in Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, there is no upper limit on the entry payment. But of course the entry payments, we are told, are going to be held in trust by the operators of the nursing homes to be used for improving standards of nursing homes. There are no guarantees anywhere in the legislation that we have seen to date that will actually ensure that. It is quite possible, indeed we fear, that in many cases that may be simply taken as profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have from this government&mdash;you really have to ask them why&mdash;is their ideological obsession with deregulation and less government intervention and the provision of fewer government services. Why do they pick on those people that are most vulnerable? We saw the reductions in the allocation of funds for palliative care before and now we are seeing these proposals coming through as well. As I said, it is just so distressing for many people and I am sure honourable senators and members on all sides of the political spectrum would have received many, many complaints and expressions of concern about these proposals.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4027">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many other speakers in this debate. My time is drawing to a close. There is so much more that needs to be said, and it will be said, as the legislation comes on for debate in the parliament. But I do urge the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Senator Ellison), who is listed to speak later on this matter, and the minister and the Prime Minister, to go back and rethink this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the outset, people do not choose to go into nursing homes because they want to. They are an integral part of the provision of adequate and equitable health care for all citizens in this country, including, as I said, those in the remaining days of their life. They are entitled to it as a right. They should not have to get into some negotiating position with the operator of a nursing home simply to achieve that service.</PARA></SPEECH>

The scaremongering and the downright misrepresentation by the Labor Party to the most vulnerable section of our community has been nothing short of disgraceful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have seen over the last 13 years of Labor government is the grinding down of the facilities of nursing homes. We have seen Professor Gregory's report, which documented major deficiencies in nursing home capital works and criticised the nursing home funding system for providing neither the funding nor
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the incentive for providers to maintain their buildings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Gregory found the following information. He found that 11 per cent of nursing homes did not meet fire standards, 15 per cent did not meet health regulations&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a shame, Senator Ellison. But did we ever hear the Labor Party talking about any of this when they were in government? This happened under their administration. Furthermore, Professor Gregory found that 40 per cent of residents had to share a room of more than four beds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To substantiate that, I will quote from the evidence given to us on Monday, 5 May. Senator Forshaw has&mdash;very conveniently&mdash;forgotten to quote this. We have to remember that in 1992&hyphen;93 there was a total of $45 million spent on capital stock. By 1993&hyphen;94 that had declined to $26.5 million. In 1994&hyphen;95 it was down to $15.7 million. In 1995&hyphen;96 it was down to $10.7 million.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What are you spending?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That represents a decline of a mere $35 million on this area of aged care, a decline which took place under the former Labor government that has brought this motion before the Senate today. That is absolutely disgraceful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes being proposed by this government are designed to bring better consumer protection, better and more sustainable funding, better buildings and better facilities for the care of residents. That is all designed to rectify the problems this Labor Party caused when they were in government. They criticise what we are trying to do, which is to ensure that the cart is turned around and that people who qualify for aged care are not put in some dreadful position where they cannot get access to proper quality care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last year of the Labor government the amount that was spent on upgrading was under $1 million. That is nothing short of a disgrace. But did we hear anything from the Labor Party when they were in government? Not a single, solitary syllable. At least we now have a number of people in this place
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4028"> and in the community who are in favour of what the government is doing. Senator Woodley, for example, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think what they've got to consider is whether or not they're prepared to allow decaying nursing homes to continue . . . unsafe, often with improper fire services to those homes . . . to continue or whether they are prepared to make a contribution themselves to the accommodation that they would want to be of a much higher standard than what we've got now.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what Senator Woodley said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, the ACT Council on the Ageing had positive comments to make. Maureen Lister of Aged Care Australia, which represents the church and charity community groups sector that provides most of the hostels and about 45 per cent of all nursing homes, had positive things to say, as did the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association and the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals. The list goes on. The only people who have carping criticisms about the government's proposals are those very people who allowed the system to run down. It is absolutely and utterly disgraceful</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Gregory estimates that what we will need to spend&mdash;on an approximately annual basis&mdash;to not only arrest the decline in nursing home standards but also to bring the stock up to standard will more than double in about 15 years, if we do not take some action now. This Labor Party does not want any action taken now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation where the Labor Party say that people should not be forced to sell their homes. Yet the fact of the matter is that well over 50 per cent of people sell their homes now. Most people do not have a problem with that. One of the interesting things the Labor Party raised in the inquiry was that people should not be forced to sell their homes, because they are somehow going to leave a nursing home and go back home. Unfortunately, it happens to be a fact of life that most people do not leave a nursing home either to go back home or to go and play football, baseball or anything else. They leave a nursing home to go into hospital or to go to their final resting place. This is where the Labor Party keep on frightening the aged and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> so many people out there. The government is trying to fix the decline of nursing homes which occurred under Labor and their mishandling of the situation. I would be very interested to hear what the Labor Party have got to say in terms of defending their $35 million cut to aged care funding&mdash;and nursing homes in particular&mdash;over their last few years of government. That is a shame. That is absolutely scandalous. But they are very careful not to mention it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been further reports this week that are so misleading you would not believe them. Since the minister made further announcements on Monday, we have had the shadow minister going out and saying that the under&hyphen;privileged and the less well&hyphen;off in society are only going to get paid $5 a day. I thought oppositions&mdash;and members of parliament generally&mdash;had some responsibility to at least get close to the truth. This does not even come near it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the opposition, the government was allocating just $5 a day to frail older disadvantaged people. That is totally untruthful. It is a distortion. This additional $5 subsidy will be paid on top of the existing government subsidies which are as high as $100 per day per person. Yet the shadow minister has the gall to say that they are going to get $5 a day. In fact, the average amount this government spends at nursing home resident level is about $29,000. The government will be spending a total of $66 million on assisting providers to care for financially disadvantaged people.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proaches very close to radical social engineering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aged care needs&mdash;and I want to stress this&mdash;deserve a `conservative' response. Aged people do not need to have their lives turned upside-down. This is one of the problems I have with these reforms: they are so radical that I wonder whether or not we will be able to deliver the good outcomes we all want. The Democrats are not afraid of change; we are not even afraid of radical change. But we will not support any proposals which are as radical as those contained in the Aged Care Bill 1997, unless we are convinced that the proposals have been the subject of an adequate consultation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) a tick in this regard. I think she has tried very hard to consult. She certainly has consulted with me. But let us also make sure that we take note of all that has been said in that consultation process. I hear what Senator Knowles said, and I think she also is able to selectively quote&mdash;as we all do&mdash;from the evidence given. Let us make sure that we take on board all of the evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also need to be convinced that all of the comments and concerns raised during that process have been fully considered and, where necessary, incorporated into the existing proposal. I want to have discussions with the minister, because we would have some pretty serious amendments to the legislation as it is presented to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to know that the various aspects of the reform will work in practice&mdash;and, of course, I suppose even to say it is obvious. But there are serious concerns which have been raised, and we would want to make sure they are met. We would want to make sure that there are adequate safeguards in place to protect the more vulnerable and powerless members of the community from unnecessary hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me comment on the minister's proposal to offer a subsidy of $5 a day. As I understand it, that is a subsidy to match the problem of no accommodation bond being available from financially disadvantaged residents. If that is so, if that is what the $5 a day is for, the problem is that it falls far short of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4030"> recommendation of the Gregory report, which came out some time ago and which was for a subsidy of $12 a day. So there is a gap already in the proposal in the Gregory report and what the minister is offering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that I think Minister Moylan is keen to make some worthwhile policy changes. But the problem is that good policy cannot survive a budget rip-off of funds from the sector. No matter how good the words are, unless the numbers match those words, the minister will not be able to deliver good policy&mdash;and that certainly is a deep concern which the Democrats have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the minister is going to have to go back to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and seek more funds, particularly in this area of the subsidy to match the accommodation bond which will be paid by those able to pay. So I repeat: she will have to go back to the Treasurer and seek more funds for the sake of aged people in this country, but especially for the sake of those who are financially disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me put on the record some of the concerns that I heard in the inquiry which was conducted&mdash;and I spent a fair bit of time at those hearings as well&mdash;particularly the community's concern about the introduction of nursing home entry fees. The New South Wales Council of Senior Citizens Associations said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of members of affiliated associations, COSCA objects vehemently to the way in which the Aged Care Bill 1997 has been presented to parliament, following totally inadequate consultation and similar limited time of 10 calendar days only allowed for comment by concerned current and aspiring residents of nursing homes, their families, carers and other interested persons, on unsatisfactory aspects of a lengthy and complicated piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The motion before us reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The community's overwhelming opposition to the introduction of nursing home entry fees,</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What I am saying in response to that is that there is a concern out there. The question is whether it is because of Labor's scare campaign, as the minister claims, or whether it is a real concern that people have. I think it is probably the second. The problem has been that I do not think the minister has really been
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the public debate sufficiently to explain what it is she is on about. But that is her problem, and it is no use blaming the Labor Party for running a so&hyphen;called scare campaign if the government has not been able to put the opposing point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lot of concern in the community. We have had quite a number of letters from religious and community organisations which have a great deal of experience in the area of aged care. Let me just list some of the concerns they have raised. The first is the unrealistic time frame of 1 July. Let us give the minister another tick that she has heard that and has extended that time to 1 October. Whether that will give sufficient time or not we are still needing to hear, but the few consultations I have had give me a mixed reaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The removal of the hostel care subsidy is a big concern, particularly for those not&hyphen;for&hyphen;profit organisations, which  are the ones which mainly run hostels. The lack of information, until this week, on funding levels has made it very difficult for aged care providers formulating their budget targets for the 1997&hyphen;98 financial year. Other concerns are the loss of variable fees, the compatibility of federal with state legislation and the unknown details and costs of the prudential arrangements. Those are concerns which have been raised. We have had hundreds of form letters from elderly people. These letters state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the government has said that an entry fee will only be around $26,000, I believe that proprietors will demand much more. In fact, some hostel proprietors are already charging an entry fee of between $60,000 and $80,000. As demand for nursing home beds grows it can be expected that the actual entry fee will be much higher in the future . . . I am very worried that, if this legislation is passed, good nursing home care for frail older people will only be for those who can pay.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I was at an aged care conference about two weeks ago where fees of $300,000 to $400,000 were mentioned. I need to ask the minister a question about that when I get the transcript, so I can be sure that my question is accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can share with the Senate that the Democrats certainly still have concerns. We are willing to work for a good outcome. Unlike
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4031"> the Labor Party, we are not necessarily threatening to chuck out the bill, but we do want to see our concerns met, and until they are we will continue to be a little ambivalent about this legislation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to put forward very strongly the view of the Australian Labor Party, that we are opposed to the imposition of entry fees for nursing homes and we believe that the methodology that is being applied by this government is inequitable and socially backward and will adversely affect those who are disadvantaged and elderly in our community&mdash;some of those who are absolutely the very worst off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It concerns me that so many members of the coalition are happily prepared to march down this road without raising any real queries. In particular, I am somewhat startled by members of the Community Affairs Committee on the coalition side who seem not to have heard the evidence that was provided to us from both operators of aged care institutions and representative groups of the elderly such as the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pretty much on the record these days what the entry fee means, although I notice that the coalition is still trying to allege that some of the higher figures suggested by us are some sort of scare tactic or are untrue. In fact, the legislation clearly states that, in determining what the entry fee for a nursing home is, the only limitation that can be placed on it is that the resident entering that home be left with the sum of $22,500. That is a figure that does not exclude the family home, as a lot of tests do, but includes it. So if you are someone who has had a fairly average income for most of your life and you become frail and have to enter a nursing home, you can be required to sell your home and provide the nursing home with all those funds, except for that small figure that I have mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this debate first started sometime last year shortly after the budget, I suggested in this chamber that that fee could be a figure of approximately $26,000. That is a figure that we extrapolated from the entry fees that are provided in hostels. I remember being
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> screamed down by members of the coalition, who said that that was an untrue statement and an exaggeration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought Senator Knowles could have come in here with good grace apologising for those statements rather than reasserting the falsehood because of the evidence that we took in the Community Affairs References Committee. I really have not had a lot of time to look, but I had a quick flick through as I was preparing today. That radical group&mdash;that is, Mr Brotherhood, the Chief Executive Officer of the National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals; I would not think a Labor Party front&mdash;said very clearly when asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Have any of your affiliates indicated what their bond levels are going to be?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Brotherhood</EMPHASIS> &mdash;No, not at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The chair pressed the point and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any ballpark figures?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Brotherhood</EMPHASIS> &mdash;It is probably about $50,000 at this stage. Many providers do not think they will initially receive a very high bond, nor will they ask for it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The next question I asked was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Was the $50,000 for the single room or for the share room?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Brotherhood</EMPHASIS> &mdash;That was for the single room.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We also received evidence later the same day from commentators on the legislation, people who were presently involved in the nursing home industry, that in fact the entry fees that could be requested could in some cases be as high as $90,000. So I certainly wish to say that our initial allegations, or suggestions, that the fees could be as high as $26,000 were not inaccurate in that they were too high but inaccurate in that they were too low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to deal with some furphies that were raised earlier in debate&mdash;that is, the reliance of this government on the Gregory report as somehow justifying the requirement of this entry fee. I have to put very clearly on the record that the Gregory report did not suggest that there should be an entry fee, but in fact clearly stated as a recommendation that an entry fee should not be the means of raising capital. I find it somewhat surprising that this government would attempt to mislead the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4032"> Senate and the community by somehow saying that it is relying on that report in pursuing this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that, despite the complaints from the coalition government about our performance in terms of capital contributions to nursing homes&mdash;and I must confess that I thought our levels of expenditure could have been higher, and certainly the nursing homes needed it&mdash;at least we spent some money, and the figures were outlined by Senator Knowles. This government is spending nil on capital contributions to nursing homes. In fact, the coalition government in 1996 cut $577 million over four years from aged care. If that is a government that gives priority to providing accommodation to those aged people, I am somewhat surprised because a cut of that magnitude over four years is not an indication in my mind of this government caring for elderly people and caring about the funding of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most worrying thing about this entry fee is the fact that it creates a two-tiered system. It creates a situation for those who can pay, for those who are in the non-disadvantaged designation. They will be able to pay an entry fee and get into a nursing home that will be of an extremely high quality. For those unfortunate people who are pensioners, who do not have a capital base, who do not have a home or who have had a difficult life, they, again, will be in a difficult position under this coalition's government's policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed that some umbrage was taken by Senator Knowles in relation to the allegation that only an additional $5 per day would be provided for capital assistance for those people who are disadvantaged. The fact is that that is exactly the case. There are the ongoing subsidies as residential fees, as were provided under our government, but, in order to redress the imbalance of the funds that can be taken from those who are well off, this government will be providing the paltry sum of $5 per day. What is this going to mean?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just apply a bit of commonsense to this proposition. You are a nursing home and you can chose to allow entry to someone who provides you with the sum of $5 a day or
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> someone who can provide you with $88,000 or maybe more. From that $88,000, you are entitled to not only take away the sum of $2,600 per year as a payment but also retain any interest that is made out of that fund that the nursing home holds. The interesting thing about that $2,600 is that it is required to be spent in providing care for elderly people in the nursing home, but on the second sum, that interest figure, there is no such restriction provided in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The interest that you draw off the money that you obtain from the aged persons entering your home is not limited in any way. If you are a for profit aged care institution, there is nothing in this legislation that prevents you from keeping that interest in your pocket and distributing it to your owners as profit. Of course, the point that is obvious to everybody in the community is that the larger the sum that is provided as an accommodation fee, or an accommodation bond, as this coalition is trying to call it, the more interest you will be able to draw off those funds and the greater the amount of money that you can retain for your benefit. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Even with her embarrassing postponement today, Mrs Moylan still hasn't outlined how a prudential system will work . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She refers to a prudential system for the accommodation bonds. They had accommodation bonds for the hostels with no prudential system at all. If the hostel or the organisation running the hostel&mdash;and there are many of them that are community based, not large organisations&mdash;had gone down the tube, where was the prudential arrangement for them? There was no arrangement. Yet Ms Macklin gets up and talks about the fact that Mrs Moylan had not outlined one. Well, she has now and we will have prudential arrangements, unlike the Labor Party, which had no prudential arrangements and no guarantees for older people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one press release. Now we go on to the next press release. They are appalling; I cannot believe it. In her press release of 22 May, Ms Macklin says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless Minister Moylan postpones her `de facto death duty' agenda and sorts out the mess, the Aged Care sector is not going to escape the general incompetence that we have come to expect from Mr Howard's government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is just unbelievable. A de facto death duty. You would think that the Labor Party did not have an ingoing&mdash;or, as we are now calling it, an accommodation bond&mdash;into hostels when they were in government. They did. But they did not call it a de facto death duty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind honourable senators on the other side that, of the people in hostels, 22 per cent of them have a personal care level which is equivalent to those nursing home residents in the mid&hyphen;range nursing home category. So 22 per cent of residents could easily be in a nursing home. They paid an ingoing but we do not call that a de facto death duty. Oh, no. We have Ms Macklin running around saying, `They'll have to sell their homes. It's terrible. You don't choose to go into a nursing home; you choose to go into a hostel.' What absolute rubbish. It means that Ms Macklin has hardly been to a nursing home or a hostel, because if she goes around
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4034"> those hostels she will see what I have seen in the 10 years I have been in parliament: that the level of dependency has increased dramatically, up to something like an average age of 81 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The level of dependency in hostels is now very high, with 22 per cent of people being eligible for or equivalent to mid&hyphen;range nursing home care. They paid an ingoing&mdash;the Labor Party never called it a de facto death duty&mdash;and those people had to go into a hostel because they were so frail. They did not choose to go. But, because we are now looking at the fact that the level of dependency has increased and we are setting up a much more flexible system, we have Ms Macklin running around making these ridiculous claims. Nowhere do I see Ms Macklin say, `Doesn't this system give us flexibility? Isn't it fantastic that an older person living in a rural area where there was only a hostel now won't have to move 150 kilometres down the road to a nursing home, away from a spouse or family or grandchildren who can pop in and see them?' This is the sort of system that will allow compassionate caring for older people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Neal, on the other side, said that we were providing nothing for capital&mdash;and I have debunked that myth she is spreading around. What was the Labor Party going to do about the fact that Professor Gregory had said we needed $540 million to bring nursing homes up to current standard? What do we see in their policy? Eight paragraphs of nothing. In government, with the resources of a whole department to produce a policy, we get eight paragraphs that tell us nothing about what they would do. Professor Gregory had told them that, just to bring nursing homes up to current standard, we need $540 million. They had no plan to do anything about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the coalition comes up with a plan extending the arrangements that now exist in hostels, what do those on the other side do? They run around scaring older people, saying they will have to sell their homes. I have press release after press release that Ms Macklin has put out saying, `They have to sell their homes. They have to change their wills.' She does not say here that they have six
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> months before they have to pay their ingoing or their accommodation bond and that they do not have to sell their homes: they can come to another arrangement, like renting their homes and paying the equivalent of the interest on their accommodation bond.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Neal talked about the fact that residents do not get the interest on their money. They did not get it in hostels when Labor was in government either. That is the whole purpose of this. That is why many of the hostels are up to scratch and at world standard&mdash;because they had the interest from the ingoing money to actually improve the capital of those hostels. But there was no such thing for nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we have seen, as Professor Gregory said, is four people in one ward in a nursing home and nursing homes that do not have appropriate fire protection and do not meet fire standards&mdash;and the Labor Party did nothing about it. They sat on their hands because they did not know what to do. It was appalling. Ms Macklin ought to hang her head in shame, judging by the detail in these press releases. Another one of her press releases from 2 May stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nursing home care is health care, and people should not have to sell their homes to get an adequate standard of care at the end of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Twenty&hyphen;two per cent of people currently in hostels are eligible for nursing homes, but it was okay for them, as I said, to pay an ingoing fee. They did not have to sell their homes, but why didn't Ms Macklin say that those 22 per cent&mdash;who really ought to be ineligible and ought to be in a nursing home&mdash;were getting health care in hostels?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I think Steven Spielberg ought to look out because there is another person around who is good at constructing terrifying fantasies, and her name is Jenny Macklin.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me just say that they have the opportunity to do it, and I thank Senator Patterson for the interjection. I can say that I have been out there in the electorate. I have been to meetings where the aged have been gathered, and there was one particular meeting recently in north Brisbane.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that meeting, quite unsolicited, the aged persons in attendance voiced their opposition to and doubts about the intentions of the government's bill. They were quite clearly disturbed at what they thought would come down the track as a result of this legislation. I have also been in the position where I have presented over 700 signatures in petitions asking this government not to go down the path of charging fees to get into nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Patterson said about the member for Jagajaga, Ms Macklin, was not correct. Senator Patterson made the assertion that Ms Macklin's views on the issue of choice about going into either a hostel or a nursing home were incorrect. It is quite clear that those people who are going into hostels have a clear choice&mdash;they are in the situation health&hyphen;wise to make a choice about whether or not to go into a hostel. On the other hand, those people who are going into nursing homes invariably have no choice whatsoever.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was the concern that was being expressed to me and to other people who were in attendance at this particular meeting&mdash;people do not see themselves as having a real choice when it comes to going into a nursing home. It is generally a fait accompli because of the state of their health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the people at that particular meeting voiced their views on why the elderly and the sick were constantly targeted by this government. The actions of the government led one elderly lady to put the comment at the meeting, `Why are they'&mdash;meaning the government&mdash;`constantly putting the boot into the elderly?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area where this meeting was held&mdash;and it was in Sandgate in Brisbane&mdash;there is a high percentage of elderly people who are reliant on the pension, who are not generally considered to be affluent and who will suffer, in spite of what Senator Patterson said, under the two-tier aged care system that will develop under the government's aged care bill. Sandgate is the site of a major state run nursing home&mdash;that is, Eventide. When one considers that there is limited accommodation in the area as it is and that resources are being stretched to the full now, there is real concern about this initiative that the government is undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I really think what needs to be done in this debate is to put a human face on it. There is no better way to do that than to look at the reactions of a constituent from Queensland, a Mrs Sallows, who wrote to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in March this year. If I just quote a couple of selected areas from this letter, one will see the genuine concerns that people have. This letter was not solicited, but it shows the difficulties that people are having. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been led to believe that as a family she would be classed as `Financially Disadvantaged'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">this is the writer referring to her mother&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and would not have to pay any entry fees. However upon admission I was further advised that Government guidelines are such that because she has owned her home within the last 2 years then `Financially Disadvantaged' did not apply in her case. (The home has been left to my sister, brother and myself with the proviso that my
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4036"> brother can  live there for 3 years after both our parents have passed on.)</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These are the concerns that people are expressing. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you can see, selling the home (as has been mentioned to me on numerous occasions) would not be an option, and furthermore neither of my parents are in a position to authorise such a sale. It had also been mentioned to me that I should endeavour to get a bridging loan from a bank to pay entry fees. What bank would entertain giving such a loan to pensioners and even if they did where would we get the money from to pay the interest each month for an indefinite period of time.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These are no economic analysts; these are no financial giants. These are ordinary people out there in the community who are concerned about what they face with respect to their parents. I really think it is summed up towards the end of the letter, when it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the health condition of both my parents we are unable adequately to look after them at any of our homes. Also my sister does not live in Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I realise we are only one family but there must be many others in similar circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is the concern that people out there in the broader community have. This initiative is going to impact not just on the elderly themselves but on their next of kin as well. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where can we go for advice, help and assistance. Do we just take our elderly parents to the Hospital door and leave them with a note attached `NAME UNKNOWN&mdash;NO NEXT OF KIN' and let the hospital do what they can. It seems a sad state of affairs when the elderly cannot be given the best possible to see them through to the end of their lives without having to find a great deal of money.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The concern is out there. Whilst this is only one letter, I am led to believe that there are numerous letters couched in this vein that have been received by many of us on this side of the chamber. I would be surprised if they have not been received by those on the other side. They are not just fleeting fears; they are real fears and real concerns about the imposts that will face them. They are real concerns about the double standards that will emerge as a result of the government's policies in this area. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue that probably needs to be addressed, but there is insufficient time, is the issue of the supervision of aged care as a result of this bill. Whilst the impost of $26,000 and the issue of the subsidy are very important issues, there is also real concern about the actual supervision of the care that will be given within those hostels and within the nursing homes in particular. If one reads between the lines, one sees that part of the agenda is to remove the registered nurse from within those institutions. This causes grave concern to the elderly, who place such a great deal of trust, respect and faith in a person such as a registered nurse. This adds further to the concerns that they have with this very piece of legislation that will be debated at a later stage in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have are problems that are being created by the government, not by the opposition. But the government does not have the courage to face up to members of the public and deal with them in a fair and compassionate way. Whilst Senator Woodley said that the government and the opposition were throwing bombs at each other and tried to make himself out to be a peacemaker, I do not know whether the Democrats necessarily have the answers either. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose elements within this motion specifically, and also the general thrust of it. First of all, I would like to make the point that we do have accommodation bonds for hostels. The system of charging accommodation bonds for hostels has greatly improved the standard and quality of facilities in hostels around Australia. The point about this is that the policy of charging accommodation bonds for hostels was introduced by the ALP. This proposal to introduce accommodation bonds for nursing homes is simply duplicating the policy which the ALP introduced for hostels and applying it to nursing homes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the course of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee hearings on this matter, a very eminent geriatrician, Dr Norman Marinovich, who is a consultant physician and geriatrician at Fremantle Hospital in Western Australia, was asked whether
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4037"> or not the system of charging accommodation bonds for hostels was causing financial disadvantage to people going into hostels. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have found that patients and their families have generally not objected&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">to paying entry fees for hostels&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">first of all. Secondly, it has not caused significant problems financially to those people or their families by having to provide that ingoing fee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When asked to comment on whether or not he thought accommodation bonds for nursing homes would cause any problems, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I envisage that most patients and their families in particular, will be able to take an ingoing fee, if it is a reasonable one, in their stride as they have with hostels, without too many problems.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that little bit of information underlines the hypocrisy of the whole case that the ALP has been making in objecting to these proposals introduced by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before looking at the four specific points raised by Senator Carr, I would like to briefly draw the Senate's attention to this government's commitment to addressing the desperate state of our nursing homes. I have seen nursing homes in the metropolitan area in my work as a general practitioner and I assure the Senate that they are appalling. The conditions in nursing homes really do need to be improved. Improving them costs money and this proposal is a means of doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Forty per cent of nursing home residents have to share a room of more than four beds. Conditions are cramped, with beds often being less than one metre apart. As Senator Patterson mentioned, 11 per cent of nursing homes do not meet fire standards and 15 per cent do not meet health standards. These problems are the legacy of Labor. The previous government commissioned a report on nursing homes by Professor Gregory and, in his report, Professor Gregory detailed the problems for the former government and offered solutions. Labor did not do anything about those recommendations. In fact, instead of doing anything positive, they responded by cutting funds to nursing homes, and that surely must have aggravated the conditions in them. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only is the current system inefficient for service providers but also the bureaucratic and administrative processes currently required divert the service providers from providing care while still not guaranteeing the quality of care. Labor left the community without enough funding for dementia patients and has created problems for families trying to find a place which will give a decent standard of care and accommodation to their elderly relatives as they pass towards the end of their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor must take full responsibility for the state we find our nursing homes in today. It is in response to that terrible situation that Labor left that the government has introduced these proposals. If they had any sincerity or honesty about this matter, Labor should have admitted the error of their ways and acknowledged that this package, introduced by the government, is responsible and caring&mdash;but they have not done that. Instead, they have engaged in a program of scaremongering. One can only say that it is a bit rich, if not outrageous and totally dishonest, for the opposition to come into this place and start criticising the government when we have acted responsibly and acted to clean up the mess Labor left behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will now address the specific points made in the motion. I strongly oppose the first point made by Senator Carr when he asked the Senate to note:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the community's overwhelming opposition to the introduction of nursing home entry fees.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am not sure where the senator gets his information from but the government has certainly not seen any evidence of `overwhelming opposition' to these changes. In fact, there has been quite a lot of overwhelming support, and I would like to mention where the support has come from. Firstly, Mr Jim Purcell, from the ACT Council on the Ageing, on ABC Radio, Canberra, on 11 February 1997, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the present time with the two systems, hostels and nursing homes you have . . . two different bureaucratic structures to look after them and two different sets of rules which have been very confusing.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">to patients as well as their relatives. He continued:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4038">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under this new system,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">proposed by the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a person can go into a residential care facility and with reasonable confidence will be able to stay there all their life with a high level of care they then need and progressively more complex level of care as their age or as their need increases.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Another endorsement came from Maureen Lister of Aged Care Australia, which represents the church and charity community group sector that provides most of the hostels and about 45 per cent of all nursing homes. On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The World Today</EMPHASIS> , on ABC Radio on 11 February, Miss Lister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certainly for the majority of pensioners there will not be a requirement for them to pay an accommodation bond at all and entry to an aged care facility will be based entirely on the care need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We've had entry contributions in the hostel system for some ten years and I don't believe that residents of hostels would ever say that there's been any discrimination against their admission on the basis of the amount of assets they have had.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will be able to see quite significant improvements in the buildings of nursing homes and everyone knows that is gravely needed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association, in a media release dated 11 February 1997, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall the new aged care legislation delivers incentives for aged care service providers to strive for continuous improvement in care standards and upgrade accommodation standards.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The National Association of Nursing Homes and Private Hospitals, in a media release, again, dated 11 February, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aged Care Structural reforms guarantee a better system of residential care under an accreditation and quality assurance system that will allow for vast improvements in aged care under a spirit of competition. No such competition or incentive to better accommodation prevails under the existing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These are strong words of praise which acknowledge the benefits these government reforms will provide for consumers and providers. The motion put by the opposition therefore fails on its first assumption, which stated that this aged care package has overwhelming opposition from the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also fails in part (ii) where it states that the timetable is unrealistic. The shift of the date to 1 October 1997 is required because
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the income testing component of the legislation must start three months before the commencement of the reforms. It is therefore quite unreasonable for the opposition to seek to imply that this start&hyphen;up date is not appropriate. There is absolutely no need for a start&hyphen;up date beyond 1 October. All the key players, including the industry itself, have indicated that they can support a start&hyphen;up date of 1 October.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned that the opposition is doing little more than wasting the Senate's time with this motion. I make the point, however, that the government is prepared to listen to criticism. We believe that this package introduces much needed improvement. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to rise to speak on the notice of motion, moved by my colleague, Senator Carr, regarding the important announcement in a press release on Monday by the Minister for Family Services, Ms Moylan&mdash;that there will be at least a three month delay in the introduction of nursing home entry fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This indicates, that the effort, to allegedly build a secure future for all older Australians, in partnership with the aged care industry, remains fraught with problems, not the least of which is the Government's failure to guarantee to us, on this side of the Chamber, that a two tier system will not develop because of the introduction of the Aged Care Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I read the response of the Prime Minister to a question without notice by the Shadow Minister, Ms Macklin on Monday about the delay on the Aged Care Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a bit of a smoke screen, being perpetuated by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Family Services, that the central opposition to the Bill is the compelling of people who can afford to do so, to make a contribution towards their care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is not the paramount issue that concerns us on this side of the Chamber. What is of concern to us, is what is concerning groups all over the country, and that is, the implications for those older, sick poorer people. If the Federal Liberal Government continues with its current policies where are these  people going to fit in under a market model of nursing home care?
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4039"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I recall that the Minister for Family Services, earlier this year circulated a statement entitled `Steps to Better Care' about the dawning of a new era in the provision of residential aged care. Well at the moment the Minister appears to be doing a bit of a two step shuffle, that is one step forward two steps back.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Shadow Minister, Jenny Macklin stated the actions of the Minister of adopting a piecemeal or ad hoc approach to aged care is creating further concern in the elderly community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is no good for Senators on the other side to claim that we on this side of the Chamber are initiating this uproar of concern. The Minister herself is creating this environment of instability sweeping across the elderly community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister, unfortunately is compelled to dance this jig, moving to and fro, because the Howard Government's true motivation is to save money not to ensure that all residents are funded properly, according to their care needs, no matter where they are residing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One has only to read the Commission of Audit Report, a blue print that has been relied upon by the Federal Liberal Government for policy direction, to realise what is the true motivation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many sections of the Australian populace are petrified about Australia's ageing population and its contingent pressure on expenditure. That is all well and good, but the crisis that is still some way off, has been recognised, and good solid government policy should be able to confront it down the track. Unfortunately this concern in the community, about our ageing society, has been utilised by the Liberal party, by becoming apparent, probably in polling and has been cunningly utilised to justify the measure of cutting over $500 million from aged care in the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my own home state of Tasmania in another 50 years the median age will be close to 50 with a population likely to be less than it was in 1987. It is no surprise to know that on the current trend with so many of our young leaving the Island that our population will go into negative growth. Tasmania's position is a lot worse than the remainder of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tasmanian Liberal Minister for Community and Health Services, recognises that the crisis con, is only an excuse for arbitrary budget cuts and has pledged to prohibit new cost burdens on Tasmania by the Commonwealth in relation to aged care. No doubt the State Minister is very concerned about the matter of entry fees, especially when there is no upper limit on the size of the entry fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt that the ageing of our population warrants good strong long term policies, to ensure we never reach a crisis in the future. The Federal Liberal Government con, has been to use the concern in the community on ageing, to argue the case for a massive cut when in fact these cuts are unwarranted.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That aside, as I said what has been of real concern on this side of the Chamber from the outset, when the Aged Care Bill in the other place was introduced, has been the failure by the Minister to ensure that an equitable service will be delivered under a market model. I mentioned earlier about the likelihood of a two tiered system resulting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from the fact that currently the majority of individuals entering a nursing home have suffered a serious illness, and are not in a position, I would envisage to be on an equal footing to negotiate, a contract with an individual who is in business to make a profit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also the difficulty of ensuring, under the market model that if you are wealthy the, `I'm all right Jack' scenario, will end up being the rule of thumb, with those better off, as the Shadow Minister said obtaining the ensuite rooms with the river views. While concessional residents who are equally frail and ill, if they are admitted to such a home in the first place, they will be accommodated in rooms with four walls wash basin and prison bed. Obviously, that statement may be a little over the top, but I make it to illustrate the point that the Minister needs to guarantee people will get access on basis of need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Gregory Report stated on the matter of entry fees, and I quote: `The sheer size of entry contributions and the impact on a client's life, of having to agree to sell assets to receive care, would be a considerable barrier to entry'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It might be all right for the Prime Minister to speak about his personal experiences in visiting new nursing home complexes, but what about the lack of swisho or elite nursing homes in the poorer socio economic regions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We all know that certain large nursing home chains in the blue ribbon regions will prosper under the new legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aged, Health and Community Groups fear that in the poorer socio economic regions in Australia by moving to the market model and with the withdrawing of capital grants that there will be a gradual running down of nursing homes in such regions as operators will be forced to reduce capital expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There would be no compulsion on homes to make them spend the entry fees on capital improvements. For a nursing home that down the track, supplies care to a particular concessional resident market niche, more by necessity than choice, they could find difficulty in remaining operational if they are unable to pay for capital upgrades. There is the risk they could fall below the minimum standard of buildings and services required, and lose their certification to charge. It will be interesting to see how the bureaucracy deals with closing down a nursing home because of poor capital stock under the proposed system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would have thought, that the whole issue of the monitoring of the quality of care, should have been one of the first things settled under the reforms. I understand
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4040"> that the matter of auditing procedures has not been settled and I find this situation deplorable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been stated that we cannot assume that the sick older generations are going to be cashed up or asset rich.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure by the Government, to provide adequate supplementary funding for concessional residents, who are unable to pay the entrance fee also is a worrying matter. If any one organisation could be responsible for creating doubt in the mind of the Minister and cause her to postpone commencement, it was the concerns of the Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association Limited and the Council on the Ageing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council for the Ageing stated publicly in February that the problems that have been exposed in recent weeks and especially in the last few days needed to be rectified. Why wasn't it sorted out prior to drafting the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An issue also, that has been raised, is the danger of the Aged Reforms creating an environment whereby poorer residents in a home become institutionalised, because they become economically dependent on that home. It must be assured that there must remain a particular level of disposable income for those concessional residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition has never said that improvements in the development of government policy on aged care, cannot be initiated to build upon what remains, in my view, a period of solid policy development of reconstruction and reform when Labor was in Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the Opposition believe, as many groups across the nation believe, is that the Federal Liberal Government and the Minister concerned, need to reconsider how their aged care program will affect those poorer aged people in our community.</PARA>

It is worth noting the challenge in front of the people who are down there working for us and on our behalf.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I have a concern with the nursing homes standards review panels reports and I would like to take the opportunity to speak on these reports. My concern is that the area of nursing homes has to be one that will continue to be of critical concern to governments and policy makers in this country. We are an ageing population and, over the years, there has been more and more demand for nursing home accommodation by our older citizens. That demand comes from all aspects of our community. One particular area that I have had close contact with for a long time has been the area of the demands from the part of the community that does not speak English.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people of non-English speaking backgrounds get old, they quite often find themselves in isolation in a nursing home environment because of the lack of capacity to communicate in a language that they understand. This has a number of effects. It has the effect of them getting inappropriate
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> food, their medical needs quite often do not get understood and their day-to-day concerns in terms of contact with family and so on are often ignored. I think it is an area which not only has been of concern over recent years but also will be one of increasing concern as the Australian population becomes older.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to take aged care accommodation in this country seriously for all Australians and we have to take it seriously for those who have migrated here, have spent some 50, 60, 70 years of their lives here but, at the end of the day, have found themselves in need of appropriate and sensitive nursing home accommodation. I think it is fair to say that governments and particularly the administration of nursing home accommodation have not really catered for the needs and peculiar circumstances of these aged people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Nursing Home Standards Review Panel is one mechanism whereby standards in nursing homes can be reviewed, monitored and assessed. But quite often what happens in situations involving those of non-English speaking backgrounds is that their concerns and their complaints are not heard through the system and in the system. They are not heard because more often than not silence on their part, silence because of language problems, is taken as meaning compliance and satisfaction with the process. There could be nothing further from the truth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the absence of mechanisms which in fact elicit the views of those people, we can never be satisfied as policy makers in this place that the needs of old people of non-English speaking backgrounds are catered for. They cannot complain and quite often the standards re views do not tap into their concerns. What I think needs to happen is for there to be a new approach to the way that we review the services for those old people of non-English speaking backgrounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system at the moment in some respects can be called goofy, as it does not cater for their needs, or supercilious in terms of the way it approaches them. But there needs to be a system in place which can actually monitor those people's needs and monitor their diffi

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are forgotten people. They are isolated. They are isolated because of age, they are isolated because of language, and they are isolated because the system has not as yet found a way of tapping into their particular plights and problems. Quite often this can be serious. It can lead to death, and it can lead to more serious and aggravated injury. The point I want to make this evening is that, from the routine to the emergency situation, I do not think that these people are being catered for.</PARA></SPEECH>

Yet, when one looks at the report, one sees it is fairly thin. It is only in the Queensland report that there is any report about the panel recommending that three of the five nursing homes reviewed be declared as not satisfying Commonwealth standards and that financial sanctions be imposed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Hogg, I was a bit curious about this report of the nursing homes standards review panels. In Tasmania there have not been any reviews, which I find rather interesting. So far as nursing homes are concerned, I think it is very true that we ought to be sure that nursing homes meet the standards. Cadorna House, a nursing home in Launceston, Tasmania, does not meet the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4044"> standards, according to a report prepared by the Department of Health and Family Services, yet it was somehow granted funding by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a somewhat lacklustre report from the minister. We might have a review panel but they do not seem to do much. I was told by the department that, under the National Health Act 1953, section 45(e), I think&mdash;it is referred to in the report&mdash;they can impose sanctions for nursing homes that do not meet the standards. Why is it that a nursing home in Launceston can be granted funding by the government when it has not met the standards? This is a concern for a lot of other nursing homes that were built and had to meet the standards that were applied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be interested to hear from the government and the minister about what they intend to do about that. If we are going to proceed to make further changes to nursing care, are there going to be requirements to adhere to standards&mdash;are there going to be standards&mdash;and are these review panels going to ensure that they are maintained and met?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would appear to be a supercilious, goofy minister has sent us a report that really does not appear to hold too much water. Quite frankly, the mere fact that this report has little content and really does not tell you much, even for those states where reviews were done, leaves you wondering what the government's intention is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must be a real concern for people who will be going into nursing homes. I know in the case of Cadorna House that there is significant concern with some of the residents. The fact is it does not meet the standard, because room sizes are wrong and other facilities clearly do not meet the standard. It was a rather damning report from the department of health about this particular nursing home&mdash;and the government proceeded to fund it!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were in government, we did not offer them any money, because they did not meet the standards. We actually instituted a process whereby there was an analysis done on what was required at that nursing home. I think half a million dollars was supposed to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have been spent to bring it up to scratch. As I said, the minister ought to be questioned very strongly about why she has not ensured that this home, and probably a few others, meets the standards. One home in Hobart, I think, was closed because it did not meet the standards. But in Launceston a privately owned one received government funding, as I said, even though the report said that it simply does not meet the standard. There have been a number of people who have stayed in that home who have serious concerns with regard to the management and the way in which they conduct themselves towards the people who are staying in the home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the government to seriously consider the process with the review panel. It is no reflection on the people that are on the panels. They clearly are endeavouring to do their job, I think. But I think it is up to the government, at the end of the day, to take some action and ensure that nursing homes do meet standards and that they are maintained over time to ensure that the interests of the people using them are protected.</PARA>

I have grave concern for one of the important areas of operation in that college. It is a very important college, training the seafarers of this and other nations, but also conducting some important research. On page 20 of the report, the Australian Maritime  Engineering Cooperative Research Centre reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The funding of $14.5M for the Australian Maritime Hydrodynamics Facility&mdash;allocated last year for the joint proposal from AMECRC and AMC&mdash;was withdrawn as a part of the new Federal Government's plan to restore the Commonwealth budget to surplus. Given the importance of the proposed facility to Australia, AMC and the AMECRC are actively exploring alternative arrangements for the facility and associated research.
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4045"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to stress the words `given the importance of the proposed facility to Australia,' because that statement must be underlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the research from this centre plays an important part in the development of the high&hyphen;speed ferry industry, which is a burgeoning industry in Hobart. If it survives this government's manipulation of the ships bounty scheme, it will provide employment for a number of decades for many people in the city of Hobart, with spin-offs throughout the state of Tasmania and natural benefits for the whole of the country, not the least of which will be income from the export of the large ferries that are manufactured on that site. The development of the ferries has relied upon the development of technology, particularly for the wave piercing aspect of the fast ferries produced, and centres like the AMECRC are very important in the development of that technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that it is a very short-sighted policy of this government to deny such a small amount of funding to such an important research centre when many millions of dollars flow back into this country from facilities such as the Incat ferry manufacturing company in Hobart and like manufacturing plants in Western Australia. These technologies are important. They are breaking new barriers in terms of ship production. The ferries that are produced, arising out of this technology, will ultimately service not only Australia and the Pacific region but the whole of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government needs more vision. Its policies in this area lack lustre, I must say. I would suggest to the government that it has a close look at its policy in relation to the funding of the cooperative research centre at the Maritime College.

That decision has taken the lustre off what was a valued and productive institution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Maritime College, as senators will no doubt be aware, is situated within the Launceston campus of the University of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Tasmania. By any standards, the college is a centre of excellence and one that Launceston and all of Tasmania can be proud of. The college attracts students and staff from a wide range of backgrounds within Australia. As well, students and staff come to Tasmania from almost 30 overseas countries. In addition to the university receiving much needed support and revenue from this arrangement, there are also obvious implications for the local economy. Students from these nations also add to the ethnic diversity and the texture of Launceston&mdash;something I hope we all endorse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, in 1996 14 Aboriginal students from different parts of Australia came to the college. I understand that the college is hoping to expand the number of Aboriginal students. Perhaps this is a lesson in reconciliation that can be shown to some other people in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The college was established in 1976 under the Fraser Liberal government, which clearly saw the sense in the project. The college had been initially conceived during the Whitlam government's period in office. Unlike the present doctrinaire coalition government, it is pleasing to know that the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, had the good grace and sense to know a good idea when he heard one. The present government seeks to undermine, no matter what the source or the merit of an idea or suggestion may be. Almost year and a half of misery has been inflicted on Tasmania&mdash;and Australia in general&mdash;because of the ideological and doctrinaire position this government holds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that it will be of interest to the government to know that, despite the best efforts of the government to cut into the University of Tasmania, they have not succeeded in their second tier objective. The university remains committed to the principles of education and maritime safety before the  sectional interests of capital and people who can afford to go to university. The AMC provides its students, researchers and clients with in excess of $100 million worth of infrastructure; 80 per cent of graduates from the Maritime College find well paid employment soon after leaving the college; and the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4047"> college has good professional academic relations with the maritime industry world wide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With these facts in mind, I cannot help wondering why the AMC has been forced onto the back foot by the government. In its slash and burn 1996 budget, the government cut the AMC budget and effectively provided the Dutch with a $4.5 million free kick. Under Labor, Tasmania was to receive $14.2 million for the Australian maritime hydrodynamics facility, as my Tasmanian Senate colleagues have indicated, at the Australian Maritime Engineering Cooperative Research Centre. This would have provided the first ocean testing facility in the world and put Tasmania and Australia at the cutting edge in this field. The research would have been used for fast&hyphen;ferry building and offshore work for oil and gas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funding just was not in the budget. The Dutch now have the funding and they are well under way&mdash;and we were wondering why our best minds are leaving the state of Tasmania. This obviously was made more difficult by the reduction of the tax concession available for R&amp;D from 150 per cent to 125 per cent. This will make it even harder for industry to create wealth and jobs through innovation.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The treaties committee, of which I am a member, dealt with this matter only just recently in asking: what does this treaty do and what does it mean? During the hearing we had on the matter, I raised some issues with the departmental people, one of which was to inquire what benefits would come from the treaty. I posed this question, given that the government has been very critical of us over time about treaties, asking of what benefit they were and expressing very strong views about a lot of treaties that had been agreed to or signed on to by the government of the day, saying that they were of no use
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and that, in some cases, they may have been a hindrance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, with regard to this treaty, I sought some indication because reference was made in it to facilitating trade fairs. Of course, no-one would like more than me to see our trade expand to more countries overseas. But as concerns the facilitation of trade fairs and that facilitation, in turn, providing opportunities for the benefit of companies and industries in this country, I was interested in how, as a result of Australia signing this treaty and it being in force between the two countries, the information about those opportunities would be fed back into the system to enable our companies and manufacturers, et cetera, to seek out and achieve the benefits. I was informed that that was a matter for Austrade, and that Austrade was essentially the facilitator of that sort of process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That worried me a little, because I have heard criticism&mdash;and not only from within countries. If you look at a most recent criticism in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages Small Business Index</EMPHASIS>, I think only something like 37 per cent of companies or small businesses in particular in this country were aware of the supposed government initiatives to assist small business; and then 22 per cent of that 37 per cent said that the initiatives were of no use. That does raise the question about providing information to our industries and businesses about opportunities that exist and ensuring that, if we are to have facilitation by way of trade fairs in other countries, et cetera, we maximise the opportunity for their utilisation by those businesses and industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern I suppose also was borne out of a discussion I had with the Austrade commissioner in Paris, Mrs Sallyanne Atkinson, who was a former Lord Mayor of Brisbane. She indicated to me that there was a problem with regard to information getting out to manufacturers and businesses in Aus tralia; that there were so many opportunities that existed with a lot of these trade fairs but that they were not being taken up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would urge the government&mdash;and hopefully the treaties committee will get to hear from Austrade in the not too distant future&mdash;to look
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4048"> at the facilitation and information dissemination processes to ensure that, if we are to have treaties that are of a facilitative nature, we do then ensure that the information filters out to people who might achieve a benefit. That will be of value to the creation of employment&mdash;something that the government claims to have near and dear to its heart. In turn, that should not only create investment in our industries here but also, I think, allow for them to explore the opportunities for more export markets overseas. I think this is a good treaty, but I would just like to see a greater flow of information arriving out of it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This document consists of the text of the bilateral treaty, together with national interest analysis, of the agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the Arab Republic of Egypt relating to air services, done at Cairo on 10 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very important point that arises out of this treaty, which I found interesting, is what would appear to be the government's position, by way of the department, in putting together this agreement with the Arab Republic of Egypt relating to air services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, all these agreements that relate to air services between countries contain a very clear understanding relating to airlines that are involved in the process of transporting passengers from one country to another. There are very strict criteria that apply to airlines not being able to carry domestic passengers. There are very few agreements that allow for that; indeed, there are none in Australia. There are only a very few countries that have agreements that allow external airlines to pick up and transport passengers from point A to point B within a particular country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked the department about that because a particular clause within the treaty referred to cabotage, which I found somewhat interest
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing. I asked the department about this cabotage clause and what it meant and why it applied. The explanation I received was that cabotage applied to protect the domestic interests of the airlines of a country. I found that to be somewhat of an unusual position for this government to be supporting, given their very strong position relating to cabotage in so far as our sea cargo services are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could not understand that a country like the US has legislation that protects their domestic shipping services, and yet we&mdash;or this conservative coalition government, I should say, because we on this side are totally opposed to the removal of cabotage&mdash;propose to abolish cabotage. That will leave our domestic shipping services open to all sorts of problems, and indeed unfair competition, and will ultimately lead to its demise. That in turn will lead to people seeking to ship goods around this country being at the mercy of international shippers, who will then determine prices that will more accord with what they can charge, because we will not have a domestic shipping industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I found it rather unusual that, on the one hand, the coalition government would say, `Look, it is a dead&hyphen;set monte that we must maintain cabotage requirements to protect'&mdash;and rightly so; I agree&mdash;`our domestic air services, but at the same time we are going to scrap it as far as our domestic shipping services are concerned.' It seems an odd sort of a position to take, to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be very interested to see what the government does in the long term. I asked the department what their view was, how they saw this thing progressing over time, and would we ultimately see the abolition of cabotage as it related to domestic air services. I found their comment somewhat interesting: they did not see it happening for some time. I guess that would be right, because there would be a significant number of problems, and how you would monitor the maintenance  of and safety of aircraft that come from outside this country would be of serious concern to the general public, I would think, particularly those that get on planes. A few politicians might start to rethink their strategy
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4049"> in terms of their transport if we get a few Russian jets in here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will watch this with interest, but I would suggest to the government that it is a bit hypocritical when you talk about maintaining cabotage in respect of air services and do not seek to protect domestic shipping services. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

As I said to the department, how do we avoid this situation with this body, this joint accreditation system between Australia and New Zealand, which has about 16 members on its panel? When it sits down to work out, discuss and put in place agreed processes with regard to accreditation, how does it do that where we have this problem and how does it take account of the different standards and applications that we have in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we do not get that right, there will always be a disadvantage. In part, that is probably what caused Blundstone boots to move some of its operation to New Zealand. We are probably missing opportunities in so far as a lot of other manufacturing industry developments are concerned if we do not get this standards system right, and likewise with labelling, et cetera. In so far as the agreement is concerned, it is good to have it, but it does not solve the problems that exist within this country. Again, if the government wants to take a step in the right direction, it ought to seek, through the process of the premiers meetings, to get some of these things uniform. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have a situation whereby there seems to be a fairly definite indication of what can only be described as social engineering with regard to the horror and disdain with which this government holds terms like chairperson, chair, seafarer or staffing, perhaps. This has become what has been publicly called `political correctness'. The term `political correctness' came from the extreme Right of the Republican movement in the United States and was in fact deliberately coined in order to try to stop these sorts of words being used. Earlier this year, we had John Howard issuing instructions about the use of terms like chairperson and chair&mdash;that they are not acceptable terms to be used and that the more acceptable term to be used is chairman.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4051"> Privileges. I do not want to criticise the report but I do want to say that the process of dealing with the whistleblowers' cases, both in the first select committee process and indeed the unresolved whistleblowers' cases committee process, was a little disappointing because it had a political approach and process for the committee to deal with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the intent of the motion that came to the Senate to set up the select committee was politically motivated. This was unfortunate because, at the end of the day, we all ought to have been about trying to help whistleblowers and seeing, in the long term, that some form of uniform legislation be introduced that would provide protection for whistleblowers around the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were some very concerning aspects that we dealt with on that committee. But while I say there was some political motivation, so far as the people who came before the committee and provided evidence were concerned, their intent and their motivation was nothing other than to seek out the truth in an endeavour to bring about a process whereby, if people did identify wrongdoing, they would be accorded the protection that ought to be available to them and that still is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Queensland, which was where the principal cases the committee had to deal with were, the Queensland government&mdash;probably again for political reasons&mdash;said it would initiate a further inquiry in respect of the shredding of the Heiner documents, which was one of the cases we had to deal with. I think there was some very clear evidence that there were problems associated with that case. Personally, I do not think that the shredding of the documents was done with any intended malice; but it created a problem of itself. The Queensland government&mdash;that is, the National Party government&mdash;said it was going to take a course of action. As I understand it, it still has not done anything.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think protection of whistleblowers around this country ought to be the responsibility of all governments. I think all senators who were members of the select committee chaired by Senator Newman agreed on a recommendation of that committee's report that there ought to be uniform legislation. And so there should be; it should not matter where people are. It should also have application in the private sector because there are some pretty important areas that have been reported. We have seen evidence in a whole host of areas. Whether in the public sector in relation to police or public expenditure through departmental systems et cetera, there are problems. There are people who may like to take the opportunity to make the people responsible aware of wrongdoing and they ought to be afforded protection. If they are not then you will allow a system of corruption to continue and probably grow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst this report found that there was not possible false or misleading evidence given to the committee&mdash;and I accept that is their finding&mdash;across the board there were some problems with regard to that case and a whole host of other cases. People have suffered terribly. One particular person I can recall in my own state is a bloke who wrote to the Premier of the day&mdash;a Labor Premier&mdash;about the Tasmania Bank, which was a state owned bank. His efforts probably saved the bank. He certainly saved the government a lot of money&mdash;probably tens of millions of dollars&mdash;but he lost his job as a result. He still does not have a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is that sort of thing that people have been confronted with. It is for that reason alone that we ought to make some efforconstitutionin terms of bringing about a process where we have uniform legislation so that people can achieve at least some sort of  justice because, at the moment, there is no justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen legislation introduced around Australia of varying types and offering protection in varying degrees. An example of that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4052"> is the legislation that was introduced in South Australia in a case that had been going on for a long time. The South Australian legislation proposed that, if you were aware of a wrongdoing that had happened 10 years ago, you could come forward and report it but, if you were the subject of having brought forward evidence of wrongdoing and you had somehow suffered as a consequence of doing that, you could not appeal under the new legislation for justice&mdash;to have your case re&hyphen;heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That really highlights the problem with this sort of approach, and I hope that sometime in the future we will get legislation that will be agreed nationally&mdash;like we did when we at least showed some initiative in trying to get uniform legislation on firearms. I am not saying I agreed with all of that, but at least we made the right effort in dealing with that particular issue and we took the right steps to implement uniform legislation in an area which was very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In taking note of the report, I hope that the government&mdash;and indeed all senators and members&mdash;will give consideration to whistleblower legislation in the future. I hope we will see some process of justice being afforded to people around the country who have acted responsibly and reported a wrongdoing and thereby, quite often, saved the community and/or a business a huge amount of money.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a matter of fact, this is the third time this week I have spoken on the issue of whistleblowers and, again, I want to point out very briefly the problems whistleblowers face. One problem is when a whistleblower makes an initial complaint and it is not dealt with properly, and that is where whistleblowing usually begins to become a very tortuous path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the issue is not dealt with properly in the first instance, most whistleblowers&mdash;who,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I might say, are very persistent people&mdash;often discover that, the further they go, the more injustices they face. They often become very much embroiled personally in the whole issue which has led them to becoming a whistleblower.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the case in the evidence that was before the Privileges Committee in this instance. There were a couple of cases which had been partially investigated by the CJC in Queensland, by various Queensland bodies and by the Select Committee on Unresolved Whistleblower Cases. Because issues were still outstanding, they finally came to the Privileges Committee and I think the Privileges Committee did a very good job&mdash;as they always do. But for the person or people involved, there is still the feeling that they have not really got to the end of the road in terms of the justice they seek.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to hold up the Senate tonight, so I will not go on and on about this. But one of the people very deeply involved in both whistleblower committees&mdash;although not intimately involved in the Privileges Committee&mdash;was Dr William De Maria, and I spoke about his case a couple of nights ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To save the time of the Senate, rather than go through all of that again, I will simply seek tonight to table a document which sets out Dr De Maria's case, and I have given a copy of that to the whips. The reason I want to table this document is that it will give the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, an opportunity to have before her information that would be very valuable to her as she seeks to understand how universities operate and would be particularly useful in Dr De Maria's case, as he is in contact with her.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key point in the observations that the committee made is in paragraphs 30 and 31. Paragraph 31 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given this pattern of behaviour, it is not surprising to the Committee of Privileges that senators and others have had some difficulty in determining whether the organisation has deliberately misled the Senate and its committees. This Committee's tentative judgment, which is to some degree reflected in its conclusions above, is that, rather than setting out deliberately to mislead, the organisation is inappropriately equipped to deal with its accountability responsibilities to each House of the Parliament and its committees.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course they were referring to the continual trotting in and rotation of officers at estimates committee hearings, then pleading ignorance to questions that were being asked. I pursued this matter for four years for these two particular gentlemen. I am pleased to say that at the end they did get justice. Kenneth Marks had an independent inquiry. That was something that former Minister Lee helped me with. I am pleased to say that Mr Marr has been reinstated in his employment. He has matters before the court at the moment but, all in all, four years of hard work in the estimates committee was quite fruitful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point that the conduct of the witnesses who appeared before the estimates committee, particularly those from Telstra, certainly left a lot to be desired. I hope that senators who are involved in the estimates committees next week would look at parts of this report and take note of the frustrations that I and other senators had.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to draw attention to this Privileges Committee report as well. I was the chairman of the particular estimates committees where these matters were raised. I share the frustration of other senators, and I have witnessed it now from both sides of the chamber. The role of the chairman of an estimates committee involves you with one level of dialogue with the committee, and your function is very different from an opposition senator in an estimates committee, where you are seeking  to actually probe. In both roles I found that dealing with Telstra was frustrating.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4054">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that in the sense that I think that Telstra has a lot to learn about the operations of parliament. I say that on the basis that, as a public corporation, Telstra has a particular responsibility in terms of its obligations to parliament. I say that in the context, even though I strongly oppose the privatisation of Telstra&mdash;or part&hyphen;privatisation as some see it&mdash;that Telstra ought to understand that it has clear responsibilities to this parliament. As a consequence of that, it is important that the committees of this parliament be treated in a manner which reflects the importance of that relationship. I note the report's recommendations concerning statutory authorities, in particular, on page 9 of the report, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . whilst it may be argued that Statutory Authorities are not accountable through the responsible Minister of State to Parliament for day-to-day operations, they may be called to account by Parliament itself at any time and that there are no areas of expenditure of public funds where these corporations have a discretion to withhold details or explanations from Parliament or its Committees unless the Parliament has expressly provided otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It strikes me that there is an attitude within some statutory corporations, Telstra being one, that suggests that appearing before parliamentary committees is a waste of time and it is an infringement upon the rights of management to determine what will be made known about the operations of that statutory corporation and what will not be made known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Officers of some statutory corporations&mdash;I see it in regard to Telstra&mdash;believe that they have a superior right over those of the parliament. I do not say that officers of a statutory corporation have to endure deprivation of their rights as citizens, but I do believe that it has to be acknowledged that they have responsibilities to the parliament that place them in a separate category from other citizens when it comes to appearing before parliamentary committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, it is totally inappropriate to give wrong or misleading information. I also say that it is the responsibility of senators asking questions to make sure that questions are clear, focused and appropriate. I do not complain about officers giving answers to questions that are actually asked. If you ask
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the wrong questions and you get the wrong answer, I guess that is your problem as a senator. It is part of our skill to make sure that we ask questions in a manner which goes to the particular issues that are being asked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I am afraid that when it comes to subterfuge, that is an entirely different matter. While I do not support witnesses being hectored or intimidated before committees, I do think it has to be clearly understood by statutory corporations what their responsibilities are. That responsibility remains with Telstra today, irrespective of the changes that have occurred&mdash;while not having yet been implemented&mdash;in terms of the legislation that has passed this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that when we dealt with officers of Telstra in the inquiry into the actual privatisation of Telstra, similar sorts of behaviour were exhibited. We commented on that in the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telstra: to sell or not to sell?</EMPHASIS> It was clear in my mind that information put to the committee was inconsistent with the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, I wish to distinguish on the basis of questions asked that are inaccurate or are not appropriate. I am talking about clear findings of this committee that the Telstra officers, firstly, basically had a contemptible attitude towards parliamentary committees and, secondly, did not see anything wrong in providing information that was not strictly in accordance with the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context, I think the Privileges Committee has dealt appropriately with Mr Krasnostein's case. I understand that Mr Krasnostein is no longer with Telstra; he has moved to the private sector. I would also say, however, that it is important for Telstra and officers of Telstra to undertake the necessary training in dealing with parliamentary committees, which is recommended in this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may well be that I have misunderstood Telstra's attitude towards parliament. It may well be that the years and years of practice that this parliament has seen where Telstra has provided information that appears inaccu rate may be wrong. It may be that they just do not understand that they are required to answer accurately and honestly. And I have made this point privately to officers of Telstra: it is
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4055"> incredibly important that they undertake the necessary training to deal with parliamentary questions in an open and cooperative manner.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I noted that Senator Harradine was in the chamber earlier for the purpose of speaking to this report. I do not know whether he is able to return but perhaps he will take the cue if he can. I can imagine the sort of lustre that he would want to give to the report. He would, however, know that Labor thought his idea was, and I say this respect, somewhat of a goofy one in relation to the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aspect that I wanted to touch on, arising from this report, was what happens with the money raised in this fashion. The government has acted like some sort of supercilious snake oil peddler in this policy area, particularly having regard to the article which is published in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> by Kenneth Davidson. It relates to the government's 1996 election campaign promise. Kenneth Davidson says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The piece de resistance of the coalition's 1996 election campaign was John Howard's promise that he would set aside $1.1 billion from the sale of one&hyphen;third of Telstra to set up the trust and that the money would be spent on the environment over five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What I understood that promise to mean, and I think everybody else understood the promise to mean, was that there would be just over $200 million a year extra available for environmental projects.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not think that is an unreasonable reflection of the public understanding of the coalition's policies leading into the last election&mdash;that is, that they would spend more on the environment as a result of raising money from the one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra. Mr Davidson goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So what has happened? According to the Budget papers, expenditure on the environment fell from $338 million in 1995&hyphen;96&mdash;the last year of the Keating Government&mdash;to
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $259 million in 1996&hyphen;97&mdash;the first full year of the Howard Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a conservative estimate, the Howard Government cut $79 million or 23 per cent from environment&hyphen;related programs in its first full financial year in office. It cut $170 million or 41 per cent from environmental programs, broadly defined to include urban and regional programs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The magnitude of that cut is contrasted against proposals, which, I think, again, are fairly described, which would have led electors to believe that there would be additional spending on the environment&mdash;not somewhere between a 23 and a 41 per cent cut in the funding of the environment. However the sale of Telstra was to proceed, the feeling of the electorate was that there would be more money in the funding of the environment&mdash;not less. Later in the article, Kenneth Davidson refers to the Natural Heritage Trust. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Heritage Trust is established and expenditures of $1.1 billion announced. The figures look impressive&mdash;$187 million in 1997&hyphen;98, rising to $290 million over the following couple of years before tapering off in 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the National Heritage Trust is the thimble. The pea is the forward estimates of expenditure on environment&hyphen;related programs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And that is why I used the expression `supercilious snake oil peddler' in relation to the coalition's policy on funding, because what the public is getting is not what they believed they were getting. Mr Davidson goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor spent $338 million on the environment in 1995&hyphen;96, which, if maintained over the subsequent five years, would have amounted to expenditure of $1.7 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">By comparison, the actual environment&hyphen;related expenditure of the Howard Government in its first year and its forward estimates of the following four years is only $1.5 billion according to the Budget papers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Howard Government is spending less on the environment than the Keating Government and far from some of the Telstra partial privatisation program being spent on the environment, savings from cuts to environmental spending are being used to prop up non&hyphen;environmental programs that have a higher priority with the Howard Government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, the public have been persuaded to accept, by electing the coalition, a one&hyphen;third sale of Telstra. But they also accepted that the government would fund additional
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4056"> programs; that it would put additional money into the protection and the rehabilitation of the Australian environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget papers demonstrate that that will not be the case and, by Mr Davidson's estimate, over the forward estimates for the next four years there will be a reduction of $200 million&mdash;not an increase of $1.1 billion, as people might have believed, but a reduction of $200 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the `thimble and pea' terminology that is used in this article is most appropriate and the public is entitled to get what they paid for, as it were, in the election. If the government says, as it has many times, that it had a mandate to sell one-third of Telstra, that mandate had conditions attached to it. The government's mandate was that it would put more money into the environment&mdash;not that it would put this money in but take more out. But the forward estimates show that more money will be taken out of funding for the environment than that which is put into it over the period of the forward estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We can argue about whether Senator Harradine's view on the redeemable preference shares is viable. As I said earlier, Labor never thought that that was a viable option; neither did the government. Everybody knew that that option would not be supported upon inquiry. That has been the result. We have come out of the exercise with precisely what Labor said at the  start: the sale of Telstra but with, at the same time, a reduction in the funding of environmental programs by this government, and the transfer of funds that Labor was putting into the environment to other programs that this government believes are more important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public needs to take note of how they have been misled in relation to this matter. Naturally, the vein in which I approach this report may be somewhat different from that of Senator Harradine, who has a different view on the issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about the report from the Economic Legislation Committee's inquiry into public equity in Telstra Corporation and to say that this report certainly does not
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> contain any surprises. The committee found that the government should really sell the first third of Telstra and not just pretend to do so. Senator Harradine agreed to the sale of the first third of Telstra on the condition that the government would hold an inquiry into revenue raising by redeemable preference shares. The idea was that we take Telstra down to the pawnshop, we pretend to sell it now, we raise the money and then, when we have some spare cash, we buy it back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra found some spare cash quite recently&mdash;around $3 billion, as I understand it&mdash;and it handed the money over to the government, as it does periodically. Of course, this is one of the advantages of having such a lucrative organisation in public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government kept its word. It did hold that pretend inquiry, and it came up with a result that was a surprise to nobody&mdash;except perhaps Senator Harradine. The majority report of the Economics Legislation Committee inquiry into public equity in Telstra Corporation recommended that the first third sale of Telstra would be by the issuing of ordinary voting shares. Senator Harradine, Senator Colston and all of the senators on the government benches, who did not have a mandate, voted to sell Telstra. And they did this even though a clear majority of Australians were vehemently opposed to the sale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats did not participate in the committee because it was very obvious to us from the start that the government had absolutely no intention of supporting the implementation of redeemable preference shares for the Telstra sale. It set up the committee to help Senator Harradine save face for selling one of Australia's most prized assets. Senator Murray said at the time that our participating in this cynical political manoeuvre would have been a waste of our time, just as certainly as it was a waste of public money. We also pointed out that the referral of this farcical inquiry to a Senate committee after the vote had been taken had  the potential to bring the Senate committee system into disrepute, and that is indeed a serious matter.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4057">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry said on behalf of the opposition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At no stage during this inquiry have the government shown any intention or desire to seriously consider Senator Harradine's proposal . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I draw Senator Harradine's attention to the fact that the government appointed the float managers well before the committee reported, suggesting that they were not taking his suggestion very seriously either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, if Senator Harradine really considered that the only appropriate way of selling Telstra was to sell it by redeemable preference shares, then he ought to have waited until the committee reported before he voted on the sale. We all know that. It is obvious from Senator Harradine's minority report that he wanted to suggest to us that he might have made a mistake&mdash;and what a back&hyphen;pedal. He says telecommunications in Australia is a natural monopoly and, to quote him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suspect that regulated competition of a natural monopoly will ultimately collapse under the logic of efficiencies of amalgamation and co&hyphen;operation . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Left to itself the market would rationalise and we would end up with one private monopoly.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then Senator Harradine, who sold out what already belonged to all Australians, ridiculously goes on to theorise how we might buy back Telstra if we ever wanted to. Well, Senator Harradine, if you really believe what you said in your minority report, the only way in which you could have voted in relation to the Telstra bill was no.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clearly Senator Allison was not here on the last occasion we debated this matter. If she had been here she would have realised that the government made it perfectly clear that, had I voted `no' on that occasion, they would have had no hesitation in using this as a double dissolution trigger. So one was faced with the choice of a third of Telstra's shares being made available to the public or the whole lot being sold. Had the government gone to the polls at that time with a double dissolution&mdash;they were riding high&mdash;they would have been re-elected and would have sold the lot. If that is what Senator Allison
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> wanted, she would have got it. They would have sold the lot. They would have had the numbers here to get the matter through and the whole of Telstra would have been sold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had to make a judgment about that. Having made a judgment about that, I am not going to canvass the other areas. I canvassed those the other evening. But, having made a decision about that, the question was how the float would be arranged. That is why I put forward the concept of optional redeemable preference shares. The reason I did that was that I believe one government in power cannot bind another government in respect of these particular matters, although it seems to be done quite regularly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats, rather than biting at people's heels, should have at least attended the meeting and considered the matters on their merits. It is all very well for Senator Allison to come in here, make a set speech and then shoot away. They were not present at the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. Had they been present at the economics committee, I believe they should have seen the merits of optional preferential shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I observed, the long-term optional redemption preference shares with no fixed dividend rights but with dividends tied to the dividends on ordinary shares would function much in the same way as ordinary shares in terms of the market signalling to Telstra's management. If that is what the government were on about&mdash;better management&mdash;then the optional redeemable preference shares option would have been the way to go. I invite honourable senators to consider my minority report. Rather than it being a face&hyphen;saving device, I was hoping to get some support in respect of that matter. But no support was really forthcoming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party, in other actions they might be contemplating, say, in New South Wales&mdash;and I make my position clear: I am not happy about the sale of natural monopolies&mdash;ought to have a look at the issue of  redeemable preference shares so that a future state government, if it wants to, can redeem the shares in an easier manner than if it had
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4058"> to face a situation where the institution was totally privatised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did point out in my minority report that redeemable preference shares would have been a fairer method of not tying the hands of future government. If the Democrats and the opposition are serious about this question of returning Telstra to full public ownership, then let me remind them that I pointed out in my minority report how that could be done, at a considerable cost. The Labor Party perhaps should think about what it might say to future shareholders of Telstra. Is this the opposition's policy&mdash;that at some stage it would go along the pathway to buying back the third of Telstra that will end up in the public's hands? If that is the case, then it would be interesting to see how that might affect the float. Investors should note that if the partial privatisation of the AIDC could be reversed then of course so can the partial privatisation of Telstra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have made it perfectly clear in my minority report that I do not accept that economic theory in any way justifies the sale of natural monopolies and that to sell a natural monopoly is to sell a licence to tax. I have made that perfectly clear. But I also made it perfectly clear what influenced me. In retrospect, one must realise that the whole of Telstra would have been sold had I taken steps other than those that I did take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say something about the government response that we are debating. I must say that I was less than impressed with the obfuscation of Treasury's explanation about the interpretation of section 46D of the income tax law. I invite honourable senators and the public, particularly persons in the financial markets, to have a look at the transcript and just see how Treasury did perform. What came out very clearly in this process was that Treasury did not in fact know the corporate law, could not give a straight answer on either tax theory or tax law and was desperately concerned about, I believe, making&mdash;what it should have made very clear to the committee&mdash;the correct response on these particular matters.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of some interest that we had witnesses who noted precisely how Treasury's advice on redeemable preference shares was contradicted by its own paper on taxation of financial arrangements. Witnesses quoted back the Treasury its own paper to prove it wrong. I note that the government feels the injection of private equity ownership is not a process that can be reversed without impeding the effective functioning of capital markets. I must say that this is a bit rich when Treasury in the recent budget has set about destroying confidence in the imputation and business tax systems by attacking eligibility for franking credits, losses of business trusts and shareholder loans from private companies. Given the chaos caused in the derivatives and managed funds markets by the Treasury in the recent budget, what I set out in my minority report, which was prior to that, is a model of moderation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we seem to have from Treasury is, as one writer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> recently pointed out, a theory of taxation reform which is chaos theory. The Treasury appears to the observer as not wanting a stable tax system. I do not see a conspiracy theory here, but you can get a situation where everybody is sick of the current taxation and then&mdash;all of a sudden&mdash;we have a GST which will save everybody. I sometimes wonder whether that is behind all of these matters. I notice that my time has expired. I ask honourable senators to have a look at this.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4059">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that has always concerned me about uranium mining is the question of safety for the workers and safety for the environment around mines in Australia. If we are going to see this government expand uranium mining in this country, it is very important that environmental concerns are taken into account. Particularly, there has to be protection for our native fauna and animals. If we have a situation where uranium run&hyphen;off into our streams can affect our native fauna, like our platypuses and our kangaroos, then we must have significant safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My interest in this stems from my family background. I am from the north of England. There is a stretch of coastline in England, around St Bedes, just below the Scottish border. The thing about St Bedes, which is where I grew up, is that it is right next to Sellafield, which used to be called Windscale.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate Select Committee on Uranium Mining and Milling was set up on 2 May 1996 to inquire into a very important mining activity which has been subject to political restraint under the previous government's three mines policy. It was timely because of an increasing world demand for uranium and the fact that Australia has 30 per cent of the world's exploitable deposits but only 10 per cent of the market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts, with the support of the Australian Democrats, was instrumental in setting up this inquiry. She expected the committee to do two things. Firstly, she expected the committee to travel the country, providing her with an opportunity for those who oppose uranium development to spread
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a mixture of misinformation, half&hyphen;truths and cliches about an industry that has been vindicated over two decades and which has operated rigorously under the guidelines set down by the Fox inquiry 20 years ago. The Fox review said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The hazards of mining and milling uranium, if these activities are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to develop Australian uranium.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Secondly, Senator Margetts expected a Senate report that she could exploit and therefore have a focus for her ongoing paranoia about uranium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, everything went horribly wrong. She did not even get TV coverage. Even <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Order in the House</EMPHASIS> ignored her. Definitely the oxygen of publicity was not provided. It was all very embarrassing. The question is why. Firstly, the anti-uranium agitators turned out to be lacking substance and intellectual argument. I am not in the business of giving them advice, but I suggest they do some research before hitting the campaign trail. Their submissions were poor, and with friends like that you barely need enemies. I cite one Reverend Stringer, from the Uniting Church Social Responsibility and Justice Committee. He was almost a stand&hyphen;up comic. We had quite a spirited discussion about whether a rock was an inert object.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, Kakadu is not an environmental wreck. Indeed, there is no more tightly regulated mine in the world than Ranger. Its impact on the surrounding environment is minimal. Its impact, at considerable expense, is mainly confined to itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, there was never an attempt to rebut the positive case put by the supporters of the uranium industry, which includes the employment opportunities that the industry provides, and the royalties to, among others, the Northern Land Council and Aboriginal groups generally. I cite an example. We went to Cotton Creek, which is a very isolated community in Western Australia, near Newman, where there was a group of very proud Aboriginal inhabitants who had some legitimate concerns about mining, but not particularly about uranium mining. Senator Margetts said, `Look, we're here from the Greens and we're

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course the other advantages of the uranium industry are the financial returns to Australia generally, the balance of trade advantages&mdash;at Ranger alone it is estimated there will be another $12 billion export income in the life of the mine&mdash;and the contribution, of course, of nuclear energy in addressing the world's greenhouse problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth reason why Senator Margetts's little plan did not come to fruition is that on the health and safety issues this industry has a good record. Our industry is already well within the world limit of 20 millisieverts of uranium exposure in a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The anti-uranium agitators have not only long given up the tedious task of building their views on research facts and impartial analysis, but also&mdash;perhaps even more serious in this particular case&mdash;have resorted uninhibitedly to unfounded scaremongering. A particularly appalling instance of this distasteful tactic may be found in paragraph 5.2 of their dissent. In that paragraph, the dissenters alleged that the incidence of childhood leukaemia in children of mine workers is 10 times the national average. This statistic falls well and truly within Disraeli's dictum of lies, damned lies and statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone seeking to verify this statistic or place it in context must run an obstacle course. The course leads back to a claimed report of the South Australian Health Commission. But anyone trying to track it down is in for a long and fruitless search. Why let truth and honesty get in the way when compared with the prospects of frightening ordinary working Australians? It goes without saying that neither Senator Margetts nor Senator Lees questioned officers of the South Australian Health Commission about this report or its relevance to the mining community at Roxby Downs during the public hearings of the committee. This is but one of the shameful aspects of their posturing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifthly, the anti-uranium proponents can find no hole in our strict international safeguard undertakings. The only chink in the international regulatory regime at the moment
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is Iraq, and Australia does not&mdash;nor will it ever, I suggest&mdash;sell uranium to Iraq.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts seems to start from the premise that there is only one place for uranium, and that is in the ground. She should try to develop some arguments rather than using the tired, embarrassing, unfulfilled cliches of the 1960s and 1970s, because she appears to be typically somebody who works from emotion and then seeks evidence to support her opinion. She really does appear in this instance to be in a very depressing time warp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts apparently has a layman's understanding of the industry, which I understand is the raison d'etre of her party and her movement. As we approached Ranger for the first time, I got the distinct impression that she thought that the piles of sulphur&mdash;essential for sulphuric acid necessary for the leaching of uranium oxide from the ore bearing rock&mdash;were yellowcake. She appeared very excited until it was explained to her what it was. I have to say that her refusal to get out of the bus at Ranger to inspect the site was one stunt among many.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lees hardly put in an appearance at either the hearings or two of the three site inspections. Perhaps she already knew all about the uranium industry or had made up her own mind. Clearly, it was the latter. This is an example of political humbug of the worst kind. The Democrat performance was that of a grandstand appearance. Unfortunately, their side had already slunk off the field of play with the depressing Greens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to congratulate the chairman of the committee, Senator Chapman, for his forbearance and tolerance&mdash;Senator Margetts attempted to make the committee unmanageable. Congratulations also to John Nethercote and his assistants. This is a considerable intellectual effort that will be read by all interested in the industry. I appreciated the opportunity to serve on the committee with Senators Bishop, Reynolds and Chapman, all with strong and legitimate views on some of the ways that the industry can be improved. It was a pleasure to get to know them better under what were difficult, but often amusing, circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make some comments pertinent to the report of the Select Committee on Uranium Mining and Milling which was tabled on 15 May. I spoke briefly on that occasion&mdash;only for three minutes&mdash;because we were very pressed for time, as we are today, when it came to the tabling of that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lees spoke before me that afternoon, and in the early part of her speech she said the following things. Talking about the committee, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I found the process on this committee the most stressful and most difficult of any of the committees I have sat on for the last seven years. The process really was the worst I have encountered, and I hope I never encounter anything like this again.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I also had some concerns about the process she was referring to. I will speak about them later. But it was because of the activities of Senator Margetts in particular and Senator Lees that the process of that committee was placed under so much stress. Senator Sandy Macdonald has already referred to this.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">  Senator Lees then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must, therefore, thank sincerely Mr Frank Nugent for his integrity, cooperation and supportive approach in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> helping us to go back through the evidence to try to balance the majority report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I was the next speaker on that occasion, and when I heard Senator Lees make those remarks, I felt that she was implying that the secretariat itself had something less than integrity and was less than cooperative and supportive. I then got up and made the following off&hyphen;the&hyphen;cuff remarks in response to Senator Lees's comments, which, I felt, reflected on the integrity of the committee. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a fact that Mr Nugent was put on to work for the secretariat, but he in fact insisted that he would only work for Senator Lees and Senator Margetts. When told that he was not allowed to do that, he resigned from the workings of the secretariat.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have been assured that that is not an accurate reflection of the facts. In raising that, I had no intention of making any personal reflection on Mr Nugent but only on the process that had been undertaken during the compiling of that report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have known Mr Nugent for all the time I have been in this place. I know him to be an honest and fair worker and a very cooperative person in this place. I should not have said that he insisted that he would only work for Senator Lees and Senator Margetts, because my understanding of the facts is that he was working under instructions, and it was not fair of me to make that implication about his work. I had no intention of what I said being a reflection on him personally but only a criticism of the process. I withdraw unreservedly those remarks that I made about Mr Nugent, because I now know that they were not fair to him personally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make a couple of other comments about the report. One of the reasons I made those remarks at that time was that I was concerned about the fact that I was unsure whether the process we went through during the compilation of that report and the earlier behaviour of some of the members of that committee were handled as well as they could have been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Friday I talked at length to the clerk of committees, and a meeting has been proposed. I hope it will be held between the Clerk of the Senate, the clerk of committees, the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4062"> secretary of that committee, the chairman of that committee and me, so that some of the reasons behind some of the appointments that were made and some of the instructions that were given to members of the committee can be talked through. I would hate to think that the process we went through would be repeated again in such a way. I believe that there were some aspects of appointments to the committee and of the process that were not as they should have been. That is something that needs to be talked out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to particularly thank the secretary of that committee, John Nethercote, for the work that he put into that committee. He worked under very difficult circumstances. I would also pay particular tribute to the work that was done by Julie Coker&hyphen;Godson who worked on that committee for a great deal of the time. I would also like to thank the other people who worked with the secretariat and within the secretariat and under John Nethercote for the duration of the inquiry, not just during the writing of the report. I felt they worked under extreme difficulties. They had very tight deadlines. It is a very large report, there was a lot of rewriting and a lot of effort went into getting a report that we felt was going to be as unanimous as we were ever likely to get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition and government members of the committee managed to come up with a report where, as in all committees, there had to be a little bit of give and take to come to a unanimous point of view. The lengthy discussions that took place and the eventual outcome and decisions that were made in writing that report reflect the hard work and integrity of that committee. I believe the integrity of the secretariat itself was reflected on by the comments that Senator Lees made when she did not refer to them but referred to someone who worked only for her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to particularly thank Senator Bishop and Senator Reynolds for their efforts. In a committee like this, it could be easily perceived that there would be a divergence of opinion which it would not be possible to overcome in order to get a majority report out. Senator Bishop in particular was very conscientious about the work he put into this committee&mdash;the time he put in and the nego
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tiations that took place with the chairman. I can only congratulate him on that. I also congratulate Senator Reynolds who, in the final drafting of the report, came a long way in making an input to help the report be as good a report as I think it is: a report that covers every aspect of uranium mining and milling that is of interest to this Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was quite natural, when you know the philosophical and political views the Greens and, to a slightly lesser but almost identical extent, the Democrats have on this issue, that there was never going to be a totally unanimous report from that committee. It was never going to be possible. But Senator Macdonald hit the nail on the head when he made some comments about Senator Margetts's position. I do not believe it is possible to start off on a committee inquiry&mdash;and one that is as important as this&mdash;with a pre&hyphen;determined position, and then try to find the evidence to suit your pre&hyphen;determined position. That was not the case with the opposition members of this committee, who worked very hard and attended the hearings and inspections and gained, first&hyphen;hand, the information necessary to write a comprehensive report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had not intended to speak so long on the committee report itself, because I did speak earlier. But I did particularly want to make the remarks I made tonight in relation to Mr Frank Nugent and, as I said, to withdraw unreservedly the remarks that I made, which were not accurate. I have spoken to Mr Nugent, I have written him a letter, and we talked about it at length earlier this week. I am pretty sure that he understands my position. I certainly understand his. I did want to make sure that, as well as speaking to him privately, I put on the record exactly what I meant to say. Because it was said in this place where he, as a clerk of a committee, has no right of response, I wanted to correct the record for 15 May.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4062"><TITLE>Men's Medical Clinics</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to talk about an issue which is probably quite topical and appropriate, given the ABC's program on men's health that starts at 8.30 tonight. I want to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4063"> draw to the attention of people in the chamber and anyone who may be listening what I have noticed lately as a plethora of advertisements, appearing often in the Sunday newspapers but certainly in weekend newspapers&mdash;in the city newspapers, but now beginning to appear in country ones&mdash;about men's clinics. Often these ads begin with questions such as, `Do you have a problem with impotence or premature ejaculation?' I am a little concerned about some of the things that I am hearing or have discovered about these advertisements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of my constituents came in to see me last week. He had seen an ad in the local regional newspaper which offered a men's clinic. He thought it was in the local community, because the ad mentioned the local community medical clinic&mdash;and I do not want to identify the area. The ad gives a 1800 number, it gives the times to call and it says, `bulk-billing available'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My constituent is an age pensioner. When he rang the clinic, he was told that the charge would be $40. After having got to the clinic and having had his consultation&mdash;which he says took all of something between three and four minutes&mdash;he was charged $80. When he inquired as to why he could not, as an age pensioner, be bulk&hyphen;billed&mdash;because I think every one of the GPs in this community bulk&hyphen;bills aged pensioners&mdash;he was told that they only bulk&hyphen;billed people who were in receipt of disability support pension, which is the old invalid pension, those who had health care cards and those who were in receipt of unemployment benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was very upset the first time this happened. He then took the receipt down to Medicare to make a claim. Of his $80, he got back $37.65. Because he also had to have a blood test, he was told to come back four or five days later. He went back to get his blood test, that again took a matter of two or three minutes, and he was told that the bill would be $42.35. This is a gentleman who is an old age pensioner, he did not have that money on him and, after some discussion, he was bulk&hyphen;billed a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But my constituent was very angry and very upset, and made his way straight from those premises down to my office. I thought it was
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a bit rude because, when he came in, he had a card giving the appointment date for that particular day's appointment&mdash;the second appointment&mdash;and that card had the name of a different men's medical clinic on it. My constituent did not know the name of the doctor he had seen because it all took place so quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rang the 1800 number only to discover that it was actually a Sydney number, and that apparently this person comes to the area once a fortnight or once a week to conduct these clinics.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then further looked at my constituent's Medicare statement of claim, a copy of which he gave me. I had all along been assuming that the people who were conducting these clinics were specialists. I could not work out how he could be going to these people without a referral from his GP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His Medicare statement of claim referred to his consultation as being under item 36. After talking to the office of the minister for health and the shadow minister for health, I discovered that item 36 in the Medicare schedule is a general practitioner visit. It is for professional attendance involving the taking of a detailed history, an examination of multiple systems, arranging any necessary investigations and implementing a management plan in relation to one or more problems, and lasting at least 20 minutes; or a professional attendance of less than 40 minutes duration involving components of a service for which a number of other items apply. That was the item that he had been charged under, for which the rebate was $37.65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was most surprised to learn that these clinics appear to be being conducted by general practitioners, not by specialist urologists&mdash;the appropriate group of the profession, I would have thought, to be conducting these clinics, particularly for elderly men where there are problems with prostate for which they want to have regular examinations and regular checks which usually involve a physical examination, as there is still a lot of conjecture about the efficacy of the blood test examination with the number of false negatives and false positives that may show up in those procedures. But, no, it would appear
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4064"> from this document that the people conducting these are general practitioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I rang the clinic because I could see where it said `bulk-billing available' in the ad, and I wanted to know why they were refusing to bulk-bill my age pensioner constituent. After a number of phone calls, I finally spoke to the doctor. All along I was being told that they only bulk&hyphen;billed&mdash;this is what they were saying to me&mdash;invalid pensioners, those in receipt of sickness benefits and health care card holders. When I said, `But health care card holders can be old age pensioners,' they said, `Oh, no, no, no; we can't afford to bulk-bill all of that particular group.' I do not know the rationale for choosing to bulk-bill disability support pensioners or recipients of sickness benefits. I also find the rationale of not being able to afford to bulk-bill aged male pensioners rather alarming, because we know that men do not look after their health as well as women; they do not have checks as often as women do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My constituent tells me that on his second visit he asked about snoring, which he also has a problem with. He alleges he was told by his doctor that he could not do anything for that. I have advised my constituent that in future he should, in fact, see his general practitioner and, if he is hesitant about having an examination for his prostate by his general practitioner, to ask for a referral to a urologist. There is a very highly qualified urologist in the area, whom he had previously seen and whom he thought was absolutely wonderful because he took time to explain what was happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have also told him that if he is having problems with his snoring he should see his general practitioner again and that there is in fact a sleep and snoring clinic at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital that is looking very closely at and doing research and valuable work on this problem of snoring. My constituent was very pleased about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am most concerned that it appears that a number of these men's clinics are not being run by specialists, as I had assumed they would be. Men probably prefer to go to men's clinics for the same reason that a lot of women prefer to go to women's clinics, in
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that they are dealing with very sensitive and personal issues and the examinations are not enjoyable. Dropping the trousers is not something that comes naturally to anybody.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very serious issue, Senator. I am sure you recognise this. It is an issue that people feel very uncomfortable with. Men feel equally uncomfortable about having rectal examinations as women do about having vaginal examinations. The reason why a lot of women go to women's clinics is that they do not have to see the doctor or the person performing the examination socially, or when they go back to the doctor for another reason they do not have to face the embarrassment that they feel about discussing these issues. It is a sensitive issue for a number of people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand why men are doing it, but I would urge a great deal of caution, because it strikes me that there are a number of&mdash;I do not know whether I can say rip&hyphen;offs and sharks, those might be words that are too strong, but I certainly have some grave concerns, from the information and the allegations that my constituent has supplied.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, I have already followed it up with the minister's office and the shadow minister's office and I will be following it up further at estimates because I think this is an issue and an area that needs to be looked at more fully and in more detail. I will certainly want to know more about this plethora of clinics.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4065"> Court's `three strikes and you are out' legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would expect fair&hyphen;minded Australians to have been appalled to hear of the punitive nature of what has now become a mandatory sentencing requirement for Western Australia's judiciary. It may well have been an unintended consequence for parliament but nevertheless the fact is that a 12&hyphen;year&hyphen;old boy is in gaol for a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The President of Perth's Children's Court, Judge Allan Fenbury, who sentenced the boy from the state's far north&hyphen;west, criticised the legislation, saying that he had no choice but to order a term of detention. His Honour said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The community should be able to find another way of dealing with a person like you rather than locking you up in a city institution. Locking you up is only going to provide a short&hyphen;term solution to your offending. I think you are a small 12&hyphen;year&hyphen;old boy from the north&hyphen;west with social problems that are not your fault . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a bitter indication to the indigenous community that, even after the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and at the same time as the Reconciliation Convention in Melbourne, we are still repeating what are now the obvious mistakes of the past. In fact, I am reliably informed that the first person ever hanged in Western Australia was a small boy of similar age, for the crime of stealing bread.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does it say about a country whose European occupation of this land was effectively born from an oppressive penal system in the United Kingdom? Have we so readily forgotten the injustice of our own colonial origins? Are we slipping back to old standards instead of moving onwards to a more moral, more just society?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Bureau of Statistics national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander survey in 1994 revealed that 20 per cent of indigenous persons aged over 13 years had been arrested in the last five years. That is one in five kids over 13 years of age. Racists would like to point to these figures as an indication of the nature of Aboriginal society. History and humanity tell us otherwise. Rational people know that these figures are indeed indicators of racism and the consequences of
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> racism. I recognise that these are not issues capable of easy resolution, but compassion and commitment would help enormously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even more recently, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commissioner, Mr Mick Dodson, reported in October 1996 the following disturbing facts:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were fifteen juvenile deaths in custody between May 1989 and May 1996. As the indigenous juvenile population grows proportionately larger than the non&hyphen;indigenous juvenile population, deaths of young Indigenous people can only be expected to increase if significant measures are not taken. The cases of six other adult Indigenous people who died in custody demonstrated very early and frequent contact with the criminal justice system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Dodson went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of indigenous kids who are brought before  Children's Courts (rather than dealt with in diversionary schemes) remains disproportionately high in comparison with non&hyphen;Indigenous kids. The rate at which they are then imprisoned in comparison with non&hyphen;Indigenous kids is even more pronounced.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to recommend that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Procedures for the transfer of juveniles to adult prisons need to be examined urgently.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Police car chase deaths are increasing overall, and in most jurisdictions police services need much more stringent policies set out when pursuit is desirable in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community policing principles need to be implemented to better deal with indigenous people occupying public areas and with Indigenous juvenile delinquency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Juvenile justice and family conferencing schemes with adequate cultural sensitivity and Aboriginal community involvement can be effective solutions to juvenile crime problems, but schemes which increase alienation and which are imposed by police on the families of the offender and the victim will not succeed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indigenous juveniles in many jurisdictions now face laws which place more impediments in the way of seeking bail than they faced at the time the Royal Commission reported.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mick Dodson has disturbingly illustrated for us that, during the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, of all the indigenous deaths in institutional settings, juveniles represented 6.1 per cent. These are the deaths of children we are talking about. In the post royal commission period, the five  indigenous juvenile deaths account for 6.3 per cent of deaths in institutional settings. In other words, there has been no improvement.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4066">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just this week, the human rights and equal opportunity report into the `stolen generation' has illustrated further disturbing facts. We have learnt that indigenous people who were forcibly removed from their families are twice as likely to report having been arrested by police and having been convicted of an offence. They are three times as likely to report having been in gaol. Western Australia, which has that `three strikes and you're out' legislation and the other legislation it has, needs to rethink its response to these horrific statistics as the current legislation will in all likelihood see these figures tragically increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whining, ugly nature of the hardening political Right and the equivocating leadership of this government represents not ignorance but denial. Without enormous effort from all sides and acceptance of responsibility, indigenous people and indigenous young people will continue to die in penal and corrective institutions. For indigenous Australians, the past is about what white Australia did to their black brothers and sisters. It is to our sorrow that for many indigenous Australians the present is often no better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No-one is suggesting for one minute that villains should not be dealt with appropriately, but surely this nation, specifically the state of Western Australia, has gone way too far when it incarcerates 12&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds as villains with apparently no hope of counselling or rehabilitation. Have justice, compassion and principles of rehabilitation been fully relegated and diminished? Has our balance gone&mdash;that is, a balance which should be our duty to the young against our legitimate need for a safe and lawful society?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing correct about the rate of indigenous incarceration in this country. There is nothing correct about escalating deaths in custody. It needs enormous political and social will to end this state of affairs. I find it hard to believe that Premier Richard Court would wish to leave as part of his political epitaph the responsibility for seeing the figures of Aboriginal and young Aboriginal incarcerations increasing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are now, in my belief, seeing the effects of what happens when parliaments and governments de&hyphen;emphasise compassion and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> understanding and overemphasise the pursuit of economic priorities at the expense of social and community priorities. For me, the balance has clearly been lost. Surely, we have not written off 12&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. The legislatures of this nation are locking up poor, young, black villains whilst other rich, white, old villains either get laughable sentences or end up laughing at us. At each end of the scale, we have Christopher Skase still at large and a 12&hyphen;year&hyphen;old boy in 12 months custody in Western Australia. Alan Bond, with his billion dollar crime, will only serve twice the time of that 12&hyphen;year&hyphen;old boy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on this adjournment debate to speak about the forthcoming People's Convention and the regime proposed to allow half the delegates to be elected and half to be appointed. One of the government's key election promises was to provide an environment for the people of Australia to decide on the issue of Australia's head of state. The government has facilitated this process this year by initiating the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an extraordinary phenomenon that, even though the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens express themselves to be avowed republicans, they are, nevertheless, critical of the very process that offers the best chance of Australia becoming a republic in the foreseeable future. There is a great deal, however, about the process to be positive about that I wish to address tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, there has been unwarranted speculation that the parliamentary delegates will be  stacked with pro monarchists by virtue of nothing more than the fact that the number of coalition federal and state representatives will
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4067"> outnumber those from other parties. This, of course, assumes wrongly that every such delegate is an entrenched monarchist and incapable of bringing an independent mind to bear on the issue of Australia's head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coalition representatives, just as the wider community, will have views from across the spectrum from those who consider that the symbols of our present system, if not the workings of our constitution, are outdated for a modern democracy, to those who believe that the present system has served us well and want to retain the constitutional monarchy, to those who welcome the opportunity to consider the issues carefully without preconceived positions. In short, there is a diversity of opinion within coalition ranks and a commitment to examine various arguments with intellectual rigour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To assert that the coalition delegates, all of them, will represent a pro monarchist block, is both simplistic and insulting. The People's Convention is a historic opportunity to give a whole range of Australians from a variety of backgrounds right across Australia an opportunity to participate in the process of constitutional reform. The People's Convention is one of those rare occasions when party lines will blur and the process will have the underlying dynamic of ordinary Australians simply having their say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has given an assurance that the appointed representatives will reflect broad community representation. One group I am particularly interested in is, of course, women. The government has said there will be gender balance in the appointed representatives. This is in stark contrast to over a century ago, during the time of the first people's convention in Bathurst, when women were excluded from participating in what was clearly seen as `men's business'. Back then, the participation of women extended to providing refreshments for the predominantly male delegates and participating, no doubt, in related conversations outside the space of formal debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The participation of women in the 1997 People's Convention will reflect the signifi
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cant and obvious contribution made by women to Australian society. A hundred years ago Australia was, in every respect, a colonial outpost. Back then our population was just 3&half; million. Only two per cent of our population was born outside Australia and Britain, and our biggest trading partner was, of course, England. Today we have a population of 18 million comprising over 150 nationalities. Consistent with this reality, the government has committed itself to ensuring that cultural diversity will be reflected in the composition of delegates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For really the first time in our nation's history, indigenous Australians will have an opportunity to contribute directly to discussions which will affect the future of how we are governed. The recognition of indigenous Australians as the original inhabitants of this continent reflects not only the need to address past injustices but also the need for simple equity in participation in the events that shape our national identity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has ensured that at least 10 per cent of delegates will comprise young Australians between the ages of 18 to 25 years. Irrespective of the outcome of the People's Convention, young Australians will inherit the model prescribed mainly by decision makers of our generation. There are many complex and compelling issues facing our youth, from unemployment to unprecedented numbers of young people who are suicidal. For many young Australians, constitutional change symbolises a direction for the future: an assertion of independence and confidence about Australia's place in the world. It is therefore vital to include young people in the process and allow them to express their views on issues which will affect them in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Older Australians want and are entitled to hear from those who seek constitutional change that the values and traditions they hold dear will not be eroded. Some older Australians may see constitutional change as somehow reducing the contribution they have made to Australian society during their lives. This situation is not assisted by some advo cates of constitutional change who have sought to extend the simple head of state issue by
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4068"> seeing it as an opportunity to change a lot of things in the constitution and some of the most fundamental aspects about Australian society. By doing this, they have fuelled suspicions of a general population which has proven to be conservative on the issue of constitutional change. Only eight of 42 attempts to alter the constitution under section 128&mdash;referendum procedure&mdash;have succeeded. By concentrating only on the issue of whether Australia's head of state should change, the general public can remain confident the result of the convention will not result in an entire overhaul of Australian society as we know it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Cultural diversity, a fair go, achievement through hard work and determination, egalitarianism: these are core values of our nation which we must sustain. They are also, I believe, compelling reasons for us to be questioning the appropriateness of having an Australian head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The views of Thomas Jefferson on the issue of constitutional change strike a familiar chord. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not an advocate for frequent changes to laws and constitutions, but laws and constitutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind, as that becomes more developed and enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions changed. With the change of circumstances, institutions must advance, and keep pace with the times. We might as well require a man to wear still the coat which fitted him as a boy, as require civilised society to remain under the regimen of their ancestors.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We must never lose sight of the fact that the underlying aim of the convention is to assemble a group of people with the capacity to make a genuine attempt to evolve a proposal that will be as good as or better than our present constitution&mdash;one that is clear enough to be understood for the purposes of either a plebiscite or a referendum, or both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think this is truly an exciting challenge. All Australians, directly or indirectly, by electing the delegates of their choice, will have the opportunity to participate in informed debate on the fundamental issue of constitutional change. I look forward to doing my bit to ensure the wider community is kept informed of the processes leading up to the convention.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise some matters relating to our banking industry. What I want to say essentially relates to a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS>  program that dealt with a number of issues on how the banks have treated their customers, particularly small business customers and farmers. The issue I want to go to principally is foreign currency borrowings and the fact that it has been assessed that one bank alone retained potentially some $300 million, as I understand it, of its customers' money that it illegally took. The ANZ Bank has been caught out in respect of this particular question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The withholding tax is a tax that is to be paid by the bank on interest earned on money it has loaned to an Australian customer&mdash;be that customer a farmer, a small business person or whoever. The bank was supposed to pay that tax, but it actually put that tax on top of the charges&mdash;the interest charges, et cetera&mdash;it was making its customers pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the ANZ Bank were caught out, and the court has ordered them to pay. They have admitted that they deducted in excess of $30 million in withholding tax from their borrowers and kept it for themselves. They did not pay it to the tax office. They then said to their customers, `You can have it back.' But the problem with that is that many of the people they did that to had suffered dramatically. They had lost either their businesses or their farms as a result of those actions. It was a little late to say, `Sorry, you can have it back.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government talks about interest rates being so important&mdash;and they are; there is no doubt about that&mdash;but we ought to have a long hard look at the issues that relate to these sorts of practices within the banking industry. It is my intention to take this to my party room with a view to looking at whether or not there is a capacity, either through legislation or through some of the committee processes within this parliament, to have a long hard look at these banks and the activi ties they have been involved in.

<ANSWER PAGE="4076" SPEAKER="Parer, Sen Warwick" NAMEID="KI4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Resources and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator Parer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The McKinnon Reactor review, or Research Reactor Review (RRR), was established to advise on whether Australia had a need for a new nuclear research reactor. The RRR reported to the previous Government in 1993. When that Government responded to the report, it said that it "broadly accepted the findings of the Research Reactor Review".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with the recommendations of the RRR, the then Government accepted that a final decision on replacing HIFAR should be deferred for about five years, and it kept HIFAR operating. To ascertain HIFAR's remaining life, and to provide additional assessments of safety margins, the Government provided funds for a probabilistic safety assessment (PSA), which is being undertaken by independent consultants, and which is now nearing completion. The PSA was commissioned by the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, for the reasons below, the previous Government did not endorse the RRR's recommendation that work be commenced with a view to the establishment of a high level radioactive waste repository for the management of the spent nuclear fuel generated by HIFAR. Nor did it provide funds specifically for access for scientists to international advanced neutron scattering facilities.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The RRR recognised the significance of a research reactor to the overall national interest. It said that the Government might want to make a positive decision about a new research reactor for the same reasons and in the same way as it does for defence and other national interest issues. Nevertheless, the RRR included in its recommendations five conditions. It said that if these were satisfied within a period of about five years, it would be appropriate to make a positive decision on a new reactor. Since the RRR reported, these conditions have generally been satisfied but, as recognised by the report, the conditions are not in themselves prerequisites for a decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is, of course, responsible for following up the recommendations and conditions of the RRR. The Government has been doing so, primarily through the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism, which has been assisted by ANSTO. The present position with respect to the RRR's conditions is set out below.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">High Level Waste Site&mdash;The RRR perceived that management of research reactor spent fuel required that a high level waste site be established. The previous Government did not accept this view, and neither does the present Government. The nature of the spent fuel is such that it cannot be stored indefinitely because the aluminium cladding may corrode and fission products could then be released. To avoid this, the fuel should be chemically processed, separating out the unused uranium from radioactive waste. The waste products would then be conditioned into a form suitable for disposal. If in the form of intermediate level waste, this waste could be permanently stored in Australia, along with our other holdings of radioactive waste in this category, and at a considerably lower cost than for high level waste. The Government has been developing a strategy for the management of research reactor spent fuel. ANSTO has participated in the process, and shipped 114 spent fuel elements to the United Kingdom for processing in 1996. The Government is currently considering options for the remaining spent fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Spallation Neutron Sources&mdash;The Government has been monitoring the use of spallation neutron sources. As part of this process, ANSTO has kept  international developments under review. Although a spallation neutron source is a very useful scientific tool, a multi&hyphen;purpose research reactor would be a more suitable neutron source for Australia. A spallation source would be more expensive than a research reactor. The minimum cost for a basic accelerator would be in the range $300 million to $400 million, and the research instrumentation and other facilities would bring the total to more than $600 million. Moreover, a spallation source could not support the range of nuclear activities required in Australia. For example, it could provide only a limited capability for bulk radioisotope production and it could not provide for commercial irradiations. (In this regard, the RRR noted that if a spallation source were to be chosen, a small reactor would also be necessary).
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4077"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cyclotron Radioisotope Production&mdash;The Government has been monitoring progress with the use of cyclotrons for the production of technetium. As part of this process, ANSTO has, among other things, maintained contact with the author of the scientific paper who proposed the use of cyclotrons for this purpose in 1991. ANSTO has reported that its investigations show significant technical problems remain unresolved, and there are no plans anywhere in the world for the commercial production of technetium from cyclotrons. Moreover, it is unlikely that commercial production from cyclotrons would meet the needs of mainstream nuclear medicine groups. The output from cyclotron production would be of a lower quality than the output from reactor production, it would result in a poorer scan image quality, and it would cause increased radiation doses to patients. In addition, the specific activity of the technetium isotope would be insufficient for many nuclear medicine procedures. ANSTO's conclusions are supported by an Environmental Impact Statement of April 1996, relating to the US Department of Energy's Medical Isotopes Production Project, where it was concluded that technetium production from cyclotrons was neither technically feasible nor economically viable in the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neutron Scattering in Australian Science&mdash;The Australian neutron scattering community has a long and distinguished tradition and, as noted by the RRR, its research using HIFAR has been of a high quality. ANSTO has found that utilisation of HIFAR for neutron scattering applications continues to increase. Between 1993 and 1996 the number of university research projects using HIFAR in this field increased by about two&hyphen;thirds, and the number of postgraduate research students using HIFAR for neutron scattering research increased by one&hyphen;third. Access to the key neutron scattering instruments on HIFAR was fully booked in 1993. Since then, ANSTO has made significant improvements in the efficiency of data collection for neutron scattering experiments, but these improvements have not satisfied demand for instrument time, and access continues to be fully booked today. ANSTO has concluded that this usage indicates there are strong and diverse applications of neutron scattering in Australian research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Interest&mdash;Government policies on non proliferation issues, possible new safeguards agreements and expanded uranium mining, together with the growth of the use of nuclear technology in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region, all point to an increased need for technical nuclear expertise in the national interest. The on&hyphen;going acquisition and retention of this expertise is a matter of high priority for the Government. Australia's technical nuclear expertise is based on the operation of a multi&hyphen;purpose research reactor, and ANSTO, as the operator of the reactor, is the main repository of this expertise. ANSTO is consulted on nuclear matters by other Government agencies on a daily basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) &amp; (3) Firm estimates of quantities of wastes would require a detailed plant design proposal. As the Government has not concluded its consideration of the options
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for dealing with ANSTO's spent fuel, a detailed proposal is not available and neither are detailed estimates of the quantities of wastes that would arise. However, ANSTO has made indicative estimates, drawing on generalised knowledge of the chemical processes that would be used, and based on the use of Synroc for the conditioning of intermediate level radioactive wastes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this basis, ANSTO has estimated that there would be: no high level waste; two cubic metres of intermediate level waste in Synroc; and either 50 cubic metres of low level waste in ceramic or up to 250 cubic metres of low level waste in cement. The liquid and gaseous wastes produced would be treated on&hyphen;line and solidified. Such wastes have been included in the calculation for the amount of solid waste that would be generated. There would be some residual liquid and gaseous emissions which would be released under controlled conditions and would be within the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&amp;MRC) recommended safe regulatory limits for radiation exposure of workers and members of the public. As the levels of radioactive discharges would depend entirely on the design of the plant, it is not possible to give exact levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that the NH&amp;MRC's recommended regulatory limits are based on international standards and are publicly available. ANSTO's emissions and discharges are well monitored and are generally well below the relevant regulatory limits. The Australian Radiation Laboratory provides independent surveillance of effluent releases. ANSTO's radioactive discharges are published in ANSTO's Environmental Survey at Lucas Heights Research Laboratories&mdash;Annual Report, which is available to the public. They are also published in the annual report of the Safety Review Committee (SRC), which was established under the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987 to review and assess the effectiveness of the standards, practices and procedures adopted by ANSTO to ensure the safety of its operation. This report is tabled in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Yes, ANSTO has explored the currently available options for conditioning spent aluminium&hyphen;clad research reactor fuel. Each of these options involves the initial step of chemical processing. The conditioning of the resulting waste then differs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The currently available conditioning methods are cementation, used in the United Kingdom, and glass vitrification, used in France. Estimates of the amounts of solid wastes generated from processing ANSTO's existing spent fuel, using the currently</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4078"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">available conditioning processes or the Synroc process, are set out in the following table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liquid and gaseous wastes would be solidified, although there would be some residual emissions. It should be noted that the total amount of radioactivity immobilised in all these options is identical. It should also be noted that the glass vitrification process currently in use in France would condition the research reactor waste together with power reactor waste, and result in some high level radioactive waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Were ANSTO to condition the existing spent fuel and not use Synroc, it would be likely to use the cementation process, as it has some expertise with the use of cement. The amounts of radioactive waste generated would be as given in the table for the cementation process.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) (a) Yes women's concerns are being heard by the Government and we are being proactive in seeking out the views of women through a variety of mechanisms through national women's non&hyphen;government organisations (NGOs) which represent a wide range of specific and broad women's interests including those of rural women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I recently requested national women's NGOs to provide me with their views on the policy issues which were in their view the top priorities for women. I was extremely pleased with the response which consistently placed violence against women, issues surrounding the balance of work and family responsibilities and women in decision making and leadership as the top three issues.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several avenues through which women's concerns can be expressed have been established. These include:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) The Australian Women's Round Table</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Women's Round Table will be an annual two day meeting hosted by the Government with around 40 representatives from national women's
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4079"> NGOs. The 1997 Australian Women's Round Table will be held in Parliament House, Canberra on 27 and 28 August. Round Table meetings will provide an opportunity for national women's NGOs to be informed first hand of government policies and programs and to provide direct input to Government on the concerns of women in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) National Women's Communication Network</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will be funding this network from July 1997 which will disseminate information between government and women's organisations and the broader community based on a variety of information dissemination mechanisms such as internet and fax. The network, which was put to public tender, will facilitate the exchange of information between the Government and the community on women's issues. Tender applications closed on 2 May 1997. We expect selection of the successful tenderer to be finalised shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) Parliamentary Advisory Group</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This group, comprising a Parliamentary representative from each State and Territory, was established to provide feedback to me on Commonwealth issues affecting women in their respective constituencies. This is intended to facilitate the flow of ideas and concerns of women throughout Australia back to the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) Getting the Message Through</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1996, the Government released the booklet Getting the Message Through which provides information and contact details on all women in Federal Parliament as well as information on Parliamentary Committees to assist women to gain greater access to the Parliament and the Parliamentary Committee system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v) Operational funding for national women's non&hyphen;Government organisations (NGOs)</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Women's Non&hyphen;Government Organisations Grants Program will provide operational grants to a number of key national women's NGOs which have a demonstrated capacity, to represent the concerns of Australian women at the Federal State and community level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) (b) Women's concerns are not limited by economic considerations. The Government's policy response has been determined by the expressed concerns of women themselves. The priority policy areas for the Office of the Status of Women directly reflect the issues identified in the recent survey I undertook of the priority issues for women, through national women's NGOs. These issues are violence against women, issues relating to the balance of work and family responsibilities and women in decision making and leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) The issue of domestic violence and the associated issue of homelessness for women and children escaping domestic violence are of serious concern to the Government. Formulating and implementing constructive,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> effective responses to reduce the incidence of domestic violence and homelessness are priorities for this Government. The Prime Minister will be convening a national Domestic Violence Summit late in the year. Funding for the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program for refuges has been maintained in real terms by this Government.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (b) Residents of Norfolk Island may enrol, under certain conditions, for any Division in Australia, except for the Division of the Northern Territory or the Division of Fraser in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), both of which already have enrolled electors from other external/internal territories (Christmas and Cocos/Keeling Islands and Jervis Bay respectively).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) For the purposes of determining representation entitlements for each State and Territory of the federal Parliament, the population of the Commonwealth must first be ascertained.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This means that most Norfolk Islanders are excluded from the total population count, with the exception of residents who are Temporary Entry Permit Holders on Norfolk Island, and whose last place of residence was in one of the six Australian States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the population of the Commonwealth has been ascertained, the representation entitlements of each State and Territory are then determined by dividing the
