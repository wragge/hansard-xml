<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pen 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="GX5">Senator Troeth</NAME><FROM>(from five citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PETITION PAGE="642" TOTAL.SIGNED="132" PRESENTERS="Abetz, Sen Eric; Colston, Sen Malcolm" NAMEIDS="N26, PF4"><TITLE>Repatriation Benefits</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Petition of the undersigned shows that only one group have been excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) where such group has performed honourable overseas `active service'. That group being members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 which were excluded under `Operational Service' at Section 6. (1)(e)(ii) of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various claims made in Statements to the House and the Senate and the contents of correspondence from various Ministers to maintain the exclusion are answered as follows, the answers are from documents obtained under FIO and from public record:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) `They were never allotted for operational service', (contained in a letter from the Hon. Con Sciacca Minister for Defence Science and Personnel 1995). A letter from the Secretary Department of the Navy to Treasury dated 11 November 1955 stated `the date that the Navy were allotted for operational  service was 1 July 1955'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) `Members of the RAN were only doing the duty for which they had enlisted', (October 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). This applies to all Service personnel everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) `They were in no danger', (November 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). They shared the same danger as all other Australian Service personnel serving in Malaya at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) `They were not on Special Overseas Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop Minister for Defence Industry Science and Personnel to Mrs Williams of Adelaide dated October 1996). Requirement for Special Overseas Service was introduced in 1962 without retrospective conditions, therefore has no relevance to events of 1960.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v) `They were not on Active Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop Minister for Defence Industry Science and Personnel dated October 1996). It is now, as it was then, that Service Personnel had to comply with one of three requirements for Active Service, this group complied with two, or twice as many as is needed. The one that they did not comply with was, `is in military occupation of a foreign country'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request that the Senate should remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act, thereby giving the Australian sailors involved comparative recognition with the Army and RAAF personnel that served at the same time, and all

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This report on the portrayal of violence in the electronic media is a flow-on from the committee of cabinet set up by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) following the tragic events of Port Arthur last year. At that time we received 700 submissions from concerned organisations and members of the community about this issue of the portrayal of violence in the electronic media.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time the committee of the cabinet identified 38 major submissions that could have a contribution in this area. It came up with a number of recommendations for this issue of controlling violence in the media. Those recommendations have largely been implemented and the Senate select committee on community standards is keeping track of their implementation. Towards the start of our report we list all those recommendations from the former committee and we give a progress report, current up to last week, where those matters are up to. The committee is very happy with the progress that has been made on this matter arising from the ministerial committee that was set up last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our committee was given the task of trawling through the 700 submissions in a lot 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more detail and also holding a seminar of the people or organisations who had been identified as putting in submissions with some of the more useful ideas. So in early December last year we invited 36 of the people who put in submissions to take part in a seminar in Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out of that arose a number of very useful suggestions for the control of excessive violence in the media, and many of these have been incorporated in this report. The way the day was structured was that we went through about five different topic areas, we had an outside facilitator and members of parliament were present. We had a very wide ranging and deep discussion about matters relating to what governments could possibly do, what research said about violence in the community, what the concerns were for different groups, what sorts of education programs could be developed and what sorts of controls should be put in place in this area with the use of new technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as a committee have sifted through those recommendations from that one-day seminar. We have unanimously adopted 18 recommendations, which we are now putting to the Senate. These, I believe, address the considerable concerns that arise in the community at present. Research shows that 75 per cent of people believe that violence shown on television is excessive and up to 68 per cent of the public believe that there should be more restrictions on violent movies, videos and video games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We found that evidence in striking contrast to what the television stations are telling us through their FACTS people: that their level of complaint is fairly low. That is probably a result of a feeling of disempowerment by people who feel that complaining to television stations is useless and nothing happens. Research shows that, for every person who does eventually complain, a vast number of others think of complaining but never follow it through. Probably the more accurate measure of what the community feel does come out of community surveys, which show that, as I said, about three&hyphen;quarters of the public have great concerns about this matter, and this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="650"> is what the committee has chosen to respond to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The groups that presented information to us on what should be done included quite a lot of professional people such as educators, psychologists and social workers. All were particularly strong in condemning violent programs on television. They shared the belief that young people, especially boys, who identified strongly with violent on&hyphen;screen characters had a tendency to behave in anti-social ways, which could prove to be harmful both to them and for those around them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The select committee is very aware that the debate on the effects of watching violent portrayals through the electronic media has raged for many years. The research evidence available to the committee stressed the association between repeated viewing of violent material and aggressive behaviour, desensitisation and fear, and that children, adolescents and people with aggressive tendencies appear to be particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of viewing such material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was not an inquiry into whether portrayals of violence actually cause violent behaviour. It is in this light that the committee has made its recommendations. The inquiry revealed widespread scepticism that the television stations are willing to listen to the community, and the committee heard repeated calls for the problem to be addressed. For this reason, the committee recommended that a telephone hotline be reintroduced through the ABA for the public to register its complaints about television programming, and for it not to go directly to the stations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the public believe that self-regulation works for the television industry, it is imperative they see that not only do television stations have well&hyphen;developed codes of practice but they abide by them as well. In order to achieve this, the committee is recommending that the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 be amended to enable the Australian Broadcasting Authority to implement penalties of up to $100,000 on television stations that breach their own codes of practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the committee's public seminar and in the majority of submissions a very deep 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concern was expressed that young children should be protected from repeated exposure to violent images, including violent cartoons. The committee is recommending, therefore, that in future these programs be classified by the ABA according to their strict standards for children's television.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the classification decisions made by the television stations, the committee is recommending that much more detailed consumer advice be provided so that the level of violence on programs is clearly indicated with a number of Vs&mdash;V for low level violence, VV for medium level violence and VVV for high level violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the major concerns that came out of the inquiry related to videos that contain a very high level of violence. In submissions and at the public seminar witnesses expressed the need for more control of this material and to make it less accessible by young people in the home. The committee is calling again for a stricter classification of this material. It is also recommending that the Office of Film and Literature Classification charge higher fees for the classification of material found to contain high level violence and that the extra funds raised in this way be used for a public education campaign aimed at highlighting the possible adverse effects of repeated exposure to violent material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee sees great potential value in education programs to promote a culture of non&hyphen;violence, and it is recommending that governments at all levels increase funds available for such programs, both in schools and through the community. I commend this report to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the first report which I have tabled concerns the proposed development of operational facilities at RAAF Base Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Defence proposes to provide the Base with facilities needed to perform its operational role in a safe and effective manner. The proposal examined by the Committee encompasses:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated out&hyphen;turn cost of the proposed work was $59.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the work should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that the military presence in Darwin reflects Government policy for an increased defensive presence in the north of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that RAAF Base Darwin is a vital component of the Defence infrastructure in the north and is likely to remain for many years at its present location.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By way of background, the report notes that the military and civilian infrastructure at RAAF Base Darwin represents a significant investment by the Commonwealth and the cost of relocating the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> RAAF Base to another site on the grounds of aircraft noise or public safety cannot be justified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In answer to a number of individuals and organisations who suggested that the RAAF Base should be relocated elsewhere on the ground of aircraft noise, the report acknowledges the responsible efforts of the RAAF in promulgating noise abatement procedures which have reduced the incidence of noise complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, the report recommends that the Department of Defence should establish a dedicated telephone line for receiving and recording any complaints about aircraft noise and a mechanism for their speedy investigation and reporting back to the complainants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the extensive works proposed, the Committee has concluded that they will enhance the operational effectiveness of RAAF Base Darwin as a forward operational redeployment and air defence base for Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second report which I have tabled deals with the proposed development of buildings and services in support of the Department of Defence Joint Project 2043, High Frequency Modernisation Project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Frequency Modernisation Project will provide for the installation of modern, state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art high frequency radio equipment to satisfy the needs of Army, Navy and Air Force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public works proposal will provide access roads, security, engineering services and buildings to house the transmitter, receiver and management functions of the network.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The entire modernisation project will cost $505 million, with building works and services estimated to cost $75 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the building works and services should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The high frequency modernisation will consist of four communications nodes, each comprising a transmitter station, receiver station and local management facility. There will also be a primary and secondary national management facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The communications nodes will be located in the Riverina, Townsville, North West Cape and Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that existing facilities are aged and need refurbishment and, at two communications nodes, new facilities are required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Facilities to house the high frequency equipment will be located on existing Defence properties and properties acquired for radio communications purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All are in areas which Defence believes are free of electromagnetic interference and have sufficient 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="652"> buffer zones to protect them from urban encroachment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed work will entail the construction of new facilities for the Riverina transmitter and receiver, on sites which Defence believes are suitable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Elsewhere, the proposal will make good use of existing facilities, which will need to be modified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once the high frequency network is operational, some existing Defence communications sites will be redundant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted that before excess properties are offered for sale, Defence should ensure that any soil contamination has been remedied, in accordance with State or local government requirements.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM (HEAVY VEHICLES REGISTRATION) BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I take great pleasure in introducing a package of two bills which form part of the national road transport reform program being undertaken cooperatively by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996 is necessary to facilitate the adoption of a nationally uniform regulatory regime for the registration of heavy vehicles. The Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996 is an essential component of the dangerous goods regulatory package designed to facilitate the adoption of a nationally uniform regulatory regime for transport of dangerous goods by road.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both bills are essential components of the regime of reformed road transport law being developed by Commonwealth, state and territory governments and the National Road Transport Commission under long-standing inter-governmental agreements. The objectives of national road transport reform are to produce improvements in road safety and transport efficiency, as well as reductions in the cost of administering road transport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The efficiency of Australia's road transport system has in the past been undermined by inconsistent or contradictory road regulations determined by each of the states and Territories, and this has impeded Australia's economic development. Accordingly, in January 1992 the National Road Transport Commission was established following agreement between the Commonwealth and the states and Territories to develop nationally uniform or consistent regulations relating to the construction and use of heavy vehicles. One of the priority areas set out in the so&hyphen;called Heavy Vehicles Agreement was the development of a national heavy vehicle registration scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission's role was subsequently expanded by a second agreement relating to light vehicles. This agreement, among other things, required the Commission, as a matter of priority, to develop and maintain national standards and associated codes of practice in relation to the transport of dangerous goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government strongly supports national road transport reform, as a significant component of transport micro&hyphen;economic reform. A nationally uniform or consistent regime for road transport regulation, rather than separate, inconsistent state and territory regulation for the road transport industry, will deliver substantial benefits to the industry, its users and the wider community and economy. It will remove the frustration, delay, inefficiencies and costs associated with differences in regulatory frameworks. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="653">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The national registration scheme to be established by the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996 is the first step towards removing the problems associated with the lack of national uniformity in the registration of heavy vehicles. The bill will establish the broad regulatory framework for the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The registration package will improve transport efficiency, enhance national uniformity, and reduce administrative costs, particularly for transport operators. The aim has been generally to retain the best features of existing practices and preserve flexibility for jurisdictions to appropriately manage local issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the bill contains a number of substantive provisions relating to the powers of registration authorities, the security of personal or commercially sensitive information and the review of decisions, it is intended that the administrative detail of the scheme will be contained in the Regulations to be made under the proposed act. The Regulations will also set out the obligations of registration authorities and registered operators of heavy vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The registration reforms were developed by the National Road Transport Commission in close consultation with the road transport industry and vehicle registration authorities in all states and Territories. Wide consultation was also undertaken with enforcement agencies and authorities responsible for the administration of third party insurance and stamp duty legislation. The proposed legislation requires compliance with existing state and territory laws in these areas. Comments received through these consultative processes have assisted the Commission in refining its final proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996 assists the development of the new national regulatory regime for the land transport of dangerous goods. The new regime contains three key components: the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act which was passed through this parliament in 1995 and which provides the broad legislative framework; the proposed Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Regulations which define the powers and duties of people involved in the transport of dangerous goods; and the sixth edition of the Australian Dangerous Goods Code which comprises the technical requirements forming the basis of the duties that are set out in the proposed Regulations as well as several non&hyphen;mandatory guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of the Dangerous Goods Amendment Bill is to amend the act to ensure that the proposed Regulations and Code can be appropriately administered, once made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ministerial Council for Road Transport voted unanimously in favour of the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the associated Regulations. On passage of the bill, it is intended that the Regulations will commence by proclamation on a date approved by the Ministerial Council. Ministerial Council also voted unanimously in favour of the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996. The associated regulations are currently being considered by state and territory regulatory authorities. Both bills have also received the support of industry and other major stakeholders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures in the Heavy Vehicles Registration Bill will have negligible impact on Commonwealth revenues or expenditure, but will impact on the states and Territories. The costs of implementing the scheme will fall mainly on registration authorities ($12.4 million in Net Present Value terms), while recurring benefits will accrue to those same registration authorities ($10 million), vehicle operators ($14 million) and enforcement agencies ($1.5 million).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Light Vehicles Agreement signed by Heads of government requires the National Road Transport Commission to demonstrate significant net benefits before including light vehicles in the scheme. Due to the high implementation costs which would be incurred by registration authorities, and the low estimated benefits of only $3.5 million annually (ie 30 cents per vehicle), the Commission recommended that the legislation not be extended to all vehicles at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures in the Dangerous Goods Amendment Bill have no impact on Commonwealth revenues or expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both bills have widespread support and I urge states and Territories to act speedily to adopt the reforms underpinned by the legislative package, once enacted by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM (DANGEROUS GOODS) AMENDMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I take great pleasure in introducing the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Amendment Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I outlined in my second reading speech covering the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Bill 1996, this bill is an essential component of the dangerous goods regulatory package which has been developed by the National Road Transport Commission and key stakeholders under the intergovernmental road transport agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes a number of administrative amendments to the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Act 1995. These amendments have been identified over the last 18 months, during extensive consultation with Commonwealth agencies, state and territory dangerous goods regulators

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PRODUCTIVITY COMMISSION BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the bill establishes a new body, the Productivity Commission, by merging the functions of the Industry Commission (IC), the Economic Planning Advisory Commission (EPAC) and the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE). The bill sets out the functions, powers and policy guidelines of the Productivity Commission, and its composition and procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister, in his Headland Speech "A Competitive Australia", on 18 July 1995, foreshadowed the establishment of the Productivity Commission as an election commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Productivity Commission (Repeals, Transitional and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996, shortly to be introduced, provides for the repeal of the Industry Commission Act 1989 and the Economic Planning Advisory Commission Act 1983, and for transitional matters and consequential amendments to other legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government wants greater public scrutiny and understanding of the factors driving Australia's productivity performance. Improving productivity 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> means obtaining a better return from our resources, our people and our capital. We must find ways of using them all in a more creative, efficient and wealth producing fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must also find ways of using our capital in a smarter, more intelligent, more modern fashion. Unless we boost productivity as a nation our incomes and living standards will fall further relative to our major competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Productivity Commission will be the government's principal advisory body on all aspects of microeconomic reform. It will continue to pursue the current functions of the IC, EPAC and BIE, but it will also have a broader charter. It will continue to have open and transparent consultative processes which engage industry and community groups in informed debate on important public policy making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, sound policy development must be based on a full appreciation of the facts. A primary role of the Productivity Commission will be to identify impediments to improved productivity in particular sectors. It will also have due regard to the important relationships between improved use of resources in one sector and the rest of the economy. It is only with this sort of information and economy&hyphen;wide focus that governments can make sensible and considered choices as to future policy. Choices that will ensure better and more sustained growth prospects for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Productivity Commission will have a particular focus on areas which impact on Australia's international competitiveness. Its research will include identifying best international practice in major industries and disseminating the results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Productivity Commission will also have the authority to examine labour market practices retarding productivity. Labour is a key input in the economy and its productivity growth is vital to sustaining increases in living standards. Liberating our labour market remains the greatest single economic and attitudinal change to be achieved if the important goals of a more productive and competitive Australia are to be realised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it is good enough to expose to public scrutiny arrangements working to the benefit of corporations and to the potential detriment of consumers, then it is good enough to expose restrictive labour market practices&mdash;also potentially working to the detriment of consumers&mdash;to the same scrutiny. Hence the Productivity Commission will be given a work program to identify restrictive work practices and significant labour market arrangements which add to the cost of doing business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Productivity Commission will not just focus on areas of Commonwealth responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The states and territories have an important role in the consideration of industry and productivity matters. The states have responsibilities in many 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="655"> sectors of the economy&mdash;for example, intrastate transport, port authorities, and electricity generation&mdash;which can impact significantly upon the efficiency and competitiveness of industry. The Productivity Commission will review areas of state and territory responsibilities. In recent years there has been increasing cooperation between the Industry Commission and the states and territories, and the government wishes to see this continue with the new Productivity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Productivity Commission will focus its attention on all sectors of the economy, including the service sector. Moreover it will have capacity to examine the efficiency of resource use within government through conducting program evaluations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of the Productivity Commission will allow for efficiencies in the economic inquiry work of the government. budgetary cost savings of $5m are expected in 1997&hyphen;98, $6.15m in 1998&hyphen;99, $6.15m in 1999&hyphen;2000, and $5m in 2000&hyphen;01.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to the main features of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes that the commencement date of the act be from the Royal Assent to the Productivity Commission (Repeals, Transitional and Consequential Amendments) Act 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill establishes the functions of the Productivity Commission. The principal functions are to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> hold inquiries and report about matters relating to industry and productivity that are referred to it by the minister;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> provide secretariat services and research services to government bodies, as directed by the minister;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> from 1 July 1997, receive and investigate complaints about the implementation of competitive neutrality arrangements in relation to Commonwealth government businesses and business activities, and to report to the minister on its investigations;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> provide advice to the minister about matters relating to industry and productivity as requested by the minister;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> undertake on its own initiative research about matters relating to industry and productivity; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> promote public understanding on matters relating to industry and productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill sets out the general policy guidelines for carrying out the Productivity Commission functions, which require it to have regard to the desire of the Commonwealth government to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> improve the overall economic performance of the economy through higher productivity in the public and private sectors in order to achieve higher living standards for all members of the Australian community; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> facilitate adjustment to structural changes in the economy and to ease social and economic hardships arising from those changes;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reduce the regulation of industry (including regulation by the states, territories and local government) where this is consistent with the social and economic goals of the Commonwealth Government;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> recognise the interests of industries, consumers and the community that are likely to be affected by measures proposed by the Productivity Commission; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> recognise the social and environmental consequences of measures proposed by the Productivity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for flexibility and a range of working methods in the performance of the Commission's functions. This will enable the Productivity Commission to mix and match its resources to its wide range of tasks consistent with enhancing its own productivity. In particular, the bill provides that the Productivity Commission is not required to act in a formal manner and may hold public seminars, conduct workshops and establish working groups and task forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no standing provisions requiring public hearings for the purposes of an inquiry, specifying the duration of inquiries or requiring the preparation of draft reports. These procedures are best determined in light of each reference to the Productivity Commission. In referring a matter to the Productivity Commission, the minister will be able to require it to hold public hearings, publish a draft report, or develop options. However, in the case of public inquiries it is expected that the Productivity Commission will usually produce a draft report, therefore facilitating community debate, and will usually present a range of options in its recommendations to the government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As indicated before the Productivity Commission will do much more than conduct inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill permits the minister to direct the Productivity Commission to provide secretariat services and research services to government bodies. For example, the Industry Commission currently provides secretariat services and research services to the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) to undertake performance monitoring of government trading enterprises and government service provision. The bill will allow this type of arrangement to be formalised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minister can request advice from the Productivity Commission about matters relating to industry and productivity. Unlike inquiries, when the minister requests advice from the Productivity Commission there is no facility for the Commission to conduct public hearings or publish its advice to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="656"> the minister. However, the minister may publish the advice provided in any way he or she thinks fit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission will be empowered to conduct research projects, which will be more narrowly focused compared with inquiries and be of shorter duration. While internally initiated research projects would be determined by the Productivity Commission, in setting topics it would be expected to be mindful of the views of the Commonwealth and state governments, business, and welfare groups. A common theme would be the factors underlying productivity growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A particular aspect of the Productivity Commission's research will be assessing the performance, including through benchmarking, of economic infrastructure such as ports and rail and of government services to business such as business licensing.Other ministers will be able to seek the minister's approval for the Productivity Commission to conduct inquiries or research into topics which fall within their portfolios. The bill also provides that the Productivity Commission may, with the minister's written agreement, and subject to any specific conditions set by the minister, provide research services to a person or body (other than a government body).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Office of Regulation Review will be maintained as a separate unit within the Productivity Commission. The Office of Regulation Review will provide advice to the government and to COAG, undertake research on regulatory standard setting, and contribute to the Legislation Review Program. The Office of Regulation Review is an important complement to the other activities of the Productivity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also details the competitive neutrality complaints mechanism to be operated by the Productivity Commission. As the Treasurer announced on 27 June 1996, when releasing the Commonwealth's Statement on Competitive Neutrality Policy, competitive neutrality requires that significant public sector businesses and business activities not have any advantages over their private sector rivals simply by virtue of their being government owned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The complaints mechanism provides for the Productivity Commission to investigate situations where Commonwealth Government business activities may not have had their advantages removed in accordance with the requirements of the policy statement, or where other Commonwealth government businesses should have their advantages resulting from government ownership removed. The complaints mechanism arrangements will commence from 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Productivity Commission will consist of a Chairman and between 4 and 11 Commissioners. The positions of Chairman and Commissioners are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> statutory appointments by the Governor&hyphen;General, for terms no longer than 5 years, though appointees are eligible for reappointment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bill before the Senate is the Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill 1996. This is a bill, as the title suggests, to amend the Trade Practices Act. The nature of the amendment proposed by the government could be characterised as a liberalisation of the act or a slight exercise in deregulation. I would prefer to call it a simplification of current procedures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The detail of the amendment is, I think, adequately covered in the explanatory memorandum. Essentially, the current situation is that a service provider can give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="658"> access undertaking setting out the terms and conditions of access it might offer to a third party on an item of infrastructure. In those circumstances the ACCC will have to publish the proposed undertaking and then go through a series of public consultations before accepting each undertaking. This bill simplifies that, rather than the ACCC undertaking multiple public consultations, one for the access code, if it has to authorise that particular access code, and others in relation to each particular use of that access code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments appear to the opposition, as I say, to be a simplification of current procedures. The amendments mean that, rather than doing it separately, an overarching determination can be made by the ACCC on the terms of access, and if applications are in conformity with that then access can be granted. We think this is a sensible proposal. We note that on such a simple proposal the government did not get it right the first time and that it has amendments itself to its own legislation. Those amendments extend the principle I have just described to the Senate and therefore are also acceptable to the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the great beneficiaries of these changes to the Trade Practices Act will be the national electricity grid: access to the grid will now, if these amendments are carried, be simplified. The national electricity grid, of course, is a Labor initiative. It is a major reform to the micro&hyphen;economic economy. It is a reform initiated by the Labor government under the rubric and heading of competition policy. It is a reform, I am pleased to say, that when we were in government was supported, and remains supported, by all of the states, and it is a reform that the now Liberal&hyphen;National party government is carrying forward as part of its commitment to micro&hyphen;economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a position we welcome, and we look forward to the realisation of what the initial report into competition policy said was achievable for the electricity industry: a saving to the national economy of about $2.2 billion because of rationalisation of the national electricity grid and the other changes that would be made. I think the actual signifi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cant saving by the coming into force of the national electricity grid is about half that, about $1.1 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previously we had a situation in which the states of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, not to mention my own state of Western Australia, took responsibility for generating electricity to meet their consumer demand within their state borders. One only has to look at the map of Australia to contemplate how inefficient this could be. In some states there was surplus commitment to capital construction by electricity generating authorities so that there was, at the peaks or troughs of the electricity cycle, shortages or overcapacity, as the case may be. A neighbouring state may have had an ability help out but, because a cartographer drew a line on a map saying, `This is a state,' the ability to help out the state that may have had a shortfall was often not available to the neighbouring state that had an overcapacity. This has brought all that onto a more coherent and rational basis. It is an overdue reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only state in Australia, I might say, that misses out on this, and that is because it is a long way away from the national centre, is the state of Western Australia, where electricity tariffs seem destined to remain higher than in the rest of Australia. That basically will continue to be so because we in Western Australia could not connect into a grid of this sort in the foreseeable future, if at all, and we will need to rely on our reserves of brown coal, which is an inefficient energy source compared to the black coal available in the eastern states, and, of course, natural gas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is a major reform and these changes to the industry access codes will help move that reform forward. We believe that is vitally important as a micro-economic reform to the Australian economy to help reduce electricity costs to consumers and to Australian business and, by cutting import costs for things such as electricity, to help Australian industries become more competitive within our region and globally. It is an important change for that reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition will be supporting the principal amendments moved by the government and this bill. However, I do foreshadow 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="659"> now that, in the committee stage of this bill, I will be moving amendments to the Trade Practices Act which are related to the petroleum industry. The amendments I will be moving seek to provide a legal right for each of Australia's 9,000 service stations to shop around for competitively priced wholesale petrol. They will establish, for the first time in Australia, an active wholesale petrol market. They will break up, for the first time in Australia, the vertically integrated control of the industry exercised by the major petrol companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments I will be moving will cause the establishment of an open market for wholesale petrol and will give Australian motorists, primary producers and businesses their best chance for lower petrol prices. Both the petrol distributors association, the APADA, and the Service Stations Association have estimated that the passage of these provisions through the parliament would lower retail prices by up to 6c per litre. The greatest price benefits would be enjoyed in regional Australia such as in Tasmania where the `Four Sisters' presently take three to four times the wholesale profit per volume of petrol sold in that market compared to Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other parts of regional Australia will also benefit. For that reason I sincerely trust that my colleagues in this place in the National Party who profess a commitment to regional Australia will see the merit of these amendments and vote with the opposition and not the government. These amendments should be embraced, however, by the government and passed as soon as possible. Only through downstream terminal access, legally mandated and guaranteed, can the coalition parties fulfil their major election commitment to lower petrol prices around Australia and narrow the city-country differential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government knows that this industry lacks active wholesale competition. The government knows that the petrol multinationals use their vertically integrated control of the industry from the refinery to the bowser to exploit motorists and enjoy oligopoly rents. But this is a government unwilling to act&mdash;or at least it has been so far. Its only plan is to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> move down the path of deregulation, giving the oil majors more power and more vertical control, especially at the retail level. The government knows the problem but will not embrace the only commonsense solution&mdash;downstream access to petrol terminals under part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 7 January, the National Party's self-styled spokesman on petrol, the member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), criticised petrol prices during the holiday break saying that `in some cases it was blatant exploitation'. He told the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that the government embarked on deregulation `on the assumption that this was a competitive market, but inexplicable price rises raise questions about exactly how competitive it is'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not too late for the government to abandon its deregulation plans. These amendments show it how to do that. The National Party, in particular, needs to stand up to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and his hand&hyphen;in&hyphen;glove relationship with the petrol multinationals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act is designed to provide downstream retail access in vertically integrated monopoly and oligopoly markets. It was introduced by the former Labor government to secure consumer benefits in electricity, gas and like markets. It can legitimately be applied to the private sector as much as to public utilities. The structure of the petrol industry in Australia is the same as electricity&mdash;that is, it is a largely undifferentiated product with a concentrated market structure integrated between the production, distribution and retail stages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A handful of companies in Australia own each of the nation's petrol refineries and terminals. They have substantial ownership interests and control at the distribution stage. Through company owned, branded and tightly franchised service stations they effectively control the retail market. The major companies have developed a market area pricing&mdash;MAP&mdash;system to manipulate retail prices and effectively sidestep the ACCC's industry monitoring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent months, employees from the major companies have contacted not only me but the shadow minister in the lower house for competition policy, the member for Werriwa 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="660"> (Mr Latham), to explain their role in the MAP system. Their job is to drive around the local area each morning and report back to head office on what the other major brands are charging. This indicative price minus a small retail margin then forms the basis of the buying price made available to individual retailers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through this system and the manipulation of transport subsidies and service station rebates, the major companies are able to maximise their profits. For consumers, it frequently means higher prices during the holiday season and on weekends, plus local price variations and a city-country price differential that cannot be explained in terms of transport costs. The MAP system is proof positive that the anti&hyphen;competitive features of the petrol industry in Australia sit in the boardrooms of Shell, BP, Mobil and Ampol&mdash;not among the country's 9,000 service station small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The petrol retail sector in Australia is already competitive. These amendments aim to apply competition policy to the wholesale sector&mdash;that is, for existing service stations and new buyer cooperatives, especially in the bush, a downstream legal right to obtain product at commercially negotiated prices, terms and conditions that may be subject to the ACCC's analysis and determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government talks about terminal access, it only means physical access&mdash;the right to purchase wholesale petrol, but on terms and conditions dictated by the oil majors. These amendments seek to entrench competitive price access into the laws of the Commonwealth. They apply the same market principles which the oil majors apply to themselves through their horizontal sharing of terminal facilities. This is the great irony of the current market structure&mdash;how petrol purchased from a BP franchise might have been supplied by a Shell terminal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majors are willing to lower their costs by sharing terminal products between themselves, but they will not allow the retail sector to lower its costs through competitive wholesale pricing. Downstream access, more than ever, is essential for fair competition in the petrol retail sector. Woolworths is presently 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> establishing itself as another vertically integrated major with access to cheap wholesale petrol. Predictably enough, it is also establishing horizontal alliances with the other majors. Unless branded and franchised stations can also access cheaper wholesale petrol, they face closure at the hands of Woolworths.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government, despite all its election promises, has endorsed the closure of 3,000 service stations, small businesses, with a subsequent loss of some 15,000 jobs in regional Australia. This rationalisation should not proceed on such an unlevel playing field. This is the purpose of establishing downstream access. Small petrol retailers will not need the resources of Woolworths, and have to establish their own terminal infrastructure to competitively access wholesale petrol. Existing service stations in country towns will have the same terminal access rights as any new competitor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments deliver that legal access right on the basis of the principles of fair competition for Australia's petrol industry. They shift market power from the large oil multinationals to the small business retail sector and to consumers. It is by far the best way for this parliament to deliver cheaper petrol prices to Australian motorists, farmers and businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the appropriate time in the committee stage, I will be moving those amendments to give force to those points that I have just made. I might also take the time to inform the Senate that, on my understanding, one of my colleagues in the other place, the member for Werriwa, Mark Latham MP, has a private member's bill on this same issue before the House as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of petrol prices and true competition in the wholesale end of the oil industry market is a vital question for Australia. Competition can deliver lower prices to consumers. In our view, that is directly consistent with the principles of competition policy. It is also directly consistent with reducing input costs to Australian businesses so that they can become more internationally competitive. We will be supporting the amendments of the government as well as

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill 1996 seeks to insert into the infrastructure access provision of the Trade Practices Act provisions allowing the electricity industry to develop an industry code, and for the ACCC to use this code as the basis of undertakings from service providers. The bill also has the effect of using this streamlined process to avoid the extensive consultative provisions inserted into the Trade Practices Act in respect of authorisations covering access issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims that this bill is an essential and progressive step in the implementation of competition policy principles in the electricity industry. It sets the access provisions by which service providers can access the common electricity grid. This, it claims, will help facilitate the delivery of the massive efficiency and consumer benefits that the competition policy cornucopia will provide for Australia. The relevant minister, Senator Kemp, refers to the estimate by the Industry Commission that competition policy reforms in electricity alone will lead to a $5.8 billion annual increase in gross domestic product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the Industry Commission's famous work on the huge benefits of competition policy was one of the more blinkered, value ridden and factually faulty documents the commission has produced, even by its own New Right standards. Economics professor John Quiggon showed that the report was riddled with assumptions, double counting errors and wild predictions that left it barely worth the paper it was written on. That did not stop the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer of the last government quoting it regularly as holy writ, and I am disappointed to see that it is certainly not going to stop the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) quoting the same dodgy report here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The assumptions implicit in the IC's approach came through in the IC's submission to the National Competition Council on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> national access guidelines which was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> I think on Wednesday. There, it seems that the Industry Commission is arguing that the benefits of competition policy from access codes can only come if there is no competition. Innovative infrastructure developers, the Industry Commission argued, will be reluctant to invest if there is some prospect that some other person, daring to want to compete against their monopoly infrastructure, wants access to it. How terrible!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission went on to warn the National Competition Council from reading too much into the public interest in determining access issues, urging it to look at competition from a `economy wide perspective' and to avoid `potentially conflicting objectives' in assessing the public interest. I presume that by those nasty potentially conflicting objectives, the Industry Commission is referring to the obligations of the NCC, the National Competition Council, to have regard to environmental, social and consumer consequences in assessing the public interest set out in the competition principles agreement and elsewhere. No, they do not want any of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was surprised that the Industry Commission was so worried about the private sector not being prepared to invest in infrastructure. When it completes its takeover bid&mdash;on a monopoly basis, of course&mdash;for EPAC and the BIE, it will inherit a body of excellent research showing that there is absolutely no shortage of private sector investors for infrastructure. Indeed, EPAC in its 1995 report went so far as to argue that there was no justification for the $300 million a year infrastructure borrowing tax concession which is propping up private sector infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are a little concerned about the curtailing of the consultative process in relation to access undertaking implicit in this bill. There are several issues that it raises, particularly about the capacity of the ACCC to adequately access review and enforce undertakings. Those issues I will pursue in the committee stage. Senator Kemp, you must not get alarmed that we are going to vote against your bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We just do not accept that the much hoped for benefits will necessarily arise. However, we are willing, as we have done on other matters, to give you the chance to prove yourselves right and to prove the previous government right. However, it would be helpful if at some future date an assessment of the forecasts was made against the reality of what is delivered. I am sure in a year or two you will be able to see whether those forecasts are wrong or whether they are right. We think they are likely to be wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will therefore foreshadow that we will support your government amendments. I will also foreshadow that there are elements of Senator Margetts's amendments that we will be supporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to move on to the remarks Senator Cook has made about his proposed amendments. Those amendments would result in petroleum terminals becoming declared services under part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act with the intention that service station operators would then be able to secure access to competitively priced fuel supplies from oil company terminals. Presently, service station operators are not able to secure access to oil company terminals and can only access their fuel supplies at the highest wholesale price delivered by their oil company or its agent&mdash;the result being that service station operators do not have access to cheaper wholesale fuel, nor are they able to seek, where that is feasible, to avoid costs incurred by the oil company by accessing terminals on their own behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we all know, the Australian petroleum industry is highly vertically integrated and that vertical integration is made possible by the exclusive supply arrangements that the oil companies impose on their franchisees. Franchisees are approximately 75 per cent of all fuels sold to motorists and are, by the existence of the tied arrangements, prevented from accessing cheaper fuel and passing that benefit on to motorists. By contrast, Senator Cook's amendment would seek to provide service station operators with a legal right to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> access oil company terminals to secure lower prices for consumers and greater competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should also be remembered that petroleum fuel is a generic utility good and as such under competition policy it should not be treated any differently from other generic utility goods such as gas, water and electricity. In those industries vertical integration is now judged to be against the best interests of the economy and of consumers. The focus in this country has been much more on horizontal integration and horizontal concentration of industry and the competition or lack of it arising therefrom than on backward and forward vertical integration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The monopolisation and undue concentration of our economy is one of the worst features of the Australian economy and of commercial life and it has been reinforced and consolidated through the state and federal policies of Labor and coalition governments. In my opinion, both Labor and the coalition stand condemned for the nature of our economy in many respects because of those characteristics. The petrol and oil industry is an example of a de facto cartel industry manipulated at every level from a top&hyphen;down strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to declare my interest, if I may, as a trustee influencing the purchase of Woolworths shares, but I agree with the remarks of Senator Cook. I am strongly opposed to the further unhealthy concentration of power in the hands of the oligopolists. I do regard it as an oligopolised market. As an example, the extraordinarily successful Woolmart organisation in the United States only enjoys somewhere between two and three per cent market share. If you start adding Woolworths, Coles&hyphen;Myer, Franklins and a few others together in the oligopolist structure, you will find they are up in the 70 per cent range, and that is very, very dangerous. It is something I hope this government will attend to as the realities of the last generation of economic rationalist and fundamentalist New Right economics comes home to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said all that, Senator Cook, I will foreshadow to the government that the Australian Democrats will be supporting your 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="663"> amendment. We think it is in the right direction. We do oppose the further concentration of power in the hands of already overpowerful commercial interests and we think this is a small&mdash;and I am referring to Senator Cook's amendment&mdash;but good step towards starting to unravel that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would go further and say that if the government and the opposition do not start to pay attention to actually separating the various levels of vertical integration&mdash;in other words, separating out production from wholesale from retail, as the Americans and some other economies have done in a number of sectors&mdash;this kind of amendment will not have the full effect that it should have. I hope that in due course I could have some good discussions with you, Senator Cook, and hopefully with the government in that regard, particularly about industries which are detrimentally affected. That is all I have to say until the committee stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The primary purpose of the Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill 1996 is to accelerate the approval process for access to infrastructure services in network industries. This, the government argues, is a critical step in establishing the national electricity market and, more generally, is critical in making infrastructure industries more competitive. However, the bill is achieving these aims by limiting the public consultation requirements of the existing act and by not including a broad enough definition of the public interest in regard to developing codes of conduct for network industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current act, a two&hyphen;stage public consultation process has developed for approving access undertakings to infrastructure services. Within specific industries a general code is developed governing the arrangements by which third parties gain access to infrastructure services in that industry. This code then provides the basis for specific undertakings lodged by individual service providers with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, which outline the terms and conditions under which the provider will offer their services to third 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parties. In both cases, the ACCC must engage in public consultation before giving approval.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill currently being discussed will remove the need for public consultation on the access undertakings given by service providers. If the ACCC adjudges that undertakings from individual service providers conform to the industry access code, then the ACCC will be able to approve them without public consultation. We are unhappy that a round of public consultation has simply been removed and that decisions about access to essential infrastructure facilities have been delegated solely to the ACCC. You only have to look at the level of concern in the community in relation to phone towers and cables to realise what interest there is in telecommunication access codes and the manner in which such service providers are given licences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a level of concern in the community. Often it is not until after such bills go through that many more people in the community begin to see how this affects them. Suddenly they find that they do not have a say any more. We believe that this action unduly concentrates power in the hands of the ACCC. The ACCC was given a great deal of power in the competition policy legislation of last year or the year before. There should be some kind of review procedure for its decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our major concern about the bill is that the concept of public interest that is used when establishing codes of conduct for network industries is not adequate. We argued that very strongly before in relation to the competition policy legislation when it was put forward. I would like to hope that more people have heard those concerns. We have heard Labor, I am pleased to say, at state level, especially in relation to elections&mdash;whether it is the Western Australian election or whether it is the South Australian election&mdash;saying that it will stand up against the tide of competition policy and the way it is occurring at state level. Part of what is necessary is to revisit such things as public interest to make sure that a range or breadth of concerns are built in. It is no good having a public interest provision that is so narrow that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="664"> it really reflects what competition policy is about: public interest equals competition policy. The assurances that are given&mdash;`Don't worry, there are public interest provisions here,'&mdash;mean nothing if those public interest provisions do not have a broad enough base so that people feel that there are other aspects of policy that can be brought into the decision making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Network industries are involved in the provision to the community of such essential services as electricity, gas and water, so you can see how broad this can be. When determining the conduct of the market in these essential services, public interest must be the single most important consideration, not profitability and not just the price of the service. The public interest must, in my opinion, be the single most important consideration. Instead, the government seems to believe that the most important consideration is increased competition. We will move an amendment which we believe will more fully reflect the variety of factors which make up public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government does not think there is public interest, that is their opinion. But, if you ask the community what they think should be included in public interest, I think you would get a different answer. Public interest is about having someone to oversee the situation to make sure that the thing is not going skew whiff and, basically, that people are not getting a raw deal in many ways. There is no point in having cheaper utility prices if other amenities are being removed or if people's enjoyment of life is being badly affected in that process. Many people are very concerned about these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We note also that the government has now moved amendments of its own to the bill or is proposing amendments. The first amendment reduces the level of detail that is required from individual service providers when they present access undertakings to the ACCC. In our opinion, this makes a bad bill worse. When determining the conditions under which access will be granted to essential network facilities, the highest level of detail should be mandatory.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another point. Under this bill industry does get a say about the access codes; the community does not. So, once again, we have shifted one step closer to self&hyphen;regulation in very important industries which affect public service provision. That makes it even more important that we broaden the understanding of public interest. If we say that industry has a power of veto, then it is very important that there is something within the law that says public interest is not this narrow idea of competition. If you look back further into the competition policy legislation, the public interest provision is very narrow. It is very difficult for the community to have a say in it. It is important, we believe, that we are consistent, and it is important, we believe, that these issues are brought out in such debates as the one today.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Trade Practices Amendment (Industry Access Codes) Bill 1996 which is before the chamber aims to improve the operation of part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act, thereby facilitating reform of major infrastructure sectors of the economy by facilitating access to essential facilities such as electricity grids, thereby permitting competition in those sectors and providing very substantial benefits to consumers, businesses and the economy more generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill essentially aims to improve and streamline the process whereby the owners of so&hyphen;called essential facilities undertake to allow other parties access to those facilities. The bill is particularly designed to promote the establishment of a national competitive electricity market. A 1995 report by the Industry Commission estimated that the annual benefits to Australia's gross domestic product of electricity and gas reform would be around $5.8 billion or approximately 25 per cent of the total benefits expected from the national competition policy reforms. I notice Senator Murray seems to doubt those figures. But, as he said, and I suppose we will not argue, time will tell. We think that that is a fair estimate based on the information which was available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government rejects the Greens' amendments to the bill. These amendments would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="665"> transform the effective, appropriate and streamlined voluntary access mechanism into a process oriented, costly and time consuming ordeal for both access providers and seekers. The only certain outcome from such an approach would be a substantial delay in micro&hyphen;economic reform, particularly in the establishment of a national competitive electricity sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will be moving two amendments to the bill in the committee stage. The government welcomes any support for the bill which I have detected in the chamber, although unfortunately there will be a number of amendments moved by the non&hyphen;government parties which will not assist the bill. In fact, a number of these amendments, as I will outline, are flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We welcome the Labor Party's support for the bill and the government's amendments to the bill. However, let me make it quite clear that the government will be opposing the Labor Party's amendments to the bill. I suspect this will be the subject of some debate in the committee stage. It has to be said that the amendments proposed by Senator Cook have nothing to do with the bill before the Senate. They are simply, in our view, a somewhat cynical attempt to criticise the government's petroleum industry reforms. The fact is, Senator Cook, that in your 13 years of office, the ALP did literally nothing to lower petrol prices to consumers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, you only have to look at your petrol pricing and the serious need for reforms when we came into office, which you had refused to move on. Senator Murray, the government is progressing reforms to deliver lower petrol prices and, regrettably, the ALP seems determined to undermine this reform agenda, which I think is a great pity. We will debate this further in the committee stage but the reality is that the amendments proposed by the Labor Party are seriously flawed in terms of actually trying to achieve their own objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is part of the mischief which has been created, but an equal part is that these amendments were simply not made available. They 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> were put in the chamber at the last moment. No&hyphen;one had a chance to look at them. My office was seeking the Labor Party amendments last night so that we could have a look at them. They were thrust on the chamber. I have to say that, to accept on the face of them that, because of some weasel words from Senator Cook, these will solve all these problems, is just plain wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge Senator Murray to think again. We are moving strongly on the issue of petrol prices. We have put down a clear policy. The Labor Party, desperate to recover some ground in regional areas from its failures over 13 years is attempting to undermine the government's reform. We have seen how the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) ended up with egg on his face recently in relation to this issue&mdash;seriously on his face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is constant argument that we need to have more consultation about legislation which is brought forward. The reality is, and I put this before the chamber, that I do not think anyone can doubt that government ministers are making themselves and their officers available to properly brief non&hyphen;government parties. Equally, the Labor Party comes in here and springs on these amendments. We could not get copies of them last night. Senator Murray, I certainly urge you to think again. If the Labor Party's bona fides in this area were serious, they would have put these amendments out so that there could have been a proper debate on and consideration of them. Senator Cook, it is a most unsatisfactory way to operate a serious bill. As a former government minister, I think you should have known better.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first amendment relaxes the level of detail required in access undertakings, in particular. An undertaking cannot include a maximum price and/or a formula with coefficients that are determined from time to time. It was never intended that the requirement for detail be read in this way. In the case of industries such as the electricity industry, undertakings should provide a framework for negotiations about access with individual contracts setting out the detail. Accordingly, the first amendment provides for the requirement for detail to be relaxed. Undertakings would set out obligations in connection with access, leaving the level of detail to a case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second amendment relates to powers of the commission to make determinations. Whilst section 44ZZA(6) confers powers on the commission to resolve disputes in accordance with an undertaking, there are no provisions for the commission to make determinations in the absence of a dispute. Conceptually, it would be possible to manufacture such a dispute, but this is an awkward way of regulating access issues.</PARA>

I have to say, Senator Murray, that unlike the Labor Party in this area there have been some constructive discussions and a willingness to try to work through what are often complex issues without indulging in undue point scoring and political manoeuvring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just for clarification, it is perhaps worth mentioning how the public interest provisions of the Trade Practices Act operate. In the act, public interest must be considered when the ACCC is examining an application for authorisation and when the ACCC is examining an access undertaking. The act provides that when performing these functions the ACCC must publish the application and call for public submissions. Similarly, the amendments in the bill provide that the ACCC, before attempting an access code, must engage in public consultation. I think that perhaps goes a little way to addressing some of the issues Senator Margetts raised. It seems to me to perhaps clarify something which may have led to some confusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to resources, when it was established in November 1995 the ACCC received an increase of 51 staff from 1995 to 1996 to undertake new functions arising out of the competition policy reforms. Recent reform of the scope of prices surveillance, as announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in September 1996, allows for the freeing up of ACCC resources for use on the ACCC's competition 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> policy reform work. Let me assure you: the government is committed to ensuring that the ACCC has sufficient resources to perform its responsibilities in areas such as electricity. We are anxious that the work is done and we believe that the resources are there. I have mentioned the increase in staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on my feet, I will refer to public interest. That was a matter Senator Margetts raised. I wrote to the senator about how public interest is determined. I do not know from her comments whether it did address her concerns&mdash;</PARA>

The list is non-exclusive and specifically includes policies relating to ecologically sustainable development, social welfare and equity considerations, including community service obligations, and economic and regional development. I know that you attempt to define it in a narrow way. I think we are indicating that a wider range of interests are taken into account. That was the effort to explain that to you.

If your optimistic view is right, and if this does deliver immense benefits to the community, including $5.8 billion worth, there is a lot at stake. The power of enforcement is therefore an important one. Are there specific penalties, fines or specific and meaningful enforcement provisions available to the ACCC? If, in the scheme of things, there are thousands of dollars worth of fines versus billions of dollars worth of benefits, you can see that they might not have much effect.

<PARA STYLE="Para">When I addressed the Senate in the debate on the second reading, I gave, for want of a better description, a second reading to these amendments by spending some time spelling out the purpose of them. Since then I note, with appreciation, that the Australian Democrats have indicated their support for these amendments. I am not entirely sure whether I caught the position of the Greens, but I am sure they will make that clear. I was overwhelmed by the opposition of the government to these amendments because that constituted most of the second reading reply by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, these points perhaps need to be made. The purpose of these amendments is to bring greater competition to the oil industry in Australia. All of us in this chamber know that there is competition in the oil industry at retail level but there is no competition at wholesale level. Retailers purchase from an oligopoly, which seems to control prices, between themselves. It is not at all surprising, as I said in  my second reading remarks, that you would buy BP petrol from a service station that has been supplied by a Shell terminal or, in my own state of Western Australia, you might buy Ampol petrol from the BP refinery at Kwinana because BP 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> supplies all the petrol stations in Western Australia. As you move around Australia, this is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of my amendments is to enable competition between wholesalers and to require that as part of the national competition and consumer policy in the competition policy regime in Australia. What do we have from the government when we talk about introducing competition, which will have the direct impact of reducing prices at the bowser for Australian consumers and, importantly, reducing prices at the bowser for consumers of petroleum products who live in regional Australia? We have two points. Both these points were made by the minister in his second reading reply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point was that the government is committed to bringing down petrol prices and it has its own program to do so. Congratulations to the government for that, if it succeeds. We have a view about the likelihood of that success, but one hopes that it does work. That is not an argument to say that if prices could be reduced further, we should not go  further and reduce those prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental point here is that the cost of petrol or diesel fuel is an input cost to Australian business. If those prices can be reduced, obviously, the retail prices those businesses charge for their services or their goods can also be reduced, making the cost to the Australian consumer of those products less, meaning that where Australian companies are in competition with foreign companies, we will be able to reduce our prices in that market, and where we are trying to export, we will be able to reduce our prices and win greater market share. It is a question of economic efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the first point&mdash;that the government says we are doing something about it&mdash;if the imputation is that, therefore, nothing else should be done, I think that imputation should be rejected by the Senate. If something can be done or if a lot of things can be done, all of which will have the effect of reducing costs and introducing competition, they all should be done. The principle we are talking about here is a principle of economic efficiency 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="670"> under the competition guidelines which we are simply applying to the petrol market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second argument raised by the government in the second reading speech was that we did not give them  sufficient notice of our amendment&mdash;that they tried to obtain a copy of it last night and could not, and that this is point scoring by the Australian Labor Party, springing a surprise on them in the chamber without proper debate. If all those things are true, I regret that the government has not received proper notice if, indeed, it has not. I am surprised that it could not obtain a copy of our amendments last night. I do not recall any contact with my office in an effort to do so. If the government says it could not, I accept its word for it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question here is: should a procedure of formality block an issue of principle? If the formality and procedure and the lack of due courtesy&mdash;if I accept the full weight of the government's criticism, which may be arguable, but for the sake of the occasion, let me accept it&mdash;are to block the application of an overriding principle, which will have an important effect on this industry, in weighing which way one should go, one should always opt for the principle and accept that the principle here is valid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With those remarks, and having moved my amendments, I hope that the National Party has paid attention to the impact these changes will have on the retail price of petrol in country areas.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of issues involved in the opposition's amendments. Honourable senators may recall that on more than one occasion I have indicated that the price of petroleum internationally is actually artificially low, the price that we pay for petroleum is artificially low, and the reason is because the world petroleum sources are moving towards their halfway point. There is usually good reason why much of the rest of the world's petroleum resources have not been obtained and the reason is related to the cost of production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the cost of production but it is the cost of energy that is important. If you end up expending more energy to get out 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> your energy, it never becomes economical. No matter how many dollars are involved and no matter how short petroleum becomes at some stage, if it costs more energy to get the petroleum out of the ground or the sea or wherever than you gain from petroleum, it never becomes economical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst technology changes, that cost of energy must be taken into consideration. I think it is not taken into consideration enough in government policy. So in that sense we are living in a bit of a paradise as far as petroleum is concerned. The price is artificially low, and it has been for some time. It is not helping us properly to adjust to what could be in a relatively short time quite substantial increases in petroleum costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not the only one to have come up with these figures. Even Senator Parer has admitted in this chamber that the government accepts this model, and international petroleum consultants have come to the same conclusion. I am not talking about environmental consultants but basically petro&hyphen;consultants who have done a lot of work on this issue. So in reality we are living in a paradise. I say to those people who want cheap fuel that it will not be around for long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to put that generally on the table first: that we ought to be realistic about the price of fuel and get used to the fact that trying to get the lowest price now may not allow us to be realistic about our petroleum use in the future. Perhaps we have to look more at alternatives to the use of petroleum, alternatives in types of transport and alternatives to the use of petroleum resources in other industries as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, we are dealing with a situation where the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission still has elements of the old Industry Commission, which I think had a fairly well recognised big business orientation. That often meant that the ability for small businesses to survive and compete fairly was perhaps not given the priority that the concerns of large industry were given, and often the ability for large industry to be profitable was equated to competition. Of course, this is not necessarily the case.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="671">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that people who have to get from A to B cannot, in the short term at least, make different decisions if the price of petroleum goes up or down. So in the short term at least those decisions may be inelastic; that is, people might go from petrol station to petrol station depending on the price but when there is a change in price they will not necessarily be able to use much more or much less petrol in the short term. That is especially the case for people in a country town which has only one source of petrol. They still have to get from A to B. Until there are changes in transport modes, types of cars, types of engines and so on, in the short term it is very hard to change those decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that, we must consider, as Senator Murray has indicated&mdash;and I fully agree with him&mdash;the level of vertical integration in the petroleum industry. It is a well established fact that companies drill for oil, they produce it, they market it and they are then involved with the retail trade as well. They go right from go to whoa and have a lot of control over very large players and a very large industry right down to the selling of groceries at 24&hyphen;hour petrol stations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a lot of vertical integration. Therefore, we need to be concerned about whether or not we should be assisting that ongoing vertical integration, which often pushes out a lot of small businesses, or looking at what the total outcomes are. I think we ought to be looking at the total outcomes. Because of that, I am prepared to support the opposition's amendment that we do provide the means by which operators of petrol stations can make a choice about their sources of petroleum. Therefore, I indicate that I will be supporting this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This concept of competition in the fuel industry, particularly the petrol industry, has been around for a long time. There has been, I suppose, well&hyphen;meaning attempts to do something about it. For example, ACTU Solo was formed when I was on the ACTU executive. I was not terribly convinced that that would work. I do not think it ultimately did work. For a short time it brought down prices 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in particular suburbs of Melbourne, but what good did it do elsewhere?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose I support in principle every attempt to tackle this problem, and I am inclined to support the proposal put by Senator Cook. The question is: will it work? As Senator Margetts has said, there is virtually a stranglehold on the industry. This is not going to touch the producers; it will touch the wholesalers. The people who are really hurting at the moment in some areas are the retailers&mdash;the people who are working in the retail trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as an aside I would like to comment on the ACCC. What worries me a little&mdash;and I do not want to foreshadow my view on the next amendment&mdash;is the term `in the public interest' being tied in. What do they take `in the public interest' to mean? Do they say that the public interest is that a shop should be open 24 hours seven days a week. Is that in the community interest, in the public interest?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are facing that very issue, which has been coming from the ACCC&mdash;and that is a problem. It is certainly a problem for the workers concerned. It is a problem for a lot of retailers. If that is the sort of philosophy that is being advanced by people in that area, then I would be very wary about what is meant by amendments which include terms like `public interest', `community interest' and all the rest of it. Obviously we have to have that there, but we really do have to tie down what the people administering that mean. The only way to ultimately do that, I suppose, is by legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said all that, I am just wondering what the government's practical arguments are against the amendment that has been put forward by Senator Cook. For example, if this is successful, what effect is it going to have on fuel for the bush? ACTU Solo might have a bit of an effect on fuel in some cities. But what effect is it going to have on fuel for the bush? What sort of mechanism can we look at to ensure that there is some sort of equal treatment, if you like, for people who are in the bush.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are bigger questions, I know, than the ones that are dealt with in this particular bill. I support the measure and I support the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="672"> amendment that was moved by Senator Kemp, the Assistant Treasurer. But I just raise those points. I am inclined to support Senator Cook's amendment in the absence of any very detailed opposition by the government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My reasons for supporting Senator Cook's amendment have been spelt out in some detail in the second reading debate, but I think I should amplify in this respect: I am far less concerned about pricing than I am about the predatory control of the many by the few which exists at the moment in that industry. It is that predatory control which this amendment starts to affect and attack. It may indeed in some respects raise prices and not lower prices. I say that not universally but for the reasons that follow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Oil companies make their profits upstream. They often make sure through transfer pricing that their profits are held and made elsewhere than Australia. In relation to those who are pressured in the secondary and tertiary sectors of this industry&mdash;in the wholesale and retail sectors&mdash;their profitability is often excessively squeezed. The effect of Senator Cook's amendment is likely to be felt most at the buying end and not at the selling end, in that those who buy for onward sale and for retail will be able to buy at better prices and will be able to shop around. But they will not always want to pass that on if their profitability&mdash;and this is the point Senator Margetts made, and made correctly&mdash;is such that it needs restoring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effects of predatory control are not always just on behaviour but on the state, the finances, the balance sheets and the cashflow of businesses. I think Senator Cook's amendment is very helpful in starting to reduce that predatory control and giving those businesses affected&mdash;and many of them are Australian businesses&mdash;more opportunity to operate freely in the market, and free markets are very much in your lexicon, Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I want to come back to some of the points that Senator Harradine 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made. You have said, Minister, that this issue has been sprung upon you. I do not know whether you used those exact words, but that was certainly your meaning. But all of us who are concerned with these issues are very well acquainted with the industry. There have been, as Senator Harradine has outlined, numerous reports, there has been much debate and each and every one of us has had visits and lobbying from all the various sectors in the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors of this industry. So, in that sense, you are not unaware of the issues&mdash;whilst you may not be aware of the detail of Senator Cook's amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a little surprised by the vehemence and aggression, although couched in fairly courteous terms, with which the government wants to reject this. I am not sure how this change really undermines government reforms to the petroleum industry. It may in fact enhance and assist it by opening up the market. I think those are the points that Senator Cook and Senator Harradine have alluded to. So I think your reply needs to very clearly indicate to all of us exactly how this is going to make matters worse rather than better for the petroleum industry, because I think it is going to be a very critical answer that you are going to supply.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was not quite the impression you created. I doubt whether I have ever seen more confusion surrounding the outcome of an amendment as this debate has shown. Senator Cook, this bill has been around for some six months. The amendments were thrust on the chamber when the bill came forward, so there has been no proper consideration of the effect of these measures. I hope the independent senators will reflect on what an absurd process this is, and I will be outlining some of what we see as the flaws of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="673"> the amendment, given the fact that we have had only a short time to look at them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook supports competition policies. He believes that this will lead to cheaper prices. Senator Murray believes it could lead to higher prices, but he is still going to support the amendment. Senator Margetts is going to support the amendment, noting the argument from Senator Cook that it will lead to lower prices, but Senator Margetts wants higher prices. That was the point that Senator Margetts was making. Senator Harradine referred to some sort of historical perspective on this whole issue which, he correctly says, has been around for quite a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first thing I would put before the chamber, particularly to the Independent senators, is that the government was anxious to discuss all amendments. We were available to discuss all amendments. The amendments have been thrust on the chamber without any or proper consultation. There has been confusion surrounding the meaning of these amendments. Even those who are supporting the amendment moved by Senator Cook believe it will deliver separate outcomes or not deliver the outcomes that Senator Cook says that his amendment is designed to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments are poorly drafted. Not only do people differ on the likely outcome of the objective, but also they are poorly drafted. For example, a declaration sets up only a right to negotiate. It does not give access to terminals with the transparent terminal gate process, which is what is needed for greater competition in the petroleum industry. It is arguable that the service provided by a petroleum terminal is the refining of crude oil. Hence, a service station owner would need to provide his own crude to be refined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had these amendments. They have been thrust on us. They are designed purely for a short-term political purpose. We do not even think&mdash;on the advice that I have&mdash;that they will achieve the goal that Senator Cook sets out. Senator Margetts wants higher prices, not lower prices, but Senator Cook says that this will get lower prices. So I do not see, really, Senator Margetts&mdash;you may have a different amendment&mdash;how you could support 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> an amendment which is strongly argued in favour of producing lower prices. Senator Harradine raised in this debate how this will deliver lower prices. I am intrigued to hear what the answer is because you have not, in your remarks, provided any figures at all. And no wonder, because it has all been done on the run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that the amendments are poorly drafted. Our officials are still looking at them. They are poorly drafted for two of the reasons which I have put down there. The chamber does not accept&mdash;at least a significant proportion of the chamber does not seem to accept&mdash;that the amendments will achieve the very goal that they set out to achieve. To people who are wavering, Independent senators who may be interested in the arguments, let me say that the amendments are poorly drafted. They were brought into this chamber at the last moment and they were not available to be subjected to rigorous analysis before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill has been out for a very long time. I think it would be very useful, in order to improve processes in this place, if the Labor Party could be encouraged to adopt a more constructive attitude to the way we debate bills so that there can be a proper debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a bit of a gap here between what I said and how it has been interpreted, so I will just put my points a little more clearly for the Assistant Treasurer. I gave a context in relation to why I was prepared to support the opposition's amendments. The context, quite clearly on the record, was that the prices of petroleum internationally and in Australia as well are artificially low. The reason I said that is that, apart from the ecological considerations, which are great, it will be in nobody's interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ecological considerations about whether or not Australia in the end decides to pull its weight in the international arena to reduce greenhouse gas is one thing. The ecological considerations about the use of fossil fuels is another thing. It is in nobody's interest in the end if the price of such things as petroleum has been kept down artificially for so long 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="674"> that, by the time the price increases dramatically&mdash;this is the point that Senator Kemp seems to have missed&mdash;there will, according to the best brains internationally on petroleum, be substantial and massive increases in the next 10 years in petroleum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will do nobody any good, least of all industry, if we as a country and other countries around the world have not had the time to adjust to that change in the supply of petroleum. These figures include existing and prospective petroleum resources&mdash;Timor Gap, everything&mdash;and potential changes in technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I stepped back from the ecological argument a little and said that it will do nobody any good if international prices remain artificially low and then suddenly there is a big hike and we say, `Oh, we didn't know it was going to happen. We weren't prepared.' If we become very petroleum oriented and dependent, we as a country will suffer more than most. That was my point at the outset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now as to my comment, most people have personal knowledge of the impact of this very specific control over the petroleum industry that the big players have had for a long time. For some people, that has meant a lower price in terms of putting people out of business when they dared to try to become independent. For some people, it has meant higher prices when there were no choices and, unless government stepped in and tried to address that, often it has meant that the profitability of companies has held sway. As Senator Murray indicated as well, there is the ability of companies&mdash;in regard to whichever countries charge the most tax and whichever countries charge the least tax&mdash;to transfer pricing, which means that it may not be considered to be important in Australia to make as much as profit as it might be in another stage of their production. And it does not matter so much for a company whose production spans several countries. It is a global production, and they have control right down to the sale of milk and tea bags at the end of the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the context was that people should understand clearly where I was coming from in general on petrol prices. It is my belief that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> probably the major effect of the opposition's amendment will be on the viability of small business. It is not just about price. It is about access, about people being able to access petroleum and about being able to access available sources. It is about communities being able to operate a little better than if they have only certain choices as to where they buy. I really do think it is about small business. It also obviously is about competition at that level and I think we will have to wait to see what the outcomes will be. As Senator Murray has indicated, it is some effort to address this situation. Nobody can pretend that this situation has not existed for a long time and I would like to see the government doing a little more about it than what it is doing at the moment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, I am not going to do you the discourtesy of reading you an economics lesson, but I would suggest that you are deliberately misinterpreting the statements made from the other side of the chamber for political purposes and, therefore, I must make sure that my point is clearly recorded. There is no confusion. The fact, as you will understand and as your advisers will understand, is that when you free up markets the participants in markets are then free to set their own pricing levels. The fact is that when they do so prices will go up as well as down and individual participants, if it is a genuinely free market, will not have common pricing. The fact is that you have to recognise that any change in freeing up a market can result in higher prices as well as lower prices. I do not know, and Senator Cook does not know, what the consequences will be when individuals are able to make their own decisions. Just in economic terms, straightforward practical empirical economics will tell you that a free market, or a freer market, will mean that prices can go up as well as down, especially if it is not a manipulated market. I do not think I can be clearer than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, the second thing I want to say to you is that, for a horrible moment, I felt sorry for you because I could hear in your answer the inability to deliver a cogent and reasoned response to the question before you. That may 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="675"> be because you are not well enough briefed and it is not your field but what you have not addressed is whether the principle and the policy envisaged in this amendment are wrong. That is really what you have to tell us, and that was the question, as I understood it, that Senator Harradine was asking and that I was asking. Is the principle in the policy envisaged by Senator Cook's amendment wrong? Is it wrong on competition grounds? On community grounds? On what grounds? You have not answered that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your entire rebuttal focused on drafting. That could mean that you accept the principle or policy, but you just think it does not achieve its end through the amendment that has been put, that it is badly drafted. I put it to you that you have the opportunity, if this amendment is accepted by the Senate, of actually improving the amendment when it goes back to the House of Representatives. I am quite sure that, if the amendment comes through improved from the House of Representatives, the Senate will say, `That is terrific. You actually have met your own criticism.' So what I do say to you, Minister, is that you must address the principle and the policy as distinct from the drafting problems on which you may or may not have a good point&mdash;I do not know because I have not seen your alternative and you have not had time to produce one. Unless you can address the distinction between those two, you have a weak argument in rebuttal to the comments from this side of the chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was going to take up the same point. The thing I have to say through you, Mr Chairman, to the Minister with the greatest of respect is that, in your reply, the arguments are the same as you put at the summing&hyphen;up of the second reading debate. The first argument&mdash;let me just deal with this again&mdash;is the question of whether the process has been as polite and as civil, and a recognition of the forms of procedure, as it should be. You have said that this has been dropped on you at the last minute, that you have not had time to consider it and that there is some defect in the drafting. I have been fairly generous in not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> replying to that, other than to say, `If it has inconvenienced you, I apologise for that.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us just be a bit more realistic rather than employing the continuous politeness that sometimes masks some of the realities in this chamber. The government knows about this amendment, and it has known for some time. It had a private member's bill from Mark Latham, a member in the other place and the shadow minister for competition policy, put down on the 10th of this month. It has had notice of these amendments, if you like, that a bill was going to be proceeded with in the House on exactly the same criteria as you have before you. It is not as if the government did not know about this. Whether you knew about it directly, Minister, I do not know, and that is why I have been careful to be apologetic and reasonable from my side. But there is no argument that the government did not know about it, that the government would not have had a chance to consider it or that the government would not have had a chance to come to a view about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the drafting argument is concerned, these amendments were lifted from a private member's bill that went through a drafting process. When you have got your back to the wall it is a reasonable argument to say that there are some problems with drafting, but you have to recognise that it has been through the drafting process. I do not accept that there are problems with the drafting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the substance of it. I think the substance of it was fairly well summarised by the question just put to you by Senator Murray, so I should sit down, shut up and allow you to answer that question. I think these amendments will allow greater competition for petrol retailers with petrol terminals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the current situation we have, with what I might term the little `a' access plan that the government has&mdash;a plan where an oil company dictates to a particular distributor the terms and conditions by which it must draw from a particular terminal on a certain date&mdash;you could call these amendments the big `A' Access plan. The big `A' Access plan in these amendments provides a legal right for service stations and distributors to obtain 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="676"> petrol at commercially negotiated prices, terms and conditions that may be subject to ACCC assessment and determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the same principle of vertical separation and downstream access that the part IIIA regime has applied to electricity, gas, railway and telecommunications industries. Given the natural oligopoly features of petrol terminals and given the homogenous nature of petroleum products, the same principle should apply to the petroleum industry. That is my argument, but, Minister, I wait with bated breath to hear your reply.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not too bated, I trust, Senator Cook. I will bring some of these themes together. In relation to Senator Murray's contribution, the government's philosophy and policy to bring about reform in this sector were set out in the statement that was brought down some weeks ago. So I would not have thought that there was any question about our philosophy and our approach in this area. In fact, I think we have been exceedingly detailed. I do not want to go through that, but a major statement has been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that, when people review this debate, they will find great ironies in it, Senator Murray. It is not our job to fix up the Labor Party's sloppy amendments. Your latest plea is that you cannot evaluate my argument because you have not had the time to look at it&mdash;that is essentially what you said. Well, join the club. No-one has time to deal with complex amendments in the way the Labor Party has handled this matter. Then Senator Murray said, `We will rely on your goodwill to get it fixed up.' That is an extraordinary way to run a debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our philosophy and our approach are not in doubt. Major statements have been made. I have outlined two fundamental flaws with these amendments, which Senator Cook has not responded to. The reason he has not responded to them is because his advisers have not had a chance to consult with my advisers and to go through it in detail because the Labor Party did not give us the amendments last night. No government has been more accessible to discussion and negotiation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with non-government parties in the Senate than this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that Senator Cook has been caught out and exposed attempting a political stunt with poorly drafted amendments. Senator Murray says, `Don't worry. Senator Kemp, you can go over and get it fixed up for him.' Thank you very much, Senator Murray, but we will not be picking up your invitation. It is not our job to fix up the sloppiness of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray, whenever you refer to me with such exquisite politeness, I always duck for cover. I think an examination of what you have said would show that the responses have been made. You asked me what initial problems we saw with the Labor Party proposals. I outlined two, but there may well be more as the advisers have a chance to go through them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts, I think I was very fair in my comments to you. I have to say that I am in utter confusion about your approach to this whole matter. You are opposed to competition policy. You believe that this will induce greater competition. So you seem to be riding against your own approach. You want higher petrol prices, not lower petrol prices, and these amendments, according to Senator Cook, will produce lower petrol prices. I just do not understand, Senator. I do not want to have a debate with you about it. I have written you letters, but I have to tell you that I do not understand your approach. It seems to me that there is utter confusion about your philosophy and your policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have outlined&mdash;and I will not go through them again unless people want me to&mdash;that these amendments will not even deliver what Senator Cook thinks they will deliver. Senator Murray says, `We can't evaluate your arguments, Senator Kemp, because we have not had time to see them.' That is not my fault; that is their fault.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are after proper processes in this chamber, those who are wavering should teach Senator Cook a lesson this time for coming into the chamber and proposing major policy initiatives and amendments to bills which have nothing to do with the substance of the bill&mdash;that is what he has done.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our amendments deal with the matter of public interest considerations in this bill. We are concerned that public interest is not defined broadly enough. It has been interesting that Senator Kemp has talked about the narrowing of public interest definitions when in fact it is our consideration that under competition policy public interest has been narrowed very much indeed. The bill mistakenly equates increased competition with public interest. Senator Kemp, I know, has a different spin on that. I know he has written me a letter but the fact that he has written me a letter does not mean he has yet convinced me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has got the cart before the horse when it comes to the relationship between competition and public interest with regard to network industries. For the government, increasing competition in markets such as electricity and gas seems to be the overriding policy objective with the public interest being only one factor to be considered while pursuing this. A statement in the National Competition Council's paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Considering the public interest under the national competition policy</EMPHASIS> accurately sums up this attitude. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of this paper is to point to those processes by which public interest matters can be considered within the national competition policy agenda.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the agenda is first. Public interest fits in there somewhere but I think it gets very much a lesser guernsey than anything else, certainly in terms of competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In contrast, we believe that the public interest or public benefit should be central to the formation of government policy. Otherwise, why would we be doing that? We assume we are moving towards public interest but, if it is not central, why the heck are we doing it? In the formation of public policy with regard to network industries, competition should be considered within that context. If increased competition or the opening of markets to competition is shown to be in the public interest, then so be it, but we should not be assuming that this will always be the case. I hope Senator Kemp is listening to this, because it will explain why we take particular 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="679"> positions on things like oligopoly and monopolies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the workings of markets are in the public interest, then we are in there batting. But, if they are not, then we are in there fighting that governments have a role to play&mdash;and we will always believe so. Of course, this opens a fundamental divide between us and the government. The government's policy on this and most others is premised on an ideological assumption that competition actually equals public benefit. This is explicitly stated in the section of this bill which deals with public interest considerations. Paragraph 44ZZAA(3) states that, when the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission decides if they will approve a network industry code, they must consider:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the public interest, including the public interest in having competition in markets (whether or not in Australia).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet the opposite can be true. Competition can be contrary to the public interest. Indeed, in a letter to me on this bill, the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public interest tests contained in the Trade Practices Act 1974 and the Intergovernmental Competition Principles Agreement recognise that vigorous competition is not an end in itself and may not always be in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">See, we do read your letters, Senator Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why then does the government's bill state so clearly that it is. Why is it that the only specific example of public interest mentioned in the bill is the public interest in having competition in markets? Accordingly, we believe that this bill must have a more detailed definition or a broader definition of the public interest than is currently the case. We should like to see other considerations, such as the environmental and social equity considerations, given greater weight. Yes, competition may sometimes be in the public interest, but it should not be taken as a given and should not subsume other important decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also are aware that the word `environmental' is in competition policy; we do know that. But, if you look further&mdash;which is what Senator Kemp seems to have failed to do&mdash;it says `in terms of whatever the government's policy is on environment in relation to this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issue'. There is not one. Trade and competition override the environment so, if the government does not have a policy which says you must take ecological considerations as being important then, in reality, it is a circular argument. It is a circular argument when you finally get to the last point and you find that there is nothing that says ecological or equity considerations ought to be considered as important. Who does it? How do you do it? If it is not government policy, it does not actually get a guernsey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Communities are asking that these other issues be taken into consideration. They need to have an assurance that they will be at least taken into consideration. Unfortunately, with the circular nature of competition policy and the way the ACCC is set up, there is very little they can take into consideration. I really do not see that there is a particular mechanism by which they can do so given the way things currently are. In our amendment we expand the concept of public interest. Paragraph 44ZZA(3)(b) will read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the public interest, including the public interest in having access to the full range of relevant goods and services to be provided at least cost in ways which are efficient, ecologically sustainable, equitable and consistent with community wants and needs, irrespective of location;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would wonder at any government or any major party which thinks that we should be promoting or saying that by law ecological sustainability should not be taken into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are we saying that, no matter what happens, industry should be given free access to develop such things as electricity, water and so on, without taking into consideration ecological sustainability? If the problem is actually putting in the words `ecological sustainability', I want to know why. What is the problem with actually putting that in as part of what must be considered in the public interest without regard to geographical location?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, we are not narrowing the definition; we are broadening it. Those people who would like that clarified should look at how narrow it is within the competition policy. We are certainly being consistent in saying the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="680"> definition should be broadened. It should give some certainty&mdash;the word is very popular&mdash;to the community that these issues will be taken into consideration. If they are not, why the heck not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of moving the amendments, I am happy to be guided by the Senate as to how they should be moved. I believe that the Australian Democrats cannot agree with the new section (ba). I believe they are happy to support amendment 4, minus (ba) in that section&mdash;the relevant public interest standards relating to the industry.

I have had a bit of a problem with this amendment because I understand entirely the purpose of it and sympathise with that purpose, but I am not sure that the amendment can be supported by the opposition. In fact, we will not support it. We will not support it because I think the amendment appears in a form which is entirely too prescriptive to suit the circumstances.

I would be more relaxed if that was a condition that the commission had to have regard to rather than had to actually meet.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I think, to the national power grid. For that reason, I think the tightness of the words defeats the possibility of support from the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing is that, if one goes to the amendments that are proposed in this bill, I notice on page 3 of the bill, schedule 1, item 4, proposed section 44ZZAA(3)(b) would read:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government rejects the Greens' amendments to the bill and I think Senator Cook, in his remarks, touched on what was a point of substance&mdash;that these amendments would transform the simple but effective voluntary access mechanism envisaged by the government into a process orientated, costly and very time consuming ordeal for both providers and seekers. The only certain outcome from such an approach would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="682"> be a substantial delay in micro&hyphen;economic reform, particularly in the electricity industry where a substantial slice of the total benefits from national competition policy reforms are expected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under amendments (1), (3), (5) and (6) moved by the Greens, it would be necessary to establish a public interest committee to develop standards which would be taken into account by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission when assessing undertakings. Development of the standards would be a time consuming and expensive process which would duplicate existing processes such as the Commonwealth's own environmental impact process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendments (2) and (4) appear misdirected because they focus on access by household consumers to services at the end of the production chain, such as electricity. This is not the subject of the national access regime which is, rather, concerned with access by business to the intermediate services of so&hyphen;called monopoly facilities such as access to the transmission grid. The Greens' amendment (2)(b) is about access to goods and services by consumers, but this is not the subject of part IIIA of the Trade Practices Act. Part IIIA is about access by businesses to facilities such as electricity grids. I think there seems to be a fundamental confusion. Public interest where it is used in part IIIA is a wide concept. It refers to competition; however, competition is just one example of the things which can be in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, I have been listening carefully to you because, as you know, we have been anxious to clarify this issue of public interest.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister. We have read the letter, but I have to say that I do not think the minister has read the competition policy. I do not think the minister is particularly au fait with the wording when it comes to public interest. If the minister had done that, he might realise that it is in fact a very narrow definition. That is what we have been arguing for all along.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you move to each different mention of public interest, when you finally get down to taking off the last wrapper in the game of pass the parcel, you find that it means very little indeed. The definition under competition policy is extremely narrow. To indicate that the definition that is in this bill is broad is, I think, indicating a fundamental lack of understanding of how narrow the definition has become under competition policy. I am attempting to broaden that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am cognisant of what Senator Cook has said is the concern of the ALP. I hope that my words may address some of those concerns. Section (b) of our amendment 2 states `including the public interest'; it does not say `comprising'. I have listened to what Senator Cook says and I wonder whether it might address the ALP's concerns&mdash;it is a pity the ALP does not want to see something a bit clearer in the legislation&mdash;if I were to amend that wording to say `including having regard to the public interest in having access to the full range of relevant goods and services to be provided at least cost in ways which are efficient, ecologically sustainable,' et cetera. I wonder if inclusion of the words `having regard to' in our amendment 2 would address the concerns of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Public interest needs to be taken into consideration, but I do not believe it was prescriptive. I do not believe it could be enforceable in any real sense, but I believe it does indicate that those things ought to be taken into consideration. I would like a

Minister, you have heard the proposition Senator Margetts has put to me, which I am considering; that is, a removal of the more prescriptive words and the putting in of a `having regard to' phrase so that it is one of the issues the commission would weigh in the balance. It would not be a principle the commission would have to observe in the perfect sense, but it would weigh it against other elements of public interest. You have heard that proposition, Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My observation in my earlier remark was that the government will be in a position of bringing in regulations to this bill. In those regulations, it could spell out the public interest and it could have an incorporation of these words to provide guidance but not limit the definition of public interest. As soon as you start qualifying public interest, you confine public interest to the extent to which you have qualified it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think public interest needs a wide definition because one cannot anticipate what public interest will be, but one can certainly say, `It is wide, but it does at lease consist of some elements and these elements are as follows.' My question is: would the government be prepared to specify that in a way that meets the point made by Senator Margetts in respect of regulations? If it were to do that, that would enable me to make a decision about the proposal that is before me from Senator Margetts.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the opposition, I would like to indicate that we support the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill. We would like to put on record a number of comments about this amending bill. The bill is designed to implement the recommendations of a review conducted by the Attorney-General pursuant to section 40A of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 of the operation of subsections 40(2) and 40(3) of the act. The review was completed by the Attorney-General on 31 May 1996.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The requirement to conduct a review pursuant to section 40A of the act was inserted by way of an amendment moved by the Australian Democrats to the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1991, an amendment which I am pleased to say received bipartisan support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsections 40(2) and 40(3) contain exemptions to the act. The bill narrows the scope of a number of those exemptions. Consistent with the Labor Party's support for the procedure requiring the conduct of a review pursuant to section 40A of the act and in terms of the substance of the recommendations made by that review, the Labor Party supports this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not propose to discuss the amendments in detail as I note that they have been comprehensively covered in the second reading speech delivered by the Minister representing the Attorney-General, Senator Vanstone. However, the bill has been introduced at same time as the parliament has been considering the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Chris Sidoti, set out HREOC's concerns in relation to the bill as they relate to sex discrimination. He stated during the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee's consideration of the bill on 28 November 1996: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="686">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first part of schedule 3 would propose the insertion of a section 507(a) into the Migration Act. The insertion of this paragraph (a) would permit differentiation between applicants for immigration on the basis of de facto or de jure marital status. The commission is most concerned that the introduction of this kind of discrimination represents a significant retreat from the commitment made in the enactment of the Sex Discrimination Act and there should be no discrimination on the basis of marital status.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian law has dealt for some time with the criteria for the acceptance of the existence of a genuine de facto relationship. That criteria has been spelt out most particularly in social security law, but it has also been enacted in the past and developed in the past in relation to immigration law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of a period of relationship test, as proposed in paragraph (a) of the proposed section 507, is a significant retreat from the banning of discrimination on the basis of marital status and introduces a much harsher test for those claiming on the basis of a de facto relationship than those claiming on the basis of a de jure relationship. The commission recommends strongly to the committee that the introduction of that new test and this form of discrimination be removed from the amending bill, and that the existing form of testing of the genuineness of a de facto relationship be continued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commission is also gravely concerned at the proposal to enact paragraph (b) of section 507. Paragraph (b) would have the effect of introducing a much wider exemption into the Migration Act than paragraph (a) would introduce. It represents, for the first time since the enactment of the Sex Discrimination Act in 1984, the provision of an exemption relating to the implementation and administration of Commonwealth laws and programs. The banning of that form of discrimination is found in section 26 of the Sex Discrimination Act. As I have indicated, there has not in the past been any exemption or exception whatsoever from the unlawful nature of conduct covered by section 26 of the Sex Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph (b) of the proposed section 507 would allow any form of discrimination in the administration of programs, so long as the program itself is within the law. That would mean, for example, on our reading of the paragraph, that immigration officials, in seeking to apply regulations concerning marital status, could discriminate generally against people on the basis of their de facto relationship, whether or not that discrimination was required by section 507(a) or by the regulations. It has the potential to provide a very sweeping exemption for the immigration department's officials and one which we consider unacceptable. Even if 507(a) were enacted, which we have recommended against, 507(b) remains unnecessary and particular 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ly undesirable because of the greater breadth of exemption that it would provide.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On the basis of the matters advanced by Mr Sidoti, it is easy to see the government's hypocrisy on the issue of sex discrimination. The government cannot, through the introduction of this bill, claim to be fulfilling its obligations to eliminate sexual discrimination yet at the same time legislate in a way contrary to the principles underlying the legislation. The government should bear in mind that, even if it is successful in imposing this provision on the Australian people, it will rightly be subject to criticism from international fora for failing to live up to its fundamental human rights obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fate of proposed section 507 as contained in the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1996 is a matter which obviously will be resolved when the bill is considered. I urge the government to reconsider that provision and, failing that, encourage all non-government senators to support the relevant amendments to be moved by the Labor Party at the committee stage of the bill's consideration. Otherwise I encourage all senators to support the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill is a direct result of an amendment in 1991 by former Leader of the Australian Democrats Senator Janet Powell. Section 40A was successfully inserted by the Australian Democrats in the context of the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1991, which sought to halt the regime by which exemptions to the SDA for Commonwealth legislation were implemented by regulation. In place of this regulatory regime a range of Commonwealth legislation was to be given permanent exemption from the act, most significantly legislation relating to taxation and social security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During consideration of the 1991 bill by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, Senator Spindler stated the Democrats would move an amendment to the effect of section 40A. This amendment had been foreshadowed by Senator Powell during the second reading debate and was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="687"> accepted by the committee. Although the intention of the amendment seems to be as a general watchdog clause, Senator Powell specifically noted that `it seems to me that an indefinite exemption is inappropriate in the case of the tax and social security departments'. The bill implements the recommendations of the Attorney-General's review of the permanent exemptions in subsections 40(2) and 40(3) conducted pursuant to section 40A and tabled on 26 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The framework for the bill is expressed to reflect the government's supposed `commitment to equal opportunity and the prevention of discrimination', as indicated by this bill's second reading speech. Both the second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum state that the bill is consistent with and an indication of the government's policy that exemptions to the SDA should be limited and that where possible all federal legislation should be consistent with the SDA's objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments in the bill are not controversial, primarily because of their limited nature. But the amendments in relation to taxation legislation, the Norfolk Island Social Services Act 1980 and the Papua New Guinea (Members of the Forces Benefits) Act 1957, merely reflect the status quo. Therefore, although the exemptions are either narrowed&mdash;that is, in taxation the exemption is narrowed from a general exemption to an exemption from the SDA in terms of marital discrimination&mdash;or repealed, these actions reflect the existing types of discrimination relevant to that legislation. Therefore, no positive steps have been taken to ameliorate discrimination in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the sunsetting of the exemption for certain definitions in the National Health Act 1953, again this is not a positive step in itself to rectify discrimination. Rather, it is a necessary amendment to ensure that the SDA reflects the phasing out of sex differentiated access to age pensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some other limitations with this bill need to be pointed out. The bill does not amend the exemption currently provided in the SDA for anything done in direct compliance with the Social Security Act 1947. There are apparent 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ly a couple of reasons for this. The first is the unclear legal status of the exemption given that the Social Security Act 1947 no longer exists and was repealed by the Social Security Act 1991. Secondly, there are complex issues concerning `in principle' discrimination in the social security regime, particularly in relation to marital status discrimination, which are raised in the report of the steering committee assisting the Attorney-General in his review of this exemption. The review defers the legislative response to the social security exemption and states that the Attorney and the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, will report back to the parliament before 26 June 1997 as to the status of the exemption and the issues raised in the steering committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another matter which needs to be considered is the review of marital status discrimination in social security. As the exemption for social security was one of the issues which Senator Powell specifically mentioned as inappropriate for an indefinite exemption when proposing section 40A, it is interesting to note that the process by which consideration of this issue has proceeded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committee's report states that most discrimination in the social security regime is based on `assumptions of dependency', which generally invoke discrimination on the grounds of marital status. While analysing these provisions, the steering committee's report recognises that discriminatory assumptions of dependency are not limited to the social security regime but are intertwined into areas such as superannuation, taxation and the payment of student assistance. Accordingly, the report recommends that, with the aim of ameliorating discrimination on the grounds of marital status, it would be productive if a general review of policy and laws based on assumptions of dependency were undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of this recommendation by the steering committee, the Institute of Public Administration of Australia and the Australian Institute of Administrative Law held a one-day seminar on 16 September 1996 to tease out the issues relating to assumptions of dependency which arose in all government 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="688"> portfolios. A wide range of Commonwealth departments attended the seminar and identified discriminatory aspects of government programs. It was indicated at this seminar that these issues would be raised with the Minister for Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that the minister has decided that the review of in principle discrimination identified in the steering committee's report will only relate to issues arising in the social security regime and will not be linked to other laws and programs. If this is the case, it is rather a curious outcome, given that the identification of in principle discrimination was the subject of the steering committee's report. Such a review would appear to be a duplication of research in a climate of scarce or dwindling resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should note that, as part of the government's legislative agendas, other exemptions to the SDA are currently being sought, for example temporary exemption for Austudy and Abstudy. Currently, Abstudy and Austudy discriminate on the grounds of marital status in that the schemes differentiate between legally married and de facto couples. If one is legally married and a student one can apply for independent Austudy&mdash;of course subject to a means test&mdash;whereas this is prohibited if one is in a de facto relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The exemption for student assistance from the SDA has always existed in various forms, either within legislation such as subsection 40(4) which expired in 1994, or through administrative exemptions provided by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in accordance with section 44 of the SDA. Section 44 exemptions are specifically temporary exemptions designed to provide temporary protection for a situation whilst the discrimination is fixed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">HREOC has just provided a further exemption for Austudy and Abstudy for 1996 under the notice of the grant of exemption. The notice of the grant of exemption links the exemption for student assistance to the review on notions of dependency and states that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) has given an undertaking that a report will be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made to the commission prior to the expiry of the exemption on long&hyphen;term solutions to marital status discrimination in current and future student assistance schemes, which take into account the review outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two things are interesting to note with this temporary exemption. Firstly, the fact that once again a temporary exemption has been sought and granted, given that the raison d'etre of a temporary exemption is to provide a space so that the discrimination exempted can be stopped. The notice of exemption does not detail any steps that DEETYA has taken to find a solution to discrimination in Austudy, except in so far as it is linked to the dependency review. Secondly, a central problem with temporary exemptions is that they are not noted in legislation and are not easily available on public record, in fact they are gazetted. They have the effect of permitting ongoing discrimination to remain hidden in a sense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should also be noted that at the same time as this bill is in the Senate, the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) is being debated. This bill proposes an exemption for the Migration Act from the SDA in relation to the making of regulations which specify the incidents of a relationship required to establish a de facto relationship. This therefore potentially permits regulations to be made discriminating on the grounds of marital status and is specifically aimed at ensuring that regulations can be made which impose a two-year cohabitation period on a de facto couple before they can apply as a couple under the Migration Act, and of course that was an election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading speech for that bill states that this measure will relieve the mischief of bogus and short&hyphen;term relationships, a statement which suggests that de jure married couples are less likely to have short&hyphen;term or bogus relationships. It is precisely these assumptions that prohibition of discrimination on the ground of marital status is aimed at stopping. Of course I will comment further on this when that particular bill comes to the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Margaret Thornton, an Australian expert on anti-discrimination laws, has noted 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="689"> that although anti-discrimination law represents a halting step towards the formal recognition of inequality, it nevertheless `is riddled with weaknesses in respect of both substance and procedure'. She considers that a key weakness in relation to federal sex discrimination law is the numerous exemptions and exceptions to the act. In relation to 40(2) and (3) specifically, Professor Thornton notes that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the exception accorded acts done under statutory authority has been potentially one of the most devastating. . . the usual principle of statutory construction in which the most recent enactment overrules the former, has been waived in some legislation. The subordinate status of anti-discrimination legislation reveals quite unequivocally that certain legislatures did not intend that their anti-discrimination legislation should be taken as seriously as other legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is presenting the bill as a sign of its commitment to anti-discrimination principles and to narrowing exemptions. The narrowed exemptions are not positive measures to actively narrow current discrimination, but reflect the status quo. At the same time other exemptions in other legislation to the SDA are being introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final word must surely come from Ms Sue Walpole, the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner who recently criticised the federal government for creating a policy vacuum on women's issues. Since the election the commissioner has come under considerable criticism from this government with the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, describing her as a Labor stooge and the Attorney-General, Mr Williams, describing her as biased simply because the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission funded a report on flexible working hours. The report was jointly launched by the commissioner and ACTU President, Jennie George. I suggest that it is beneath both the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General of this country to seek to implement the politics of division over such an issue as discrimination. Australian women will not be used as political footballs by those particular men, or any men in this country, regardless of what office they hold.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Walpole for her tenacious pursuit of women's issues throughout her time 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as the commissioner. She has made a valuable contribution to the human rights landscape in this country and in my view has never shrunk from what is an inalienable truth, that is, that women's rights are human rights and when they are being breached, ignored or in this case neglected, then this entire nation is diminished by that fact.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Tierney rightly says, it has fallen to 27.3 per cent this month. But that is seasonally adjusted, and we cannot take too much glee from seasonally adjusted figures.

There is no single policy that you can put a little on the stain and the rest in the wash, because it simply will not work like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have now been left with structural ingrained unemployment, and it is going to take very consistent work by the government to get policies through this chamber&mdash;with reluctance from people opposite&mdash;to remedy and break down this problem. The coalition has produced lower interest rates through a balanced budget and low inflation. That makes a big difference. We are making workplace arrangements more flexible and revitalising apprenticeships and traineeships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The apprenticeships we had last year were the same as we had 10 years ago&mdash;what a disgrace! That is what sort of contribution you people made to getting young people into jobs. You kept the apprenticeship levels the same as they were 10 years before. You are in no position to comment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank Senator McGauran very much for that question. It is refreshing to get a question that is important to the whole Australian community instead of the rubbish we are hearing from the Labor Party on the other side. It seems to me that the disease of relevant deprivation that Mr Evans got has become contagious and has now spread throughout the whole Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned at the press conference earlier this week, the production licence to Woodside for Laminaria represents a major and significant boost to Australia's oil reserves. From a self-sufficiency point of view, it is great news for Australia with a 20 per cent increase in our reserves. In global terms, Australia has been very much underexplored for oil, even though the exploration undertaken has produced a great success rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The success of Laminaria&mdash;and this is the other positive point&mdash;will add impetus to exploration activity in Australia for oil. On 24 January this year, the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association published its forecast for petroleum exploration and development activity in 1997. The forecast is very positive for the future of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, a significant increase is predicted in both exploration and development activity, especially in Australia's offshore areas. Between $750 million and $1 billion will be spent on exploration, while over $1.5 billion is expected to be spent on development projects. This means real jobs, direct and indirect. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the onshore activity will concentrate on the proven petroleum province of the Cooper&hyphen;Eromanga Basin in the north-east of South Australia and in the south-west of Queensland. This means more jobs for regional Australia. Development drilling will increase offshore in the Carnarvon Basin and in the Gippsland Basin in Bass Strait, while onshore development drilling will continue in the Cooper&hyphen;Eromanga Basin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to congratulate the shadow minister for resources and energy on what I believe is his second press release on resources in 12 months. It can best be described as a blast from the past. It may be even reminiscent of the late Rex Connor. Let us see what Mr O'Keefe has to say. Among other things he called on the federal government to use its export licence control powers to demand stronger Australian returns. Someone should tell Mr O'Keefe that there are no export control powers on oil and nor were there under the previous Labor government. Great stuff from Mr O'Keefe!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next thing he says is that he requires a substantial part of investment capital to be sourced in Australia. Here we have a joint venture made up of Woodside, an Australian company, 50 per cent; BHP, another Australian company&mdash;the big Australian&mdash;25 per cent; and Shell, a company which has very proudly worked in Australia for many years, 25 per cent. Yet he says he wants more investment capital sourced in Australia. He goes on to say that he is happy with the project. Australians want more projects. They want real job creation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It interesting, isn't it, that the focus on good administration and running government effectively is of interest to people like Senator Ferris but it does not seem to be of much interest to the Labor opposition who would play games in the Senate when there are important matters of employment, for example, before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We heard a great deal during the previous Labor administration about how clever they were about administering the Department of Social Security. The former minister, Mr Baldwin, said in 1995, `What we do now by way of compliance is now recognised as being world leading standard in many respects.' Because of that, what did they do? They sat on their hands. They did not really 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> make any further effort in terms of compliance. They did not put the additional resources in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The former Labor government's administration of the social security portfolio has been exposed as fraud. They were defrauding their fellow taxpayers and the community by telling them that the system was as tight as it could get. We now know from Labor's findings on the reasons for its recent election failure that the people were not conned. The Labor post&hyphen;mortem report, co&hyphen;authored by Senator Mackay sitting opposite me, was a clear statement that almost everyone knew a social security cheat&mdash;that is, everyone except the former Labor government. They were supposed to have their finger on the pulse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it really shows that Laurie Oakes did not list enough things in pointing out how out of touch they were with mainstream Australia when he wrote his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> article this week. This was yet another area where they were quite out of touch. I made a promise when I became Minister for Social Security, and today I am delighted to be able to provide to the parliament the second social security compliance report. When we compare the social security compliance results for the last six months of last year with the opposition's results for the same period in government in 1995, we can see how misguided their understanding of the system was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My report today demonstrates that my department has increased compliance reviews by nearly 29 per cent. From these increased reviews, there was an increase of over 27 per cent in cancellations or reductions of payments. Overpayments raised from reviews totalled over $105 million, and that is an increase of almost 40 per cent. This is a particularly interesting item, Senator Ferris: we are saving the Australian taxpayer over $10 million every week as a result of the review activities over the last six months of this last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, recoveries of debts for the six&hyphen;month period were $175 million, which was a massive 49 per cent increase over the same period in 1995. Most importantly of all, the public have also demonstrated their support for our efforts in this area by assisting us with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="701"> information that has allowed us to undertake a further 26,500 reviews&mdash;and that was an increase of 27 per cent of public reports. There is a resultant increase in savings from these reports. So reviews are up; identified overpayments are up; debts recovered are up; and support from the public is up because they know this government means business. I am very happy to table this report for the benefit of the parliament.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

One million Australians are now better off with $1 billion worth of tax savings.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="704">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrast that with Labor's record: the second highest prime interest rate among all developed nations and average monthly home repayments rising by nearly 50 per cent. Labor pushed up interest rates on homes by 50 per cent. Do you remember the home loan variable interest rate of 17 per cent in 1990? Do you remember that under Labor home loan variable rates never went under 8.75 per cent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht, as the then minister for small business, do you remember small business loan rates of 20 per cent in 1989&hyphen;90? Under your government small business had to pay 20 per cent to borrow? What did your government do? It pushed rates up further and further until businesses went to the wall. Do you remember the credit card rates, or have you got a short memory? There was a 25 per cent interest rate on credit cards. That is the record of Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In only 10 months, in such a short period, the coalition government enacts sensible economic policies and gets hold of expenditure and we see three official reductions in interest rates. This is now flowing through to businesses and houses. When you add to that low inflation rates, a government determined to keep taxes down and a government that is encouraging business investment, which is now up to around 17 per cent, then there is real hope in this country at last.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirteen years of dismal Labor has been replaced by the opportunity of hope, the opportunity of growth, the opportunity of jobs and the opportunity of benefit to those who suffer so much under Labor: small business and families. This government is responding in the way that the public elected it to do, and that should be applauded.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday, when asked a question in the Senate chamber, Senator Herron read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a letter that he had written to Ms Gabi Hollows.

So Mr Howard made the weak and quivering announcement that neither Mr Sharp nor Senator Herron would be required to resign. I was not surprised that Mr Howard said that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this motion because I think it is a matter that is becoming increasingly urgent and one that is of national importance. We do have a cover&hyphen;up here. That is an indisputable fact. Especially after question time today we can see that the whole mountain of evidence in relation to this matter has not been examined. I say that because in question time today we had Senator Hill and Senator Vanstone either not being able to answer questions or not wanting to. I make the allegation of them not wanting to because some of the most basic information that was sought here was available to members of the House of Representatives but Senator Hill was not able to provide it to us here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the most fundamental things that Senator Hill said in question time today was that there had not been an investigation. We on this side believe there should be a full investigation that takes into account the whole context of this matter. It is not good enough that Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, has come in here and said, `Look, this incident has a long history. It is a saga. It has gone on for some time, and the minister has wanted to sack the board members,' and then said that all of this is irrelevant to the correspondence between Minister Herron and Gabi Hollows. It is not irrelevant&mdash;it is not irrelevant at law and it is not irrelevant at politics. For as long as this matter goes on, politically there will be a stench. It will undermine the credibility of this government, particularly our Prime Minister (Mr Howard). `Honest John' has a very empty sound these days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Legally&mdash;I ask Senator Hill to listen to this&mdash;the context is critical, the context is important. This is not just the view of the opposition; it is the view of the full bench of the High Court of Australia. It is worth placing on record the view of the High Court of Australia in terms of these matters. Just a few years ago the bench, chaired by Justice Mason with Justices Brennan, Toohey, Gaudron and Davies, had this united voice on what is relevant in matters like this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A representation may be made by acts and conduct as well as words or by a combination of words, acts and conduct. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="708">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am not talking here about judicial activism of the High Court, because they go on to quote Lord Campbell in the 1841 case of Waters and Morgan in the British judicial system. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"A nod or a wink, or a shake of the head, or a smile" may constitute a representation. Likewise, the content of a representation (which is ordinarily a question of fact) is to be ascertained, where appropriate, by reference to the circumstances in which it was made and the matters to which it related.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the telling part: the context, the import, the impact of a representation is to be assessed `by reference to the circumstances in which it was made and the matters to which it related'. In this case, this government sat the whole weight of the Prime Minister's office and the office of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) on a poor public servant in the Attorney-General's Department, the most inappropriate person to make an assessment of the evidence in this case. They sent to him only a small bit of the mountain of evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For anyone to make a comprehensive, full and honest assessment of what these ministers were up to, they would have had to look at, for instance, the circumstances of the delivery of the letter that was examined; the discussions between ministers; the general background; minutes of meetings, especially of the initial one that Minister Sharp had with the board where he sought their resignation, and of particular discussions he had with individual members&mdash;there would have been minutes for those; letters from ministers to members, seeking resignation; minutes of conversations between ministers and their officers; and of course minutes of the meeting that Minister Sharp had with Gabi Hollows and the one Minister Herron had with Gabi Hollows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All these bits of evidence are quite critical and fundamental to any honest examination of this matter, and they have been neglected. The Prime Minister was not game enough to put all this evidence to independent scrutiny. As I say, for independent scrutiny it should have gone to the DPP or the Australian Federal Police, because we have here a case involving quite a number of characters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bottom line in a sense is that the Australian public is being asked by `not so 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> honest John' to believe that there has been a full examination here and everything is okay. But how can there have been an examination when not even the prime witnesses have been questioned? Even Chief Inspector Clouseau would have examined the prime witnesses. He would have asked them questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this Attorney-General has been derelict in his responsibility to the law and the legal system of this country. As the person responsible he should have said, `Hey, this is a bit of a sham here. There's more involved in this than one letter.' All the evidence should have been sent to the appropriate law enforcement agency&mdash;not just one or maybe two letters in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> being sent to an officer under the direction of the Attorney-General.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Herron did not attempt to mislead the Senate. In fact it was yesterday afternoon that the very letter he was referring to was made public. There is nothing misleading about that. Senator Herron said yesterday:</PARA></TALK.START>

There is nothing in that letter at all which is incriminatory and there is nothing at all which would imply interference with the exercising of the duties of an officer of the Commonwealth, as Senator Faulkner feebly tried to imply yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we have here is a very common situation that we find in government: someone who has a great deal to offer has been discovered, as it were, by someone&mdash;in this case, Minister Sharp. He contacts his colleague, quite rightly so, and says, `I have a woman here who has a great deal of expertise and can assist you.' That is what happened. In fact, Senator Herron has said that. It is reflected in his letter. He even states in the letter that he has spoken to Minister Sharp and he has said in that letter what he wants to do, and that is to make use of this lady's services in relation to her expertise. It is nothing more and nothing less than that. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. In fact, any minister who did not make that sort of approach to some worthwhile member of the community would not be doing his job.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In fact if I say it first I cannot avoid saying it immediately, can I. I agree that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron, is in fact the patsy in this matter, and I said that to him by way of interjection 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="710"> yesterday. He is not the prime agent in this dreadful piece of chicanery at all. He was the cat's paw; he got set up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, having been given that job to do by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, there is no question about what he did in the Senate yesterday. I ask all honourable senators to simply do one thing: get the page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> from Senate question time yesterday, sit it alongside this letter that Senator Herron was quoting from and just have a look at what he tried to do. Senator Herron in question time yesterday read out the complete text of this letter from the top to all the way down the page&mdash;every single word. Have a look in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>; you will see the letter there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impression Senator Herron was deliberately trying to create was that he was reading out the whole letter. Without leaving out anything, he got all the way down to the words, `I have discussed this matter with my ministerial colleague Mr Sharp.' He then stopped, put the letter down, looked up and said to the chamber&mdash;and you see the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> page; you then come out of the letter; Hansard have correctly placed a full stop after the word `Sharp'; and it scans, it makes a complete sentence&mdash;`The letter continues'. It is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. He then goes on to quote the last paragraph.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just us, Mr Deputy President, who stand to be deceived on this; it is the many people&mdash;and there are many in fact, sometimes to my surprise&mdash;who follow the proceedings of this parliament, read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and watch question time in the Senate. When you read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> you are deliberately given the impression by the minister that he has quoted the whole letter. His words: `The letter continues'. What he did not tell us yesterday was that he only part&hyphen;quoted a single sentence; he stopped in the middle of the sentence. There is not a full stop after `Sharp'; there is a comma. The words he did not read out were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . who has assured me that he will be amenable to you retiring from your responsibilities&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">et cetera. I know what happened. He got to that bit, when he was reading, and thought, `Oh; better not read that out.' That is when he 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stopped, looked up and said, `The letter continues'. He deliberately left it out so he could run off and check whether he should table the letter or not, because he knew that bit was potentially, at least, embarrassing to both him and his colleague.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the impression he set out to create, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record demonstrates, that he quoted the entire letter, was an entirely false impression and he stands condemned for attempting to get away with it. When they knew the game was up later on that day, somebody else of course tabled the letter. They knew we had it in any case and they gave it out publicly. But that does not excuse what the minister did yesterday in question time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to pose a question to the minister. It is a genuine question. I am not attacking him by asking this question; I am genuinely interested. Gabi Hollows is a talented person. I know Gabi Hollows well. The first time I ever met her was in an Aboriginal community with Fred Hollows a lot of years ago when she was out there as a nurse helping Fred treat people. Of course she is qualified in that area. But, after sending the letter, the minister made not the slightest further attempt in relation to this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the minister: what are the bodies in his gift that he could appoint her to? Primary responsibility for health, of course, was transferred to the health department&mdash;with my full and continuing support&mdash;from the portfolio of Aboriginal affairs in 1994. I would actually like to know from the minister what are the appropriate bodies on which appointments in his gift are made in respect of Aboriginal health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying this: why does the minister for transport, if he wants qualified people on the board of CASA, want to sack Dr Clare Pollock? Why do he and the media keep referring to her as simply an academic? She is not; she is an expert in human factors. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

Nobody would take any notice of what `Honest Nick' might say about this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of this attack on Senator Herron is that the Labor Party appreciate that Senator Herron is the first minister for many, many years&mdash;for more than a decade&mdash;who is seriously concerned about the plight of Australia's indigenous people. They realise that Senator Herron has compassion. He has an understanding of and a determination to do something serious about indigenous people in Australia. He is concerned about their health, he is concerned about their education, he is concerned about their housing standards, and he is doing something about it. The Labor Party does not like that. They are trying to discredit Senator Herron because they know he is doing such a wonderful job. They can go on as much as they like. Comments from `Honest Nick' and the crew will not wash with the indigenous people nor with the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron knows what is needed and that is why he approached Ms Hollows. That is why he, recognising her interest in the matter, approached her to see if she could help. She has a great deal of expertise in Aboriginal health. Mr Sharp indicated to Senator Herron&mdash;I think it is important to get the facts on the record&mdash;that he thought that Ms Hollows might be resigning from the CASA board. So Senator Herron thought about Ms Hollows, but only after&mdash;and it is interesting to emphasise this&mdash;Ms Hollows had actually called around to speak to Senator Herron.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They had a short conversation and following that conversation, Senator Herron thought that he would confirm the contents of that short meeting: that Ms Hollows would be interested in exploring the possibility of working in the Aboriginal affairs area. Sena 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="712"> tor Herron confirmed this in writing and invited Ms Hollows to discuss the possibility of using her expertise in the portfolio. Ms Hollows never responded to the letter, and that was the end of the matter as far as Senator Herron was concerned. Senator Herron has related all of those facts, step by step, on at least two occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bob Collins made a big point about this letter. Senator Herron in question time indicated why he stopped there. If you look at the letter, you can understand why. He read the first paragraph, which said that Ms Hollows would be aware that the federal government was interested in improving health conditions&mdash;quite a matter for public dissemination. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The inference that can be drawn from Senator Abetz's speech was that I condone and, wittingly or unwittingly, encourage drug use and abuse.

To hypothesise my mother's reaction to the question on amphetamine use was unnecessary and patronising.

Currently, because of a procedural flaw, the act does not enable the bringing of valid discipline charges against officers of the Australian Public Service who have resumed duties in a Department of the Service after a period of unattachment, where the misconduct alleged took place when the officer was an "unattached officer" as defined in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The discipline provisions are set out in Division 6 of Part III of the Public Service Act 1922 and seek to ensure that officers or employees of the Service who have committed misconduct can be dealt with, in order to ensure efficiency in the workplace and to maintain the integrity of the Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of differences in the nature of the employment relationship, the procedure for disciplining unattached officers differs from that for disciplining officers occupying substantive positions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to that in a second. The opposition is concerned to ensure that this matter is fully, very quickly and exhaustively canvassed, unlike that cursory review that we had conducted at the insistence of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have seen some advice today from a senior counsel in New South Wales, Mr G.R. James QC. I think it is important to place some of that advice on the record because we believe that immediate action is needed to ensure that a full and proper investigation can continue in the future. He said in respect of this&mdash;and it gives the lie to what Senator Hill said in question time today:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many ways to seek to influence or affect a Commonwealth officer in the exercise of his duty or authority by promising or offering any property or benefit other than by an outright ex 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="716"> pressed bribe. The suggestion made by the letter on its face is oblique. When it is considered in the context of the provable circumstances the suggestion becomes quite blatant: "If you resign from the Board we'll find you a job in Aboriginal health." What matters as far as criminality or impropriety is concerned is the nature of all the conduct, the intention behind it and its effect. See Hawkins v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 440 particularly per Sir Anthony Mason CJ at 447-448 citing Lord Campbell L.C. in Walters v Morgan (1861)&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such an offer as is implied from the letter and the surrounding conduct if made with the requisite intention is quite capable of being revealed as illegal or improper on full investigation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Queen's Counsel is quite explicit. The third paragraph on the final page refers to Mr Burmester's advice. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Burmester's advice, confined to the terms of the letter and omitting reference to Mr Sharp and Senator Herron's other actions, an advice given with no reasons but as a simple assertion of the author constitutes no substantial basis in my opinion, why investigation into such an important matter should not proceed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We on this side believe that it should proceed as a matter of urgency. As I say, there is a lot of documentation that needs to be grabbed here and a lot of people who need to be examined. In terms of that documentation, the Queen's Council says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am instructed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and I do not think anyone disputes this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there is evidence available to prove that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (1) at the initial meeting of the Board the Minister sought the members resign and indicated to the members that if there were any other appointments more congenial or convenient he was prepared to look at it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those minutes are critical. There is the fact that the minister wrote to each member seeking their resignation. He met with the board and asked for their resignations. All those documents and minutes are critical in terms of any full and honest investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a conversation with one member the minister indicated it might be that the member would be able to earn remuneration from the department if the member resigned from the board. That person also needs to be examined and questioned. The advice goes on, but I think the important thing here is we need to take into account the fact that, whereas this QC says quite clearly that there is a mountain of evidence&mdash;and I am using my words&mdash;to be assessed by an appropriate officer, this government has not taken that course. As he says, the advice of Mr Burmester does not examine the actions of the ministers, either separately or in combination, and specifically does not deal with the conduct of Mr Sharp. That is a very valid point. The QC says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="717">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advice does not advert to any question of a matter arising of impropriety in public office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">No doubt this was because the Attorney-General did not seek advice on those matters although in my view it is those matters which raise considerable concern warranting inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">One of the leading silks in the bar in New South Wales makes it very clear in this advice that there are matters which raise considerable concern warranting inquiry. He cites the only relevant precedent in this case in terms of the relevance of all the context of this matter. Yet the government, through the Leader of the Government in Senate (Senator Hill), came in here today and put on the public record quite clearly the government's view that there is a context, there is a saga here and there is a longstanding issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But having said that, contrary to the law of this country&mdash;and in fact the law of the United Kingdom, to the extent that that might be relevant&mdash;he then makes the assertion that all these matters are irrelevant. You cannot do that, Senator Hill. You cannot claim legally that all this background information, all this to-ing and fro-ing, is irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, how did it come about that Mr Fischer, the Deputy Prime Minister, handed the letter over to Gabi Hollows? The whole context of all these matters&mdash;the running public debate, the inducements to Ms Pollock as well as Gabi Hollows&mdash;has not been put to an appropriate legal officer. That then raises the point of who is an appropriate legal officer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must admit that I feel sorry for Mr Burmester. He is in the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, he is there to provide legal advice. He could see the train coming yesterday&mdash;the Prime Minister's office, the Attorney&hyphen;General's office&mdash;with all of them wanting quick advice. You cannot get to the root cause of a matter like this unless you have a full assessment. That is the judgment of the Full Bench of the High Court of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In fact, what Mr James says is, `There are matters that warrant investigation.' He also reflects quite clearly that the law of this country demands that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> those matters be investigated. That is what Mr James says.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The appropriate person to investigate these sorts of matters is not Mr Burmester&mdash;a person who has been given a couple of documents and asked to pass judgment on them, knowing that the full impact of the government's wrath is not just about to descend on him; it has been descending on his department for some time. We saw the last manifestation of it in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on Monday when Glen Milne had been `fed the line' from the government that they were not happy with the government's advice from the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Burmester is the same person who gave this government advice on the Wik case. He told them in that advice&mdash;a document which was put to cabinet by Ministers Herron and Williams, together with Parliamentary Secretary Minchin, last year&mdash;that you cannot extinguish native title and you should not. The advice from this person and the A&hyphen;G's department was that you should not extinguish native title. They rejected his advice there and set the bushfires going with Mr Fischer and Premier Borbidge. But, as I say, whereas they rejected his advice there, they were clutching at straws to get this advice here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right people to investigate this are the law enforcement agencies. If the Prime Minister is not going to do that, then there needs to be a judicial investigation. What you have here is evidence which is quite pertinent and evidence which, I fear, may not be present later down the track unless this investigation is done urgently. As I say, there are a whole raft of matters to be examined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what really makes a mockery of the Prime Minister's assertion that there is nothing to worry about is the fact that Mr Burmester came to his conclusion without examining one person. How can you claim that you have had a full investigation and assessment of these matters and not have one person examined? It would have been appropriate for Ms Hollows to have been asked about what inducements were offered, the meetings, including the one with Mr Sharp, and so on. It would have been appropriate for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="718"> others on the board to have been asked. The victims of the inducement should have been examined&mdash;and, in fact, the perpetrators also. It makes a mockery of the whole judicial system if you can argue that one can come to a conclusion on guilt, without questioning the witnesses and without examining the suspects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what we have been asked to do here. We have been asked basically to turn our heads to a case not just of a potential breach of section 73A but also one involving a whole raft of ministers, including the Deputy Prime Minister. And you have to ask how and to what extent the Prime Minister's office was involved here. We know that there was a meeting in the Prime Minister's office, so you have to ask to what extent the Prime Minister was involved in this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is nothing short of a potential case of conspiring to pervert the course of justice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I would indicate to the Senate that I am not going to take 10 minutes, as there is really very little that needs responding to. When Senator Bolkus, with some drama, rose to speak in this debate, we thought he may have some new information, some information that may well bring the government down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What that information has turned out to be is an advice, apparently from Mr James to we are not quite sure who, based on instructions of which we are not quite sure, about another barrister's opinion. It is a barrister giving an opinion on another barrister's opinion. I daresay that, if you gave this couple of pages over to another barrister to give an opinion on this barrister's opinion, you could get a different set of conclusions. Perhaps you could get any set of conclusions you wanted to. You could go around to whichever barrister you wanted to pick and ask him to give an opinion on another barrister's opinion. It is quite remarkable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not know who this advice is to. It is rather remarkable in the way it is set out. It 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is some six years since I practised law, but I have never seen an advice like this. Neither have I ever seen an advice where there does not seem to be any basis for the instructions. Somewhere in this it says, `I am instructed that there is evidence available to prove that . . . ' That is apparently his instructions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder who gave him those instructions, what the evidence was, and what he was told the evidence was. Could I be right in thinking that he was given those instructions by some political people, perhaps the Australian Labor Party? Perhaps some senators or staffers have made up some facts; perhaps they have given him a set of facts which they seem to have got from somewhere and said, `Right, these are your instructions, now give us some advice on them; and here is another barrister's opinion, give us some advice on that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know of Mr James, but that is my failure and not his, I might say. He is of senior counsel, so he obviously has some considerable ability at the law. But a counsel's advice can only be as good as the instructions that are given. If these instructions are given by the Australian Labor Party&mdash;a political group seeking a political opinion or a matter on a political issue&mdash;then one has to have some doubt as to just what this particular opinion says.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regrettably, although Senator Bolkus spoke at some length on this&mdash;the advice has only just been handed to me, so I have not had a chance to have a look at it&mdash;but on the brief look that I have had it does not really seem to take the matter any further at all. There is nothing in what Senator Bolkus has raised that warrants any sort of response from the government at this particular stage. Perhaps if we knew a little more about the facts that were given to Mr James, perhaps if we were to get another eminent counsel to give an opinion on Mr James's opinion, then the matter could go further. But I do not think I need take the time of the Senate any longer to address this. There is really nothing in what was said that requires any sort of response.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The document I refer to is a letter by the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, the Hon. Warwick Smith, to the chairman of the Casino Surveillance Authority concerning a dispute between Christmas Island Resort Pty Ltd and Casinos Austria International (Christmas Island) Pty Ltd. Because the casino has such a significant effect on the economy of Christmas Island, this matter was drawn to the attention of the Australian public by Mr Dave McLean, who is the representative of the employees through their union in that area. The dispute has arisen in such a way as to have an effect on the operation of the casino and therefore the operation of the hotel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr McLean reported to the public, as I understand it, that, because the casino operator was now no longer prepared to allow the so-called high rollers from South&hyphen;East Asia to wager to the extent they would like to, the casino's operations were prejudiced, the hotel's operations were prejudiced and that was affecting the employment of the community on Christmas Island.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not profess to be an expert about Christmas Island, but I do know in relation to that particular part of the world there is not a lot of employment available and they do depend heavily on the operation of the casino for their economy. That casino, for its success, depends on drawing the gamblers and other visitors from the South&hyphen;East Asian region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pretty well known, I think, that people who frequent the Christmas Island casino often go there not only because it is close to where they live but also because they have been able to wager large amounts. They do not travel to bet $2 or $5 on a turn of a roulette wheel. They go there because they are able to gamble to the extent that they would like to.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the dispute, as I understand it, as reported by Mr McLean, between the hotel operator and the casino operator, the casino is now not taking wagers of any significant amount. That means that the so-called high rollers are not travelling to Christmas Island to use the hotel or the casino and that means the employment of the locals is drastically affected.

I am pleased that Senator O'Brien supports the government's proposal to try to get some resolution of what is obviously a matter of some great concern on Christmas Island. It is certainly the case, As Senator O'Brien said, that there are not great opportunities for employment on Christmas Island, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> apart from tourism. The casino was a major attempt to attract tourism, and tourism of a particular class, to the island.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I have some comments to make ever so briefly on the matter. I speak as Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. I endorse Senator O'Brien's comments. Some six months ago, the minister and I visited Christmas Island when this matter was just starting to brew. Now it has broken wide open.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember that when the issue of the casino first came to the Senate it was controversial: should one be set up or should it not? It really did split the Senate. But it has proven to be very beneficial for the island because of employment. There are not many opportunities there and, of course, it drags in the tourist dollar. The other opportunity is phosphate. To its credit, the union took over the phosphate mine, after it was shut down by the company, and is running it very successfully. Other than that, there is only the casino on the island. The union on Christmas Island is taking great interest not only in the phosphate mine but also in the troubles of their workers at the casino. They have been faxing the minister and me and keeping us updated on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More particularly, in relation to the portfolio of the minister, the minister and I met with the licence holder of the casino, Mr Sumampow, and the managers of the casino, Casinos Austria International Ltd. They are at loggerheads, and the situation has reached a very serious point. This casino once turned over billions of dollars a year; now it has come to a grinding halt. The high rollers are not coming into Christmas Island any more. The maximum bet allowed at the casino is $50. That is the absurd situation that has come about because of the dispute between the licence holder and the management. There are many opinions about who exactly is at 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="721"> fault. That is why Senator O'Brien is quite right in saying that we should get to the crux of this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's reputation is very much on the line. The present government&mdash;as with the previous government&mdash;takes great interest in the happenings on Christmas Island because of its position so close to Indonesia. We cannot have one of our outposts, one of our territories, in such a mess financially and its reputation held up to ridicule. Quite frankly, at the moment the dispute between the casino operators and management has reached the absurd stage. It is greatly affecting the people of the island, and they deserve better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report is of importance. These outposts cannot be forgotten. We so often focus only on the mainland of Australia, but we have territories like the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island and Norfolk Island and others. We have to have an equal involvement in them as a government. Senator O'Brien, you have brought important matters to the Senate. We on this side of the chamber are acting upon them with great diligence. We do not underestimate the importance of the matter to the people of Christmas Island.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I also want to join with Senator McGauran in commending Senator O'Brien for bringing this matter to the attention of the Senate this afternoon. It is an extremely important issue for the people of Christmas Island and for those who have an interest in the continuing development of that island, that beautiful area off the Western Australian coast. It is not part of my electorate; it comes into the electorate of the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also commend Senator McGauran for paying tribute to the very good work, over a large number of years, of the Union of Christmas Island Workers and the contribution that they have been able to make to the continued development of the island. There are grave fears on the island about the island's future and what is going to happen. There are hopes that this inquiry that has been initiated by the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government (Mr Warwick Smith) can be concluded quickly and successfully for all 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parties, without making comment on who is at fault and who is not at fault.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I want to bring this to the attention of the Senate and urge expediency in the resolution of the matter is that it is having much wider ramifications than on just the island itself or on those high rollers, those gamblers, who visit the island to chance their luck on the tables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is this weekend that the only international airline link between mainland Australia and Christmas Island is going to cease. National Jet Systems operate between Broome and Christmas Island and they have given notice that the service is going to cease from Monday of next week. That is another reason that I suggest that, while it may not be directly impacted by the matter that is under investigation by the casino control ordinances, nonetheless it is a further example of why the matter ought to be resolved as speedily and as justly as possible.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="721"><TITLE>Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade</TITLE><PROCTEXT>

He implied that the British people would not know what bath towels were&mdash;but I think he retracted it quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter that I did want to address and, hopefully, it will be a great subject matter in next year's Foreign Affairs and Trade report, is Australia's decision not to sign a human 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="722"> rights clause that is contained within the trade agreement with the European Community. In some parts of Europe, this is causing grave concern as to why a country like Australia, a country of the First World, a developed nation, is so backward about signing a human rights clause, which is something which is a matter of course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that I am motivated to bring further attention to this matter today&mdash;although it does not stand Australia in good stead and I am very loath to in any way knock Australia&mdash;is that yesterday I had the privilege of meeting members of a delegation from the French parliament, from their foreign affairs committee, who were in this country. During a working lunch with that delegation, mention was made of the fact that, in recent times, what French people have heard about Australia most has been related to one member of the other place, the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). It is in that context that they had an understanding of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previous to that, their understanding of Australia and their knowledge of Australia was related to our opposition to France's testing its nuclear weapons in our backyard. Of course, that has put some strains on the relationship with this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you compound those three events&mdash;Australia's pretty vigorous opposition to the French testing, which I acknowledge crossed party lines; their knowledge of the publicity surrounding some of the comments by the member for Oxley; and now Australia's reluctance to sign a human rights clause in a trade agreement&mdash;one must wonder what French people think of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hope that our Minister for Foreign Affairs, who has just returned from visiting a number of countries in Europe as well as some other parts of the world, will be putting increased and enhanced efforts into building Australia's reputation in that area. It is not the only area of the world that the foreign minister and other ministers of this government have to put effort into. Certainly, they cannot neglect the area in which we are located, that is the South&hyphen;East Asian region where you have to build many bridges&mdash;and I do not mean only in the physical sense of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> building a bridge across the Mekong. We have to build many more bridges because many of our relationships have been damaged in this region since this government came to office, not the least of which by the reportage of certain comments by the member for Oxley.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is something that the members of the parliamentary friendship group with France sought to address yesterday when they met with the French foreign affairs committee. They did tell the committee about the motion condemning anti-racist comment that was moved successfully by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) last year at the behest of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley).

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McKiernan has raised a very important matter. As others before me have said, you really have to divide the issues. I do not think anyone anywhere in the world can critically accuse Australia of having a poor human rights record. I think our human rights record over the years&mdash;I might say, Senator McKiernan, in the time of even your government&mdash;has been second to none. I do not think anyone seriously challenges that proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia will continue to push for the rights of all human beings, no matter where and when they are. But we will do this in the appropriate forums with the appropriate devices. Annexing these sorts of clauses to trade agreements, which are really agreements related to trade, is just, in my mind, quite silly. They are completely separate issues. You make agreements for trade by talking about trade issues, talking about advancing the welfare of all countries in the world by having the freest and easiest form of exchange of goods and services. That is what trade agreements are about. That is what trade discussions and forums are held for. But that should not be confused by human rights addendums. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="723">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a proud record of human rights. We will continue to pursue that and continue to make all Australians proud of the way their governments, regardless of political colour, pursue the question of human rights. Certainly, this government will be as much to the fore as, if not more to the fore than, the previous government in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is tremendous to see the French delegation here. We look forward to very close relationships with the French parliament and, in fact, all parliamentarians right throughout the world. I could not quite follow your logic, Senator McKiernan, when you said that the French worry about us because of three issues, one of which was our objection to their testing nuclear weapons in our backyard. I do not point the finger at anyone or at any nation. I do not think it is appropriate for me, or perhaps any Australian, to lecture other countries on how they should run things although I, like others, was very concerned about the French testing in our backyard, or anywhere in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I wonder what the French explanation was for the human rights of those people who would have been affected by that nuclear testing. Perhaps some of the things that were said to us by some of our European friends could have been looked at a bit more closely when we were determining the rights of those living in the Pacific islands, the rights of those living in Australasia and the rights of those of us living in east Asia when the French were testing nuclear weapons. Again, I do not make any accusation or comment, but I raise the matter of Senator McKiernan's joining a blaming of Australia for not saying something about human rights with a comment about the French being concerned about us and our attitude to their testing of nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As is quite often the case on some of these occasions&mdash;I certainly make it clear that I am not talking about the French particularly here&mdash;people who are saying to us that we should include in trade agreements comments about human rights have records on human rights that are nowhere near as good as Australia's record. I as a private citizen sometimes wonder if perhaps a little bit of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> action might speak louder than words on those occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the matter Senator McKiernan raised is a very important one. On no occasion will Australia resile from its commitment to human rights, but we think it should be done in the appropriate place at the appropriate time.</PARA></SPEECH>

That is where we stamp our credentials in regard to human rights. We have not failed to uphold in the strongest terms the highest ideals in regard to human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other example of how a country respects human rights is through its political system. Australia, with its mix of predominantly the Westminster system and the American system, has the freest and most tolerant of political systems, with all the democratic checks and balances that are required in our political system. How stable, certain and tolerant it is stands up against just about all, if not all, political systems in the world. It is a truly democratic system with the best mix of the British Westminster system, a bit of Australian thrown in and, of course, the powers of the Senate err more towards the American system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have nothing to hide in regard to human rights. All this government is saying is that there is a time and a place to voice those human rights and to single the issue out.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I preface my remarks by simply indicating that Senator Allison of the Australian Democrats came down to the chamber to speak on one of these documents. If she was intending to do that, it might be an appropriate time for her to return to the chamber. I do not know which document she wanted to speak about, so I cannot move to take note of it on her behalf and seek leave to continue my remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Document No. 103 is a report on the National Crime Authority for the year 1995-96. As senators would know, this authority was established by the states, the territories and the Commonwealth to fight organised crime. The authority has been given powers that exceed those which the state and federal police forces have. Having been given those 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="726"> additional powers&mdash;extra authorities, over and above the normal authorities&mdash;the authority has to exercise those increased powers very carefully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recently retired from the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority. Nothing I say in this very brief contribution is in any way anything confidential that I gleaned from my time on that committee. My understanding is that the parliamentary committee is having a general inquiry into the National Crime Authority for a number of reasons. One of those is the concern in some people's minds, including my own, that the National Crime Authority may have entered into the political arena several years ago when it embarked upon an investigation of a prominent Victorian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without making any comment on the innocence, guilt or otherwise of that gentleman&mdash;I am certainly not in a position to raise that&mdash;I inform the Senate of a matter that has always concerned me: whether investigations of that nature fitted into the brief of the National Crime Authority on organised crime. My understanding and that of ordinary Australians and I think most parliamentarians is&mdash;perhaps this is not the technical legal interpretation&mdash;that that authority was established to look at organised crime, that is crime involving what is referred to in the media and in fictitious TV programs as the Mafia and Triads&mdash;the real organised crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One wonders whether the NCA has in some of its investigations followed that part of its charter. I am sure that the parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority will investigate that and other matters in its determinations in the near future. I think it is important that the parliament has the ultimate confidence in that authority. I am sure the authority does tremendous work in a very difficult area, but it is important that the parliament watches over, so to speak, these powers, these authorities. I am sure the joint committee, under the chairmanship of Mr Bradford, will very thoroughly look at all aspects of the work of the National Crime Authority so that the authority can continue its good work now and into the future in

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the reasons I briefly want to comment on the annual report of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation is that recently we had a briefing at Parliament House with the new managing director of that organisation, Mr Adrian Kloeden, who also happens to be the Managing Director of the International Wool Secretariat. Being a wool grower myself and representing a lot of wool growers, I must say things have not been that bright in the wool industry of late but I was heartened by some of the comments he made. I was particularly impressed by his attitude as the managing director of that organisation. After all is said and done, the wool growers of Australia have been pouring millions of dollars into that organisation over the years. That has produced many great outcomes, but in recent times some questions have been raised, quite rightly, about whether they are getting value for money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amount of money being paid in by government has reduced. In 1995-96, wool growers contributed $87 million in wool tax, $11 million was contributed by the government and another $11 million was contributed by others. Contributions made to the International Wool Secretariat, an international organisation, totalled about $98 million. When we look at the funding of the International Wool Secretariat, we find that Australia provides&mdash;to me, not surprisingly&mdash;92 per cent of that money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember visiting the International Wool Secretariat a few years ago in Paris. I was warned then by the people working there that perhaps the funding was not being put to the best of use, and in fact promotion had almost fallen away, to the detriment of the industry. I think if you look back over the last few 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="727"> years, you see that there is no doubt that the lack of money being put into promotion has had quite a dramatic effect on the usage of wool. There have been plenty of other effects, of course. I was pleased to hear the opinions of the new managing director, who is a private enterprise orientated person. He is taking a whole new outlook on the situation. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Great opportunities lie ahead, and with a freshly invigorated business&hyphen;based philosophy, AWRAP will continue to go out and meet the challenges head&hyphen;on.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They have. One of the innovative new ways that they have tried to improve our sales of wool overseas is to gain access into Mexico, sell our wool tops into Mexico, have the wool processed there and then be able to get the cloth duty free into America. Up until now Australia itself has had a non-tariff barrier of quite significant amount preventing us from exporting to that key market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The annual report does point out that, whilst there has been a dwindling income for wool, there are other ways growers can maximise their returns, and that is by being more efficient. A lot of the activities carried out by this wool research corporation are into new technology. It is very good to see that they have put quite a bit of money into soils and pasture management programs. My colleague Senator Heffernan would know all about that, being a wool grower himself. I note also that there has been quite a deal of money and some very good results in long&hyphen;life combs and cutters. If anybody has ever been mixed up with the shearing industry, they would know that that is in itself a significant advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were in the IPU visiting the Baltic states a couple of years ago, we visited the Drobe Wool Enterprise in Lithuania. At that time Australia had started investing money into that enterprise. I am pleased to see that, as a result of Australia's interest and encouragement, this particular mill has lifted its usage from 50,000 kilograms in 1992 to 700,000 kilograms last year. Those sorts of enterprises that have been encouraged by the International Wool Secretariat and the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organi

<PARA STYLE="Para">Earlier this week the Senate discussed the issue of the position within this government of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), highlighting the fact that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had sought to undermine her authority and position within the government by allowing her junior minister, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, responsibilities for the new work for the dole scheme. That was a scheme that this government had dreamt up over the weekend as an attempt to divert attention away from the various scandals and difficulties that it was facing&mdash;an attempt, of course, driven by the pollsters within the Liberal Party secretariat, aiming at distracting attention away from the gross inadequacies of this government. This is a pattern that has emerged in recent times 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> within the government, and particularly within this portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicated earlier in the week that the opposition extended its sympathy to the minister because of the concerns that must undoubtedly be being felt within her office at the constant, determined and persistent efforts being made by her colleagues, her ministerial colleagues, to undermine her within the government. Now we see that the Prime Minister is supporting her detractors within the ministry and weakening her position, her authority and her capacity to effectively administer this portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Upon reflection, I thought that perhaps this was in itself not the full story; that our sympathy should go to the minister on a broader range of issues, because after all this seems now to be a bit of a pattern within her career. It is really sad, when you think about it, that she came into this parliament in 1984 as a person presenting herself as representing the views of the wets within the Liberal Party, the so-called progressives within the Liberal Party. She has had to face and struggle against her opponents within the Liberal Party&mdash;the dries, represented by Senator Minchin and others. Of course, this is a struggle that has continued since 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She sought, I think, in many respects&mdash;and we saw this with her interest particularly in law reform&mdash;to present progressive views and liberal views in some areas. But what does she find when she gets into government? She of course is obliged to introduce policies which will see those educational programs cut dramatically; she will in fact have to do the bidding for the most conservative elements within the Liberal Party; she has become effectively the agent for the dries within the Liberal Party. I am sure that is a frustration that she feels quite strongly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the fact that she was seeking so strenuously to be the Attorney-General in the Liberal government, she ended up with what she regarded as the booby prize. It is the third largest portfolio within the government. You would think it is a matter of great significance, that it is a portfolio that has enormous political, social and economic significance for this country. You would think that she would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="729"> actually regard it as a job that required some real attention, had some real worth. Unfortunately, that is not the approach that she took.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, in this last budget, we saw her administer policies which amounted to the reduction of some $4.3 billion in the budget outlays for her department over the forward estimates period. Here we have it: a person who comes into politics as the great progressive ending up implementing the policies of her arch factional rivals within the Liberal Party. You can understand her frustration in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the higher education area in particular we saw that she has introduced policies under this budget which have seen the reduction in expenditure of some $1.821 billion dollars. That is provided on page 22 of volume No. 1 of the additional information received by the Employment, Education and Training Legislation Committee. In the vocational education and training area she, as a senior minister, is administering policies which see the gutting of the Australian National Training Authority. She will see the quite dramatic undermining of the whole training reform agenda. She will see the reduction of some $137 million for vocational education and training over the forward estimates period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of course it is in the labour market programs that we see the really big cuts being made, where the really savage, draconian, ruthless and heartless actions are being taken by this government to reduce assistance, by some $1.958 billion, for persons who are unemployed. That is nearly $2 billion worth of reductions in assistance to people who are unemployed. We heard last weekend this government's miserable, petty scheme to provide assistance to persons who are unemployed. It is a miserable, pathetic scheme which, of course, is aimed at harbouring the most prejudiced views about people that are unfortunate enough not to be able to find work within our community. A right that is being denied is a nature of our economic system and the failure of our economy to provide adequate work for all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this government do? It blames the victim. It seeks to establish in the minds of the public that the reason we have unem 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ployment is that the unemployed are there and that, somehow or other, the unemployed themselves are to blame. Instead of having a program of assistance which is based on a balanced approach between employment and training and education and training, as we saw under the previous government's Working Nation, this regime has sought to blame the victim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has sought to attack viciously those persons who are unemployed and to try to de&hyphen;legitimise people in a way that means that the public turns on those who are unemployed. Instead of providing assistance, they say that it is not appropriate to provide assistance. But when the government gets into trouble&mdash;political scandal after political scandal surrounds this government&mdash;they have to dredge up a new device to distract attention away from the difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister has to also administer cuts to education assistance, income support, youth policy support and Aboriginal education. In total, student, youth and Aboriginal education support has been reduced by nearly half a billion dollars. That is $4.59 billion in the forward estimates period which will be reduced from this portfolio as a result of the budget. The total budget savings introduced in this budget amount to $4.3 billion. It is little wonder that the minister finds it frustrating in a new job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She made it perfectly clear from the moment she came into this position that she did not really want it. She made comment upon comment which suggested to me that she is having great difficulty adjusting to her new role. For instance, I recall, there was a famous speech that she gave at the national conference of the Australian Association for the Education of Gifted and Talented in Adelaide back in April last year in which she said that education has had it too good for too long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She announced that, since becoming a minister, her most important decision had been that the letterhead should be black to save confusion when changing trays on the photocopier. She knew the difficulties that she would face in this new job. She announced that she was going to buy a Paddington Bear yellow mac `because of the garbage that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="730"> would be hurled at me when I visit universities.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition does feel for her with her approach to these great issues of the nation, her approach to these high policy matters&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, of course there is the issue of her fashion sense as well. But the real question is her attitude to this portfolio. What we have seen in this last budget is that this government has reduced the total outlays going to this portfolio from 11 per cent to nine per cent of total government outlays in the forward estimates period. This is a government that is determined to undermine this portfolio as a priority within this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Actions of course speak much louder than words, but the words themselves are very interesting. I remember Senator Vanstone describing students as the ugly face of self&hyphen;interest, defining students as little brutes squealing like stuck pigs when faced with the problems that she of course was administering.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CONROY" NAMEID="3L6">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3L6">Senator Conroy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She didn't say that?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AW5">Senator CARR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She did indeed say that. She suggested on one occasion in September 1996, when confronted with the very strong reaction from within the higher education sector, that universities should stop whingeing and start dobbing. She said that academics should dob in wasteful universities by leaking information&mdash;to her, of course, and to her department&mdash;that they should stop whingeing and start dobbing. She said, `I am sick of hearing comments from universities that, "We'll have to cut courses and staff."' She said, `I am yet to hear one of them say, "We will improve our management or make administrative changes."' She said that they should contact the media to alert the community to waste.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government very concerned about waste, isn't it? We have seen a whole frontbench over there which is very wasteful indeed. The minister suggested that people should place a piece of paper in a brown paper bag to raise problems. We all understand what is meant by that, don't we? Some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> times a bit of public embarrassment is the way to do it, she said. Vice&hyphen;chancellors pretty well get anything they want from the university councils, she said. She said there were huge problems that had to be confronted and suggested that the way to do it was to stop whingeing and start dobbing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister was, frankly, having great difficulties communicating this government's policies, and I can understand her frustrations in doing that, because she had a very straightforward approach: if people did not agree with her position, she announced she would simply `rip your arms off'. She would, of course, find it a great difficulty that university chiefs were feeling `helpless and totally dependent on government in seeking to cope with changes facing their own institutions'. She suggested that `those who are entrusted to light the path are afraid of the dark'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again we have a classic case of a government which is determined to blame the victims for their present circumstances. And this is a government which has inflicted great pain and suffering upon our higher education institutions. The government has approached quite profound issues in a most simplistic manner. It has sought to suggest that the minister's massive changes in policy were, as she said in September `just a nick; you won't even have to put a bandaid on it'. She suggested that `apparently if you lose one per cent the end of the world has come'. There is nothing like that. We saw some 17,000 university places taken out of the system as a result of this government's changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it any wonder that there was such a reaction to the government's budget? Is it not therefore also any wonder that in this climate there should be such turmoil engulfing the higher education community, that there should be the national disgrace of the inaction at the rising levels of unemployment and the rising levels of inequality that were a direct result of this government's failure in terms of the administration of this portfolio and the policy directions this government is taking, particularly in education and training. You have got budgetary measures which are aimed at the removal  of  some  $4.3  billion  from 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="731"> DEETYA's funding over the forward estimates period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a result that comes directly from the vandalism that this government has inflicted. We see rising unemployment, declining levels of demand for university courses and a deterioration in the public education system. So at all levels, in all divisions of her portfolio, this minister is facing enormous problems. A very deep&hyphen;seated crisis is emerging and she has failed to administer it properly. As I say, the opposition has some sympathy for her because we understand how difficult it must be for her to be able to confront these enormous problems when she is being so constantly undermined from within her own ranks. It must be extraordinary not to be able to rely upon the support of her Prime Minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is another difficulty, Senator Conroy. The ambition faction within the Liberal Party makes it extremely difficult for her to concentrate on the task that she is faced with. It is no wonder that the national newspapers cover a significant disaster in national education and training policies week by week. Week by week we are faced with the stories of shame that arise from this government in terms of this minister's failure to address very serious concerns being expressed by scholars, by academics, by business people, by trade unionists&mdash;by ordinary Australians. Every aspect of her portfolio is under severe public criticism. Just take a few of the comments that have been made. Former University of Canberra chancellor and distinguished author Donald Horne made the point that Vanstone is a disaster. Mr Horne described the minister as a `real disaster', stating that `she had no understanding of the fact that there are public benefits in universities'. Perhaps even more damning was his belief that `the present minister has lowered the debate to a depth that might be unparalleled in the liberal democratic world'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You know, Senator Herron, exactly what I am talking about&mdash;all the conventions of ministerial responsibility. It is symptomatic of the government's dogmatic 1950s attitude, the belief that we can turn back this country to the way the world might have been in some idealised vision of the elitism of the 1950s. The great patriarchs of our society will be able to come forward and suggest that we should have a university system for the rich and the powerful, we should have a system of school education for the rich and the powerful, we should have governments that are aimed at providing business welfare at large; but no support, or very limited support, for social security recipients, for the unemployed, for any people who do not measure up to your ideas of success.

In response to a seven per cent decline in demand and plummeting entry scores in terms of the TER cut&hyphen;offs, we have heard the government first make their puerile claims that it was too early to evaluate the effects of the HECS increases. They then said it was the fault of the schools and then it was the fault of the universities. And, guess what, it will ultimately be the fault of the students themselves, because we have a mentality here that you blame the victim. Of course, the real victim here ultimately will be the minister herself. As I say, we have some sympathy for her in the struggles that she is facing in these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very easy to blame everybody else except the minister and this government at large. This view stands in very sharp contrast to that of the experts right across the educa 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="732"> tion and training sectors of this economy. It stands in contrast with the views of experts such as the head of the New South Wales Vice&hyphen;Chancellors Conference, Professor Cliff Blake, who recently described the number of vacant places as unprecedented. Dr Rice, the President of the Australian Council of Deans of Science, said, `The effects of increases in the higher education contribution scheme could not be underestimated.' Professor Tim Brown, who chairs Melbourne University's selection committee, said, `It would be surprising if higher fees had no impact on student choice.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even the National Party itself&mdash;the great scholars of this parliament&mdash;said that it was very concerned to see that the minister was unable to meet the responsibilities of her portfolio. It was very concerned in particular about the increases to HECS. The Nationals understand that there is considerable damage being done to our regional universities as a result of the changes to higher education and the introduction of such draconian higher education fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are very clear. When the government released its higher education budget statement on 9 August, some 11 days before the 1996-97 budget, the higher education community reeled. In its first budget, the government totally abandoned a whole series of pre&hyphen;election promises and so-called guarantees. It slashed some $2 billion from the sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government cut some $623 million from operating grants to universities and some $214 million from the discretionary funds, which are funds used by the university to enhance the quality of its teaching and its research. So much for the promise the government made about promoting quality and excellence in research and teaching. It made so much of that in the election campaign. The universities were also made to bear the cost of a $300 million academic salary increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, the government has slashed some 17,000 Commonwealth funded places from the higher education sector, from the university sector. It is not just the universities that are being deceived. The 1996-97 budget added a massive $1.1 billion in additional costs to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> students. It replaced the single level HECS charge with a three-tiered structure, increasing the annual debt levels by between 35 per cent and 125 per cent. It lowered the repayment threshold by almost $8,000 and in 1998 we will see the introduction of the full fee paying places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has abandoned the concept of merit and has gone back to the old scheme where wealth and privilege can buy both a place at university and all the rewards that that confers. You want to be clear about what you are doing. Do not try to deceive the Australian people in the manner in which you are trying to return to a scheme based on privilege and wealth and are trying to take away from Australian universities their mass character and their character which the Labor government was able to introduce by allowing more and more Australians to participate in the university sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the government has set a 25 per cent cap on fee paying places, many believe that the major purpose of the West review, which is currently under way, is to expand the whole privatisation of the university sector. That point is certainly being rammed home by the AVCC acting president, Professor Geoff Wilson, who stated that the government, through the West inquiry `was trying very hard to achieve a significant shift from public to private funding' and `more deregulation with respect to fees would be a fairly likely scenario to result from the inquiry'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's agenda is for a small, elitist university sector. It is quite apparent that the effect of the 90 per cent rise in HECS for science and engineering students will produce that sort of result in those sectors. We see significant drops in demand for those particular courses throughout the country. Cut-off scores have plummeted in Melbourne. The combined science and engineering degrees at Monash University have dropped more than 10 points, a statistic repeated or exceeded throughout the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduction is so severe in Victoria that the tertiary education minister has established a committee to examine the drift of higher achieving students away from science and technology, and has called on universities to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="733"> subsidise science and engineering students. In New South Wales they have gone even further with the University of New South Wales actually offering to pay the difference between last year's HECS fees and the new rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has the nerve to continue to rant that her increased HECS fees are not the source of the problem. Sydney University Vice-chancellor, Professor Gavin Brown, summarised the true situation when he told students last year that the change to a three-tiered HECS system was `a gratuitous act of violence which showed a lack of understanding on the part of politicians about the impact of their decisions'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact has been felt not just by the university students but also by the staff. With major sackings occurring nationally as a result of the budget cuts and the constant attacks on the sector by this government, staff morale has plummeted. The effects that such low academic morale and disillusionment will have on the learning environment are yet to be seen, but one can see a situation in which there has to be an eroding of the quality of teaching standards and an undermining of the drive for excellence that one would expect all our universities to be striving for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the schools area we see a similar shift away from equity to privilege. We see a similar shift away in government priorities. In terms of general grants to the states and course specific purpose payments, we see a net reduction of some $387 million in Commonwealth funding for schools, public schools in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abandonment of the new schools policy will directly aid the privileged in our society. It will provide additional resources for the private sector at the expense of the public sector. It will deliberately see an undermining of this country's commitment to public education. As a result of the government's changes, we will see a net gain of some $150 million over four years to private schools in direct grants alone, while government schools will suffer a $177 million reduction over the same period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This transference of funds under the government's so&hyphen;called enrolment benchmark 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> adjustments has seen all states in this country condemn that measure. It has seen a new device added to the scheme of undermining pubic education by the use&mdash;and I think the cynical use&mdash;of the concept of choice in this regard without having regard to the fact that choices are being extended to some at the expense of the many.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, you will see this classic case being repeated over and over again, a situation recently highlighted by the Bulla Primary School in Victoria. That school had 42 students in it when the Kennett government closed it. The Victorian government forced it to close, like the 300 schools in Victoria which have been forcefully closed as a result of that government. Forty&hyphen;two school students at the Bulla school left because it was forced to close.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened? The same site has been used to reopen a new school, but it is a private school. And guess how many students are there: 21. So much for the rhetoric of choice. The huge undermining of public education that is occurring in Victoria is being repeated across this country. It has been directly facilitated by the policies of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can see a situation where, in funding for vocational studies, private school students will get the benefit of government support of some $1,700 per student. But funding for students undertaking vocational studies in government schools is some $300 per student. We even see discrimination in the Catholic sector, where the amount of money is from $433.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just discrimination about private versus public&mdash;which is abundantly clear&mdash;but discrimination about particular private schools, particularly the Catholic systemic model, against the more wealthy private schools. A recent report by Monash University has shown that Victorian schools are now forcing parents to raise some $200 million in  addition to the amount of money being provided for their so-called non&hyphen;salary cost of delivering educational programs through their various fundraising activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government which in all sectors of this portfolio is committed to the privatisation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="734"> of what ought be a public responsibility and which requires the full support of this government but which is not enjoying that full support. We have a minister who is constantly being undermined from within this government, a minister who is obliged to introduce the most draconian measures and the most hostile of environments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She came into this parliament as the great libertarian. We hear her day after day saying to us, `Listen here, sport, if you do not like what you are getting, we will rip your arms off.' This is the great libertarian, the great moderate of the Liberal Party, who is under constant attacks from the more extremist elements, such as those represented by Dr Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we do have some sympathy for this minister. We know she does not really believe in anything she is doing. She does not actually believe in the quality of education, to begin with. She does not actually support the value of this portfolio and its work within this government. I understand how difficult it must be. But to have to face up to the constant criticism from within her own government! She came here to represent the progressive views of the Liberal Party in South Australia and finds herself constantly undermined by her colleagues. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was no surprise to those of us on this side of the chamber to hear Senator Carr end his speech in the same way that he began it&mdash;talking about factions. Senator Carr, you must be so preoccupied with the problems of the ALP in Victoria that I am really delighted that you would find time to devote to a debate like this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We came into this chamber expecting a discussion on the items which you have put forward under this general notice of motion, like higher education, labour market and training programs, the long-term unemployed and public education. But, no, we heard half of your speech being devoted to a dissection of factional tactics which are so beloved by you, and that is what you would sooner talk about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Conroy further trivialised this debate when Senator Carr was talking about 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the portfolio of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone). I do not know whether the remark was taken down in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, but Senator Conroy described it as a mickey mouse portfolio. So that would give us Senator Conroy's impression of these very important matters. Far from it being a mickey mouse portfolio, these are very important matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to them one by one. The government is, of course, most concerned that interest in participating in higher education is maintained throughout the Australian community. As Senator Carr correctly remarked, the department is monitoring the number of applications and enrolments each year. For him to say that it is early days yet is true. It is early days&mdash;it is the first academic year after these changes have been brought in. So how would it be possible to be doing anything else at this stage but monitoring the results of our changes to see how they are going to operate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has already indicated its intention to make adjustments if there is clear evidence that increased HECS charges are significantly affecting enrolments in particular courses. Analysis of the applications data so far shows that the number of year 12 applicants for 1997 admissions has not been influenced by the latest HECS charges. There are other factors that operate which influence the number of students who enrol for each course. Demand for places overall by non&hyphen;school leavers has declined for 1997 but there has been a late rush in at least one state by mature age applicants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When students consider whether or not they are going to do a university course, there are other factors that decide what they will eventually do. A university course is indeed a worthwhile goal for many secondary school leavers, but many students decide that perhaps they will not do a university course and that they will seek full-time employment. Who is to say that they are wrong? Many of them may have come to the conclusion to follow that course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, the number of science and engineering graduates as a proportion of all graduates, and science graduates in particular, has been increasing annually since 1992. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="735"> Similarly, the number of engineering surveying graduates has been increasing as a proportion of all graduates since 1992, and it is in fact at its highest level since 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The employment outcomes for recent science graduates do not indicate that there is an undersupply and data derived from the graduate destination survey, published by the Graduate Careers Council of Australia, showed that, of recent science graduates&mdash;and I am talking here about a bachelor degree&mdash;available for full&hyphen;time work in 1995, between 27 and 38 per cent, depending on the field, were still seeking full&hyphen;time employment five months after completing their course compared to 22.1 per cent for all disciplines. Between 45 to 75 per cent of those who were employed were working in science based occupations. Engineering graduates, on the other hand, enjoy better labour market prospects than science graduates, but there is no evidence of undersupply. In fact, the starting salaries of engineering graduates have declined in each of the last five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With particular reference to these two applications in those two disciplines for 1997, the analysis of first preferences by the department indicates that there is no systematic impact of differential HECS on these disciplines. In fact, first preferences increased in agriculture, law and veterinary science and all of these were in the middle or top HECS band, showing that the differential level of HECS is not a limiting factor in the choices that students make. However, the continuing decline in the number of applications for science courses is of concern to the government because the last thing we would want to happen is that in a few years time we do not have enough science graduates, particularly when I put this in the context of a consistent decline in applications for science courses since 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decline, as again Senator Carr correctly remarked, appears to be a reflection of the declining interest in science subjects to year 12 at high school where, for example, the proportion of year 12 students undertaking a physics/ science subject has fallen from half in 1986 to 44 per cent in 1992 and 31 per cent in 1995. Again, the government is most 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concerned about this trend and we welcome the inquiry set up by Mr Honeywood, the Victorian minister for higher education, which will address this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn now to the remark by Senator Carr about the reduction of training and labour market programs. There could be no greater contrast because between the coalition government and the former Labor government which had such a disastrous record with its labour market programs. Indeed, I well remember asking many questions in estimates on the employment, education and training program which indicated that the outcomes result&mdash;that is, people who actually gained a job after going through a labour market program as administered by the former government&mdash;was very, very low.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The present government's goal is for everyone who wants a job to be able to find one. The major elements of the government's job creation strategy are being implemented or are under development. I will go on to mention some of these in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a broader level, the budget is being placed on a more stable footing so that we know as we approach each budget what exactly is in the Treasury. I compare this situation to the result that we faced when we came into government in March 1996 and discovered the existence of the $8 billion black hole. Under our Charter of Budget Honesty, which will be introduced in the parliament in this session, the budget will see the underlying balance return to surplus by 1998&hyphen;99 and we will know at any given time in the budget cycle exactly where we stand as far as money in the Treasury is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reduced budget deficit operating in 1996-97, brought about as a result of the May budget last year, has already helped to bring about reductions in interest rates, and it will increase national savings. These developments are critical for economic growth which underlies the creation of new jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, relating to another portfolio, to stimulate employment, the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996 came into effect at the start of this year. It will take time before the full effects are felt but I would point out that the January 1997 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="736"> figures for the lodging of unfair dismissal claims stood at 347. At this time in January 1996 the number of unfair dismissal claims lodged were 1,150. This represents a 69.8 percentage reduction in the number of unfair dismissal claims lodged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, during the course of the employment, education and training committee's inquiry into the causes of long-term unemployment, one of the major disincentives for employers to employ was the existence of the unfair dismissal provisions. The fact that they are put on a much fairer footing will mean that employers will once again have an incentive to employ people because they will employ people knowing that if the employee proves unsatisfactory or the employee is not satisfied they will then be able to put them off and it will not be such a long and onerous process. Again, from another portfolio, that will work in with employment prospects. The government does recognise that there are many disadvantaged job seekers who will not benefit from jobs growth alone and it is reforming employment services to better assist the unemployed to benefit from real jobs growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at some of the projects that were carried out under the Working Nation scenario before March 1996, we saw large amounts of taxpayers' dollars being spent on simply processing long-term unemployed clients through labour market programs so that they could then be reclassified as short-term unemployed. The whole thing employed a washing machine action by which the long-term unemployed were simply churned around.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much of the formal training funded under Working Nation was demonstrated to have little or no impact on the client's chances of getting a real job and, as I remarked earlier, the successful outcomes from the labour market programs were very few. I think the highest percentage of those who actually achieved a real job within three or six months of leaving a labour market program was something approaching less than 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the so-called job creation placements, such as jobskills, new work opportunities and the LEAP program for the long-term unemployed, were extremely expensive and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they did not significantly enhance the client's chances of getting a long-term job. Later in my remarks I hope to illustrate the advantages of the work for the dole scheme which has a much greater rate of success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The delivery and effectiveness of Working Nation was severely impaired because of the large number of programs&mdash;I think up to 26, which we have now cut back to five&mdash;their complexity and lack of flexibility. This government's reforms aim to assist those unemployed people who need assistance most, and assistance will be tailored to their individual needs. Arrangements will be simpler, less costly and more sharply focused on real job outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me now turn to training. This is one of the most important aspects of this government's programs. There is a planned increase&mdash;I wish Senator Carr were here to hear this&mdash;in Commonwealth expenditure on training in 1996&hyphen;96, not a reduction. Expenditure on accredited training was $240.2 million in 1995&hyphen;96, while the revised estimate for 1996&hyphen;97 is $314.1 million, an increase of $73.9 million associated with an expected increase in apprenticeships and traineeships. Again, education and training grants to the states maintain the number of student places available in 1996&hyphen;97. Funding to the states and territories, apart from designated Commonwealth funding for vocational education and training through the National Training Authority, has been increased by $10.6 million in 1997 over 1996. The allocation of funds to public&mdash;that is, TAFE&mdash;and private providers within states and territories is a matter for state and territory governments, consistent with the national strategy for vocational education and training agreed to by all governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I turn away from the provision of employment and training, I would like to mention that Senator Carr indicated that this government sees the unemployed as victims. He knows that that is not true. I would like to bring to his attention the remarks recently made by Martin Ferguson, now the member for Batman, lately the President of the ACTU. As recently as 10 February 1997, Mr Fergu 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="737"> son, when opposing our work for the dole scheme, told ABC Radio:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">referring to unemployed people&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">go home and go back to bed or watch TV for the rest of the week.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If that is not painting unemployed people as victims, what is? If you over there did not take any notice of the rising level of unemployment for the 13 years that you were in government, you stand condemned for it. That is a good one, Mr Ferguson. Apparently unemployment over your 13 years of government had nothing to do with you. Neither did the record high interest rates, neither did the failed Labor job training programs that I have just gone through. Working Nation, as we discovered in estimates, certainly while I was in opposition, simply tried to hide the unemployment numbers. They were shuffled from program to program. But I guess we should not be too surprised by this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only did the member for Batman say that. Your leader, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) recently said that Labor's billion dollar training programs, which you instituted, were successful not because they led to jobs but because the unemployed `weren't around the streets bothering everybody else'. You know quite well that that was said by Mr Beazley on Radio 6PR on 29 January 1997. You have got the shadow employment minister and your leader talking about the unemployed in those terms. If we had been so unwise as to ever do that, you know that there would have been question after question about our ability to govern this country. Yet you have Mr Beazley, who was a minister in your government, talking about the unemployed in those terms. If that is not painting them as victims, what is?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to turn to the school sector, which was also dealt with by Senator Carr. Contrary to his assertions, this government has taken decisive action to strengthen schooling in the government area. He referred to our States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act. This was an historic act because, for the first time, it gave parents choice. Senator Carr denigrated the word `choice', but let me tell you that, for many 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parents who are thinking about where to send their children to school, choice is a very important element.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take particularly the Bulla Primary School in Victoria which Senator Carr mentioned. Bulla Primary School, at the time of its existence, was given the opportunity to close or to merge with another school. The parents chose&mdash;the word `choice' again&mdash;to close that school. Another school was then enabled to set up on the site. It is a private school with 21 students at the moment, as Senator Carr correctly pointed out. Parents at long last have a choice about where they will send their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Carr and, indeed, many others on the Labor Party side, do not seem to understand that, although we have an excellent government school system in all states, many parents, for reasons of religious belief or other principles that they hold, like to have a choice about where they send their children to school. That is a choice that is being made by many parents today. Enrolments in the non&hyphen;government school sector have gone up in recent years because that is the choice that parents are making. They choose to send their children to those schools because of religious beliefs or other principles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are on about choice, I would also like to point out to Senator Carr that I find it hard or easy, depending on which way you like to look at it, to understand that he does not understand that some parents like to work for their schools and help provide additional funds. That is a choice that parents make. Not all parents want to be involved in school fundraising, but some do because they feel that that involves them in their children's education. They like to do whatever is possible to assist the school to gain extra funds with which to better educate their children. He should not be on about denigrating the choice that parents make to send their children to different schools or the choice that they make to help the school in fundraising activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are promoting choice and diversity, not only between the government and the non&hyphen;government sector but also within the government sector. We are encouraging government 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="738"> schools to communicate with parents about the quality education that those government schools offer and this lies at the basis of the recent remarks by Dr Kemp about the way in which schools should communicate with the parents about how their children are doing at school. Instead of a one&hyphen;line report, which is certainly what may have been offered in the past, you would get from the government school a detailed examination of how your child is progressing. If parents are happy with that, presumably they will chose to keep their children at the schools. In that way, students in government schools will be there because their parents have chosen those schools as the best schools for their children. These sorts of reforms can only increase confidence in the government sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since we started on the promotion and the passing of the states grants schools assistance bill, Senator Carr has been running around the countryside, running down and eroding public confidence in the government school sector, and he stands condemned for that. Given that the government sector is expected to continue to educate over two million students a year, this hardly is the bare bones of a system that is left, when everyone has emigrated to the non&hyphen;government system. There will never be a movement like that. The Labor Party, who are the self&hyphen;proclaimed defenders of government schools, would much better serve those schools by ceasing to talk down their strengths and by supporting the government's initiatives in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Carr also made a point about research funding, and again, I would like to comment on that. I am talking here about higher education institutions. This government has substantially increased research funding and it has put in place mechanisms to enable universities to generate additional income. This is in addition to the specific initiatives to further encourage the participation of equity groups&mdash;again, this is a term that Senator Carr loves using&mdash;in higher education, such as the provision of up to 4,000 merit equity scholarships. I do hope that you understand what this means. It means that students who are extremely bright, who do very well in their secondary school career and who may 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not have the means to go on to a tertiary education will then be able to access one of these 4,000 merit equity scholarships, and go on to achieve a university degree.</PARA>

As for your allegations that `it's only the rich and thick' who will occupy university places in the future, you are wrong. In addition, you know very well that the fee&hyphen;paying places are capped at a certain percentage of university intake and there will never be a very high proportion of fee&hyphen;paying students. The places at university will be occupied by students who have won those places on merit or who have got there by the usual processes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, for Senator Carr to be talking about devoting half of the half&hyphen;hour that he had to factional issues and devoting the rest of the half&hyphen;hour to what Senator Conroy derisively called a mickey mouse portfolio&mdash;and you'll live to regret that, Senator Conroy&mdash;is something that I find very difficult to believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, I would like to turn to youth unemployment. I mention here, particularly, two initiatives that the government has put forward since the new year, which will help to deal with the unfortunately very large numbers of youth unemployed that we have had in this country as a legacy of Labor's mismanagement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, I turn to the work for the dole scheme. Senator Carr, in his terms of reference, talked about regional and rural areas and this is something that is particularly close to me as I come from a rural area. It is in regional and rural areas that we have seen some of the worst features of Labor government mismanagement over 13 years and very high levels of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The pilot programs that will be introduced for the work for the dole scheme will have between 20 and 30 pilot schemes in those very regional and rural areas with very high 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="739"> levels of unemployment, and it is expected that several thousand young people will work on projects under these pilots. It has been emphasised by the opposition in these last few days that this is a draconian scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the start, as a way of implementing this scheme, we are going to call for submissions from local communities that wish to undertake projects which involve partnerships between local government; service bodies such as Apex, Rotary and Lyons; local business; local welfare groups such as the Salvation Army; and young people. People will not be made to do this. It is for people who want to work on these sorts of projects and for organisations who want to be involved in them. It will focus on community based projects that provide direct benefits for local communities and worthwhile work experience for young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is particularly the work experience that I would like to talk about for one moment because it is this that provides training. Some of these projects will include a training element and, at the end of it, the young people who participate in this scheme may very well have had the training that enables them to go out and recommend themselves to an employer. It is the first foot on the rung of the ladder.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not only that, the pilot scheme that will be worked out to enable them to experience real work in a real work situation will help install a work ethic in young people and it will enable them to receive that first&hyphen;hand work experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the long&hyphen;term unemployed young people that we spoke to during the inquiry into the causes of long&hyphen;term unemployment with the Senate committee talked about the fact that they would leave school, they would not be able to get a job and as two, three, four, five years went on, their sense of worthlessness and inadequacy simply increased. By getting a place in either the work for the dole scheme or in one of our other major projects, the green corps, many of these young people will be able to get the sort of work experience 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that will enable them to then get a job later on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The target group for the work for the dole scheme, as I said, is particularly young unemployed people, particularly the longer term unemployed. But there will be some scope to include older age groups in the pilot stage. Rather than slave labour, again as the opposition has pointed out, the participants will be paid at the relevant award rate for their age, and their hours worked per week will be the equivalent of their dole payment. We will be releasing some more details of that in the weeks to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last thing I would like to deal with is, again, another dramatic initiative&mdash;the green corps. This provides great work experience for people who are interested in environmental and heritage conservation. Again, it is particularly aimed at young people between the ages of 17 and 20. The participants in the program will receive a weekly payment of $206.65 based, I hasten to assure the opposition, on the federal national training award level C and on-the-job training, since you are so interested in that, in a wide range of skills. They will work full time for 26 weeks with an option to extend to 52 weeks. The funding for this program is $41.6 million over three years. In the first year of the program, it is expected that 440 young people will have commenced a 26-week placement on a green corps project with 240 places completed. In 1997-98, it is expected that 1,360 places will have commenced with 1,260 places completed. In 1998-99, 2,000 places are expected to be available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, one of the green corps pilot projects in Victoria is based around the town of Macedon. Certainly, there is great scope in that electorate of Burke for the sorts of job opportunities and training in the environmental area that this particular program will present. In contrast to the Working Nation programs, these projects must provide real environmental and heritage conservation outcomes, and they should exhibit a very clear community focus. Training, I assure you, Senator Conroy, will be given in skills relevant to the above projects.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think all Senator Troeth has done is indulge in a point scoring exercise with Senator Carr. I have yet to hear any commitment, any outline or any detail of policies for sustainable employment opportunities for young unemployed Australians from this government in this debate or, in fact, since we began sitting this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Troeth was concerned that Senator Carr did not address the specific points in today's general business motion, I will assure her and her colleagues that I will apply my attention to each point, (a) through to (e), starting with the first one; that is, the government's `unwillingness to address concerns of the higher education community about the problem of declining demand for university courses, particularly in regional Australia, resulting from increased Higher Education Contribution Scheme charges'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly this government stands condemned for two reasons. The first is its absolute lack of commitment to providing and adequately funding universal public education at whatever level in this country&mdash;primary, secondary or tertiary. The second reason is that this government went to the election in March with very clear policy objectives in the area of education, specifically higher education. They were not going to cut Austudy, and what did they do? The independent age is up from 22 to 25 years and more stringent eligibility criteria were applied. They were not going to cut operating grants and what did they do? They instituted $600 million worth of operating grants cuts over the next three years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Shame, indeed. What else did they promise? No fees and charges increases. Look at HECS. We have gone from an annual payment of $2,300 per annum right up to, in some cases, $5,500 per year for some courses. I am not surprised at a report that in fact only arrived in my office today called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Swindler's List</EMPHASIS> . It is by the Geelong Association of Students. They point out some fascinating facts about Austudy and HECS repayment schedules. They ask:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did you know that if you take out an Austudy supplement you could get an additional $70 per week but you could be paying $70 per week to the government for the rest of your life.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So when Senator Abetz, as an example, stands up in this place, as he did yesterday, and talks about intergenerational equity and how we should not burden the young Australians of today or tomorrow with debt, be it debt in the form of a budget deficit, he overlooked the fact that this government has imposed a greater amount of debt on its students and on its young people than any other government beforehand. Not only have they increased HECS charges and fees, but of course from next year we will also see the operation of up&hyphen;front and full-cost fees for some courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How dare Senator Troeth stand up here and talk about choice in education in this country! Choice went out of the window when education was linked to your ability to pay. When it is your bank balance and not your brains that counts, there is no choice. Even the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) conceded in the debate last year that in fact there would be people who could not take advantage of an up-front, full-cost fee option. How could they? People cannot automatically take out $30,000 at the beginning of a year and then enrol in a course accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Troeth mentioned that education has not changed that much since she was studying. I am so glad that she had the advantage of a merit based scholarship. Many of her colleagues&mdash;in fact, many people in this chamber&mdash;had the advantage of publicly funded education, be it under Whitlam or beforehand. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="741">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Our education sector has undergone the most radical reforms in its history&mdash;and only in the last few months. So for Senator Troeth to suggest otherwise shows that she is not up to date with this portfolio. Last year the threshold at which graduates begin to repay their HECS debt was reduced from average weekly earnings to 27 per cent below average weekly earnings. This means that graduates' debts kick in by the time they reach a salary of around $22,000 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already had research in this place from NATSEM that demonstrates, for example, that women are three times less likely to repay their HECS debts by the age of 30 than men. We have seen that it is the traditionally disadvantaged groups in our community that cannot enter into and participate in higher education or any other education institutions if faced with the prospect of up&hyphen;front and full cost fees. In fact, HECS, up&hyphen;front, full cost, non-award or postgraduate fees all act as a psychological and financial disincentive to enter the higher education system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am glad that Senator Troeth knows a few details about the scholarship system that is to be applied over the next  few years, because the rest of us are still waiting for clarification as to how that scheme will operate. Will it be based on merit? Will it be based on a person's socioeconomic status? As to the 4,000 scholarships over four years for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, as I have already said, whoop&hyphen;de&hyphen;do. According to research from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander higher education network, the chance of getting a scholarship to a university such as Sydney University is one in 4,000. So I have to seriously question the government's commitment to access and equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of reduced enrolments, the figures speak for themselves. I mentioned in this place the other day that the decline in the total number of university applications was three per cent in Queensland; five per cent in Western Australia; six per cent in Victoria; six per cent in New South Wales; seven per cent in South Australia; and eight per cent in Tasmania. We have glaring evidence that enrolment applications have sunk. How dare Senator Troeth talk about a last-minute 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> increase in mature age applications. There could be nothing but an increase in mature age applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the applications made by mature age students to higher education institutions around the country. As at the close of applications, they had fallen by 12 per cent in South Australia, 13 per cent in Victoria, 15 per cent in Tasmania, 17 per cent in Western Australia and 19 per cent in New South Wales. Let us hope there was a last&hyphen;minute increase in mature age applications because mature age students have certainly been hit hardest by many of these so-called reforms which are basically a radical restructuring of our education system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of the motion before the chamber deals with the complete abrogation of the government's responsibility to ensure an adequate supply of science and engineering graduates. I now turn to the areas in which enrolment applications have declined. There is clear evidence of a trend of a decline in engineering and science courses across the nation. I am not quite sure where Senator Troeth is getting her figures from. In my home state we need only look at the types of courses and the types of subjects being affected. They include nursing, education, business studies and Aboriginal studies, with science and engineering courses being the hardest hit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe this continuing decline can be attributed to increased fees and charges. Despite pledges from both the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr McGauran) and the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs to review the new HECS system if there was a decline in enrolments or if it was seen to have an adverse impact on those particular courses, we have seen little action. Mr McGauran conceded last year that HECS had the potential to act as a disincentive to students pursuing science based courses and careers. They were his exact words. But we are yet to see any action from either minister in this particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know what we have seen from both ministers: a purported concern about the drop in science enrolments and young people pursuing science based careers. It seems that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="742"> Mr McGauran blamed the schools while Senator Vanstone blamed the universities. They are probably chasing tails and blaming each other at the moment. Still, there is a lack of action while they indulge in their political point scoring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The market drive to reduce funding and to seek accountability must be balanced with the pursuit of excellence and the quest for knowledge&mdash;something we in this country seem to have forgotten. Important discoveries in the areas of science and engineering may not be immediately useful or marketable. In fact, new technologies and ideas occur in a historical context. Incremental developments make the foundation upon which major advances can occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the art of creativity and the nurturing of creative people upon which science and technology of course rely do not always march to the regular beat of a financial drum and short-term economic timetables. The research path in itself, by its very nature, is unpredictable. Therefore, there must be a balance which recognises the value of science and technology, teaching and research, and the long-term benefits that follow from healthy and vibrant research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Make no mistake: the significant challenges of the future are within our lifetimes and require our urgent attention. The Democrats understand the possible consequences of global warming, pollution in our cities, population increases, emergent diseases, environment degradation, et cetera. These are all issues which we should be addressing through research, teaching and education, and by social change based on the results of new science and technology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, by understanding these challenges, we will be better able to identify the relevant considerations that we have as a nation and to implement workable solutions. This is founded on the idea that persuasive solutions should be based on evidence tested by experience. Education has a significant role to play in addressing a general understanding of modern science and technology and in preparing the community for the complex legal and ethical solutions generated by the introduction of technology&mdash;again, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other issues which we will have to grapple with not only as a parliament but also as a nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At present, education fails to adequately prepare the general community for a world which is dominated by the consequences and the products of science and technology. This, in part, can be changed by a serious commitment from the government to support and fund innovative science programs in schools and to create a vital research community. We have seen from this government only a token gesture in this regard. I think an additional $12 million over the next three years is going into a program designed to encourage young people to pursue science at school. But $12 million over three years is not going to address or arrest the dramatic decline we have seen in science enrolments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The falling interest in schools' base science subjects and falling university applications show not only that this measure is necessary and it is a good and small start, but that it is certainly not going to be enough. A strong and vibrant research community that has adequate funding and a long-term perspective will attract young people because they will see that there is an opportunity to pursue excellence and their imagination. We should also ensure that there is sufficient training through schooling and university to provide the passion, intellect and imagination for this research excellence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As science and technology spokesperson for the Democrats, as well as higher education and employment spokesperson, I am inundated all the time with letters, e-mail and faxes from students who are currently studying science or thinking about science based careers but are unsure about their future. For example, last week I received an e-mail from Chris Wilkinson, a PhD student in astrophysics, nearing the end of his studies. Chris set out a number of examples facing young scientists. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I personally, and many of my colleagues, are now at the point that we cannot encourage school leavers to go into science without seriously warning them about the conditions they face. The message needs to get out that science is definitely not vocational, that they should expect to have to branch out when they finish, and that generally 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="743"> does not lead to research. In that case serious thought should be made to choosing something more vocational, such as computing. Research is extremely hard to get into, and the conditions they face there are appalling and I think exploitative. They will be underpaid, unvalued and overworked and after a few years will quite likely have to get out of it and do something else, at which point you have to consider the worth of it all.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Even the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, has announced some assistance for science and engineering, realising the potential loss of skills in Victorian institutions&mdash;both science based institutions as well as universities and schools&mdash;in the near future. He understands that Victoria will suffer as a result of such losses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also pleased to note that Senator Troeth mentioned the initiative of the Victorian Minister for Education, Mr Honeywood. I believe he set up a committee designed to investigate&mdash;and, hopefully, stop and make recommendations about&mdash;the drawing away of young people from science and science based careers. It is something that has been echoed by a former minister in the South Australian government, Mr Bob Such, who argues that his federal colleagues have inflicted a double whammy on his state and on students and aspiring students, not only through HECS debts but, of course, through institutional funding cuts. He was particularly concerned about science.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to note that even Senator Vanstone has recently acknowledged in the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Science and engineering are vitally important faculties at universities . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So perhaps Senator Vanstone and Mr McGauran could stop blaming each other and come up with some recommendations as to how we can protect the interests of science and science graduates. Creating an environment in which science and technology flourishes is in all our interests and will draw young people to those careers as well as create solutions for the future. By failing to act now, the government is, indeed, as per the words of the motion in front of us today, abrogating its responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn to part (c)&mdash;reduction of training and labour market programs. Again, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Troeth trumpeted the coalition's two initiatives&mdash;two big initiatives, apparently. I am surprised that she referred to the work for the dole scheme as an initiative because it has to be one of the oldest solutions for a very modern and growing problem, that of unemployment. I was particularly disappointed this week to hear this government talk about a work for the dole scheme and to dredge up this anachronistic idea to the problem that we are dealing with.</PARA>

I have never seen a member of this government do anything except portray young people in this place with stereotypic and negative ideas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We only have to examine the treatment of young people in the last week. Let us look at this parliament and let us look at the example that Senator Troeth put forward. Let us look at the way the media has portrayed young people in the work for the dole debate. Have you seen a newspaper story on this accompanied with any image apart from young people with surfboards or skateboards?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seasonally adjusted figures out today show that 27.3 per cent of 15- to 19-year-olds are looking for work. That means that 88,500 15- to 19-year-olds are looking for work and cannot get it. The inference that this government and other members draw on occasions is that young people are sitting at home. They are not looking for work&mdash;they are watching TV and they are having a ball. Life's a beach for young Australians! Well, it is not. Not when we are looking at incredibly staggeringly high levels of youth employment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="744">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does this government do? It comes up with two paltry initiatives. It scraps 107,000 places from labour market programs and other education, training and employment placement areas and comes up with a green corps. A total of 240 places will be provided in 1996-97 through the green corps for young Australians. Even then you have to get in on merit and you can only be aged 17 to 20. It will be funded at $41  million over three years. How token can we get in this nation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a Democrat I would support environmental initiatives, environmental industries or anything in that area. We are desperate for those kinds of solutions. We are desperate for sustainable and long&hyphen;term job opportunities for people in this country. Not only is this a token gesture but, again, the government has broken a promise. They said that the green corps would be funded at $68 million over three years, it would be open to 17- to 25-year-olds, it would not be accessed on merit and that young people who were interested in environmental initiatives could apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about the work for the dole scheme? I do not know why this government persists with the assumption that young people need to be compelled to work. The irony is that young people are looking for work. They want work. Many of them have amazing education and training qualifications. Even if those who do have degrees and are seeking entry into the work force get in, graduate starting salaries are at an all time low. So why compel people? People do not need compulsion. The fact is that the jobs are not out there. I have heard nothing from this government as to how they are going to start creating jobs for young people or for anyone in this community. Let us not forget that while young people are a specific group, there are other groups&mdash;unemployed people in this nation&mdash;who have been treated badly by this government and former governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston might like to get up after me and explain his initiatives for sustainable environmental industries, high technology fields, valued added manufacturing. Maybe he would like to talk about how we are going to create the jobs of the future&mdash;and I mean meaningful jobs. I am not talking about short- 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">term, ad hoc, stopgap measures designed to keep young people occupied while they receive their benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another thing people seem to forget about dole recipients and those people in receipt of social security benefits is that there already are elements of compulsion involved, there already are mutual responsibilities that have to be met. People are now filling in dole diaries and they have to be answerable to employer contact units and other measures that are designed indeed to&mdash;if only Senator Troeth were here&mdash;blame the victim. It implies that young people are not trying hard enough when in fact they are trying, yet the jobs are not there for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government talks about the benefits of low inflation, business confidence and balanced budgets as the way to restore substantial jobs growth. Unfortunately, the Treasury forecast for unemployment at 8.25 per cent by June this year is way off the mark. Even private sector forecasters suggest that unemployment could be as high as nine per cent by even midyear. That is based on current laws and current initiatives and other regulatory measures by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The recent Westpac and Melbourne Institute index shows a drop in consumer confidence, and the DEETYA indicator shows an employment decline. The recent revelations about the need for further budget cuts suggest that a balanced budget may be some way off. Even if the Treasurer, Mr Costello, is so interested in and committed to a deficit reduction strategy, as we all are&mdash;all Democrats support a reduced budget deficit but not at the expense of the economy and not so that we create environmental and intellectual deficits in the future&mdash;why not create jobs? I understand that an increase in the jobs rate of one per cent would knock $1.5 billion off our deficit. So we do seem to be approaching it from another perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what has happened to labour market programs in this country? Senator Vanstone has suggested&mdash;indeed, Senator Troeth pursued this line as well&mdash;that the labour market programs LEAP and REEP, the landcare and regional environmental programs that existed under the former government, admittedly, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="745"> were not working and that projects like LEAP, REEP or others did not necessarily have positive outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not entirely uncritical of some of the labour market programs that existed, but Working Nation and the concept behind it were short lived before this government cut Working Nation. Why not take the best bits and get rid of the worst bits as opposed to making the massive cuts&mdash;$1.4 billion worth of cuts&mdash;to labour market programs that were made. LEAP and REEP may be defined as being so-called unsuccessful because they had around only a 45 per cent success rate, but the 14,000 LEAP placements in 1995 meant that around 6,000 young people still went on to further education, training or employment. So even if we define that as an unsuccessful program, at least 6,000 people still benefited from that program. LEAP and REEP were expected to help 75,000 young people and unemployed people over the next three years, and we have replaced that with the green corps, which is expected to help 3,500 people over the same period&mdash;that is, assuming we meet the government's targets, but so far the green corps has failed in its objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For 15- to 20-year-olds the labour market programs LEAP, REEP, NWOs, jobtrain, accredited training for youth, the special intervention program, skillshare and job club have all been abolished with a total loss of youth labour market placements of over 120,000. Over 120,000 places have been lost. When we weigh that up against the green corps and the work for the dole so-called initiatives, we start to see exactly what we are doing to unemployed people, including long-term unemployed people and young unemployed people, in this country. These programs were directed towards providing young Australians with training and access to employment. And yes, they did have varying degrees of success, but we should have built on their success&mdash;not slash them because the government simply thought that, because it was a new government, it should put its ideological stamp on government programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So far the government's responses to youth unemployment have been indeed problematic and disappointing. I resent the implication that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Democrats, including me, are knocking this for the sake of knocking it. We are coming up with strategies, just as we have in alternative budget proposals since 1977, for job creation, for sustainable industries. We have been coming up with strategies&mdash;yes, for budget deficit reduction but we also balance that against the needs and the wellbeing of the community, especially young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will turn to part (d) of the motion which relates to the lack of sustainable policies. I think I have already addressed this in part, but the centrepiece of this government's budget must be&mdash;and I hope it will be&mdash;some positive plans for addressing unemployment. They can consider a range of issues, including export assistance programs, research and development&mdash;again, something that was massively slashed in the last budget&mdash;small business incentives, regional development initiatives, tax reform, infrastructure programs and, of course, environmental repair programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to see the government embark on a community discussion about how we can solve this problem. We recognise that there has been a massive structural and technological change in our work force. The traditional jobs for young Australians do not exist anymore. Traditional entry level jobs have disappeared. For that reason it is time to start reassessing how we define work, the nature of work, in our community. Maybe that does mean talking about issues that the minister ruled out in question time the day before yesterday&mdash;job sharing, working hours, leisure, the contribution of those who are unpaid in the home, assessing different ways of how we work, income distribution. There is a range of other issues. Instead of ruling them out, at least talk about them and involve the community in these discussions before instantly dismissing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment should be the major focus for this government. Unfortunately, it is not. There are economic reasons but there are also social, personal, psychological and health costs of unemployment in this nation. If we really care about our community, we must address unemployment as a priority.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="746">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last part of Senator Carr's motion before us today relates to the government's failure to defend public education. This is where I have a go at both sides. Unfortunately, although Senator Carr moved this motion, and it is one with which we agree, the process of pursuing user&hyphen;pays education both at a secondary level and at a higher education level, specifically the introduction of HECS and the deregulation of post-graduate fees, occurred under the last government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats have always supported and defended a universally accessible and publicly funded higher education system. It has been a part of our policy since we began in 1977 and we have voted against every attempt to impose and increase fees for education in this country&mdash;the HEAC in 1986, HECS in 1988, postgraduate fees all through the 1980s and 1990s. We opposed Austudy loans, we opposed reductions in the threshold at which graduates begin to repay their HECS debts and of course last year we maintained that opposition in relation to the radical and truly regressive reforms to higher education introduced by the new government. So it saddens me to acknowledge that the mover of this motion is a member of a party that began this process, one that was severely and radically entrenched by the government before us today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we really care about education in this country, we should start to treat it as an investment and not as a cost. It is part of the solution to the economic ills of the day; it is certainly not a contributing factor. I will, as long as I am in this place, continue to oppose attacks on a publicly funded education system at whatever level. I think it is getting increasingly harder, and I have to say that it was pretty heartbreaking last year to see the ultimate edge of the wedge, if you like: the introduction of up&hyphen;front and full cost fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt&mdash;all the evidence and research backs us up on this one&mdash;that those fees are a disincentive, especially for traditionally disadvantaged groups. After Whitlam opened up access to higher education after the abolition of tertiary fees in 1974, we saw an increase in participation rates of those traditionally disadvantaged groups&mdash;Aboriginal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and Torres Strait Islander people, students with disabilities, women, people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. A vital component in that was student financial assistance, whether it was TEAS back then or Austudy and Abstudy as it is now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in the last few weeks I cannot imagine that there are many people in this place or in the other chamber who have not been inundated with calls from families, individuals, students and aspiring students as a result of the actual means test in the Austudy provisions. The confusion that the actual means test has resulted in has meant that some families have taken their students out of education at both the secondary and the higher education level. That evidence is available and it is heartbreakingly true.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the combination of student financial assistance and the abolition of fees does ensure that people in our society have access to education&mdash;the one guarantee in this new modern work force for employment opportunities, and we have almost shut the door completely on an accessible and publicly funded education system. So the students who were responsible for the Geelong association paper entitled `The Swindler's List'&mdash;quite good, I thought&mdash;acknowledge that you can get in only on your ability to pay. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this motion, I highlight that I will be focusing on the points related to employment. Given the criticism that was made of Senator Carr by Senator Troeth earlier, perhaps I should also highlight that the opposition decided that, so we could comprehensively cover all the points, we would focus on different areas. So I wish to put that point on the record against the criticism made by Senator Troeth that Senator Carr did not adequately cover all points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to indicate an apology on behalf of Senator Crowley. Because several of the speakers have taken advantage of the last opportunity they will ever have under the standing orders to speak for a full half an hour, she has had to leave the chamber and will not be able to cover the points on higher education that she was intending to cover.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="747">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, for my part, as I have indicated, I will focus on those points related to employment, which I think we have all acknowledged is an issue that has been identified as one of the most important issues on the political agenda of the day. In relation to this motion, I want to highlight the failure of the token Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, to adequately defend or administer those key aspects of this most critical portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to Senator Vanstone as the `token minister' because of the treatment of her and other women within this parliament, within the cabinet, within the Liberal Party. The retiring sex discrimination commissioner, Sue Walpole, said that, while she was retiring for personal reasons, she was concerned about the government's poor record on women's policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at a couple of recent examples of that. We do not have to go beyond today's question time to find a beautiful example of how this government really is in the picket fence era of the 1960s. In question time Senator John Herron referred to Gabi Hollows as a potential adornment&mdash;adornment&mdash;to his portfolio. For heavens sake! Yesterday, in a TCF industry forum in the Great Hall in Parliament House, I and several other women attending that forum were offended by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr John Moore. He quite rightly acknowledged his wife's presence at the forum and her expertise in fashion, but also added how the rest of us should think about taking our wives along, too. That is a little bit difficult, I am afraid. Once again they are back in the 1960s, for heavens sake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone's problems may not just relate to her gender; they may also relate, as has been mentioned earlier by Senator Troeth, to some factional problems she has within the Liberal Party. I must say that `faction' was the word she used, not me. Many have already mentioned the preferment problem she faces with respect to the Kemp brothers and the allocation of the responsibility for the `new great initiative of work-for-the-dole' given to Dr Kemp rather than to her.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I go on to some points on employment related issues in this motion, I would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> like to digress just for a moment to the points made by Senator Stott Despoja. I note that Senator Alston is here in the chamber at the moment. In the past, he has referred to my perhaps having delusions of grandeur. I would rather be a little bit more humble at the moment and refer to some of my beginnings, some of my history, and say quite seriously that I do not believe that I would be here today if, as a mature age student, I did not have access to Austudy. Following her points, I am pretty sure that I would have thought three, four, five times over the issues if I had faced increases that are currently before us within the community in the HECS charges. I am pretty sure I would not be here today under those circumstances, even with delaying the stage of having a family until a fair bit later than most people do within the community. I think that that further education problem would have probably been too much for me to stumble over as a young woman hoping and aspiring for an education and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I sympathise with Senator Vanstone because of all these problems that she faces. I understand the difficulties. I see the 1960s aura that pervades this place and the verbiage of many of her fellow ministers. But, unfortunately, despite her having all of these problems, we do have to recall that she still is responsible for a very significant and important portfolio. The results of her failure are thousands of extra Australians unable to find work, particularly the long-term unemployed and the young. In a moment I will detail the report card on this token minister in the areas of training and labour market programs and sustainable policies to protect the long-term unemployed&mdash;areas that she is alleged to have ministerial responsibility for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a clearly identified community insecurity regarding employment issues: insecurity about work, insecurity about the future of work and insecurity about retaining work under the new Workplace Relations Act. Underlying this uncertainty are, to be fair, the sweeping structural changes that have been occurring in the international economy. We have had to undergo dramatic change in response to these changes. This has resulted 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="748"> in significant structural employment change in the country. Many workers now need to learn new skills and require assistance to put them back on the path to employment.</PARA>

If the minister has difficulty with my referring to notes, then perhaps he should examine his own problems rather than mine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me refer to the problems that this country has faced under the structural employment changes that have occurred. Many workers now need to learn new skills and they require assistance to put them back on to the path of employment. Australia has abundant natural and human resources. We are located in a dynamic region which is experiencing tremendous growth. With the correct policies and priorities, we have the capacity to achieve higher growth, higher employment, better quality employment and improved living standards. Labor, when in government, recognised this and crafted policies to provide training and support programs for those in need and for those suffering from the problems associated with structural reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This concept seems to have eluded Minister Vanstone and the coalition government who have participated in the obliteration of many needed programs. The token minister has waffled and bungled her way through $1.8 billion of funding cutbacks of many innova 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tive and effective training and employment programs. Many of these programs enabled the long&hyphen;term unemployed to find work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These programs were not failures, as Senator Stott Despoja has already highlighted, but the government has been attempting to portray them as such, expecting high success rates from programs targeted at particular problem groups such as long-term unemployed. Frankly, one long&hyphen;term unemployed person&mdash;out of five&mdash;put into a sustainable job is better than none, as often occurs in places such as Britain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will detail the specific labor programs that the Howard government and Minister Vanstone have presided over. The Howard government and Minister Vanstone have presided over. There is the jobskills program and the landcare and environment action program. Now, of course, we have the Green Corps&mdash;a scheme that has $3.3 million in funding in the year 1996-97 compared with the $90 million landcare and environment action program, LEAP, funded under Labor. There will be 3,500 people entering the Green Corps program compared with 13,000 people who went through LEAP in one year. That is a very big difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja raised another very important point in relation to the Green Corps, and that was merit. How on earth do we determine merit for a Green Corps program? Are we going to analyse people's views on what is green? Will that get them entry? Is it their academic record? Is it their job seeking record?</PARA>

Being a Liberal Party staffer and prepared to say the right thing on television at the right time might be useful. Who knows? We certainly have not heard, and God only knows when we ever will.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I digress. Let me continue to the other programs that have been abolished: the new work opportunities program, the jobtrain program, the special intervention program, the accredited training for youth program&mdash;the minister will excuse me while I read this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="749"> list&mdash;the skillshare program, the formal training elements and the direct assistance elements of the training for Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders program, or TAP, the job clubs program that Senator Stott Despoja has already mentioned, and the mobility assistance scheme. The way the government is going to encourage mobility is to more strongly exert the threat to remove any benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The net effect of the minister's efforts in abolishing all of these programs is nearly 27,000 extra long&hyphen;term unemployed. Long&hyphen;term unemployment levels have shown no improvement under this minister. Contrast this with the Labor government which, in trend terms, provided 32 consecutive months of decline in the number of long&hyphen;term unemployed. In fact, it is predicted that long&hyphen;term unemployment will increase under the Howard government's policies, according to forecasts by the minister's own department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So now, when the minister effectively sabotages the chances of those people finding work, where do they go for additional assistance? Do they use Dynamo to remove the stain after today's question time? No, they go to the CES. But this will be cut, too. The minister has the Employment Placement Enterprise to rely upon. This will regulate the private sector providers of programs currently provided by the CES but&mdash;surprise again&mdash;it is likely that the EPE will not even have the resources or the capacity to adequately regulate these programs. But the minister need not worry if these service providers charge high fees at a much higher rate in real terms than the CES when it provided the services, because the one&hyphen;stop shop, the new one&hyphen;stop shop, will refer only the unemployed who have been so for more than 12 months. So there will be less to provide a service to, even if those services are going to cost more.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What will they do when they cannot refer them to these providers? What will they do? It appears now that the interventions are focusing on grammar. I am disappointed that the government does not find more substance on which to comment. Obviously, employment assistance is going to be reduced by the new measures applied to the CES and this is particularly going to affect young people. One of the much vaunted concerns of this government is youth unemployment. In 1983, Labor faced Mr Howard's youth unemployment level of 158,000. By February 1996, it had cut it to 87,000. Labor's Working Nation program was working. It was reducing the numbers of our young unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet the Howard government has added a token $160 million to the amount allocated to youth training and apprenticeship schemes; this can only be considered in the context of the impact of the $1.8 billion worth of labour market programs that have been abolished. The outcome has been no decrease in the total level of youth unemployment since the minister took office. I wonder, therefore, what the minister would say to her Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who, just prior to the election, said at the National Press Club:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would be a very disappointed man if I had not made serious inroads into the level of youth unemployment in this country because I would like to see our performance in this area as being the mark of what we have been able to do as a Government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I hope it is. I hope we face the next election with that as the key test. Senator Vanstone will be able to report that she has, indeed, made serious inroads&mdash;inroads in the wrong direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me refer to the other figures that were released today. Two sets of government data, released this morning, gave contrary indications of what was happening on youth unemployment. We had the minister refer in question time to the ABS data, but data released by the Department of Social Security shows an amazingly sharp jump of 9.1 per cent&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="750"> that is, 3,050 young people&mdash;in the number of young people receiving dole payments. The Department of Social Security's figures suggest that any improvement the government hoped to get from its work for the dole scheme has been wiped out in one month. At the moment, the government's policy on youth unemployment is a case of running up and down on the spot. It is not going anywhere. And it criticised the Labor government for a lack of real jobs. To date, we have not heard of any real jobs in this work for the dole program. No real jobs have been highlighted at all.</PARA>

The minister is defending the South Australian vehicle industry&mdash;this minister from South Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Putting up dodgy work for the dole schemes in an attempt to conceal Senator Vanstone's problems and perhaps Senator Woods's failures is not the answer. The scheme betrays the unemployed. Senator Troeth seemed to be indicating that compulsion was not really 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> going to be a factor in these schemes. She also criticised Mr Ferguson for describing some of the characteristics of long-term unemployed people who she herself accepted suffer from a lack of worth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Ferguson was criticised for describing these problems of young people who would go home and spend the rest of the week watching television. I personally know what that is like, having suffered from an incident of severe depression when I was at school. It is not much fun going home, getting into bed and watching television. As Senator Stott Despoja pointed out, young people do not find this much fun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not a criticism of young people that Mr Ferguson was making; it was a description of what happens to them when they suffer the lack of worth associated with long-term unemployment. It is no compliment to Senator Troeth that she cannot see this connection. In fact, it is no compliment to the government as a whole that during question time they attempted to score points on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work for the dole scheme sets those who work against those who do not. That is what it is really about. Senator Vanstone has failed to help the unemployed and is now seeking to stigmatise them.

There could be some debate as to whether there was an advantage or a benefit arising from a matter that he created and a matter that had been debated some time before. He used the forms of the Senate I believe to create an issue for his benefit and maybe to the detriment of a number of my colleagues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation arose when a number of us were attending a committee meeting of the Senate.

When we look at the register of interests, the lowest one in the register seems to be about $100.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;As I have done on two previous occasions when issues concerning woodchips have been debated in the Senate, I declare that I hold shares in Boral Ltd, which has an interest in woodchips. I make this brief statement because, when a disallowance motion moved by Senator Brown was voted on in the Senate on 6 February, I did not declare this shareholding at that time, al 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="752"> though I had done so, as I say, on two previous occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason that I did not was that, like Senator Watson, I had rushed into the division from I think a committee meeting on the other side of the building. Quite frankly, I was not clearly aware of the subject matter on which I was voting when the division occurred. I think that is something that we all find we are subject to on very frequent occasions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I subsequently learned that it had been a division on a woodchip issue, I thought that my two declarations on similar occasions late last year might suffice for a declaration on this occasion. However, it is now quite clear to me that this is not sufficient within the terms of procedural standing order 17(5). So I now set the record straight by repeating for the third time that I hold some shares in Boral Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like Senator Watson, I am very proud to hold shares in several major Australian companies. Australia is crying out for productive investment. Shares are a critically important vehicle for such investment, and I am proud to be playing at least a small part&mdash;I have to say it is a pretty small part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a couple of points I want to raise about procedural standing order 17 because I think it has certain practical problems. The first is that a senator who holds shares in a company may well not have a detailed knowledge of the activities in which the company is engaged, particularly if it is a large company, say, BHP&mdash;or for that matter a company such as Boral. It could be that a senator holds shares in a company which does have an interest in an area about which there is parliamentary debate and/or voting but to which fact he or she may be quite oblivious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second problem with procedural standing order 17 is how do you define the words `any relevant interest'? Does it mean that, if I am debating or voting on a bill dealing with company tax, fringe benefits tax or other taxes or charges on companies, I will have to get up and name every company in which I hold shares? Does it mean that if I have a bank account or savings in a superannuation fund or a mortgage on my house&mdash;as I certainly do&mdash;I have to declare all these interests 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> if I am involved in a debate or a vote on a bill that could have an impact on interest rates? Or if I own my home do I have to declare this when debating or voting on legislative measures that impact on inflation and therefore the value of my house?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do farmers have to declare their interests each and every time they debate or vote on a measure dealing with the rural sector? Do members of trade unions, in particular former officials of individual trade unions or trade union organisations&mdash;there are surely more than enough senators in that category on the other side of the chamber&mdash;have to declare this each and every time we debate industrial relations, industry superannuation funds or the other vast array of issues that affect trade unions and their membership? Should Senator Brown declare his directorship of the Australian Bush Heritage Fund every time he speaks about conservation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt whatsoever that before the Register of Senators' Interests was established in 1994, many such declarations of interest should have been made when relevant matters were being debated or voted in the Senate. Since 1994 we have had a Register of Senators' Interests, which is a public document, available for the world at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder whether this register should not be regarded as a sufficient declaration of interest for the purposes of debate and vote in the Senate, unless of course relevant assets are not disclosed in the register because they are owned by a trust, the assets and liabilities of which have not been listed in the register.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I use the word `wonder' deliberately because I do not have a firm view of what is the best course of action. But I do think there are real questions in respect of procedural standing order 17 that should be examined. For that reason I wish to use this occasion to request the President to give consideration to referring procedural standing order 17 to the Committee of Senators' Interests for examination and report in light of the three years experience we now have of the operation of the Register of Senators' Interests and of the operation of that procedural standing order.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senators will recall that one of the more public, high profile inquiries conducted by the Senate last year was the one the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee of the Senate conducted into the development import finance facility scheme&mdash;DIFF. This scheme was axed summarily upon the government coming to office and caused great consternation, concern and damage to Australia's foreign policy relations and particularly to our relations with four of the countries in our region which were in receipt of DIFF schemes&mdash;Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and China.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committee has since found unequivocal evidence that our standing has been severely damaged in those economies. It was damaged at government level because of the way in which the scheme had been axed, but it was also damaged at a commercial level. Australian companies had spent a big dollar in developing projects that would qualify under DIFF, and often they did it with the support and cooperation of joint ventures in the target country&mdash;Indonesia, China, the Philippines or Vietnam. So industrial or commercial entities in those countries had invested in the project, too. Often those projects had a gestation life of anything up to three or so years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of them&mdash;and all of this was adduced in evidence&mdash;were projects that committed to real benefits to the country, that committed priority benefits to the country often in a way in which the individual or ordinary people in that country would directly benefit. Solar 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lighting in Indonesia and training of people with disabilities in Indonesia were two good examples of that. Therefore, the damage was done as well across a much wider area. Now what we have is the government's response to the recommendations of that inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I say that the response by the government is totally inadequate. In fact, the response by the government is downright wrong or absolutely dishonest in the case of some of those responses. Let me go, for example, to the first recommendation that the government's response deals with. In many respects this is one of the key recommendations. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Majority Committee Recommendation: that all companies holding DIFF Letters of Advice at the time of termination of DIFF be processed in the normal way and that additional funds be made available in the 1996/7 and subsequent years to finance successful applications.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government have rejected that proposal and they have rejected it on the most specious of grounds. They argue that they had a clear pre-election commitment to terminate the DIFF scheme. You can argue there is some justification in that. They got elected. They said before the election that they would terminate the scheme and they certainly complied with that immediately after the election, but the majority recommendation of the committee that I have referred to which these government remarks reflect on does not mean to say that if the government does not want to terminate the scheme it cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it means to say and what it importantly recommends is that the government should do it. If it is going to proceed to do it, it should do it in a way which respects the needs of the client countries who are recipients of the benefits of the scheme and which does not damage Australia's international reputation and our foreign relation standing, particularly in this region with many of our most populous neighbours, and does not inflict financial hardship, sometimes bankruptcy, or rupture the relations between government to government in those countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had considerable evidence that if all of the schemes that had received, as the majority report says, a letter of advice&mdash;that is to say 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="754"> that they were partially qualified for the final hurdle of selection to obtain approval to proceed with the DIFF program&mdash;were allowed to go through and be tested at each point so that the criteria of final decision making would have been the same, about 30 per cent of them would have been knocked out anyway because they would not qualify. It is far better to do it that way then just cut them off at the pass without any appeal at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The others would have been schemes that would have benefited Australia, would have created jobs for Australians, would have created market opportunities for Australian companies in countries where they needed that market foothold that the scheme would promote and would lead to&mdash;the evidence here was overwhelming&mdash;follow&hyphen;on work of a commercially remunerative nature which would have enabled Australian companies to expand their operations in the longer term in these high growth economies of Indonesia and China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coastal provinces of China are growing in economic terms at around 10 per cent. Indonesia last year grew at about eight per cent. This is a major growth market. If this recommendation had been observed, it would have enabled Australian companies to position themselves to take advantage of it. As it is now, those schemes that have been cancelled will go ahead. They just will not go ahead with Australian companies; they will go ahead with Italian companies, or French companies, or German companies, or American companies, or Japanese companies. So the work that Australians have done to create these market opportunities will be taken by foreigners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The prestige that we have built up in developing these projects will finally go to some other nation, not Australia. The reputation we have given ourselves here is as unreliable partners in commercial development. To say that the government had said something vague about cutting the scheme before the election and that everyone knew that after the election it would do so and that therefore that is a mandate for cutting the scheme is I think specious. But what I think is even more specious is to say that by adopt 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ing the recommendation that I have referred to in the majority report they would be going against their own policy. They would not. They need not. They would simply have grandfathered those companies that had the opportunity to develop schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me put this in an important foreign relations context. In October 1995, the then Australian trade minister, Mr Bob McMullan, was in Beijing with the Chinese Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, Madam Wu Yi. They announced at a joint ministerial meeting a list of companies that had letters of advice. The fact that they announced it does not mean to say that those companies with letters of advice qualified. We know that. But to take a technical point that they did not qualify and therefore they can be rubbed out, which is the point the new government has taken, insults Madam Wu Yi, the trade minister for China, and causes China to lose face with those Chinese companies that were joint developing partners with the Australian companies on that list that she had published.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was understood, as those ministers announced that list publicly, that each of those companies would have a chance to present their credentials. The fact that the new government stopped them, stopped them unilaterally without appeal so they have no chance at all, is, I think, despicable. But to  pretend that we have not inflicted severe damage on our credibility and offended the Chinese, who are a major source of trade for Australia and an enduring growth economy in this region, is, I think, laughable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spent more time than I ought to in the 10 minutes I am allowed on the first recommendation. There are many others that I can comment on. The government has responded to most of the other recommendations of the Senate inquiry by saying, `Well, the Simons review is going to answer that.' The Simons review is taking a lot longer than it was intending to take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should give a long, strong, clear, reliable signal now to our major trading partners that it does intend to have a DIFF scheme and that DIFF scheme will operate from the next budget but that the details of it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="755"> will be worked out following the Simons review, not say, `Let's wait for the Simons review. Let's then decide whether we will have a DIFF scheme, whether we will have soft loans and whether we will participate in this form of aid.' That leaves the ball up in the air. Companies are undecided, not knowing what the future prospects for them will be and Australian companies will lose market opportunity to European, North American and Japanese companies in the high growth market of Asia. That is what the government should say, and I make that as a general comment on all those references to the Simons review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final recommendation goes to the minority committee recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the terms of reference of the Simons committee review of Australia's aid program be enlarged to the extent necessary to examine certain details of mixed credit arrangements such as the overall impact of the multiplier effect, flow on trade and export opportunities etc.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that was a worthwhile recommendation. The fact that the government has now declined to do that is a pity. It simply asked for there to be some econometric modelling done saying, `The Australian taxpayer in the aid program puts X number of dollars into foreign aid. What does that create in terms of trade for Australia and return to the Australian economy in exports, and what does that mean in terms of jobs created in Australia?' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the response that the government has given on the DIFF inquiry. In particular, I think it is significant to look back at the original hearing on 7 August when Senator Boswell asked a question of Mr Tripp of Ralpar, one of the companies that had taken the time to put in a submission and appear. Senator Boswell said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have told them that the Senate inquiry is like the cavalry coming over the hill to help you.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Tripp responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I did not put it quite like that, but fundamentally, yes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the inquiry took place. Many of the small business people who turned up to that inquiry saw the inquiry as being like the cavalry 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> being sent to save them, their businesses and the many outlays they had made in getting to either the formal offer or the letter of advice stage. They saw the inquiry as very significantly affecting their future. Most of the companies&mdash;not all, but most&mdash;that showed up on the day in Canberra did not come for tea and biscuits or a day in Canberra; they came because they had outlaid substantial amounts of money. They had a hope, albeit belated, in respect of what the government had said at that time. They hoped that the government might in some way change its attitude to the DIFF scheme and do as my colleague Senator Cook has just said: grandfather the scheme and at least allow those who had got to the letter of advice or formal offer stage to be totally processed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of the hearing, some 57 formal offers or letters of advice had reached particular stages in the DIFF process. Of course, these never were able to proceed. The government has driven the final nail in the coffin for these people with the answers that were tabled in the Senate last week. Some companies had outlaid as little as $50,000 in getting to the letter of advice stage. Some had outlaid from  $50,000 up to $100,000. Some had even outlaid up to a million dollars to get themselves through the first or the second stage. This is money that has just been washed straight down the drain, never to be recovered by these businesses. It is something that they can ill afford to have happen to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing is that there was an effect on jobs. Most of the businesses that appeared before that inquiry were, as I said, small businesses, businesses employing somewhere in the vicinity of five to 10 employees. In one case, a project had up to 65 subcontractors involved and employed small numbers of people. What the impact on those people has been I do not know. One of the important recommendations that the government has since rejected was that the government look at putting forward another mixed credit scheme. It is quite clear that, if Australia is to be competitive in the region, we will need a mixed credit scheme which can support small business operations and allow them to get a foothold, as the DIFF scheme allowed many 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="756"> small businesses in Australia to get a foothold in the South&hyphen;East Asian region. The responses by the government are totally inadequate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bill's career took him to some interesting places before he came to the Senate. He was employed as a field medical assistant based at Lufa about 80 kilometres from Goroka in Papua New Guinea. He was responsible for the general health of people living in an area of some 10,000 square miles in the New Guinea highlands. Because roads had penetrated little of the highlands in those days, most patrols were conducted on foot and Bill spent many weeks of his time away from his family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After some years in business in the Philippines, in 1977 Bill moved to Canberra with his wife, Ines, and their family. Like many others in the old building, he began his career in the department as a Senate attendant. In 1980, he was promoted to personnel officer, and two years later to his present position where he was responsible for the maintenance of senators' office facilities. One of his first jobs was to arrange the supply of state&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;art IBM golf ball typewriters. They were issued to senators over a period of two years strictly in order of seniority. Bill's next duty was to arrange for the supply of curtains and fridges in our offices in the old Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From those humble beginnings not so many years ago, Bill is now responsible, among other things, for the supply and maintenance of the department's 380 personal computers, 100 facsimile machines and 30 photocopiers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter that I wish to raise this evening is a matter that has just occurred in the hearings of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee looking into euthanasia. That committee had two witnesses before it who had some research funded by the taxpayers of Australia through the NHMRC. They have declined to provide us with the data of their findings on the basis that they have an agreement with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> . Whilst I fully accept that the copyright of the article clearly vests within the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> , I believe that the data, which is being funded by the people of Australia, should have been made public. I say that because I believe the information and the tactic employed may well be designed to try to gain some extra publicity for the pro&hyphen;euthanasia cause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="757">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that a survey was conducted in which Dr Kuhse, Professor Baume and others were involved. They sent out 3,000 surveys to general practitioners. They had a 64 per cent return rate. The signatures, I understand, of Professor Baume and Dr Kuhse were on the letters forwarding the survey. All of us in this place know that, when you send out surveys with a signature of the protagonist at the bottom, you will get your supporters responding. When I do electorate wide surveys signed off, let us say, as Eric Abetz, Liberal Senator for Tasmania, it stands to reason that I will get more Liberal supporters responding to that type of survey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, Professor Baume acknowledged that in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS>, volume 161, published on 18 July 1994, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The non&hyphen;respondents were less likely to agree that it is sometimes right for a doctor to take (active) steps to bring about a patient's death as shown in Table 2.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In table 2, you find that from those who voluntarily responded to the survey 59 per cent were allegedly in favour of euthanasia but it was only 18.2 per cent from the non&hyphen;respondents&mdash;a vast difference. When about one&hyphen;third of the people that you are inquiring into do not respond, it would be fair to say that the vast majority of those would be opposed to the particular cause of Professor Baume, who is the patron of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society of New South Wales, and Dr Kuhse, who is well known for her views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The suggestion is being made that these researchers compared the results with the findings of what they describe as a comparable study of `medical end of life' decisions in the Netherlands. That is wrong. I have a copy of both the Dutch findings and the survey that has just been circularised around Australia and there are some very important differences. The Dutch survey was based on actual deaths from the coroners' reports. Their survey was based on a paper survey or interview going to doctors. So one was a survey of doctors; the other was a survey of coroners' reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Dutch did a three&hyphen;point study, and it is very important that that be understood. They 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> took a three&hyphen;part design which was a sample drawn from a population of physicians, a sample drawn from all deaths and they also interviewed the physicians for some 2&half; hours. There are no personal interviews in relation to the study that is supposedly going to be released on Monday. So the methodology is completely different. When it comes to the refusal rate, the Dutch report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in order to present an estimate for the whole of the Netherlands, it is essential to know on how great a fraction of the total number of deaths the statements of the physicians in the sample are based. This latter information cannot always be obtained.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report continued further:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A minimum of several thousands of deaths need to be studied to obtain a sufficiently large number to get the important statistical data.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Dutch study claims that there is a bias in the non&hyphen;respondents. In the Dutch study, you had 15 out of 410 doctors&mdash;but, course, a whole lot more deaths being considered in those 410 doctors&mdash;but there was a non&hyphen;response rate of 2.7 per cent. In the Australian study about to be released with all the fanfare, there is a 36 per cent refusal rate&mdash;in other words, a 36 per cent rate of bias. Therefore, their bias rate will be 12 times that of the Dutch study. I hope they do not try to continue with the prospective media release, which I have, to assert that this is somehow a comparable study&mdash;because, clearly, it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The questionnaires differ also in a very material way. The Dutch only asked about the acts that doctors may have undertaken to hasten death, and they asked that in the questions, whereas the Australian survey asked, `Was death caused by one or more of the following actions or omissions?' They slip in the word `omissions'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think everybody in this chamber knows that the euthanasia debate is not about omissions but about deliberate active actions. So to slip in the words `or omissions' will undoubtedly give you a greater number saying that they have been involved in euthanasia. The question goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Was death caused by one or more of the following actions or omissions which you or a colleague 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="758"> decided to take with the explicit intention of not prolonging life or hastening the end of life?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So they lump in taking a course of action designed not to prolong life with an act of hastening the end of life, as though it is an active act to hasten the end of life. To try to say that an action is the same as an omission, to try to say that not prolonging a life is the same as hastening the end of life, is, I have to say, intellectually dishonest. I do not make that claim lightly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were denied all of this information at the Senate hearing because the witnesses wanted to go into camera. It gives me no joy to have to put this on the public record, but the simple fact is that the Senate committee and those witnesses who are about to appear before the committee tonight and tomorrow morning will be denied the right to respond on the public record to this supposed study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on these people to make available the raw data for independent examination. The editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS>, Dr Martin Van Der Weyden, tells us that the survey results would be used to support both anti and pro euthanasia arguments. In other words, it is like statistics&mdash;anybody will be able to use the survey results to try to bolster their argument. I have a funny feeling that those involved in this study may have been trying to excite some community interest in this matter. The editor also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Society's energy should be more focused on palliative care . . . where modest investments have yielded excellent results . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The media release goes on to state that Professor Michael Ashby believes that you ought to draw a distinction between a doctor causing of hastening death by stopping active treatment or by palliative interventions and administration of a lethal injection. So he makes the distinction. I seek to table this media release from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS>  entitled `Survey results provide more ammunition for euthanasia debate'.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="758"><TITLE>Communications Tower, Berkeley Vale</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over 1,000 residents have lodged objections on environmental and health grounds with the Wyong council. Two thousand preschool and primary school students attend schools within a one kilometre radius of the proposed tower. A private hospital is within the shadows of this communications tower.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="759">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a sad irony for these residents in the electorate of Dobell that they are facing this fight with Vodafone. The present member for Dobell, Michael Lee, is the former minister for communications in the last Labor government. This fight between Vodafone and the concerned community citizens stems directly from the legislation that Michael Lee, the member for Dobell, was responsible for. The ALP act exempts Vodafone and other carriers from state and local government environment, land use, general development and planning laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former Minister Lee published a code to this effect in June 1994. That national code of the last Labor government was an appalling example of window dressing. Under it, carriers were supposed to take into account environmental matters and the views of the local council. There was also the question of having the proposal to build telecommunications towers subject to arbitration by the federal environment department. What is the outcome of Labor's national code in relation to these towers? The carriers politely tell the local government and the community that they are going to proceed with construction, regardless of what they think.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Electors of Dobell in Berkeley Vale and Tumbi Umbi are furious that their local MP has left them with this time bomb to unsettle their daily lives. My colleague the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston, has replaced this window&hyphen;dressing with action. The telecommunications national code that commenced on 1 January this year has more teeth than the code that was in effect under the last Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this new code, carriers must refer to the council's telecommunications facility planning guidelines which indicate councils' preferred sites for towers. Carriers will be required to co&hyphen;locate mobile facilities on radio telecommunications towers, unless it is not technically feasible. That technical feasibility is determined by Austel. High impact facilities are to be notified to the council and, if requested, the carrier must consult with the community at public meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, these changes appear to be too late for the residents in Dobell. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> proposal for the Berkeley Vale tower was lodged with Wyong council on 17 December 1996. This means it is exempt from the tough provisions of the new coalition national code and comes under the old code of local member Michael Lee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While Michael Lee remains silent on this matter, I have initiated action to seek alternative sites in the Wyong shire. I have had discussions with Liberal Mayor, Councillor Doug Eaton, to jointly approach Vodafone. We are going to meet with local residents. We have spoken to the managing director of Vodafone, Mr John Rohan. We are going to use moral persuasion to get the carrier to reconsider this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As this carrier is currently acting under Labor's law in Berkeley Vale, there is no other way around it legally. All we can do is ask Vodafone to change the decision. I remain hopeful that we can clear up this mess left by Michael Lee not only in his own electorate but also in many other areas in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our initial contacts with Vodafone in a cooperative approach have been most promising. They have promised to revisit the question of the location of the tower. They are sending up their radio and property specialists to report within a week, and we find this to be a welcome development. People should be under no doubt that the problem of communication towers and their inappropriate locations right around Australia were caused by the code set up under the last Labor government. We are changing that and, with the procedures that will come into effect after 1 July 1996, we will get this back on a proper footing so that proper environmental concerns, proper local government concerns and proper community concerns are taken into account.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="759"><TITLE>Austudy</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to continue my remarks about the Austudy actual means test&mdash;this great bungle that the government has introduced for tertiary students around this country. I have brought into the chamber tonight the Austudy application form, which is 13 pages long if the means test does not apply to you and 17 pages long if it does. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="760"> You receive an explanatory booklet with a cartoon from Leunig. That is very apt because it has somebody developing into a plant. You probably would by the time it took you to work it all out. In fact, whoever drew the cartoon should have drawn someone turning into a stone. I can imagine how difficult the form would be for students to work out. Even accountants are having problems with it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The means test application form indicates that you will need to read the notes on pages nine to 12 of the Austudy application guide. If you need more information, those pages direct you to the 1997 Austudy information book, which is 69 pages long. The means test is explained in another booklet which is 36 pages long. No wonder people are confused. They do not understand exactly what applies or what they are required to put in terms of expenditure. The means test explained booklet states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The actual means test questions require the family or independent student (as applicable) to give a summary of their expected expenditure and savings for 1997 in the following seven categories . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then there are seven dot points: principal family home expenditure, other real estate expenditure, transport expenditure, general living expenditure, other family expenditure, financial expenditure and other investments&hyphen;education expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some cases people have put down Austudy loans as expenditure when they are not required to do so. It is very difficult to find in the booklet where you are told not to do that. As a result, where people have done it&mdash;and that has been what has ruled them out of eligibility&mdash;they have to apply for a review. Just because they have made one simple mistake, they cannot simply put in a new application. That would be the simplest thing to do. They have to apply for a review which, in some cases, can take up to six months. These people are either not able to continue their studies or not able to start them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of what you are required to put as expenditure, if you put in a figure lower than the average national benchmark expenditure figures based on the ABS household expenditure survey, the department changes it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems a bit silly to ask people to fill out this application form to identify all of these various aspects of expenditure and then at the end of the day, if the department thinks it is too low and it does not match up with the average national benchmark expenditure figures, they change them anyway. Why do they not just apply the national benchmark figures and save people a lot of time and stuffing around?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This morning on radio in Tasmania, when asked a question by the interviewer about the distress being caused by the actual means test, both in the way it is structured and the way it is administered, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We tried to modify the test to make it easier than last year's and more accurate. Last year what basically happened was the Department would take the value of your house and they would impute income from that. They'd say effectively: look, if you've got a house of that value you must have 2.5% of that around in income&mdash;and so it went. We changed that to say: no, look, let's shift as far as we can towards what people tell us their expenditure will be. But we did have a number of remaining items we wanted to keep some sort of check on&mdash;because, as you understand, while most citizens are good and honest people and would fill in a form honestly, now there are a number out there who would perhaps take advantage of self-assessment and not put the correct thing in. So we decided that we would in a sense use that same imputation arrangement against a number of these things, and it's reasonably clear to me that some of those assessments are well out of kilter . . . </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot think of a much better description, Senator Herron. Students who received Austudy last year, without any change to their income or any other changes, are finding themselves either having all of their entitlement removed and not being entitled to any Austudy or having it substantially reduced. Surely the government must take a greater course of action than 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="761"> it has by lumping a few more people to work on the hotline to take the calls. Surely you must take some course of action whereby you can alleviate these problems, because in terms of the review process&mdash;that is a 10-page document that you have to fill in, and it is supposed to take somewhere between six to eight weeks&mdash;students who have sought to enter university have to pay certain fees by 28 February. That includes the student amenities fee of $204. Also, if they have not made a decision by 31 March with regard to where they are at, they will be liable for HECS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that, I am curious to hear from the government about students who are part&hyphen;way through their courses or degrees who have done one or two years already. What happens to them when they are now ruled out by this stupid means test&mdash;it really is just a whole mess&mdash;with regard to the HECS debt that they have already accumulated? If they are not able to continue in university, does it mean that the HECS that they have accumulated thus far will be waived? What does it mean? Surely these people have some right to get information from the government and not have to wait in some phone queue to ultimately speak to people who do not have these answers. The answers to those questions are answers that only the government can supply. Departmental people cannot provide those answers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely the minister and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) have an obligation to do something. If you talk about the importance of education and an application of fairness of education to all Australians, as you have on many occasions, surely you have a responsibility to come out and indicate to people what the situation really is. It is a ridiculous set of circumstances if you do not do something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a whole range of other matters that really ought to be addressed by the government. I think that the minister, for whatever reason&mdash;I am not sure whether she understands it herself or not; it would appear that she does not&mdash;is simply not coming forward with answers. If the government does not do something about it, I think that will be reflected when these people come to vote at the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to speak about the benefits of the family tax cuts and the economic as well as the social implications following the family tax initiative and the associated family income tax cuts which operated from 1 January this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was some interesting research undertaken by the Cato Institute in the United States on the effect of reducing taxation on the economy. This research was undertaken by Stephen Moore and Dean Stansel and was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of Wednesday, 15 January. I believe that these studies can be used to endorse the government's recent measures to reduce tax for Australian families. I firmly believe that these tax cuts will be of benefit not only to the immediate families but to the economy as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two economists researched the 10 US states which had cut their taxes the most between 1990 and 1995. They then went on to compare them with the 10 US states which had actually increased their taxes the most. They found that in the ones benefiting from the tax cuts there was greater growth in employment and greater expansion of the economy; their budgets exhibited a healthier balance and their populations actually increased. Where taxes were raised, employment growth was static but where taxes were cut or reduced, there was an overall increase of 10.8 per cent in the number of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment statistics backed up this finding. Unemployment was higher in those states increasing their taxes and lower in those states decreasing their taxes. When taxes are increased the cost of producing goods and service increases. This results in higher prices and increases in the cost of family living. Family income was found to have grown by a larger 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="762"> percentage in states which reduced their tax. In fact, over that period a family of four was found to be significantly better off in the 10 states which had the greatest reductions in tax. Because of this, in the first half of this decade there was an influx of people into the low taxing states to take advantage of the economic benefits generated by the tax cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud, as you are, Madam President, to be part of a government that on 1 January this year brought in significant reductions in tax for families with dependent children. I remind others listening to this broadcast that for families with combined incomes of less than $70,000 and with one child the tax&hyphen;free threshold has been increased by $1,000, which on average will reduce their tax by $200 per year. For each additional child the income threshold for eligibility is increased by $3,000, a generous amount. Eligible families with, say, five children can expect a tax cut of $1,000 this  year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, further tax cuts are now available to eligible families who have only one source of income. Where there is a single parent or one parent chooses to stay at home to look after their under&hyphen;fives, the tax&hyphen;free threshold has been increased by $2,500. Families can expect a tax cut of $500 from this measure alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, the study by the Cato Institute which I have mentioned supports the initiatives taken by the government as a means of improving economic growth. According to that American study, interpolated into the Australian scene, we should be able to look forward to higher family incomes, greater employment, more economic growth and a better balanced budget. So Australians should benefit not just from the initial reductions in tax but from the long-term flow-on effects in</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="766" SPEAKER="Parer, Sen Warwick" NAMEID="KI4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Resources and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator Parer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) On March 19 1992 Mr David Marsh of `Allendale' near Boorowa, New South Wales, did sign an application for a grant under the National Landcare Program (NLP) in his capacity as Chairman of the Boorowa Community Landcare Group (BCLG) for establishment of a demonstration site on the main Boorowa-Cowra Road involving $19,780 of NLP funds and a group contribution of $29,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The project application provided a description of the work to be undertaken, and a copy of the application which received NLP funding will be provided direct to the Senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Departmental investigations showed that the project application was endorsed by the majority of Boorowa Community Landcare Group members. A copy of a Chairman's Report 1991-92 held in Departmental records does not specifically refer to the NLP project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Department did write to the New South Wales Department of Conservation and Land Management on 5 January 1994 seeking information on costing details. A response from the Department of Conservation and Land Management</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="767"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was received on 8 February 1994, and enclosed a copy of the Statement of Receipts and Expenditure for the project ending 5 November 1993, and a copy of the detailed Financial Statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) It is not unusual for NLP projects to be varied from the original approved project specification (i.e. the application) during the life of a project. Droughts, fires, floods, illness of project managers, etc., can all be reasons for variation of original project specifications. Underspends of grant funds can also occur as a result of effective project management (including use of innovative techniques).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Systems are in place to ensure that, where project variations occur, documentation is in place to support any continued funding of the project. In addition, Audited Statements are used by NLP program administrators to ensure that unexpended funds are recovered as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) An officer of the Department did visit the site of Mr Marsh's property on 29 November 1993. The officer verified that the funds provided from the NLP had been expended in accordance with the terms of the application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7)(a) By examination of the application form, by physical inspection of the works undertaken at the project demonstration site and by the noting of information that the demonstration site has been used for demonstration purposes. (b) Certified relevant extracts from the officer's report will be provided direct to the Senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) The community contribution as per the BCLG application was assessed and all available evidence indicated that such an amount had been expended on the project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) The Department did not seek independent legal advice with regard to the provision of the grant funds made specifically available to the Boorowa Community Landcare Group for establishment of a demonstration site on the main Boorowa&mdash;Cowra Road. Such advice was not sought because claims of irregularities in the project application could not be proven.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) All Departmental records concerning the above grant were made the subject of an offer of access by the Ombudsman. It is a matter for the Ombudsman to provide the reasons as to why she stated in a media release that `the funds were used for their intended purpose'.</PARA></ANSWER></ANSWER.TO.QON></ANSWERS.TO.QUESTIONS></HANSARD>
