<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understood Senator Faulkner's query yesterday, it related to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act and how that related to the SES officers of the APS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation here in clause 38 is that the SES officers are treated differently on this aspect. We have tried to align as much as possible the Australian Public Service with the private sector. In the private sector, senior executives are excluded from the termination provisions because they are not covered by a federal award or agreement, and they also earn more than $66,200 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the SES officers, they earn more than that amount. However, they are covered by an award, so their exclusion from division 3 of the Workplace Relations Act can only be achieved by expressly excluding them. That is what is being done here: they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9064"> are being looked upon as executives would be in the private sector.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When you say that the senior executive service will be treated on the same basis as the private sector, does that mean that from time to time we may expect substantial payouts when senior executive service people leave in the same way as there are very substantial payouts to people in the private sector when they leave?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think clause 37 deals with that; there is an incentive to retire aspect there. There is a convention as to how much will be paid that states that the agency head can given notice in writing to an SES employee in the agency stating that that employee will become entitled to a payment of a specified sum if the employee retires within a period specified in the notice. It then goes on to deal with that. That, I think, covers the question of any payments that can be made to SES officers.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

Can we expect the same flexibility here and, if we cannot, how can you say it is like the private sector?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to respond to Senator Harradine on this important matter. I was a little surprised by Senator Harradine's comment. He may have been in the same position in which I found myself in relation to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, because I was not aware, until I became a member of that committee for the purposes of this inquiry, that the committee has had a very long tradition of not having minority reports. I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made it very clear to the committee&mdash;even though there were fundamental differences between the opposition and the government in having that committee examine this legislation&mdash;that I did not feel it was appropriate for me, on behalf of the opposition, to up&hyphen;end that convention and tradition. I hope Senator Harradine will appreciate that that is the case. That meant, during the committee's examination of the Public Service Bill and related bills, that there were a number of issues on which the committee was silent. Again, this was something that committee members well understood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a range of issues where government and opposition members could not find agreement and that meant at times&mdash;I suspect not only from an opposition perspective but also from a government perspective&mdash;that compromises had to be made. The opposition has always been very clear in its approach to the work of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters, Mr Reith, was responsible for making a decision to refer this legislation to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. There would be arguments about the appropriateness or otherwise of that particular committee dealing with legislation in detail. I know it did present difficulties for a number of senators&mdash;I am sure you would have been in that category Senator Harradine. I know the Australian Democrats, for example, did not have representation on that committee and subsequently that meant that the selection of bills process in the Senate was used to ensure that there was a further hearing of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee into this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicated at that time that for its part the opposition would not be engaging in that particular process because we took very seriously both the hearings and the development of the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. You raise an important issue Senator Harradine and I am glad I have had an opportunity to explain to you that this is a long held tradition of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, and one I was not aware

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was in that spirit that the opposition approached its task. I think that was a spirit that was accepted and reflected by government members of the committee too. We did try to develop a committee report that opposition and government members could sign up to, which is what we achieved. It did mean that there would be no minority report. It did mean that the committee would not be able to canvass a range of issues that would be subject to amendment in the committee stage process. But I want to assure you, Senator Harradine, that members of the public accounts committee and at all stages the government were well aware of this approach and well aware of the issues that the opposition thought were significant for this committee stage debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I never want to up&hyphen;end these sorts of traditions and conventions and I certainly thought for the purposes of the committee's important work, albeit limited to one package of legislation, that ought not occur.

Put simply, we are prepared to allow the Prime Minister and agency heads some degree of flexibility in setting salary and conditions provided that advice is sought from the Remuneration Tribunal and the final agreed package is made public. That means that the government would need to justify in the public domain any variation from the Remuneration Tribunal's advice. I am satisfied that in those circumstances these amendments are not necessary. It is for those reasons that the opposition will not support Senator Allison's amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This is again an important issue for the committee to give consideration to. Obviously, it has very much exercised the minds of the Merit Protection Commission and the Merit Protection Commissioner. The current Merit Protection Commissioner regards immunity from suit and protection from civil actions as absolutely necessary to the effective conduct of external reviews. I suspect that the Merit Protection Commission is in a very strong position to be able to advise the parliament on these issues. I would be interested in knowing whether the government has sought the views of the Merit Protection Commissioner. If the government has not sought the views of the Merit Protection Commissioner, why not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These protections are currently provided in sections 80 and 82 of the Merit Protection Act. Staff and agency members cannot be sued if they have acted in good faith. As far as the opposition understands, without this protection, it would be difficult to find people willing to investigate cases, particularly the more difficult ones that often have to be dealt with. There are also people, both those with grievances and witnesses, who say that they have been threatened with defamation and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other legal and sometimes illegal action if they give the MPRA certain information. Even with these protections, there are alleged victims of bullying and witnesses who have information which the agency has not been able to act on because they are not prepared to be identified. These are important issues. They are of such significance that this amendment is required to provide immunity from suit and this level of protection.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Nothing in this clause prevents an alleged unlawful reprisal from being treated as a breach in the code of conduct. The Labor Party have consistently said they want to leave these matters to the government when they produce their whistleblowing legislation. We have got no guarantee from the government that they will produce whistleblowing legislation. We have got no offer of them to do so. We have got no time frame in which they will produce such legislation. The oppo 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9075"> sition, by consistently rejecting these protections for Public Service employees, are going to hang those employees out to dry unless whistleblower legislation is brought in. Our view is that that legislation certainly will not reach us in this parliamentary term and, when the next government comes into power, there is no guarantee that either side will introduce it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in consistently rejecting these matters throughout, the Labor Party have sided with the executive. They have once again behaved as an executive in waiting and have used an excuse, in my view, to avoid confronting the fact that they need to provide further protection to the Public Service employees in an environment where the nature of their employment has changed so substantially that they are to be made far more vulnerable, and we as a parliament, in our accountability role, are to be made far more vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst I do accept the opposition's view in terms of our substantive amendment the other night on part 2, the minimalist provision we then came back with in my view was worthy of support. As I have said, in rejecting it Senator Faulkner has said it is a consistent position. Yes, it is a consistent rejection but, in doing so, you are hanging Public Service employees out to dry and you are behaving as an executive in waiting, not as an accountable opposition. I commend my amendments to the Senate.

This is a very convenient time for those technically minded senators to take a little refreshment break to check the future technical amendments, because I will be about 15 minutes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make the point here, in the more general points associated with this legislation, that these clauses are meaningless. It does not matter what provision you put in the act about secretaries, they have no protection whatsoever from a malevolent government. It does not matter what clauses you put in to protect them, to give them tenure or not give them tenure, the fact is they have no rights whatsoever and they have been treated abysmally by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had 11 heads of department go since 11 March last year. That is about one every two months. The first purge was a big one: six departmental secretaries hit the fence. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> No reason was given to any of them as to why they were not continuing in employment, and large taxpayers' payouts went to them so they could be got rid of. Mr Codd left, and that was a planned retirement. I knew about that before the government changed. Mr Hollway went for a better employment opportunity and Mr Stevens moved on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is one example of how governments will act wrongly, no matter what you put in a public service bill, it is the case of Mr John Mellors, the former Secretary to the Department of Administrative Services. This person could never have been regarded as a Labor partisan. In the time that he served the Labor government, I never once knew him to show any partisanship towards the Labor government, nor would I believe he would ever have shown any partisanship towards a coalition government. It is true that secretaries from time to time have sympathy for one party or another but, usually, at least half never have. Mr John Mellors fell into that half. He was just a good old-fashioned public servant. The treatment of him by this coalition government is absolutely abysmal. This particular individual, who had served the government loyally, was butchered and made a scapegoat for the mistakes of politicians, not his own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I asked Senator Hill at the estimates committee hearings whether Mr Mellors was sacked and DAS abolished out of revenge. Senator Hill said the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister blames his colleagues for the ministerial problems. But there certainly has been a view that some of these matters could have been administered more effectively than they have been.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have had that debate going on all year. Now it is time to put on the public record who had the debate, when they had the debate, what the sequence of the debate was and how the politicians intervened to put the fix in on DAS to stop them reviewing administration of these entitlements. I intend to go into that in some detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue has its genesis in the fact that there was a DAS inquiry in 1994 into the now Prime Minister, Mr Howard, sending out letters in support of Liberal Party candidates in the New South Wales postal workers union ballot. That prompted the then Minister for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9078"> Administrative Services, Mr Walker, to ask, `Just how precise are the definitions about entitlements and what should we do about it?' This was reinforced by Mr Codd's inquiry into Mr Alan Griffiths in the so-called sandwich shop affair where, again, there was a blurring of lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened is that Mr Walker said, `We'll have to review these things.' He authorised the writing of letters to all political leaders saying, `Here is a proposed set of revised guidelines and definitions, please respond.' Everyone responded: the Democrats responded and I think the government responded. Mr Howard sent a letter off which said that he had received Mr Walker's letter. A month later, Mr Howard then sent back a letter querying various aspects in Mr Walker's letter. Why should I raise this now? I am raising it to show that, back in 1995, Mr Howard, the then Leader of the Opposition and who subsequently became Prime Minister, knew there were problems in the administration of parliamentary entitlements, especially with the definitions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the coalition won government, and one of the first things that Mr Jull was advised of by Mr Mellors was the need to review the administration of parliamentary entitlements. Mr Jull, in a burst of enthusiasm as a new minister, wrote off to everyone. Guess what? There was no response from the Prime Minister's office on this subject&mdash;we are talking about September-October 1996&mdash;no response whatsoever. Mr Morris did not respond; Mr Howard did not respond. I understand that Mr Fischer and Senator Kernot responded. However, not to leave the matter there, Mr Sam Skrzypek did a background paper, which was ready by December 1996&mdash;I stress that he is not part of the ministerial and parliamentary services section&mdash;and suggested that this whole area needed to be looked at and reformed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then move to 18 December 1996. A minute was sent to the Secretary to the Department of Administrative Services, Mr Mellors, proposing draft terms of reference for an inquiry into the remuneration, entitlements and facilities for senators and members. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> This was discussed on that day between Mr Mellors and the then minister, Mr Jull.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By 2 January 1997, a further minute was produced proposing the actual draft terms of reference and a draft letter to the Prime Minister. The issues in this minute and letter included: first, a fundamental review based on developing the Skrzypek paper; second, improved services to members, which would be the Coopers and Lybrand report; and, third, fix Comcar once and for all&mdash;my source puts in (Ho, ho, ho). So they were the three issues put in that particular minute. The then Secretary to DAS, Mr Mellors, asked the Deputy Secretary, Mr Michael Clarke, to put a bit of flesh around this particular matter. So on 3 January 1997, we had the first cut of the budget submission. There was then a meeting on 10 January to discuss this particular cabinet submission. Present were Mr Michael Clarke, Mr John Mackay, Mr Graham Semmens, Mr Gary Gordon and Ms Anne Hazell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, though, we get to the position on 5 February, and this should be noted in detail. There was a further draft cabinet submission. It contained a reference to a review of entitlements. However, Mr Jull's senior adviser reported that he had `tested the waters', that there was no need to rock the boat and that this recommendation should be taken out of the cabinet submission. I understand the evidence for that is in a file note in the Department of Administrative Services that records, at the time, Mr Sutherland's comments and also records that the minister, Mr Jull, was present when Mr Sutherland gave that direction. When the final draft cabinet submission was produced on 7 February, all reference to a review of the entitlements was expunged. It no longer exists. On 14 February, the final budget cabinet submission was finalised&mdash;totally unchanged from the one of 7 February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will put this in context before I go on to how we did get a review. What we have heard from the current Prime Minister is, `Oh, look, the previous government never touched parliamentary entitlements. It is our great reform in government that touched this particular area,' yet we know that when Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9079"> Howard was written to in September-October 1995, he only noted his response and then put up technical questions. When he was written to again in September 1996, he did not even have the courtesy to reply to his minister. He did not even note that he had received the letter, let alone reply on the substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly enough, a whole month goes by from 5 February, when this was taken out of the submission, to an answer given by Mr Jull in the parliament. What happened meanwhile was that the Senator Colston matters, and the Senator Woods matters and other matters came to light. Mr Jull went into the parliament and announced that KPMG was going to do a study into the way DAS was administering entitlements. In later press releases of about six weeks ago, when there was a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> article explaining all of the history of this, Mr Jull said, `Oh, no, I just happened to substitute what the Mellors and DAS point of view was for my own.' The point to note is that a full month went by before we heard anything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Mr Jull came into the parliament and announced an inquiry into this, he gave his department half an hour's notice. He also gave Mr Baxter, who was doing the report, half an hour's notice. In other words, this was not the planned principal move&mdash;as Mr Jull and the Prime Minister like to explain&mdash;this was a panic move to head things off at question time. DAS gets informed half an hour before, `We're going to do a review. We're going to employ Mr Baxter. Mr Baxter has just been told'&mdash;none of all this post-rationalisation of, `Oh, we thought it would be a quicker result with Mr Baxter.' There is a critically missing month. In that month there was a conscious decision by this government not to have a review of parliamentary entitlements on 5 February. As Mr Sutherland said to the meeting, `Don't rock the boat. We're not interested in this particular area. Delete it out of the cabinet submission. We'll bury it and we'll forget about it.' It was only when the pressure came on and the panic came on that we got this inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The relevance to this particular clause is that we have a public servant, Mr Mellors, who has done precisely the right thing. Initial 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ly, he recommended to his minister, `This area needs addressing. Please have an inquiry. Let's reform this area.' The initial reaction of the minister was quite good. He wrote to people along these lines. But when the pressure came on and the waters were tested&mdash;when, I assume, Mr Sutherland rushed around and talked to Mr Grahame Morris&mdash;suddenly this got jettisoned off. So it is not good enough for Senator Hill to say that there were weaknesses in the department. Those weaknesses, if they exist, had a political origin and the government failed to act, having these things brought to their attention, at the right time to reform this particular area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is a public servant being blamed for mistakes by ministers. He has copped the blame. He has lost his job. We will hear all the fiction you like from Senator Hill that DAS was abolished for efficiency and rationalisation. Heavens to Betsy! There was not one background paper in PM&amp;C prior to 1 October.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I asked Senator Hill on 4 June in the estimates committee whether there were any plans to abolish DAS, I got absolutely no response that that was being contemplated. Last Friday when we asked Mr Len Early, Deputy Secretary to the Department of Finance and Administration, what savings there would be from the amalgamation he said, `Oh, there won't be any. We don't anticipate any savings.' In other words, the attack on DAS was a political one. It was motivated by revenge, scapegoating, `Let's shift the blame. Let's get square. Let's get rid of DAS because that's the way we lost three ministers.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It could all have been prevented if the ministers had accepted the proper advice that was tendered to them by DAS and had authorised a proper inquiry either back in September or in February as a result of budget cabinet. You can have all these clauses you like&mdash;56, 57, 58&mdash;talking about the appointments of secretaries, talking about terminations, but when push comes to shove, when governments can find a victim and shift blame, they will do it. There was never a clearer example. I might go on in a moment and discuss exactly the way the government gave Mr Mellors the push.</PARA>

We know from the previous contribution I made that DAS did not let them down at all, but they got a rough idea that they were going to be targeted as first cab off the rank when it came to revenge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government finally got through its traumas and decided to abolish DAS, Mr Mellors wrote cabinet&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence to the then acting Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Ruddock, pointing out the whole history of his efforts not only to get this area reformed but also to get it back on track. He also wrote to Mr Max Moore&hyphen;Wilton, head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, putting two requests. In his first request he said, `Look, if DAS is going to be abolished and I am made the scapegoat&mdash;and it will be most unfair if I am&mdash;will there at

In his second request he asked for there to be some public acknowledgment of the job he had done as Secretary to the Department of Administrative Services.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I anticipate the interjection, Senator Faulkner. He is too busy knocking the backs and sides off bus shelters. It is serious. Mr Mellors is an individual who has spent decades in the Public Service. He gave loyal service to the previous government and this one and he implicitly carried out the requests of this government, yet the senior bureaucrat did not give him the time of day for five days. He did not return his phone calls. He treated him like a leper, like a pariah. When Mr Mellors finally got to see the great helmsman of Prime Minister and Cabinet, he is at least informed that his requests went to the Prime Minister and the Prime Minister knocked him back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know what a vengeful, nasty little individual this Prime Minister can be, but surely that is one of the lowest acts he has perpetrated so far in his 20 months in power. If there have been problems in this government they have been because of ministerial error&mdash;it is not just restricted to this government, I concede. It is ministerial error; it is not Public Service error. There was no point in making Mr Mellors the target in all this, but he is. Had Mr Mellors been approached reasonably, I am sure he would have gone, and gone as gracefully as he could. I do not think he saw himself as having a much longer Public Service career; he had been around and he had been a departmental secretary for some time. But why not do it with just a touch of grace, just a touch of kindness? No, it just could not be done.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9081">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It could not be done because, to justify themselves, this coalition government had to have its element of revenge. It had to pick someone out to punish. So it picks out Mr Mellors and shoves him aside. It picks out Mr Godfrey. First we are told that there will not be a new deputy secretary position in the new DoFA and then suddenly there is, but Mr Godfrey is marked down for some sort of political reason. I am at a loss to know why. Six others in the senior executive service are hanging out to dry. The great irony is: the people they hung out to dry were not the leakers; they are still there in some form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If DAS misbehaved, I am not here to defend them, but I do not think there is any great evidence that they have misbehaved. I have not seen the various reports. Obviously, the Auditor&hyphen;General's report is only going to go into audit matters. I have not seen Mr Kennedy's report, but I have seen the staff circular that he was kind enough to table in relation to it. I do not want to embarrass Mr Kennedy, but it seemed to me a very balanced, classic Public Service report, done with fairness to everyone and with the appropriate methodology. If that has not turned up any misbehaviour in DAS and if the Auditor&hyphen;General does not turn up any misbehaviour in DAS, why was it abolished and why were these various people punished?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is one thing to sack people, but they treated them so abysmally. Redundancy offers were made in one case and then suspended for a month while some cloud hung over their head, and whisperers were saying, `So and so might have bought a raffle ticket from the Labor Party in 1984. We don't know for sure, but we've heard the rumour, so mark that person down.' Where are we going with these issues to have people treated in this way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, 11 departmental secretaries have gone. At best, you could say that two went through natural attrition, one went to a better job, six were purged for political reasons and one in particular was just made a scapegoat. At the very minimum, Mr Howard or one of his ministers could have had the grace to acknowledge the role that Mr Mellors played in government. I am sure Mr Jull would have, but he was no longer around in an official

The record shows that at the critical moment on 5 February when this government, without any pressure from any scandals or anything else, could have reviewed parliamentary entitlements and definitions&mdash;it was in the budget submission&mdash;it got knocked out because they tested the waters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure that everyone knows what `test the waters' means. It means, your political operative in the minister's office slips around, probably sees Mr Reith, Mr Morris and a couple of the other movers and shakers in government and says, `What do you think of this?' They say, `Don't rock the boat.' So he came back to a meeting and said, `Don't rock the boat.' Mr Jull did not intervene. Suddenly it slipped out of the cabinet submission and a whole month went by with nothing happening. It was only when the issue broke, the government was under pressure and it panicked, that suddenly it had two simultaneous inquiries into these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is understandable, but what I really hate is the post&hyphen;rationalisation because they did not think we knew about the circumstances. They now say, `We're the reforming government. We're looking into these things.' They looked into them with a gun at their head and when they had the opportunity to do something about it they totally failed the test. So it is no use Mr Jull&mdash;after the Laurie Oakes article&mdash;or Mr Howard or anyone else ever putting the argument that they were determined to reform these areas. Mr Howard had his chance in 1995 and failed to properly respond to Mr Walker's request. Mr Howard 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9082"> had his chance in 1996 when he did not even bother to reply to Mr Jull's letter. Mr Howard had his chance at budget cabinet and he failed again. The only time he intervened was when this government had problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand, in these clauses you need flexibility to appoint and terminate agency heads or departmental secretaries&mdash;however you refer to them. All I say is: it does not matter what the government's view is, what the opposition amendments are or the Democrats' amendments are; in the end, when it comes to agency heads, governments will do absolutely what they like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is the case, I make this plea: that they come out and honestly say why they are terminating a departmental secretary&mdash;because they think the person is politically biased, because they think they are incompetent or, in this last case, `Because we're trying to shift blame. We're looking for a scapegoat and if we've got to lose three ministers, two Prime Ministerial staffers and one departmental official'&mdash;unfairly as it turns out&mdash;`if we have to do all that, we're going to put a bit of stick around and have a bit of revenge.' The trouble is, they sought revenge on the very people who lived up to the top ethical standards of the Public Service, anticipated trouble, recommended remedies which a political fix knocked out, and then they became the victims. It is absolutely pathetic.</PARA></SPEECH>

The provision as drafted has very little to say about the responsibility of secretaries.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 53 adds to clause 58, which contains the words `appointment etc. of secretary', the words `but shall be paid remuneration in respect of one office only'. This reflects a sensible provision in the current act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the aforementioned Mr Max Moore&hyphen;Wilton, he appears to concentrate most of his time on the minutiae outside what one would expect would be the normal role and responsibility of a Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 52 spells out that a secretary has a duty to assist the relevant minister to fulfil his or her accountability obligations&mdash;and `accountability' is the operative word. As the bill currently stands, the secretary to a department, under the agency minister, is responsible for managing the department, and that is as far as it goes. We think this cuts to the heart of the issue of Public Service accountability; going beyond the government of the day and extending to the parliament and the public.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the things that the opposition complained about took place under legislation which they brought in and which related to how the government dealt with various secretaries. I will not comment in detail about what Senator Ray and Senator Faulkner said; suffice to say that amendment No. 52 has two parts. The first part would replace the words of the bill with the language that is currently employed in section 25(2) of the present Public Service Act. The new wording in the bill will reflect the nature of the new employment framework, as the government has set out in paragraph 7.7 of the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is our view that this amendment is unnecessary. The government prefers the more modern formulation that I have just referred

In relation to amendment No. 53, which seeks to restrict the payment of secretaries to be in respect of one office only, this is unnecessary, the government believes, given clause 61, which enables the Prime Minister to fix remuneration.

He is talking about the secretary to a department, under the agency minister, being responsible for managing the department. It is a management concept. I think that is fine, but that is really what the amendment put forward by the opposition implies. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed new clause 57(2) includes accountability to parliament in the legislation. I believe that is a very important matter. As we would all know, anything that is in legislation which would uphold and promote the parliament's audit and control functions over executive government decisions, decisions of their departments and the disbursement of taxpayer's funds by those departments is to be supported, so I am supporting that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the opposition proposes in opposition amendment 53 to add to subclause (5), in relation to the same person holding more than one office of secretary, the words `but shall be paid remuneration in respect of one office only'. Otherwise you would quite clearly have the circumstance where, effectively, a secretary could receive a remuneration package that would be utterly inappropriate. I think this amendment has merit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to ask a couple of questions. First of all, I want to make an observation. I am aware of the history of the consultative council. It has had a very long history. I can recall that very often on the ACT executive we used to get reports about this, but not so many because the trade union movement in those days was not as dominated as it is these days by public sector organisations, not that I am saying that is necessarily a backward step. I would not comment on that matter right here and now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I want to say so everybody knows is that the consultative council is not functioning in the way it was designed to function. As I see it, this is a management advisory committee that is being proposed by the government. It has people on that management advisory committee that are, really, self&hyphen;selected, who believe they need to go on the management advisory committee. I think the government should appreciate the fact, and I am sure it does, that there is a need, if the service is going to operate smoothly, for input by the employees or representatives of the employees of the service. I would ask the minister to give some indication and guarantee to the committee as to how the viewpoints of the employees are going to be taken account of by the management advisory committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it likely that other persons nominated by the secretary of the Prime Minister's depart

We have been along this track plenty of times over the years in various areas of consultation between managers and staff representatives, employee representatives and union representatives. That can only smooth over the problems that managers might foresee. Could the minister give us an indication as to whether that would be something that the government would see as desirable&mdash;that is to say, having somebody on the MAC who would be able to express the viewpoints generally of the employees in respect of management matters?</PARA></SPEECH>

I do not think I can take it further than that in the circumstances.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was reading this while Senator Faulkner was talking, and it seems that `senior officials' covers a very wide category of people. Does it mean a person who holds any office or appointment under an act? What about those acts that set up wheat boards, farming groups or any sort of group that gives advice, not necessarily for money, or things set up under the ASC? The use of the term `any office or appointment under an Act' seems very broad. Even if a person is appointed on an honorary basis, it seems that he or she becomes a senior official.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition asked what the current position was and, of course, that is reflected in their amendment: that you can delegate with the consent of the Public Service Commissioner. I gave Senator Faulkner and the opposition the reasons for this, but I will mention them again. One example is military officers supervising civilians in the Department of Defence. Military officers are not part of the APS, but they could well be in a position where they need delegation to supervise civilians in the Department of Defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another example is those officers administering the tax act in the Australian Taxation Office. There are people who are not members of the Australian Public Service who could well be in a position where they have delegated authority to supervise APS employees. I do not want to go over again those other examples that I referred to, such as state or territory officials or exchange officials from overseas public services working in the APS. For instance, I think we get officials from Papua New Guinea. You could well need delegation in that instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The requirement of the Public Service Commissioner is in the current act. It is the current act we are trying to reform and streamline. It is the efficacy of it that we are looking at. We do not believe there will be anything lost by the new provision proposed in clause 78.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This, again, is a very important amendment. It is designed to grandfather the rights currently conferred on first and second tier persons by the old act, with the exception of the right to reassessment for reintegration or reappointment. Of course, the procedures for that have fallen into abeyance in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most significant of these rights are the so&hyphen;called mobility rights; the rights of current and former public servants who are in public employment other than Public Service departments to return to employment in the Public Service. The bill provides for APS employees 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9095"> to retain their current mobility rights only for a transitional period which the government now proposes will be three years, after which such rights will become a matter of discretion for the head of the agency to which the relevant employee is attached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition considers the government's proposals on mobility to amount to a retrospective removal of an important condition of employment. Mobility rights have been an important consideration for many APS employees in deciding to accept offers of alternative employment. We are strongly of the view that it is not acceptable to remove these rights after such decisions have been made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We note the government's proposals in schedule 2 of the draft commissioner's directions in relation to former employees of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and former APS employees who now work for the ACT and the Northern Territory Public Services, but we consider that they fall far short of fair treatment. We are particularly concerned here about the impact of removal of mobility rights from people employed by ministers and opposition office holders under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition takes the view that governments and the Public Service have at both levels benefited from the frequent movement of people between Parliament House and government departments. We made this point at some length during the hearings of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Parliament has benefited from the knowledge of the bureaucracy that departmental officers bring with them and departments benefit from the knowledge of political, parliamentary and legislative processes that those who go back to departments take with them. The benefits far outweigh the slight inconvenience to Public Service managers caused by the uncertainty as to when former employees might seek to return. This has not in the past been an unmanageable burden for departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition believes that this cross&hyphen;fertilisation is very good for our system of government and that it should be encouraged rather than discouraged. That is why the former Labor government initiated the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act in 1984. The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mechanism for encouraging such cross&hyphen;fertilisation is the preservation of mobility rights during the term of MOPS employment, and removal of these rights will discourage such movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We find this very hard to comprehend. It is hard to believe that that is what the government is really seeking. There is also an issue of natural justice. Many MOPS employees have taken the decision to accept their current employment in Parliament House, for the most part in ministerial offices, on the basis that they retain rights of return to their departments for the duration of their employment under MOPS. Staffers know, particularly in the light of the recent destruction of government ranks, that there is little security for them in political employment. I can think of some staff who were working for ministers in the last few months who have now learnt that lesson. We all know it; it is not unique to one side of the parliament or to the coalition parties. It is a fact of political life for people who are employed in a ministers' office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These mobility rights compensate for that lack of security&mdash;it is that important. If the government is determined to remove mobility rights, they should be removed only from APS employees who transfer to other eligible public employment after the entry into force of the new legislation, in the prior knowledge, for those people, that they would have not right of return. Those who transferred on the basis that they enjoyed such rights ought to retain them, as far as we are concerned. That is what our amendment to clauses 6 and 7 is designed to achieve. We consider this a very important amendment of issues that gained a lot of debate and concentration of effort during the work of the Joint Committee of Public Account. They are worthy of serious attention and I commend the amendment to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This question  is very important and needs to be determined. Some of the comments made by Senator Faulkner are, I believe, compelling; others are not. The question as to whether the ministers' officers, or indeed shadow ministers' officers, are assisted by persons coming from the department is one 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9096"> which people need to study pretty well. In some cases, there is a mind&hyphen;set in particular departments and some persons who come across from departments to ministers' offices are really batting for the department. One wonders, under those circumstances, whether this cross&hyphen;fertilisation, as Senator Faulkner described it, is appropriate and serves the parliament well. It certainly sometimes serves the department well, but whether it services the parliament well is another question. A busy minister, a busy member of parliament or a shadow minister could take on face value the information provided to him or her from that person who comes from the department.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that the opposition supports the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997 (No. 2) and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1997. These bills collectively propose to amend the temporary Commonwealth tax safety net arrangements concerning tobacco which were implemented 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9097"> after the High Court invalidated the business franchise fees levied by the states and territories in relation to tobacco, alcohol and petrol.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The customs and excise bills propose new arrangements for the taxation of tobacco. Prior to the High Court decision, tobacco was taxed under Commonwealth excise, which taxed on the basis of weight, and state franchise fees, which taxed on the basis of the value of the products. The original safety net arrangement involved an increase in the Commonwealth excise of $167 per kilogram. This significantly altered the taxation of various tobacco products. This, in turn, would have flowed on to significant alterations to retail prices and would have affected the relative profits of the manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new proposals will replace this weight based system with a combined weight based and ad valorem, or value based, system which equates as far as possible with the situation prior to the High Court decision. The changes under the customs and excise bills will result in a decrease of $288 million in revenue. However, there is no financial effect on the Commonwealth as the moneys from the safety net arrangements are all on&hyphen;passed to the states and territories. Under these on&hyphen;passing arrangements, each state and territory receives a separate fixed share of the safety net revenue for tobacco, petroleum and alcohol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another bill which will be dealt with later today, the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997, is related to these bills. That bill proposes to give effect to a request by the states and territories to alter their shares of revenue replacement payments for tobacco under the safety net arrangements arising from the change in the method of imposing tax. That bill is also seeking authority to set any future changes to the distribution of alcohol, tobacco and petrol revenues by regulation to avoid the need for additional legislation. Having made those remarks, I indicate, as I said earlier, that the opposition supports the bills.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S114">Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</XREF>  is listed today as non&hyphen;controversial and indeed that is the case. However, it is important that I briefly put on the record the history of the bill because the government is proposing a significant number of amendments to it. Whilst we support the thrust of the amendments that are to be moved today&mdash;which will enable passage of the bill&mdash;there are, nevertheless, some issues of concern which the opposition needs to put on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this bill first came before the Senate it related to another bill introduced last year, the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Amendment Bill 1996. The major thrust of those two bills was to implement changes to enable the Australia New Zealand Food Authority to impose a system of charges upon companies seeking approval of changes to food standards. If it had been enacted, it would have been a new feature of the operations of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority because, for the first time, it would have been able to charge companies for the work that was required in giving approval to food standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history had been that food standards applications would be made to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, would be dealt with as they came in. The Australia New Zealand Food Authority argued that it needed the flexibility to impose charges in order to prioritise its work and enable it to give sufficient time to dealing with some other key issues, including the review of the overall food standards code and a range of other matters that the authority is currently addressing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation was referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee which issued a report in June of this year. In 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9098"> that report it was indicated&mdash;by the opposition and, I think, in respect of at least one aspect supported by the Democrats&mdash;that we had serious concerns about proposals which, firstly, related to the imposition of these charges and, secondly, related to giving the authority the capacity to employ persons as non&hyphen;public servants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We indicated in that report that we would be opposing those aspects of the legislation. The legislation has been on the list for some time and is now back before the Senate. On this occasion, the government has indicated that it does not wish to proceed with the two aspects that were controversial&mdash;that is, the provisions relating to charges or a system of fees and charges in the future and the provisions relating to employment of non&hyphen;public service staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, the government has decided not to proceed with the fundamental basis upon which the legislation was put forward and was considered by the Senate committee. However, in the amendments that the government is putting forward today, the government has said that they will not be proceeding with those aspects of the bill that were controversial. Rather they wish to amend the legislation to provide for the establishment of the position of chief executive officer within the authority. Currently, the authority is staffed by a chairperson. I understand the chairperson is full time and there is no position of chief executive officer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the opposition do not oppose these proposals, but I do want to place firmly on the record our concern about the procedure that has been adopted. When the legislation was put before the Senate and considered by the committee there was no reference at all to any proposal to establish this new position of CEO. The Senate committee addressed what was in the bill at that time. Now the Senate is being presented with the same bill, but it has been significantly amended to establish a new position of chief executive officer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are prepared to support that. We do so clearly on the basis that that is an appropriate course of action and the government will, through its amendments, not be proceeding with the other aspects that I referred to&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">namely, the charges and the intended future employment of persons who would not be covered by the Public Service Act. I wish to register our concern that I do not think it is appropriate that the committee was unable to consider the issues that are the subject of the amendments to this amendment bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised as a result of my discussions with industry that they were not made aware formally; I am not sure whether they were made aware of this informally, of the government's latest proposals&mdash;that is, to establish this position of chief executive officer. In my discussions with the industry, who did appear before the original Senate inquiry, I found that they are not unhappy with this proposal. I know that they would certainly wish it to be recorded that they feel somewhat aggrieved that, whilst they did participate in the earlier proceedings before the Senate committee, they were not made aware of the latest set of changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be supporting the government's amendments to the bill on the basis that I have outlined except that we will be opposing items 25 and 26 of schedule 1 as circulated on sheet 698. Schedule 1, items 25 and 26, page 9 lines 11 to 24 are the provisions currently in the bill which would enable the authority to employ persons other than as public servants. We will be opposing that provision. I understand the government will not be seeking to pursue those matters and will accept our opposition to it. We will support the bill except for those items.</PARA></SPEECH>

The public service is here to service both the public, and the wider public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We moved this amendment to remove a provision which undermines the general public service employment arrangements. These are matters best dealt with in the Public Service Act and its replacement which is currently before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We welcome the Government's acceptance of our amendment and a recognition that statutory authorities must conform with the general employment policies of the public service. Statutory authorities are not the private sector and they must remain accountable to the Government and the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats set out in the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee minority report our objection to this sort of provision:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Democrats are concerned the [Public Service] Bill in its present form signals a shift away from a Westminster style of public service able to give independent, frank and fearless advice to both government and Parliament, towards a new `private sector' model of public service which `belongs' to the government of the day".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision proposed by the Government would have been this shift. We are unable to support such a provision. But without that provision we are happy to support this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other late changes the Government proposed concern the change to the position of `Chairperson' and `Chief Executive Officer'. The splitting off of the Chairperson's day-to-day administrative functions to a newly established Chief Executive Officer will leave the Chairperson position as part-time and increase the efficiency of the Authority.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats support the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R324">Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill 1997</XREF>  . I want to make a number of points. If it were not for the start&hyphen;up date and the need to put in place the measures contained in this bill, we would have spent more time discussing it. We would probably have suggested to government some further improvements. Those improvements go not only to the detail of the bill but also to the philosophy behind it. It is in terms of that philosophy that I want to put some points on the record today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We use words like `adjustment' as though they were benign terms to describe something which, for many farmers, is in fact a very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> stressful experience. For them, adjustment means actually getting out of farming. Sometimes I think we put a lot of pressure on farmers by referring to them as `non&hyphen;viable' or `uncompetitive' or `inefficient' or `not good enough', as though the whole predicament was solely their own doing, and we fail to admit that at times it is government policy or the lack of government policy which has contributed very significantly to the situation in which farmers find themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that is policy of all of the major parties. I do not leave the Democrats out of that, as we seek also to struggle to understand the situation of agriculture not only in Australia but also in a global sense, for there are massive changes that have been and are taking place in global farming. I do not believe that they are all positive. In fact, I think that globalisation and competition policy, which we often laud as the answer to all of our problems, is really proving&mdash;to me, at least, and I think to many other people&mdash;to be simply not working. We keep on projecting globalisation and competition policy as though we were all playing on a level playing field. I know that the rhetoric says we agree there isn't one. Nevertheless, the policies remain in place which project a level playing field as though it were reality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we continue to reduce tariffs in many of our primary industries, despite the fact that in many other countries tariffs&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MURRAY" NAMEID="3M6">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator Murray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And non&hyphen;tariff barriers.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And non&hyphen;tariff barriers as well&mdash;are still in place, and we expect to compete with those countries. We know the problems that farmers have with low commodity process, and I could go on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another major factor in the whole problem of agriculture is the dominant paradigm, a paradigm of extension and competition adopted by government and even by industry bodies purporting to represent all farmers. And yet each year we have a new batch of farmers fitting into the following categories: 10 per cent prosper; 40 per cent manage to keep afloat; 30 per cent struggle like mad to stay afloat; and 20 per cent go under. What we do not acknowledge is that every time we take the 20 per cent off the bottom we actual 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9104"> ly then spread the 100 per cent out again and so we have a new 20 per cent at the bottom. Of course, the 10 per cent at the top today will eventually be split up into the categories and they themselves will be dropping off the bottom, if we continue the way we are going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that farmers have lower access to business improvement management and technology compared to city business counterparts. That is a reason for our government to continue fostering their extension activities. Government sponsored agriculture extension is notorious for looking after the top 50 per cent and leaving the rest behind. But we know from Australian commercial and corporate contact extension programs that this need not be the case. When appropriate agricultural extension is directed to all farmers, there is measurable improvement in uptake of technology and financial position among most farmers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, looking after the top 10 per cent of farmers in some ways is not efficient. These master business people will thrive regardless, and often in spite of government extension intervention. They are the ones who already have well&hyphen;honed research, technical, financial and management skills. What is required is equity of access, and we know from research that it is not adequate to say, `Well, here we are. Come and see us.' Nor is it adequate to run standard government extension programs without also providing individualised business improvement programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would have improved the  Farm Household Support Amendment (Restart and Exceptional Circumstances) Bill 1997  in a number of ways. We put these on the record as something that we would like to pursue in the future. When we talk about adjustment and restarting, we would like to see governments taking account of the possibility of restarting not just off the farm but restarting on the farm as well. We believe that, unless governments do begin to take account of the possibility of some farmers restarting on farm, we will continue the failure which has been part of the experience of so many farmers in the last few years. This means that government has to accept best practice in business improvement programs. Government should genuinely 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> provide access to financial counselling, technical&hyphen;management extension advice&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just wait till I get to the end, Senator Boswell. You delay me. I am trying to get through this as quickly as I can. I do not want to hold you up. Government should provide access to family&hyphen;partnership counselling, career counselling, collegiate ongoing mentoring from farmers and ex&hyphen;farmers, access to the property management planning, and one&hyphen; or two&hyphen;year monitored and reviewed action plans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, to answer your question, Senator Boswell: what we would like to see is that this is available not just to the very viable farmers, who are the ones who usually access it, but we would like to see equity in that to enable some of those farmers who would perhaps be dropping off to have the opportunity to restart, because we believe that not enough account is being taken of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that as long as government and peak industry body policy continues to have a vision only for the need to restart off the farm then we will continue to lose those we regard as non&hyphen;viable. But as I said before, that will continue to eat up not only those who are non&hyphen;viable today but some who will fall into the bottom category in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to use sensible definitions of `farmer' and take into account that farmers can be women, second families, couples on the farm, young people, single people, and relatives not in the immediate family. I do not get the impression that government appreciates the diversity of labour situations on farming small businesses in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I certainly will. I am being provoked but I will try not to be. I believe that there are a number of other things that we need to do in order to improve this bill and that I hope will be part of the continuing debate, because I know that Senator Boswell certainly wants the best for farmers in Australia, as I do, even though we do not always agree about how that can be achieved. There is no doubt that that is his intention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we do need a clearer definition of `exceptional circumstances', and I hope we might develop this through consultation with farmers, rural counsellors and the various farming bodies. I would hope that we could enable exceptional circumstances to continue until a social security income test demonstrates that farmers are able to stand on their own, in cases where farmers are individually drought declared by their state or territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to ensure that professionals with extensive rural knowledge and experience are the ones to conduct the viability, income and asset tests. Unless there are going to be huge numbers of DSS centrepoint staff undertaking extensive tertiary training et cetera, then I do not believe they have the expertise to do this and we ought to use the people who are on the ground and who know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe we should include disease eradication program participants as being eligible for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the restart scheme. Many of these people discover that they have an eradication program all of a sudden put on their farm. This often has a devastating impact on their financial and psychological states. I also believe the DSS review of estimated incomes should be conducted in March of the year when DSS payments are received. Often when farmers have to repay lump sums this can be very damaging to their cash flow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need a genuine proactive public education process to ensure farmers know what government programs are available. The existing processes do not work in many places. I will not spend the time of the Senate, but we had a lot of contact with farm counsellors who were saying that people just do not know what is available. We need to do more work in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally&mdash;and I have not used up all my time&mdash;I think we need both in government and in the Department of Social Security to keep a level head on the subject of rorting. Recent press releases show that the problem in rural Australia is that most eligible farmers do not access government programs of this kind. They either do not know of the programs, do not know of the eligibility requirements or do not want to be part of restrictive, privacy-invading government programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend the bill to the Senate. Those are the issues that the Democrats would like to put on the table for further debate around the issue of support for farm families. We trust that the positive aspects of this bill will be taken up.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions invest resources where they are needed encouraging social and economic growth in rural communities and providing access to an adequate safety net.</PARA>

The dairy industry has been another success story with their exports expected to rise by $200 million per year.</PARA>

We will, however, be moving one amendment to the bill which will be circulated when the committee stage is called.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the Senate may recall that the Australian Democrats put such an amendment to an earlier states grants bill.

When it was put to the Auditor-General package of bills&mdash;surprise, surprise!&mdash;Labor turned it down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of the states grants debate, Senator Conroy and Senator Carr came into this chamber and made impassioned speeches against Premier Kennett, his arrogance in office, his lack of accountability and sundry other allegations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997 and to draw to the attention of the government the effect of its policies on Australian families, particularly on low income families. Australian families are very concerned about what is happening now and what may happen in the future. Australian families, particularly low income families, are facing a great deal of uncertainty and insecurity at this time. I have to say that, under this government, they are justified in being concerned that they may not have a job next week. Under this government, they are right to be concerned that their already stretched household budgets may not be able to meet the extra costs that this government is going to impose on them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to go through a few examples of this. They will be spending more on child-care costs. As we know from the report that was tabled yesterday, in some cases they will be spending up to an additional $40 a week. They will be spending more on community care services and HACC services. If they can afford private health insurance, the benefit they would have received from the rebate will have gone in increased premiums. They will be paying more for pharmaceuticals. Health card holders will pay an additional $3.20 for the co&hyphen;payment and, as at 1 February next year, potentially as estimated by the AMA an additional $30 per month with the new drugs tax. They will be paying more for dental 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> treatment with the abolishment of the Commonwealth dental health scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They will be paying more for housing with the reduction in rental assistance and the reduction in the availability of public housing. They will be paying more for their elderly parents to get into a nursing home and they will be paying more as a daily fee once they get in there. If they have children between the ages of 16 and 25 who are seeking work or are in education, then they will have to support those children searching for work up to the age of 20 and they will have to provide more assistance to their studying children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All round, if you are a family in Australia, particularly if you are a low income family, under the policies of the present government you are a loser. Australian families over the last two budgets have lost $10 billion&mdash;that is from health, housing, education and social security. If this government believes that it can carve $10 billion out of the pockets of Australian families and it will have no effect, then it had better rethink its position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will look at the provisions of this bill. Schedule 1 combines the parenting allowance with the sole parent benefit. Ostensibly this is the provision to ensure simplification; to put two allowances together under the same name. As this government has always done, when it simplifies it uses it as an excuse to take away a benefit some low income person has. This is no exception to that general principle because, as usual, it has gone for the lowest common denominator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sole parents will lose in the following ways. Before, there was an assets taper whereby the sole parent payment was reduced gradually as their assets increased. Instead of their payment being reduced by $3 a fortnight for every $1,000 of assets that they have, under the new arrangements proposed in this bill they will immediately lose their sole parent benefit, or the parenting payment as it is now to be known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also now the application of an income maintenance period for sole parents which did not previously apply&mdash;that is, if they have cashed out annual leave, sick leave, long service leave or maternity leave and it is paid as part of a redundancy payment, they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9109"> will now have to wait the period that those payments cover before they are eligible for the parenting payment. There is also a reduction in the overseas portability from 26 weeks to 13 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some small winners in these provisions, but the net effect of these changes is that there is $7 million taken away from low income families that have children. When we know very well that children living in families relying on the sole parent benefit are some of the worst off in our community, those who are struggling the hardest, it really is a very harsh provision to be applying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it does get worse when we move to schedule 2, which applies to the child disability allowance. Firstly, as of 1 July, eligibility for the child disability allowance will be based on a prescribed list of disabilities and a child disability assessment tool. Secondly, the child disability allowance arrears will be cut from 12 months to six months. Once this government starts cutting away at payments made to disabled children, it really is hitting the bottom of the barrel. If I were a member of the coalition now, I would be a little embarrassed. If this government does not believe that the disabled children in our community are entitled to some sort of support, I really cannot see who it does believe is entitled to support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is only one positive change in relation to disabled children&mdash;that is, in order to get over the high jump, in order to qualify for the child disability allowance, you can now add two children together. So, if you are a family that is unfortunate enough to have not only one child but two children who are disabled, you can add them together so you get over the high jump. It is a small positive thing&mdash;I do not like to be negative always&mdash;but I have to say, in the light of the negative changes the government has made, it really is pretty small. There has been some debate about exactly who are affected by these changes and how many. The government itself says there will be about 12,000 children who are affected, but this certainly does not seem very clear, and maybe the minister would like to clarify that when she is on her feet. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, there seems to be some argument about the sorts of disabilities children suffer from, which will mean that some will lose out with these changes to the children's disability allowance. There seems to be some argument on behalf of the government that the sorts of people who are going to be missing out are three particular classes of children. They will be children with attention deficit disorder, children with diabetes and children with asthma. I suppose the whole basis of the argument is that these children are not really disabled, that it is not really a problem for them, that they require no additional help.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, despite the fact that those figures were relied on in the budget portfolio document, there seems to be little support for that view put forward by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. I am sure the government is well aware of the debate in relation to that issue. It seems to me that in some cases the children who will miss out will be not only those in the three categories but also those who suffer from other disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Putting aside that argument for a moment, it is important to say that I do not believe the three classes of children with those particular disabilities are unworthy of support. If that is a view held by the government and by the department, they have never had children, dealt with children or cared for children who are in those categories. It certainly is a great difficulty that children have to overcome, particularly in the category of ADD. For those children who suffer ADD in our community, it can often be the difference between their being educated and their not being educated. In many cases, to overcome that difficulty they have to have extensive additional teaching and coaching to get even the bare necessities of an education&mdash;to be able to read and write.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is saying that, if you have a child with attention deficit disorder, it does not care if you cannot get that additional help. If you are poor, if you cannot afford to pay for that additional training yourself, that is just too bad. I really do not see how this government feels that the community are winners if there is a generation of children with a disability and the government does not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9110"> provide them and their families with the tools to overcome it. That sort of short-sightedness also applies to children in the categories of having asthma and diabetes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite our objections, this government seems hell&hyphen;bent on proceeding with this part of the bill, and this is not the first time that this government has had a go at the disabled in Australia. It is not the first time, because we fought it off before. When the government attempted to alter the arrears for the child disability allowance in earlier legislation, we defeated it, and I hope we will be able to do that again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also other areas where this government is eroding the support that is being provided to the disabled. In the Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Family and Other Measures) Bill , which we have previously dealt with, there was the introduction of a new disability impairment table for adults who are disabled. Under that new table, thousands of people with disabilities would have to look for work, and where there were no jobs available those people would miss out. That amendment got through on the basis that the Australian Democrats agreed that they would allow its passage if the government would review it at some time in the future. I was quite disappointed by that position, but I cannot get away from the fact that this is a proposition put by the government that does have a responsibility for running the country. Obviously it thinks that it is all right to reduce the eligibility of disabled people for the disability allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something else has happened, probably less obviously, and there was some discussion about it at the estimates committee hearings&mdash;that is, at the same time, there has been a crackdown on the availability of the mobility allowance. I questioned the officers at some length about this issue. They tried to impress upon me that this reduction, or this removal of a number of people who are on the mobility allowance&mdash;or, more accurately, the failure of many people to qualify for the mobility allowance&mdash;was as a result of the fact that there had been some confusion about the mobility allowance. They said the reality was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that, previously, people who were not entitled to it were receiving it and they had just clarified the guidelines to ensure that this did not occur. I beg to differ.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of people who have contacted the opposition have an entirely different view of it as well. They see that they had an entitlement before to an allowance, not a large allowance but just enough to allow people who are quite disabled to get around, to attend living skills classes, to attend venues outside their home that would give them a greater level of skill. Maybe it would not give them a sufficient level of skill to immediately obtain employment, but for some people, particularly those who are disabled, the journey to being able to obtain employment is a very long and arduous one. The early steps may have a tenuous connection on the face of it to eventually getting a job but, in my view, anything that increases the skills and exposure of disabled people to the outside world is a step towards getting them a job. I believe that this government has treated the disabled, both children and adults, despicably. I hope that it reconsiders its position in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 3 of the bill is rather peculiar. The government has changed `family payment' to `family allowance'. We are not opposed to it, but we are a bit puzzled by it. Why this government would bother to make 255 amendments to the Social Security Act just for the purpose of changing the name from `payment' to `allowance' seems to be rather extraordinary, although I suppose there is some ideological basis for it. I am a bit concerned about not only the amendment and the fact that it wastes the time of the Senate in dealing with it but also the cost involved in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the cost of this ideological bent of this government to change `payment' to `allowance'? How much does it cost for the stationery? How much does it cost for the application forms&mdash;reprinting it all, of course, because of the change of name? How much is it going to cost for the publicity to inform people of what is happening? Again, I would like the minister to respond to that when she is on her feet, if she can. How much will it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9111"> cost the community for this change of name, which appears to me to be entirely based on ideology? If the minister has another explanation, I would be very interested to hear it, but I certainly could not think of any other reason.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 4 of the bill deals with the hardship provisions. It standardises the arrangements for determining when severe financial hardship can be invoked to waive ordinary income maintenance and liquid assets waiting periods. A person must have liquid assets of no more than two weeks payment. For the income maintenance and liquid assets test, they must also demonstrate that they are in this financial predicament because of what is, in the view of this government, unavoidable and essential expenditure. This has been a vexed question: what exactly can be the basis for hardship provisions? This seems to be an improvement on the previous position, but I am not sure if it is exactly the ideal. I suppose I have to concede the benefit of a slight loosening up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with `unavoidable and essential expenditure' is that sometimes things occur to a family that may not necessarily come within this category. In those circumstances, should the family have to potentially go without food and lodgings for maybe two weeks? I suppose it is not often that it occurs, but I am sure it does happen. Say, for example, the father of a family takes the only income the family has and goes off and gambles it. Obviously you would not describe that as being essential expenditure but, then again, is it really fair that the family in that situation should go without food for that period if something like that should occur? Obviously the father has done something completely irresponsible, but should the rest of the family suffer as a result? Again, I would be very interested to hear if the department has given any consideration to this circumstance or whether there is some provision that can deal with this sort of situation.</PARA>

Of course we support the first part for all the reasons that I have said already&mdash;I think disabled children need all the help they can get&mdash;but we are a bit concerned that this mechanism extends the period over which income is assessed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R345">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997</XREF>  was first introduced into the parliament, the second reading speech stated that the bill had two key aims. Firstly, it was designed to simplify income support arrangements for parents, regardless of whether they had partners or not. Secondly, it aimed to reduce the social stigma sometimes associated with being on a sole parent pension. Both of these are laudable aims. However, the Democrats are not totally convinced that this bill goes all the way to achieving those aims. But, inasmuch as we believe that it does, we recognise the value of those aims and support them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will look firstly at the simplification aspect. The Democrats have argued for many years that the Social Security Act is far too complex. A simple illustration of that is the measure in this bill to change the name of the family payment back to family allowance. It has taken nearly 50 pages of amendments to make that very basic change. I do not think you need much more demonstration than that of just how huge and incredibly complicated the Social Security Act has become.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are convinced that a simpler act would be fairer to both Centrelink customers and the staff who have the very difficult job of trying to interpret this huge and ever&hyphen;changing morass of legislation. If we could simplify the act, it would also significantly reduce the cost of administering our income support system. We acknowledge that a complex system such as social security does require complex legislation, but we do urge the government to increase their efforts to make the act easier to understand and administer. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9112">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One schedule of the amendments made by this bill will replace two existing payments&mdash;that is, the sole parent pension and the partner allowance&mdash;with a single new payment, the parenting payment. On the surface, this does seem simpler. However, as often happens, if you dig a little deeper, you find that the new payment is in fact paid at two separate rates and under two separate conditions; it just has the single label over the top. So, while there is some alignment of payment conditions, this certainly is not a major step forward in attempts to make the Social Security Act more accessible or simpler for those who have to work within it and receive payments under it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the other core purpose of the bill, as expressed by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), that parts of this legislation are aimed at reducing some of the social stigma on sole parents, it should be noted that the way in which the government intends to achieve this goal, according to the provisions contained in this bill, is by putting longer waiting periods on sole parents, imposing a tougher assets test on them and reducing the portability of their payment. I don't think this is necessarily the nicest way to reduce the social stigma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of minor improvements for sole parents, which we acknowledge. But, overall, as a result of this legislation, we will see a reduction in support to low income families of more than $6 million a year. That is a bit of a price to pay for having a bit less stigma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems that the biggest benefit for sole parents is a change in the name of their payment. I do not necessarily want to underestimate the value of this, because labels are sometimes quite important in our society. I note that the National Council of Single Mothers and Their Children has welcomed the introduction of a more inclusive payment&mdash;one that will be made to all parents whether they have partners or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make the point that, if this is the best the government can do to assist the group of social security recipients who have been shown in study after study to be the group most likely to be in poverty, then we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do have a fair way to go. At this point, however, I would like to put on the record that the Democrats were very pleased to receive a number of commitments from the minister's office in relation to this new payment. These commitments were: that the level of parenting payment paid to sole parents would be legislatively pegged to 25 per cent of male average weekly earnings; that sole parents will remain eligible for both the employment and education entry payments&mdash;at least while those payments still exist; that a sole parent can continue to receive their payment pending any review of their entitlement; and, finally, that sole parents will continue to receive the more adequate pensioner concession card. These are important measures in terms of reducing disadvantage for what is one of the most disadvantaged sections of our community. The Democrats welcome those commitments from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, a further commitment given by the minister's office was that Austudy regulations would be brought on at a later date to ensure that students who are sole parents will remain eligible for the pensioner supplement. I would ask the minister, when she does get the chance to respond to this at some time down the track, if she would put that commitment on the public record for us. These are all vital commitments for the Democrats, and they were instrumental in ensuring our qualified support for this legislation. There are a number of amendments that I propose to move in the committee stage, on behalf of the Democrats, to make the legislation a little fairer. I will talk to those in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make a point about the legislation's stated aim of reducing the social stigma for sole parents and social security recipients. It seems to me that it is a little incongruous. While this aim is a good thing, it does not seem to gel terribly well with the role the government has played in the media debate over recent months about social security fraud. I am sure all senators would have seen some of the recent headlines trumpeting the crackdown on social security fraud. In a few of the headlines from the last few weeks, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9113"> the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> talked about 200,000 cheats and $1,400 million in rip&hyphen;offs on welfare, the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> talked about welfare cheats being stripped of $369 million, and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> had the headline `Red Handed: 330,000 welfare payments stopped'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me, and to the Democrats, that these sorts of factually incorrect headlines do enormous damage to the way in which the community views all social security recipients. If we are talking about people having a stigma attached to them, I think this has a hell of a lot more of an impact on those people than will changing the title of a few payments. Some of the editorials that followed on from these misleading headlines, giving the impression that there are hundreds of thousands of cheats out there, demonstrate how much damage is done and how much that stigma is still attached to welfare recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the light of these factually incorrect statements, and in light of the current bill's stated objective of removing the social stigma from sole parent pensioners, it is important to look at what sort of response the stories did get from the minister and from the government. As far as I am aware, we have not once heard the minister stand up and say, `These headlines grossly misrepresent the truth. The level of fraud in social security is not out of control and it is not out of proportion to fraud in any other sphere of government.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not noticed the minister once defending social security recipients in the face of this media misrepresentation, or playing a constructive role in allaying community fears about the level of welfare fraud or reducing the stigma on those who receive payments. To date, I have not seen this happen even once. Indeed, it seems to me, and to the Democrats, that the minister and the government have done the exact opposite and put out very carefully worded press releases which, whilst not quite saying that all overpayments are due to fraud, leave the very clear impression that this is the case. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment. Minister, is it true that you have been forewarned about the potential disaster to the Great Barrier Reef which is posed by acid sulfate soils? Is it true that you have received advice from Australia's foremost experts on acid sulfate soil management about the magnitude of this problem? What action have you taken on the basis of this advice? What action do you propose to take in light of the information revealed on last night's ABC news report?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="9113" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were specific matters raised in the report but Senator Faulkner's question started off on a much more general tone. As honourable senators would be aware, acid sulfate is a significant issue along the southern New South Wales coast, along the Queensland coast, in the Northern Territory, in Western Australia and even in some areas of South Australia and Victoria. In fact, there is estimated to be some two million hectares of acid sulfate soils in Australia. Developments obviously disturb these soils and it is important that the acid sulfate is properly managed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, if Senator Faulkner is asking whether we are aware that development projects along the Queensland coast as it adjoins the Great Barrier Reef waters need to be carefully managed, yes, I am aware of that. Regrettably, in the past, there have been many developments where that was not the case, largely out of ignorance. People are still learning not only the consequences of acid sulfate soils but also how to effectively manage them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the news report on channel 2 last night&mdash;it was more of a five&hyphen;minute commentary piece in the middle of the news report, quite an unusual occurrence&mdash;it was grossly misleading, because the point is that in the case of the Hinchinbrook development there is an acid sulfate management plan in being. In fact, the original draft of that plan was put out for peer review, including review by Professor White. As a result of that re 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9114"> view, the report was considerably strengthened and the plan that was put into place was a strengthened plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of that plan is to enable the development to take place in a way that does not threaten the world heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef; in other words, to contain th acid sulfate soil during the development process. That, my advice is, is being adhered to, and there is no occurrence in relation to that development that is putting any of the world heritage values at risk. You might be somewhat surprised to hear that, in light of the tenor of the piece on channel 2, but that is in fact the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The plan sets out a number of steps that need to be taken to protect against acid sulfate soils. I will not go into all the details of that at the moment. An independent monitor, the Queensland Acid Sulfate Soil Inspection Team, is in place to monitor the effectiveness of that plan and the deed expressly prohibits the discharge of any water below a pH of six or above a pH of nine, and daily monitoring is being conducted to ensure that these levels are being complied with. In other words, there is in place a plan to protect against acid sulfate soils leaching into reef waters. It is being adhered to; it is being properly monitored; and my best advice as late as today is that there is no threat at all to the Great Barrier Reef or its world heritage values.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, what was so disgraceful about last night's report&mdash;you might remember, if you saw it&mdash;was that they tested the acid sulfate soil and found that in fact it was acidic. The point is: where they tested the soil was where the acid sulfate was supposed to be captured so that it did not get swept into the offshore waters. Did that come out of the channel 2 piece? Of course not. You were led to believe that in the next rains it was all going to be washed into the sea. The plan is to a design, and it is being implemented, to ensure that that is not the case.

<ANSWER PAGE="9114" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Ferguson is quite right that there were claims made of that order&mdash;absolutely extraordinary claims. You have to go back to January 1996 when we first announced our policy to partially privatise one&hyphen;third of Telstra. At that time we talked about it being worth perhaps $8 billion&mdash;in other words the company being worth around $25 billion. What sort of response did we get?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sandpit club of course immediately went absolutely troppo. You had Paul Keating out there using the very words that Senator 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9115"> Ferguson used, that the market would choke on a privatisation of this size. Of course, he had no evidence to support it. It was simply part of the ongoing, monumental scare campaign that they hoped to whip up. Not only were they proven to be monumentally inaccurate but they have never apologised for it. Presumably they will continue to go on burying their heads in the sand on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the level of foreign ownership is concerned, you will recall that we put a limit of 35 per cent on foreign ownership, which would give just under 12 per cent of the company as a maximum for foreign investors. The reality is that this float, this issue, proved so overwhelmingly attractive to ordinary Australians, both retail&mdash;mums and dads, and families&mdash;and institutional investors, that it was only necessary to make available what amounts to about 6.3 per cent of the total of the company for foreign investors. In other words, around 19 per cent of the share offer ultimately found its way into the hands of foreign investors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was not just something that was said in the heat of the election campaign because, despite Mr Keating doing his very best to whip that one up as well and saying that there would inevitably be more sales to foreigners, that we would lose control of the company as soon as we introduced a partial sale, there was a Senate committee report. Do you remember the filibuster that was involved with this lot sending it off to a committee and months of running around the country trying to, again, whip up some antagonism?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we had there was an unholy trio. You know Senator Schacht&mdash;he is the leader of the disgruntled unionist faction in South Australia. We had his colleague from the lunatic far Left fringe in Victoria. He basically heads up his own faction, doesn't he now, Senator Conroy? The last thing you would ever want to put on your CV is that you worked for Kim Il Carr. Nonetheless, he was part of this, and then Senator Lundy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You had this trio saying, `Further pressure to increase the level of foreign ownership will arise from a recognition of the limited scale of domestic share market fund.' What would they know? They clearly did not understand 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> even the basics of the share market, and they didn't want to know, because they have been burying their heads in the sand on this issue right from the outset. It is the biggest conflict of interest in history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only reason they do it is that their masters tell them that that is what they have got to do. It is not the usual story of saying, `Jump!' and their asking, `How high do I jump?' They actually go to the ACTU and say, `How high do you want us to jump on this one?', and the ACTU says, `We know you privatised everything in sight when you were in government, but would you mind doing a backflip from now on, so that we can appeal to our own membership.'

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JX4">Senator MINCHIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the government is proposing is that a claim lodged on behalf of a group cannot cover areas where native title has already been extinguished, for example, on freehold land; it cannot claim exclusive possession of land where native title can only coexist; and it must define the areas and native title rights being claimed. These are very sensible proposals and should not be difficult for properly researched claims to meet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say that the mix&hyphen;up in relation to the Greens is between making a claim and having that claim registered. Claimant groups can seek registration in order to access interim statutory access rights and the right to negotiate. In relation to your press release, I think it is important for you to understand the difference between lodging a claim and having it registered. For registration, at least one member of the claimant group must have or have had a traditional physical connection to some part of the land claimed. That is a very important difference. In relation to the Mabo test, the Mabo decision said that, in order to establish native title, you must prove to the court that you have maintained a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9118"> traditional connection to the land. That is a matter entirely for the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to registration of a claim and the benefits that attach to registration, all we are saying in relation to a claim is that one member of the claimant group must be able to establish that they have or have had a physical connection to the land at some stage in their life. That is simply not an onerous requirement and it does not relate either to the claim being made or to proving the claim in court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill does not restrict the number of claimants in a group. We understand that a lot of these claimant groups are very large indeed. All we are saying is that simply one member out of a whole claimant group, in order to get it registered, has to have or have had some connection with the land at some stage in their life. I think it would contribute to this public debate if people such as Senator Margetts understood what they are talking about, read the bill and understood it, understood the processes involved and understood what the High Court decided in the Mabo case.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

The number of different assessments that need to take place, the number of different peer reviews and the level of monitoring are really quite extraordinary. But I do not apologise for that.

We put in place this process to ensure that, whilst this development took place, those values would be protected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already drawn the contrast between our approach and the approach of the last Labor government. It allowed the acid sulfate soils to be disturbed; left them there for a period of 10 years under Mr Williams and under previous ownership; and did not care at all whether they got washed into the channel. That is the comparison; that is the alternative. That is the way that these things used to be done under Labor. Any comparison between that approach and the current approach, with its degree of scrutiny, management and engineering demand, tells its own story. The bottom line of this development process is that the acid sulfate soils are properly being contained during this construction phase. The plan is working and is being monitored by the Queensland Acid Sulfate Soil Inspection Team.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the great revelation of Senator Faulkner that some of the work started prematurely, I remind Senator Faulkner that I said last year that that had occurred and that there had been some breaches.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McGauran for that question. It was acknowledged last night by Robert Gerard, the President of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, that some of the initiatives we have seen developing in the education and training arena over the last 18 months, led by industry, are world class. A strong role for industry in the training system is a high priority for this government. This will ensure that together we will secure a vocational education and training system that provides Australia and its business with a competitive edge through a highly skilled work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has made very significant reforms in the training system. The national new apprenticeships initiative takes the concept of quality training into new industries and occupations. It will meet the needs of employers and young people. In addition, the Commonwealth in funding through ANTA has committed $560 million in incentives to employers, apprentices and trainees to support up to 220,000 places over the period from 1997 to 1999. New apprenticeships will be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> competency based, and this represents a significant move from the traditional time based apprenticeship system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union is reported in today's paper as providing an apprentice system for children of union members. This is another aspect with the union seeing that having a private provider or user choice system is a very good idea. There are still those in New South Wales who do not think this choice is such a good idea. But, obviously, the CFMEU sees merit in this because it is setting up its own system for apprentices. That would seem to suggest that it too agrees with the government's policies on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On the question of more jobs for school leavers, this government has introduced the jobs pathway program through which we are funding 70 projects to provide assistance to more than 20,000 young people at 1,100 secondary schools across the country. Up to 10,000 young school leavers will be found jobs, and a further 10,000 young people at risk of leaving school early will be encouraged to remain at school.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also pleased to announce that at the ANTA ministerial council last Friday&mdash;and no doubt Senator Carr will be interested in this&mdash;the ministers for vocational education and training endorsed a revised ANTA agreement for submission to their respective state and territory cabinets for approval. Unfortunately, the minister from New South Wales was unable to attend due to parliamentary commitments.</PARA>

But his was not the only success story that night. Senator Carr could attest to the fact that there were a good many other successes, including with older people taking on apprenticeships.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Knowles for the question. This morning I jointly launched the national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural industry strategy with my colleague Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts. The national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural industry strategy is about enabling indigenous Australians to promote their culture, create jobs and generate income. When implemented, it will provide significant economic opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment is still a grave concern for indigenous Australians with an unemployment rate of 38 per cent. Also, only two per cent of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the indigenous working age population are self&hyphen;employed compared with eight per cent for the total working age population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural industry strategy has strong links with the tourism industry. Tourists are interested in the uniqueness and diversity of indigenous culture. Indigenous arts and crafts are estimated to be worth nearly $200 million per annum with tourist purchases of indigenous arts and crafts estimated as being over 50 per cent of total sales. I thought, Madam President, even the opposition would be interested in this in the interests of their constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strategy highlights the importance of promoting and marketing indigenous cultural industries domestically and internationally and is linked to the recently launched national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander tourism industry strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many opportunities through identification of investment opportunities, employment and product development and partnerships in the tourism sector. The strategy will encourage indigenous people to make the most of opportunities such as those available at the Sydney 2000 Olympics and the Paralympics. A productive and progressive partnership between indigenous and non&hyphen;indigenous Australians within the cultural industry must be encouraged if we are to see indigenous people develop economically in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you know, Madam President, this is what indigenous people constantly ask: that they be allowed to be economically independent so that they can have self&hyphen;empowerment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the third of three strategies that have been released over a period of time; the first being the rural industry strategy, the second being the tourism strategy, and now the cultural industry strategy. All are designed to produce employment for indigenous people,

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to matters that Senators Lundy, O'Brien and Murphy raised in relation to the sale of FIRM, I am advised that in accordance with the government's competitive tendering and contracting policy, the Department of Finance and Administration has commissioned a scoping study on the feasibility of the sale of the Commonwealth Payroll Service and its central accounting and payment service, including existing FIRM system software. This scoping study is being conducted by KPMG Corporate Finance. The consultant's final report is due to be provided to the department later this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Contrary to Senator Lundy's assertion yesterday, the minister advises me that preliminary findings of the study indicate that the sale of the CPS and CAPS is feasible. However, until the government has had an opportunity to digest the contents of the final report, no decision will be made in respect of the sale of CPS and CAPS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were questions from Senator Lundy in relation to the accrual budgeting system. The Minister for Finance and Administration advises me that in a completely different scoping study on the implementation of an accrual budgeting framework, the issue of a suitable central financial management system for the Commonwealth was considered.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9128">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scoping study considered a number of alternative system scenarios. Given that firm has a cash accounting system only which is incapable of performing the requirements of an accrual framework, KPMG, who advised the scoping study team on systems related issues, recommended that firms should be replaced by an off&hyphen;the&hyphen;shelf system. Subsequent to the scoping study, the department specified the user requirements for the central system and invited suitable vendors on the OGIT shared systems suite to undertake scoping studies and propose solutions to satisfy these requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I am advised by the Minister for Finance and Administration that, contrary to Senator Lundy's assertion yesterday, no decision has yet been made and no system has yet been purchased. The department is currently evaluating solutions proposed by vendors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators O'Brien and Murphy raised questions in relation to the outsourcing of applications development. In relation to the question on the outsourcing of applications development, I can again provide some information from the Minister for Finance and Administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Department of Finance and Administration has not awarded any contract for applications development or maintenance work in relation to firm and pay systems to IBM GSA. The department has sought bids under the DAS PE63 contract for IT services for application development and maintenance services to supplement in&hyphen;house resources. Contractual negotiations with the preferred bidder, Computer Power, are nearing completion. IBM GSA was not invited to submit a proposal. This is not related to the Department of Finance and Administration IBM GSA contract or the whole of government outsourcing initiative. Almost all government departments have employed contractors in their applications and systems development for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murphy raised a question in relation to the OAS IT security. On the issue of the OAS information technology, the chief executive has indicated that this issue was among the first of the matters he identified as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> requiring resolution and the amalgamation of OAS with the IT outsourcing functions from OGIT. He has indicated his intention of negotiating with the Department of Finance and Administration and IBM GSA to dispense with the services of IBM GSA following the physical collocation of the two functions during December. The OASIT would then move to appoint an appropriate contractor to manage its small in&hyphen;house desktop IT functions under arrangements that would be seen to fully protect the probity and security of access to OASIT information. The details of this change have yet to be developed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The OASIT would not wish this move to be interpreted as any criticism of IBM GSA whose service to the OAS in the short term that has been in place has been commendable if it is seen necessary to avoid any suggestion that IBM GSA could have inappropriate access to OASIT information relevant to contracts in which it may have an interest.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You pointed out during the launch of this booklet that such soils were a serious problem and I am disappointed that you are laughing about the matter now. In fact, you said that $1 million&hyphen;worth of fish from east coast commercial markets were rejected each year due to diseases related to acid sulfate soils. You also said in your speech that this was the tip of the iceberg. The minister's contribution is important; what a tragedy it is that he is unable to heed his own words. What a tragedy it is that he just read a speech about the importance of acid sulfate soil management, but did not actually read the booklet. The minister should listen to the Jack Beale Professor of Water Resources at the Australian National University, Professor Ian White, a world expert on acid sulfate soils.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Professor White said last week was that if Port Hinchinbrook was a chemical factory or a mine it would be shut down. This is the same Professor White who not only reviewed the original acid sulfate management plan for Port Hinchinbrook, but latterly has had an opportunity to look at the actual acid sulfate soil management plan that has been approved by Senator Hill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Hill appears to be very disappointed about is that the ABC has got hold of this management plan. The history of this matter is most interesting. Dr Bowman of the CSIRO found that the original plan, cooked up by Keith Williams, the developer, with the Queensland government, was seriously flawed. Of course, he was not consulted again. The plan was re&hyphen;jigged but the revised plan was not sent back to Dr Bowman. The Queensland government set up its own body to review the revised plan, and surprise, surprise, Madam Deputy President, it got the tick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earthworks proceeded at Port Hinchinbrook; the developer defied Senator Hill, who called 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9130"> for a halt to the work until the plan was approved. There was hardly any change to the proposed plan; stable acid sulfate soils were dug out, left to bake in the sun over months and months&mdash;something you just cannot do with those soils&mdash;and Professor White has looked at the amended plan that was approved by Senator Hill, still finds it inadequate and has called for a close&hyphen;down of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jes Sammut, the author of my booklet on acid sulfate soils, has reviewed the plan and he has found it seriously wanting. Of course, Port Hinchinbrook is just one site along the east coast which has the potential to unleash sulfuric acid into World Heritage waters. But it is the one development site along the coast about which Senator Hill has the power to show some leadership, call a halt to the work, get world&hyphen; respected scientific authorities into the site and do what has to be done before the acid affects the corals, causes heavy metals and ultimately rots the foundations of the resort itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has he done, of course? Nothing. He wants to trash the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. He would not express his confidence in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority because they are willing to stand up to Senator Hill on this issue; they are willing to show some leadership and have some guts on this issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose the only useful thing that has come out of this debate today is that some further publicity has been given to a serious national issue&mdash;that is, the management of acid sulfate soils. As I said in question time, they cover a very large part of coastal Australia. A lesson we have learnt over the years is that they need to be managed carefully and they were not always so managed in the past. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> A lot of current research has taken place on ways of more effectively managing such soils to avoid damage. It is something that we applaud and support, as was demonstrated by my launch of the booklet which Senator Faulkner referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Deputy President, it should be remembered that this was a project that the Queensland Labor government supported and approved. As far as the on&hyphen;site development was concerned, apparently, Senator Faulkner supported it as well. Senator Faulkner, as you might recall, took certain actions to protect some of the vegetation types, but he did not take actions that stopped disturbance of the soils, the criticism of which he is now making here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we inherited this matter, it was a partly developed site. It had been cleared and partly excavated a number of times over a long period. But it also occurred under the Labor government. The acid sulfate soils had been disturbed and they had sat there for 10 years, being weathered and so forth. In complaining about us, he says they were left to withstand one summer. Under him, Labor left them to withstand 10 summers. Of course, that is different, because Labor is in opposition; it is no longer in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor basically supported this project. It is true that there were modifications in relation to foreshore management, but basically Labor supported it. I presume that if Labor had stayed in government, they would have done something similar to us, which was to put in place a management plan to ensure that the further excavation and development of the site was done in a way that would safeguard the site from a number of potential dangers. One of those potential dangers is unwise management of the acid sulfate soils. I presume Labor would have done that, but we did not have the opportunity to find out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important point is that when we came into government we did that. We had the developer sign on to a deed which we believe applied the most onerous, demanding obligations&mdash;he would not like to hear `onerous'; I should say most rigorous obligations&mdash;to ensure that the World Heritage values that are not on the site but are adjacent to the site are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9131"> protected. In other words, in relation to acid sulfate, to ensure that the acid sulfate soils are not washed into the adjoining ocean where they may or may not cause some damage in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We therefore required a plan for acid sulfate management to be approved. We were not satisfied just to leave it at that. We then required that that plan be peer reviewed by two separate scientists. It was peer reviewed. We took into account the advice that was given in those reviews and then applied a more demanding final plan. As I said, that plan went through the approval process, ultimately being approved by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, which has the principal responsibility for oversight of this development for us, in a way that protects the World Heritage values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In question time I set out the safeguards that have been built into that plan to ensure that acid sulfate soils cannot be washed out to sea, even in the wet season, and therefore ensure the world heritage values against any inadvertent flow of water off those soils. The key point in this whole debate is that the best advice that I can get is that the plan is working well, there has been no damage to world heritage values and there is no case to suggest there has been any damage. That really undermines Labor's case. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have real interest in this issue because it was an issue that was widely canvassed earlier this year at a hearing of the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts References Committee in Ballina. A real focus came on this issue of acid sulfate soils and the real inability of our society to deal with the issue because we have not known a great deal about it in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now there is an emerging raft of research on the issue. As the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, said, and rightly so, if the acid sulfate soil had been disturbed on that site and had been exposed&mdash;and therein lies the problem&mdash;then the development should have been stopped point blank. The issue should have been dealt with and not allowed to proceed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The body of research knowledge that is emerging tells us that this problem is far worse than we have even contemplated. It says that we really need to address the issue properly. The suggestion that was put up during question time by Senator Hill that we would bury the acid sulfate soil below the water table once the development had been completed leaves the issue widely open to dispute. What we have here is no solution to the problem whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem starts to exist once the acid sulfate soil is exposed. The acid sulfate soil then oxidises and once water comes upon it, it then forms sulfuric acid. What we have here is a problem that cannot be buried. It does not matter how far you try to bury it because, as we heard in the evidence that was given to us in Ballina, as the water settles on the acid sulfate soil that has been oxidised and the water then comes to the surface, you still have the same problem. You have got the problem of sulfuric acid that will leach into the system. Then you have got the problem in regard to damage to fish life, mangroves, the general environment, corals and so on. Burying it below the water table, as I understand the problem, is not the simple answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst Senator Hill gave undertakings about scrutiny, management and what would or would not be happening during the construction period, the real problem would occur when the construction is finished. I believe that that is the criticism that is being levelled at the project at this stage. The government has not addressed it because the experts cannot address it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a major problem of mounds of acid sulfate soil and what to do with it? Burying it is not the answer. What is the answer? Something should have happened in the first place when the management plan was found to be ineffective, inefficient and was rejigged. We have got the Queensland acid sulfate inspection team overseeing it and my information is that they are not the most experienced people in this country. There are people of far greater expertise. When one has people such as Professor White and others being critical of the current processes, then the government needs to act now because the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9132"> problem is one that does not simply go away by burying it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we need to see is this government not trying to fob off the problem, not pretending that there is an easy remedy to the problem, but dealing directly with the problem. If they had heard the range of experts that I have heard on this issue, they would know that the solution is not simple. It is not simply trying to bury it in the ground. That is something that the government needs to take note of and desperately needs to do something about.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Senator Hogg, my friend on the other side of the chamber, did not tell the Senate was this: this government has put in place one of the most stringent environmental management plans that could possibly be put in place. Senator Hogg was correct in saying that it is not sufficient to merely bury acid sulphate soils. What Senator Hogg did not tell the Senate was that that is only part of the management plan. The other part of the management plan involves the building of ponds, of drainage systems and of treatment of the water. We do not just let this water flow into the channel. The water first has to go into a drainage channel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is an interesting fact. The ABC report last night vindicated the work of this government because in fact what it showed was so-called acidic water being taken from a channel. The whole point of the channel is to stop acidic water flowing out into the passage. The water flows into a channel and then from there it goes to a sump and from there it can be treated. But the ABC did not bother telling people this. This is proof that the system works because this water was not allowed to flow straight out into the channel. What happened when the ALP was in government and these acid sulphate soils were exposed to the sun, not baking for one season but baking for 10 seasons in the sun, and when the run-off flowed directly from there into the passage?

Obviously, as a representative from Queensland, it is something that I have a particularly strong interest in. It is a major asset, both an environmental and economic asset, for the Queensland people and this federal government has a legal responsibility to protect those world heritage values and protect this area from damage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must agree, as Senator Hill and Senator O'Chee have both pointed out, this is a problem that has been visited in the past at least in large part due to the actions of the Labor Party. The basic fact is that the Port Hinchinbrook resort should never have been given the go ahead in the first place.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do have some sympathy for the federal Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) trying to figure out a way of preventing the inevitable environmental damage that will occur from this resort from happening. Basically, he is on a hiding to nothing because there are so many different potential environmental impacts from this resort. Acid sulphate soils is simply one in a very long list. We have to sheet home a large proportion of the blame for that damage to the Queensland Labor Party because it was the Goss Labor government over so many years that bent over backwards to do everything it could to make sure this resort went ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst it is important to ask today what the federal environment minister is going to do about this issue, it is also important for the Senate to ask today what the Queensland Labor Party is going to do about this issue. There is a state election coming up in Queensland in the not too distant future, quite possibly March next year. Peter Beattie, the state opposition leader in Queensland, has been fairly silent about what the Labor Party is going to do about Port Hinchinbrook.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His federal colleague Mr Kerr has been reported in the press over the last few hours calling for work to halt at Port Hinchinbrook. That is always easy to say and I certainly congratulate him for his statements in that regard, but I would like to hear from the state Labor Party about whether they share that position, whether they will do something about this if they get back into government in Queensland next year. I would be very interested to hear what position they will take on that. It is important that Mr Beattie and the Queensland Labor Party make their position clear on this issue. Whilst it is a responsibility of the federal government, it is even more so a responsibility of the state government and it is much easier for them to put on tighter controls and to prevent damage from this development occurring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having mentioned that, the other question that still remains is what the national government is going to do and what the federal environment minister, Senator Hill, is going to do about this issue. It is a matter of great concern to the Democrats that it does appear 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9134"> that, despite the information that has been put forward not just over the last 24 hours but over many months prior to that, the federal government is going to continue to do not very much at all. It is clear that the minister knows about the dangers of acid sulphate soils. He has demonstrated that today in the chamber and from the speeches he has made in the past with the information booklets he has launched. So it is not a matter of his not being aware of the danger and the problems; it is a matter of his not being willing or perhaps not being able to act on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a great concern that a spokesperson on behalf of the minister was reported in AAP last night as saying that there has been no adverse impact on the world heritage values of the area to date. I think that is probably fairly debatable. Even if it is the case, that there has been no adverse impact to date, that gives the Democrats great concern because what do you do once the adverse impact becomes apparent? It means that the acid sulphate has escaped into the channel. The minister might be very skilled but I do not know how he is going to go about sucking all the acid out of the Hinchinbrook channel. It is a little bit late to be worrying about the impact once it becomes apparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are enormous amounts of information that have been given by eminent scientists&mdash;Senator Hill himself calls them eminent scientists&mdash;that this is a disaster waiting to happen. It is a disaster that needs to be prevented now, not one where we sit back and wait for it to happen and then have to do something. The big issue is whether Senator Hill is going to join the Queensland Premier, Mr Borbidge, up in Port Hinchinbrook to celebrate the opening of the first stage of this resort next month, or whether he is going to join the Democrats and others in taking the environmentally responsible path of preventing it from being opened and helping to close it down. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me remind the chamber, Madam Deputy President, that this was a project approved by the Queensland Labor government some decade ago. This was a project that was approved in this very chamber when the opposition was in government&mdash;in fact, approved by the person that has become infamously known as `Richo'. He supported this. This fear has been spread, based on the evidence that the ABC ostensibly took recently where a Cloudy Bay chardonnay bottle was dipped into a channel. The program did not have the truthfulness to demonstrate that that channel was actually running into a sump&mdash;the very reason that it was put there. The ABC did not say that sump is then treated, if the pH factor is too high, to bring it down, and, if it falls below six, it is treated to bring it up to a pH balance of about seven&mdash;it did not include that&mdash;and that water is then released and only then released into the channel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened 10 years ago was not that. It was in fact disturbed and, with the contact of the oxidisation and water, of course it did

In terms of parts per million in the Hinchinbrook Channel, my information is that it is not something that would be detrimental to the reef or to any other aspects of the environment within the channel. Those are the scare tactics. Let me quote, if I have time, from Professor White, under `General Comments':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The overall management philosophy for acid sulfate soils at the Port Hinchinbrook site is in general accord with accepted practice. Acid sulfate soils can be managed in land developments with no risk to the environment, provided they are recognised and treated in accord with best practices. Best practice dictates avoidance of disturbance where possible coupled with treatment of all acid which may be produced by any disturbance. The acid sulfate management plan for Port Hinchinbrook espouses these principles.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The management plan that the minister spoke about&mdash;the management plan that the minister and this government insisted on being upgraded&mdash;meets world standards. Scare tactics are no way to induce people to stop development in Australia. We need development. We need it to be done in a proper fashion. We do not need the peddling of fear to turn people against development in this nation. You people on the other side would be the very first to scream, Senator Murphy, if it curtailed employment. And that is what curtailment of development does; it curtails employment. Here you are knocking Australia again, knocking a development that is of a world class standard and knocking those safeguards, those checks and balances put in place to protect the environment and to protect the world heritage value of the Great Barrier Reef. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say a couple of things about this. Firstly, this is not usual. It is quite abnormal practice. The usual practice in an event like this is for the Advance to the Minister for Finance to be made available to the Senate at the same time as the portfolio budget statements are. We have just heard in this motion that it is the intention of the government to have it referred to the legislative committees as part of the additional estimates process. The additional estimates process, in the main, occupied the consideration of the Senate last week when most of the legislative committees met to consider the estimates in their particular portfolio areas. Some of those committees have concluded their consideration. Some of those committees still have further consideration of those estimates to go and intend to sit tomorrow with a possible spill over tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, the usual practice is for these to be tabled at the same time so that they can be dealt with concurrently with the portfolio budget statements. In the case of some estimates committees, it may well now be the case that they will not meet again before they report to this chamber and thus be unable to deal with the Advance to the Minister for Finance. In the case of other committees that are meeting tomorrow, it would seem appropriate that the government at least give an indication to the parliament that officers be available in those estimates committees to answer questions about the Advance to the Minister for Finance. I think it is appropriate that I indicate now to the chamber that, when the Committee of the Whole sits to deal with the appropriation bills and this matter, subject to the opportunity I might now avail myself  of to see the details of the Advance to the Minister for Finance, I reserve the right to ask questions in the Committee of the Whole on the advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by putting one other reservation down in view of the lateness and the abnormal practice being engaged in here. It may well be that the committees that have met and are deciding the nature of their report to this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9142"> chamber might now wish to meet again or include in their considerations the proposal that they hold over until their next meeting commentary on the Advance to the Minister for Finance. I put those reservations down in order to later be able to take up the options that I have referred to and to not be accused of bad faith when I do. I also do so in view of the lateness of the document and the unusual practice being engaged in here by the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continuing relevance and value of the Commonwealth to its members is well demonstrat ed by the fact that 51 member states attended the Edinburgh meeting, 43 of them represented by their head of government or head of state. It is a particular pleasure to record that Fiji was among those 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9145"> members, taking its place again at the Commonwealth table with the wholehearted support of my government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was my first CHOGM. It reinforced for me the strengths of the Commonwealth:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> it spans a broad diversity of nations, developed and developing, from all corners of the globe and representing a quarter of the world's population</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> its members share a common heritage of language, traditions and values, which forms the basis for the Commonwealth's ability to reach consensus and work constructively on many issues</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> it has perhaps the widest grass&hyphen;roots support amongst its member countries of any international body, with a vast network of associated organisations bringing together people from all walks of life&mdash;these personal and professional links are the lifeblood of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These strengths underpin the value of the Commonwealth to Australia. The Commonwealth also complements our key bilateral relationships and our focus on regional forums such as APEC and the South Pacific Forum. It is the principal avenue for our engagement with many Commonwealth countries beyond our immediate region. As the third largest financial contributor to the Commonwealth, Australia has a positive role in promoting the economic and social development of those countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outcomes of the Edinburgh meeting were good&mdash;for Australia and for the Commonwealth as a whole. I should say at the outset that the meeting's success&mdash;and its harmonious and constructive atmosphere&mdash;owed much to the capable chairmanship of Tony Blair. I was pleased to be able to work closely and effectively with him. The United Kingdom was an excellent host, and the people of Edinburgh and Scotland gave us a warm welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the first time, CHOGM focused its discussions on a theme&mdash;Trade Investment and Development: the Road to Commonwealth Prosperity. That economic focus was reinforced by the inaugural Commonwealth Business Forum, held immediately before CHOGM.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was one of several heads of government asked to address the Forum. It was an opportunity for me to argue the case for Commonwealth member countries to open their markets and economies if they are to maximise the opportunities globalisation can offer. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outcome of CHOGM's discussions on its economic theme was the Edinburgh Commonwealth Economic Declaration, Promoting Shared Pros 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> perity. The declaration expresses the economic principles shared by Commonwealth members and is the companion to the 1991 Harare Declaration, which set out the core political and human rights principles of the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The declaration is significant in the degree of common ground reached among developed and developing members on the need for continuing trade liberalisation, the importance of encouraging investment flows&mdash;especially through sound macroeconomic policies and financial systems, strong regulatory and supervisory frameworks and good governance&mdash;and the crucial role of the private sector in achieving economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this good outcome reflected wide support for trade liberalisation, the meeting showed we have some way to go in winning universal acceptance of the value of a new round of global trade negotiations. As I said in my address to the Business Forum, Australia believes a new global trade round should be launched by the end of the century. There is support for a new round among other Commonwealth members&mdash;but it is not unanimous.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The declaration recognises that some countries need help in adjusting to and taking advantage of globalisation. governments need to facilitate the sometimes difficult adjustments required, and explain and manage reforms in a way which ensures community understanding and support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to advise the Senate that Commonwealth leaders welcomed and strongly endorsed Australia's initiative to respond to this need by establishing a Trade and Investment Access Facility under the Commonwealth umbrella.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The facility will help Commonwealth members manage the potential economic and social impacts of trade and investment liberalisation. My announcement of Australia's contribution of $1.5 million over three years to start the Facility was backed up by funding pledges from Canada, Britain and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I see this not only as a practical and constructive response to the concerns of many developing countries about the impact of opening up to the global economy but also as a means of helping generate the momentum of trade liberalisation world wide and opening up markets for our exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outcome on climate change was also a good one for Australia's national interest. Against many expectations and dire predictions of Australia being isolated on this issue, the economic declaration advanced our interests by recognising that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9146">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> as a general principle, the costs of protecting the environment should be borne in accordance with shared and differentiated responsibilities</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> both developed and developing countries have to play a part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to solve what is a global problem</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a successful outcome at the climate change conference in Kyoto would involve realistic and achievable goals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Edinburgh meeting also reinforced the importance attached by the Commonwealth to the principles of democracy, good governance and human rights set out in the Harare declaration. Heads of government confirmed the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group's mandate to respond to situations where the Commonwealth's principles are seriously or persistently violated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We bluntly told Nigeria that it must improve its human rights record and return to democracy. Nigeria remains suspended from the Commonwealth, with the Ministerial Action Group authorised to invoke various measures if it considered these would encourage a return to democracy and respect for human rights. If Nigeria's transition to democratic government is not completed by 1 October 1998, heads of government will consider its expulsion and further sanctions. We also condemned the military coup in Sierra Leone and agreed to continue its suspension from Commonwealth meetings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outcome on membership was also positive in maintaining the integrity of the Commonwealth by emphasising the common threads which unite an otherwise diverse group. Leaders agreed that, to qualify for membership, countries should have a constitutional association with an existing member, comply with the Harare declaration and accept Commonwealth norms and conventions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as our contribution to these outcomes, Australia's strong commitment to the Commonwealth was demonstrated in my announcement of an expansion of Australia's assistance for Commonwealth sport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is the Commonwealth's largest sports donor, seeing the social, health and economic benefits for young people of participation in sport and the important role of sport in strengthening Commonwealth ties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will continue the successful Protea sports program in South Africa, which was due to wind up next year, and work with South Africa to extend it to other parts of Commonwealth Africa, with funding of $1.8 million. We will also extend support for junior sports development in the Caribbean, with funding of $1.35 million. And, subject to a review, our sports development program in the South Pacific, ASP2000, will be extended until 2006. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's support for the Commonwealth was also expressed in my offer&mdash;which was warmly accepted&mdash;that Australia host CHOGM in 2001. It is very fitting that Australia's Commonwealth friends will be able to join us in our celebration of the centenary of federation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the great values of CHOGM is the opportunity it provides for formal and informal discussions with a range of leaders, establishing the personal contacts which are such an important part of strong bilateral relationships. It was, of course, a particular pleasure to meet President Mandela for the first time&mdash;he kindly invited me to visit South Africa and I reiterated how welcome a visitor he would be in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My discussions with Mr Blair in London, building on our meeting earlier this year, set the tone for our close cooperation in Edinburgh on a number of issues, including climate change. We also had a useful exchange on what is one of the few irritants in our bilateral relationship&mdash;the indexation of pensions paid to former residents of the United Kingdom who now live in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My meetings with Mr Goh Chok Tong and Dr Mahathir allowed a very useful discussion about the financial instability in Southeast Asia, including appropriate action at the forthcoming APEC leaders meeting. It was also good in the lead up to the Vancouver meeting to talk with this year's chair of APEC, the Canadian prime minister, Mr Chretien, and to discuss the Ottawa Treaty on landmines which Mr Downer will sign on behalf of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My meeting in Edinburgh with Mr Haiveta, the deputy prime minister of Papua New Guinea, allowed me to hear about the drought afflicting our closest neighbour. I repeated Australia's determination to help the government and people of Papua New Guinea get through this very difficult period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, my subsequent visit to Indonesia&mdash;my second as Prime Minister&mdash;coincided with developments of crucial importance to Indonesia's future, and to the future of the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the timing, it was both inevitable and in keeping with Australia's deep and abiding interests in the bilateral relationship that the financial situation in the region and its implications for Indonesia were a focus of my meetings with President Soeharto and his ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My offer that Australia was ready to participate in any IMF package to assist Indonesia underlined the strength of our commitment, as a friend and neighbour, both to the partnership with Indonesia, and to the Asia Pacific region whose future Australia and Indonesia share.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is not a fair&hyphen;weather friend. Our offer showed that we are a reliable neighbour and member of our regional community, prepared to help out during difficult periods. Moreover, our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9147"> response has been warmly welcomed by leaders in the region and demonstrates Australia should be confident about her place in our region and the regard in which it is held by her neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is in our national interests that the significant economic progress made by Indonesia over the last thirty years&mdash;progress which has meant better lives for the majority of Indonesian people&mdash;is continued. Stability and prosperity in Indonesia and wider region are important for Australia, for our economic prospects, and for the living standards and jobs of Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is confident that the measures Indonesia has agreed with the IMF will help stabilise Indonesia's currency and lay the basis for good growth in the medium term. While I was in Jakarta I launched a joint venture between the Commonwealth Bank and Bank Internationale Indonesia. This enterprise is a timely and strong expression of confidence in Indonesia's economic future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also a measure of the growing commitment of the private sectors in both our countries to work together for mutual benefit. Our commercial relations with Indonesia are now very significant and growing apace. Our two&hyphen;way merchandise trade grew by 20 per cent last financial year to $5.2 billion, and two&mdash;way services trade grew to $1.3 billion in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The numbers of Indonesians and Australians travelling in both directions for business, education and tourism are also growing strongly. About 360, 000 Australians visited Indonesia in 1996 and 150,000 Indonesians came here. There were more than 16,000 Indonesians studying here in 1996. Those contacts are deepening understanding between our two countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our commitment to strengthening the relationship with Indonesia was also marked during the visit by my announcement of</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the opening of six new honorary consulates, four of them in eastern Indonesia&mdash;the region covered by the Australian Indonesian Development Area&mdash;which will give a boost to our trade and investment links</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">NATIONAL TRANSMISSION NETWORK SALE BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Transmission Network Sale Bill 1997, together with the National Transmission Network (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997, implement the Government's decision announced in the last Budget, to sell the National Transmission Network.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the election we announced that we would increase the national broadcasters' responsibility for transmission of their programs. These bills provide the ABC and SBS with a direct commercial relationship with transmission service providers. The ABC and SBS have been seeking such a relationship for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sale of the transmission network will provide a range of benefits. The ABC and SBS, and other network users, will finally operate in a purchaser/provider relationship with service suppliers. Transferring this operational activity to the private sector will produce the scope for greater client focus and responsiveness that flows from normal commercial practice. In addition, it sets the scene for a greater degree of competition in the transmission services market, particularly with the introduction of digital terrestrial broadcasting. Sale proceeds will be used to further reduce the public debt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In agreeing to sell the network, the Government recognised the importance of safeguarding important broadcasting policy objectives. We have made it clear that the maintenance of existing ABC and SBS coverage and service quality, particularly for regional and remote communities, is a prerequisite.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, we will ensure that existing Community Service Obligations will be preserved, including those for network users such as Radio for the Print Handicapped, remote commercial satellite broadcasting services, self&hyphen;help retransmission groups and emergency service operators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the medium term, we recognise that there is likely to remain limited competition in the transmission services market, especially outside major metropolitan centres.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against this background, these bills balance the desire to maximise the benefits of establishing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9149"> commercial synergies, with the need for competitive safeguards to protect the Government's broadcasting and social policy objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Network will be transferred to one or more national transmission companies which will have agreed contracts with the ABC and SBS spelling out transmission requirements. These companies will be sold to the network purchaser, or purchasers, with the contracts in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A compact with the ABC and SBS will spell out the Government's transmission coverage and quality expectations&mdash;in return for full funding of the costs of the broadcasters' five year transmission contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The onus will therefore be on the ABC, SBS and other users to ensure that adequate and appropriate transmission services are obtained to meet their needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bills provide a regulatory framework to underpin these contractual arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is necessary to ensure the continuity of contractual arrangements in the event of on&hyphen;sale of the network, and to safeguard against the transfer of assets necessary for the continuation of ABC, SBS, Radio for the Print Handicapped services and emergency services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, this bill contains provisions requiring Ministerial approval before transfer of any assets associated with these "nominated services". This requirement will enable the Minister to ensure that the proposed transferee adopts the conditions of the previous contracts with the ABC, SBS, and Radio for the Print Handicapped operators in relation to their core performance obligations. The provision will also allow an assessment of the likely commercial or financial viability of the proposed transferee to further safeguard the continued provision of national broadcasting services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation also provides for an access regime similar to that put in place for the telecommunications industry for the benefit of certain nominated customers. The access regime will guard against any imbalance in negotiating power, which could have led to essential transmission services and facilities not being available, or only being available at monopoly prices. The access regime will:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">guarantee access to transmission services for the ABC, SBS and the Radio for the Print Handicapped operators, and will</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">guarantee access to existing Network sites and towers for groups such as community broadcasters, self&hyphen;help retransmission groups, remote commercial satellite broadcasters and emergency services, as well as the ABC, SBS and Radio for the Print Handicapped. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the parties are unable to reach agreement on the terms and conditions to apply, they will have recourse to the ACCC to arbitrate the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This combination of contractual and legislative provisions will balance the likely market power of new network owners to ensure continued access by national broadcasters and other nominated users on reasonable terms and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commercial users of the network will have recourse to standard fair trading legal safeguards, including those under Part 3A of the Trade Practices Act 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new arrangements also require a number of technical changes to other portfolio legislation. The National Transmission Network (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997 amends the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, the Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to allow the broadcasters to deal directly with transmission service providers, and to enable the ABC and SBS to maintain control over the Radiocommunications spectrum used to broadcast their services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABC and SBS will also be able to establish their own transmission services. This power, together with the ability of the broadcasters to purchase future requirements from other providers, will provide commercial leverage and introduce contestability into the market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABC and SBS will report to the Parliament, through their annual reports, on any significant changes in transmission coverage or quality of national broadcasting services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABC and SBS will be responsible for dealing with any complaints from the public about reception quality. In the unlikely event that a suitable and timely response is not provided by the broadcasters, and a substantial problem appears to exist in relation to changed transmission coverage of a community, the Minister will have the option of directing the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) to investigate the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this contractual and legislative package, the ABC and SBS will at last have a direct commercial relationship with the provider of their transmission services, and a degree of flexibility in determining how best to meet their future transmission needs. At the same time, the Australian public can be confident that coverage and signal quality for national broadcasting services will be protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, self&hyphen;help groups, emergency service operators, and remote commercial satellite service providers will be protected by the access regime. Capped charges in contracts or supplementary funding will ensure that they are not financially disadvantaged.   
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9150">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Transmission Network Sale Bill 1997 also contains some technical requirements to facilitate the sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These include provisions to ensure, if necessary, that ownership of fixtures can be separated from ownership of the land on which they are located. Some transmission facilities have been built on non&hyphen;Commonwealth land and the power to "sever" the fixtures from the land is needed to make it clear that the Commonwealth is the owner of Network assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also ensures that the new Network owner will not be subject to State and Territory planning and environmental laws for facilities existing or under development at the time of the sale. Of course, a new owner will be subject to all planning and environmental requirements for new facilities or substantial changes to existing ones.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sale proceeds are expected to return to the Budget in 1998&hyphen;99 as an offset to outlays. The Government has agreed that total outlays for transmission services after the sale will be contained within current forward estimates. No additional resources are required for the negligible financial impact of administering the regulatory arrangements contained in these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These bills will allow the timely completion of the sale of the transmission network. As promised, the Government will deliver the benefits of a more commercial transmission environment, and give the national broadcasters the direct responsibility for transmission of their programs which they have sought for so long. At the same time, the bills provide the safeguards necessary to preserve the Government's national broadcasting and other social policy objectives.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1997 No. 282 and made under the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">To translate that motion into understandable English, I am opposing a regulation brought forward by the government which involves enormous fees being levied on film and literature in this country for the purpose of classification&mdash;that is, classification and censorship. I understand from the government that the aim of this matter is to make the business of having classification of films and literature a user pays operation in which people who put forward films or pieces of literature for classification will pay for the cost of that classification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going to point out why that does not occur; I am going to point out why these regulations are a breach of faith with past commitments&mdash;at least, inherent commitments of the Senate&mdash;and I am also going to point out why they are going to have a decidedly detrimental impact on small producers of film and literature in Australia in particular. That must concern us all because it will lead to a diminution of the output of both those categories of art and their contribution to the Australian community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These fee increases represent a second set of increases imposed by the Office of Film and Literature Classification. The fees were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9151"> previously increased dramatically on 1 January last year. The fees were more than doubled, in some instances, on that occasion. With the new fees effective from 1 November this year, the total increase over the 18-month period amounts to: for film, 360 per cent; for video, 130 per cent; for computer games, 69 per cent; and publications, which did not cost anything to classify before last year, have gone from zero to $130.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Appeal fees&mdash;that is, for people who are appealing against the classification applied to their books, comics, videos and computer games&mdash;involve an even bigger increase. In the last 12 months, there has been a 700 per cent increase in appeals against film classifications. The fee increases are even greater than the Office of Film and Literature Classification commissioned consultant inquiry that the so-called pivotal report recommended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This circumstance has a heavy impact on small players right around Australia. The fees are the same whether you are Village Roadshow or whether you are a specialty, high quality, small producer such as David Bradbury or Michael Cordell. Whether you are selling 10,000 videos or you are a community group which is making 20 videos for private sale, you pay the same classification cost. I repeat that: if you are a small specialty video producer, you pay the same as a large company producing tens of thousands of videos. Obviously an increase in the fee from $500 to $1,130 for a 90-minute film, as proposed here, will not make that much difference to the big player, to the multinational, but it is going to have a profound impact on the small player. It is going to, in effect, prevent the production of small quality videos. It is going to be inhibitory as far as their production and distribution around this country are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, when we come to literature&mdash;and some might cavil with comics being under the definition of `literature' but, as an avid comic reader in my earlier years, I have to side with comic distributors and those who use them&mdash;if you are a small independent comic importer and you want to sell just a dozen copies of that comic, it would be simply uneconomical to do so in these cir 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cumstances. You have to pay $130 to have them classified if there is some matter in the comic, such as nudity, which might lead you to have to submit the comic for classification. Eighteen months ago, there was no such fee. People could introduce small quantities of comics, books and so on for distribution in Australia. The niche market there had full range, but here is a very strong deterrent to people to do so. So small numbers of specialty literature, including that example of comics, simply will not be imported any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has argued that the fee structure has to be uniform for small and big players, otherwise it would be classified as a tax and, therefore, would be unconstitutional. Presumably, they have to base their fee on recovery costs only. When the fee was increased in 1996, the Senate then threatened to disallow it. That is the first tranche of classification fees. However, a Senate inquiry which ensued recommended against the disallowance of that set of fees in January 1996 and said, in effect, `Let's give the government another chance.' Here we are with the second tranche of these fees. Last time around, that committee recommended that the government consult closely with the industry before this second round of fees was put in place and that a Senate committee inquire into the impact and the acceptability of the second round of fees. There has been no such inquiry by any Senate committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question which then arises is: are these fees legal? My advice is that they are probably not. I know that recently Senator Bolkus asked about these fees in estimates committees and was told&mdash;he can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that the fees are for full cost recovery. For this year, it appears that the fees are going to be more than cost recovery for the second part of the year, but they are going to be argued as cost recovery over the whole of the year because the fees were lower before the introduction of this current set of fees. I do not think that will hold up in court. Moreover, it does appear that the Office of Film and Literature Classification is anticipating it may have to introduce tax legislation to maintain these fee increases next year. If that is the case, why not now?</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9152">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a wide range of producers and distributors in Australia who are against these fees. I suspect that many people in the production and sale of literature and film around this country do not know what is coming or do not know what impact this will have on their business. Certainly those who are aware of it are vehemently opposed to these fees being passed by regulation through the Senate. They include organisations such as the Australian Visual Software Distributors Association, the Eros Foundation and the Australian Independent Distributors Association&mdash;the latter being filmmakers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many sorts of businesses will be affected. I have referred to some of those, but let me point to a few. There are 25 small comic book importers, such as Impact Records in Canberra, Half a Cow in Sydney and Polyester in Melbourne. There are the Australian producers of small scale films such as documentaries, the sexual erotica industry, the importers and distributors of the high quality foreign language films from Europe and Asia, and the independent producers throughout the English speaking world working outside the Hollywood studio system. In short, this formula might be okay for the Hollywood big guys&mdash;it is not going to be more than a pimple on their back&mdash;but it is going to have a huge impact on the small home&hyphen;grown producers and, in particular, quality producers of film, video and literature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It in that sense is regressive. It in that sense is bad for the arts industry, for the creative talent that there is in this country. There ought to be a better answer than this one. Whatever the answer is, if the government is insistent on full cost recovery then it ought to be weighted so that the big producers pay more. It appears there is a legal inhibition to that. What we have got here, effectively, is a doctrinaire approach by the government which is going to hit small players around this country. The government ought to be doing better than that. Simply to say, `User pays,' regardless of the impact and the detriment that occurs to industry, particularly the creative industries in this country, is not good enough. That is why I oppose these regulations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition has concern with these regulations and part of that concern was spelled out during the Senate estimates hearings last week. Our concerns are twofold, and they are concerns that I think Senator Brown has canvassed pretty well already.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first concern we have is that these regulations, these charges, that the government is proposing are charges that will have a very strong, direct and negative impact on diversity. They are charges which the big players in the industry can accommodate and factor in to their costs, but because the charges are the same across the board their impact on the smaller players will make it much more difficult for those players to sustain those fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fee structure that the government is still pursuing, combined with the higher fees, has a direct impact, I think and fear, on diversity in this area. It is not just the fees on their own. We say to the government: we do not mind your recouping this amount of fees from the system, but the amount that you are expecting to recover for this financial year, combined with the fee structure, makes it a system that we would have to oppose. We maintain that there is a level up to which it can be argued that fees can be sustained across the board. But we are concerned that, after a certain level, the combination of the amount raised and the fee structure which hits everyone, small or large, with the same amount would have a deleterious impact on diversity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown mentioned the impact on people like David Bradbury. He is one of the players. But let us acknowledge that there is a very big market in the community for niche films, documentaries and the like. To have them in all their diversity pinned to the same amount as the big Hollywood features is something that the government has to reconsider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say to the government: look at alternatives. For instance, rather than pick on the minor players and the diversity of players that this measure seems to do, accommodate usage of a particular video, a particular film, and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9153"> maybe pick up more through the high volume turnover.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second important issue that we are concerned about is the constitutional aspect of this legislation. In the estimates committee I think officials made it clear that, in respect of next year's charging structure, they would have to introduce a new regime and bring in tax laws to recoup the sorts of amounts which they are looking at recouping next year with increased fees. Their concern is that, unless they use the tax legislation, the fees and charges would be unconstitutional because the fees and charges would extract from the community much more than it would cost to run the film classification system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is next year. The concern we have now is as to this year's regime and the charging structure that the government has proposed. Our concern here is the same one: we think that the actual costs that were provided to the committee, the actual level of fees, allow a fair degree of concern about what the government is doing, because a full year effect will raise more than they should reasonably be allowed to raise for the cost of the classification system&mdash;not for the whole cost of administration or other parts of the administration of this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has got to be some doubt, I think, in respect of constitutionality. But, putting that aside for the moment, our real concern is the combined impact of the existing fee structure and its high fees on diversity. Particularly for that reason, we support Senator Brown's disallowance resolution.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond briefly to this matter. Senator Bolkus knows full well that, prior to some recent increases, this industry has not had increases for a number of years and that increases were proposed by the previous government. You yourself, Madam Acting Deputy President, may be familiar with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been made of the charges to the industry and the nature of those charges. I think it is important to point out that, as I am advised, on the basis of population the 1 November 1997 fees for classification of a feature film in Australia are lower, Senator 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Brown, than those charged in countries such as New Zealand, Canada, the United States of America and Britain. So failure to allow these amending regulations will result in the industry and, in particular, the film industry, paying fees which do not even approach the recovery of costs associated with the provision of classification services by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am further advised that the revised regulations prescribe differential fee scales which take into account views expressed by industry during consultations on this matter which were conducted during 1996 and 1997. I am advised they were very broad consultations over that period of time. Regular and ongoing contact is maintained with the Motion Picture Distributors Association, the Australian Video Retailers Association, the Amusement Machine Operators Association and the Eros Foundation. There is, perhaps, a less easy involvement with the Australian Independent Distributors Association which, I am advised, was formed in August this year to represent independent cinema film distributors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to that matter, I am advised that consultations with members of the group have been conducted informally and that the group has neither sought nor been involved in formal consultations with senior departmental officers since its formation&mdash;since August 1997, and that is perhaps not surprising&mdash;and that members of this group were nonetheless involved in formal consultations on the subject of the fees prior to the formation of the new body. In so far as you can say it is possible, the views of the group have in fact been taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could go on ad infinitum if we wanted, but the bottom line is this: the consultations have been made with a wide range of people&mdash;I have highlighted that. I have indicated that, if we do not proceed with these amending regulations, you will have a very viable industry paying fees way under those paid in other countries. The only point which I think is worth making in addition to that is that these regulations give effect to matters that were put forward by the industry during the consultations&mdash;that is what these regulations do. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9154">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the matters that were put forward in these consultations which I think need to be taken into account are matters such as reduced fees for simultaneous applications for the classification of films for public exhibition and for sale or hire, reduced fees for films which had been edited following a prior classification, differential time ban fees for film classifications, differential fees for public exhibition and sale or hire classifications, and differential fees for computer game applications. The government strenuously urges parties, as dimly as the chance appears, to support these regulations.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Justice (Senator Vanstone) and Senator Bolkus for those contributions but it does not rest there. I go back again to say that small film and video producers in this country are faced with massive increases in fees which are going to affect their businesses in a way that is not going to touch the big feature film producers which were a feature of the minister's delivery. For a small film producer, the classification fee going from $500 to $1,130 will make a big difference. For a whole range of video and literature classifications, the massive increase in fees&mdash;of course, there were no fees at all 18 months ago on much of the literature that is being classified&mdash;is going to make a big difference. Nothing that the minister said is going to offset the fact that small producers especially in this country are going to be hit by these big fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The big fees are coming in not because they are higher in some categories elsewhere overseas; they are coming in to fulfil a government philosophy which says that everybody should have to pay the same amount of money for the time it takes to classify their product regardless of who they are, whether they are MGM and Hollywood or whether they are a small producer at an arts school or a specialty art house in Australia producing quality literature and quality film.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These fees are enormously regressive. The government is going to recoup $2.3 million this year and $5.4 million next year. I would like to know where the extra $2 million is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coming from and what proportion of that is coming out of the small Aussie productions, as against the amount that is going to be extracted from the multinationals. Multinationals can bear this quite well; it is our own arts industry that we are concerned about. Nothing the minister has said has assuaged the concern I have about that industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister indicated that the players have been adequately consulted. That is not the feedback I and my office have had. There is a feeling out there that people were not consulted adequately about these fees, they are opposed to the fees now and they want the government to find another way. I put it to the Senate that we ought not be passing these regulations, that the least we could do is fulfil an earlier request in reviewing the first tranche of fees by the appropriate Senate committee that any future fees also go to a Senate committee, so that the public does get an opportunity to have input and so that the players do have an independent alternative to a government assessment of their plight before enormous increases in fees like this are levied on them. I support the disallowance motion and hope that the rest of the Senate will do likewise.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was previously addressing that part of the explanatory memorandum which dealt with this, but perhaps an overview in a more detailed fashion might address the concerns that Senator Harradine had. Clause 6 of the bill, which is the subject of opposition amendment No. 2, deals with two quite different sets of rights&mdash;namely, the first&hyphen; and second&hyphen;tier persons, as they are called.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In clause 6, the first&hyphen;tier people are basically APS officers who have gone to Commonwealth employment outside the APS. They are deemed to be on leave without pay and can return at any time. Their service outside the APS counts for all purposes. These rights continue indefinitely for Commonwealth office holders and, normally, for three years for everyone else. This category covers anyone who left in the last three years. An example could be someone like a member of the APS who left to join Telstra or some other statutory authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second set of rights are those of so&hyphen;called second&hyphen;tier persons. This term covers both first&hyphen;tier people who become second&hyphen;tier after three years and also APS officers who are transferred to a Commonwealth authority from the APS as a result of the transfer of APS functions to that authority. These second&hyphen;tier persons have no automatic right of return to the APS unless their career is adversely affected or they face retrenchment from the Commonwealth authority that they are working with. They can, however, apply for gazetted vacancies which are only available to current APS officers, and their non&hyphen;APS employment is normally recognised for long service leave purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While overall numbers cannot be estimated with precision, the assessment is that there are about 50,000 people who have first&hyphen; or second&hyphen;tier rights. Of this number, there are about 700 on leave from the APS because they are working under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act 1984&mdash;in other words, they are MOPS, as referred to by the opposition. As indicated in the second reading speech, the current provisions, which cover 60 pages of the current act, are very complex and represent a considerable liability for APS 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9156"> agencies. These mobility provisions were critically commented on by the McLeod report as quoted at 3.3.11 of the explanatory memorandum. The government is proposing their replacement with a simpler model, subject to appropriate transitional arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The JCPA accepted the need for a simpler system for the future. The committee gave careful consideration to the transitional arrangements. In relation to APS officers working for members of parliament or the Governor&hyphen;General or as statutory office holders, the committee recommended that the Prime Minister should exercise the power under clause 21 of the Public Service Bill to issue a general direction to agency heads stating that agency heads must grant leave without pay to Australian Public Service employees to take up statutory appointments, employment under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act, which I mentioned, or employment under the Governor&hyphen;General Act. In effect, this would allow these people to then return to the APS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This recommendation has been accepted by the government. The JCPA supported the principle of transitional arrangements and at paragraph 11.49 made the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that in the interests of the efficient and effective management of the APS, it is reasonable to impose a time limit on the continuation of present mobility rights.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is the view of the government that there should be a limit to those mobility rights. The JCPA went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the transitional period should be extended to three years to allow:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a realistic transition period . . . and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> APS management a longer period to manage any influx of former employees to the APS.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That recommendation was accepted by the government. I refer to the explanatory memorandum at 3.3.15 which deals with that. This means that current rights will continue for up to three years if a person otherwise remains entitled to exercise them. The person can always leave the APS or leave their employment and go and work in the private sector. That will be done by regulation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition amendment would have the effect of keeping alive for an indefinite period a set of what the government believes to be very complex arrangements which are ill suited to APS arrangements. The amendment also fails to recognise that these mobility provisions were first introduced when most Commonwealth employment was under the Public Service Act and goes back to 1978 when you had Australia Post and Telstra as part of the APS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the government's view that a different approach is now needed. The majority report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee did not refer to these issues. However, the minority Democrat report saw merit in removing the automatic safety net of the right to return to the APS. For those reasons, the government cannot agree to this amendment and will be opposing it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened carefully to what Senator Ellison just said and what Senator Faulkner said beforehand. I made certain comments before the debate was interrupted. I was interested to hear what the minister has just said. I was looking for the explanatory memorandum. I was trying to find that reference, which I can see now. It relates to the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter does raise quite considerable issues. I was frankly surprised. I did not know that so many people would be affected, that some 700 officers of the Public Service would be affected because they are under the MOP(S) act. That is a substantial number of people. I am not at this stage prepared to, in effect, limit their rights. It may not be limiting their rights. I can understand what the government is saying. It is saying that the new Public Service is to be a streamlined, well&hyphen;managed organisation, et cetera. It seems to assume that it is not now. I hesitate to make that remark. Like all of us, there are some good bits and some bad. There are some excellent areas of the Public Service, as we all know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does worry me a bit now that you mention there are some 700 people likely to be affected. I would like to know how these 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9157"> people are likely to be affected and are likely to respond. Is a three&hyphen;year period sufficient for those persons to give consideration to what then to do? Will it mean that the older employees who are under the MOP(S) act will choose to go back to departments whereas the younger ones who may feel that they have more show of getting back into the Public Service in some other way will remain?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What effect will this have on the advice that is given to members of parliament and I suppose to parliamentary committees? I do not know whether we are talking about those people who are working for parliamentary committees. I would really like to have a better look at this. I would be inclined to move for the adjournment of this legislation until a later hour of the day or until the next day of sitting.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might be of assistance to Senator Harradine. I mentioned that it was a recommendation of the JCPA that the Prime Minister should exercise his power under clause 21 of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R269">Public Service Bill 1997</XREF> to issue a general direction to agency heads stating that they must grant leave without pay to those employees who take up employment under the Members of Parliament (Staff) Act. This direction should cover existing Australian Public Service staff who may need to seek an extension to their current arrangements as well as staff seeking to move to such employment in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>

We can see merit in removing the automatic safety net of a right to return to the APS provided there are clear guidelines for granting applications for leave without pay and an avenue for external review should applications be refused.

They specifically prevent agency heads from entering into individual workplace agreements with parliamentary service employees. As I said earlier in the debate on the Public Service Bill, we are moving these amendments for two reasons. Firstly, the secretive nature of AWAs precludes full accountability for the expenditure of taxpayer funds and would enable deals to be made between a secretary and a Public Service employee. Those deals would not be open to public scrutiny. Secondly, it would enable different terms and conditions to be set for the same job within the Public Service, which is something that the Democrats do not see as appropriate or desirable within the Public Service context. We recognise that there may be occasions when an AWA is appropriate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This letter goes, I think, to a very important issue for the committee to give consideration to: the issue of misbehaviour as a ground for removal from office of a Clerk. As far as the opposition is concerned, we believe that there needs to be a capacity for the houses of parliament to remove a Clerk on grounds of gross incompetence. It seems to us that if a Clerk proves to be patently incapable of carrying out the duties of the office, that ought to be sufficient grounds for his or her removal, otherwise the relevant house department and, I believe, the institution of the parliament as a whole would suffer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did raise this issue with the Clerk of the Senate, pointing out that page 23 of the explanatory memorandum indicates:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The term "misbehaviour" covers any conduct indicating unfitness for office.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In fact, I did seek advice in a formal sense from the Clerk, and I believe that the letter that you have tabled is effectively a copy of that advice which was provided to me.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is difficult to imagine any conduct which could be held to be gross incompetence which could not also be held to be misbehaviour. Gross incompetence would clearly render a person unfit to hold office, and would be culpable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think it is appropriate at this point of the committee stage debate to seek the view of Madam President, with whom I have raised this issue. It is also a matter that the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing gave some consideration to. The question I would like to ask, perhaps to the minister at the table as well, but effectively to the President of the Senate, is: is it your view that the term `misbehaviour' in clause 59(3(a) comprehends the concept of gross incompetence?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">There was no equivalent amendment to this moved to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R269">Public Service Bill 1997</XREF> . Currently, redundant officers in the parliamentary departments are covered by the Public Service Act and the relevant clauses of the General Employment Conditions Award 1995. In effect, this means that they get a choice between accepting a redundancy package and seeking redeployment to another position anywhere in the APS. The current method for handling redeployees in the APS and the parliamentary departments is called the APS 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> labour market adjustment program, which is part of the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Details of redeployees are forwarded to the labour market adjustment program and they assist these individuals to find redeployment by providing redeployees with a first option for vacancies within the APS. Currently a handful of redeployees from parliamentary departments have accessed this service&mdash;about three in the last year&mdash;which reflects a low level of redundancies in these departments. The  Parliamentary Service Bill 1997  removes the parliamentary departments from the APS and, therefore, cuts off the redeployment options of staff from the parliamentary departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a serious concern to those staff. The primary reason is that a parliamentary department staff member who now becomes redundant and wishes to be redeployed will be limited to redeployment within the parliamentary departments. This restricts the likelihood of redeployment because of the limited number of vacancies in the parliamentary departments. The effect of this limitation is to remove any effective choice in the redundancy process. Staff will, in reality, only have the option of redundancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although only a handful of staff have exercised the redeployment option to date, there is significant potential for redundancies in the future. In particular, recommendation 2 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing into the proposed amalgamation of the parliamentary departments delivered earlier this year says that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recommends that the Presiding Officers require each parliamentary department to identify annually items of expenditure where savings may be achieved, particularly by the rationalisation of functions common to two or more departments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This recommendation is considered by most parliamentary departments to be a possible trigger for a significant number of redundancies. Numbers made redundant under this or any similar process will make redeployment an impossible option under the proposed arrangements. Because of this, staff in Parlia 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9173"> ment House would obviously like to retain the possibility of redeployment to the APS.</PARA>

In the recent estimates hearings, the Clerk of the Senate stated in response to a question from Senator Cooney about the impact of a change to 10-year non-renewable terms for the clerks:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is part of the long-term potential problem that I see. The problem that I identified with the 10-year non-renewable term for the clerks of the houses is that the independence of those positions may be compromised by that provision. To put it bluntly, a person appointed to that position at a young age, at the end of a 10&hyphen;year term, apart from the fact that they will have developed a great deal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9176"> of expertise that will then be done away with&mdash;that is another issue, and you can argue that it facilitates other people coming along and developing their expertise and so on&mdash;is going to be looking for a job. If they accept a government position at the end of that 10-year term, that will lead people to wonder how independent that person has been when in the position of clerk of either house: has their advice over that period been influenced by the prospect of a government job at the end of their 10-year term? That is the problem which I see with the 10-year non-renewable term. That problem would be greatly exacerbated by some of the other proposals that were talked about such as a five&hyphen;year renewable term or a two&hyphen;year renewable term, something like that.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is my concern and that of the Greens. It may only be about perceptions but that is unfortunately what politics is all about. If we are to have clerks who are truly independent and able to provide frank and fearless advice to all senators without any real or perceived influences, we must have the clerks appointed on the same basis at least as a magistrate or similar judicial position, that is, until retirement. I would like to think the Senate will support my amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can see that perhaps what is influencing people's judgment is the lack of tenure and the lack of certainty that the average worker has within the workplace in 1997 in Australia. I can see that, in relation to that, people might see that an appointment until retirement is an extraordinary thing in today's situation, but there are very good reasons for doing this&mdash;as I say, the reasons of independence. The fact that for so many other reasons there is great and growing uncertainty amongst the workplace is not a sufficient reason to imperil the independence of an area like the Senate. It is certainly not a good reason to do similar things, for instance, to the judiciary or to magistrates and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were to go down this slope, given that we are supposed to be the major decision making venue in the country&mdash;although I would probably argue that corporations, especially international corporations, sometimes have more powers than parliaments&mdash;and that theoretically this is the highest decision making body within Australia, I think we must make sure that we have not only the reality but the perception that those 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who give advice to that body are independent and not under threat in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would argue that we should not just judge this against what is happening out in the wider society. We should look at it in terms of the reality of the necessity for professionalism and independence and the trust we all need in these very important officers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition has made its position clear on the public record that we will be accepting this proposal that the clerks have tenure for a 10&hyphen;year non&hyphen;renewable period. We consider that this will provide adequate and appropriate protection of the necessary independence of the clerks. I want to say very clearly that we would not, and did not, support a shorter period. A 10&hyphen;year tenure constitutes very considerable security in our view in the contemporary industrial relations climate and it is directly comparable to the situation of the Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe that the 10&hyphen;year period should be renewable. I think any suggestion of a renewable term for a clerk would only make the clerks susceptible to pressure from the government of the day, whose gift, of course, their continuation in office would be. That would be the difficulty as the end of their tenure approached. It would place the clerks in a very difficult position. I am not suggesting for one moment that any individual would be compromised by that, but we could not afford in the parliament to have that sort of situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard the arguments that a 10&hyphen;year term would be unfair on a youthful clerk who might only be in their 40s, say, at the end of their term. As far as the opposition is concerned, you have to balance this with considerations that, if you have 10 years of satisfying and well&hyphen;remunerated work, that really is long enough for such a young clerk to be able to plan his or her next career move. I think that is very important and I hope deputy clerks and assistant clerks would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9178"> acknowledge that the 10&hyphen;year term has an advantage of giving a youthful deputy or assistant clerk a chance at the top job. Why shouldn't, let us say, a deputy clerk of the calibre of the incumbent be able to aspire to the highest step on the clerical ladder? What is wrong with that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a proposal that has merit, that does not compromise the clerks in any way&mdash;nor should they ever be compromised&mdash;and that protects their independence. It is proper that the government backed away from its proposal for five&hyphen;year renewable terms. That is one of the suggestions that happens around this place: it was floated but, at the end of the day, the arguments against it were overwhelming. I am pleased that the government has determined to come forward with what I think is a far more balanced and more reasonable proposition in relation to the tenure of the clerks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the reasons that I have outlined, the opposition will be supporting this proposal. We do believe it is a clause of the bill that does give an appropriate and adequate level of security. It gives appropriate protections to what we think is absolutely non&hyphen;negotiable and absolutely vital&mdash;the independence of the clerks of both houses of the Commonwealth parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but I want to make it clear on the record that our amendment is not suggesting a renewable term; it is suggesting the same term that would be available to a magistrate. I think that we should at least, if it is considered that that kind of protection is necessary for a magistrate, be able to expect that level of independence and guarantee of professionalism in relation to the Senate. In fact, I would probably believe there should be more emphasise on those values in the Senate than there may 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be for a magistrate, although a magistrate's values are very important as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Will we see in the future the Labor Party lining up to give reduced fixed terms for magistrates? I hope not. Will we have arguments in the future about reduced terms for High Court judges? These things have been floated around and more and more governments ignore them. I was particularly interested to hear the view expressed in a review of the constitution that governments ignore the constitutional rules again and again and then have a real dig at the High Court for telling them so. Will we have a situation where, more and more, governments flout things like constitutions and then say, `Isn't this dreadful? We'll have to reduce the terms of High Court judges'? I think it is a dreadful and very dangerous way for us to be going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to also suggest that the arguments were not about the benefits of the individuals. Once again, to refer to Senator Faulkner's argument: it was not about whether it is necessarily fair to the individual as to whether they have a reasonable career path of a 10-year fixed term; it is about, when nearing the end of that term in a growing Public Service which is more and more politicised and more and more privatised and less accountable by the minute to the parliamentary system and to the parliament, whether or not we are going to have a situation where people in the last year or so of their tenure will be looking to see what their future may be. That is not something that is just about the welfare of the individual; it is about the reality of the independence of that person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be quite difficult to go from a situation in the parliament into the private sector. The emphasis is on not just whether it is a fair thing for a person to have a 10-year tenure but whether that tenure influences, or may be perceived to influence, the behaviour of that person when they are nearing the end of their tenure, when they have understandable concerns about the next 10, 15, or even 20 years of their working life. Therefore, I indicate that the Greens (WA) and the Australian Democrats feel that this issue is important enough for us to divide when we put this to the vote.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats will be voting against the third reading of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R269">Public Service Bill 1997</XREF> . We accept and welcome the fact that the bill has been significantly improved by the many amendments accepted by the Senate during the committee stage. As a consequence of those amendments, employees of the Australian Public Service will now enjoy a much greater level of protection of their rights and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> conditions than was intended by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite those amendments, the Democrats believe the bill remains fundamentally flawed in four key respects. Firstly, the rejection of the Democrats amendments relating to public services which are contracted out, we think, leaves the bill silent on the quality and accountability of contracted services. The Democrats cannot accept that. We do not accept the minister's argument that this bill is not the appropriate place for these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government first announced its plans for these public service reforms, we were told in no uncertain terms by the then minister, Mr Peter Reith, that these reforms were not just about Public Service employment; we were told that the reforms were about improving the quality of public services. The Democrats do not believe the quality of service is a matter which stops at the door of the Australian Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If public services are to be contracted out to private corporations, community organisations or some other body, the Democrats believe the government has a responsibility to ensure that those services are also quality services. We believe that the government has a responsibility to ensure that those services are delivered in an effective, efficient and accountable manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's obligations to the taxpayers of Australia do not come to an end simply because a particular service is being delivered by a private organisation. What is more, the APS retains&mdash;or certainly should retain&mdash;monitoring and supervisory responsibilities. But this bill does not tell APS employees that they should apply the same values, standards and requirements to contracted services as they apply to in&hyphen;house services. The bill does not oblige the Public Service Commissioner to even remotely concern him or herself with how the APS should approach public services which it contracts out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At a time when governments are increasingly trying to avoid responsibility for contracted services, the bill's silence on this point is unacceptable to the Democrats. Secondly, the failure of Democrats and opposition amend 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9187"> ments relating to workplace diversity means that the bill simply does not go far enough in guaranteeing employment equity within the Australian Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reflecting on the government's belief that equal employment opportunity requirements are too prescriptive, the bill does little to compel the APS to take action to eliminate discrimination against women and other disadvantaged groups. While there is an obligation on agency heads to establish a workplace diversity program, there are no details set out in the bill as to how such a program will be implemented. What is more, the Democrats believe the draft directions from the Public Service Commissioner on this point are also inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the APS values now require the APS to promote equity in employment, the values still refer to the APS providing a workplace that recognises the diverse background of APS employees which, I suggest, is somewhat meaningless and quite different from reflecting `the diverse nature of the community served by the APS', as put by the opposition in one of its amendments and rejected by the government and Senator Harradine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The failure of our amendments dealing with the monitoring and reporting of equity issues also considerably weakens the bill. We share the concerns of the Womens Electoral Lobby, as put to the JCPA, that there is real potential for increased gender bias within the APS as a consequence of these reforms. As such, there is an even greater need for a strong APS commitment to employment equity. The Democrats believe the bill fails to ensure the APS will make such a commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the failure of the Democrats whistleblower amendments means the bill falls a long way short of offering adequate protection to Public Service whistleblowers. The government and the opposition continue to give lip&hyphen;service to the idea of separate whistleblower legislation but have failed to take the opportunity when it is here before them to build proper protections into the  Public Service Bill 1997 .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As my colleague Senator Murray pointed out, his proposed changes to the bill could have been repealed easily at a later date once 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> separate legislation was introduced. As it is, the bill will now contain only minimum protection for whistleblowers and significantly limit the circumstances in which their actions will attract that protection. This is unacceptable to the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we simply cannot support a bill in which the appointment, termination and fixing of the remuneration of departmental secretaries remains solely and exclusively within the gift of the Prime Minister. Under this bill, it is the Prime Minister who can now appoint a secretary without reference to anyone else; it is the Prime Minister who can now terminate the appointment of a secretary at any time without reference to anyone else; it is the Prime Minister who now determines the remuneration, terms and conditions of departmental secretaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that does not make the Australian Public Service the servant of not just the government of the day but the executive of the day, then I do not know what does. In effect, not only does the employment of a secretary depend entirely upon the will of the Prime Minister, but so, too, does their income and terms and conditions under which they were employed. This is precisely what Sir Lenox Hewitt was talking about when he told the JCPA that these reforms represented&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the intention to change, indeed to destroy, the Australian Public Service and to convert it into a series of appointments at pleasure&mdash;at the whim, in the case of secretaries, of the Prime Minister . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Democrats believe these changes do represent a significant shift in both the operation and perception of the Australian Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the APS serves the government of the day; it provides advice to the government and it implements the policies and programs of the government. But the APS has always had a role which extends beyond that. It has had a wider role in implementing the legislation passed by the parliament in assisting the parliament in scrutinising how taxpayers' funds are spent and in serving the Australian public. In other words, serving the government of the day is just one of the functions of the APS. The APS is not owned by the government, it is not owned by the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9188"> Prime Minister, it is owned and paid for by the Australian community. This bill seeks to change that. It seeks to turn the Australian Public Service into the creature of the government of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ray came in here today during this debate and spoke very eloquently about the politicisation of the APS by the Howard government. He neglected, of course, to point out the significant contribution made by the previous Labor government in this regard.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="WOODLEY" NAMEID="HX5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator Woodley</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1M6">Senator ALLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. If he was genuine in his concerns, then he and the Labor Party should also vote against this bill on the basis that it will result in an even greater politicisation of the APS, an even greater loss of the accountability of the APS and a further reduction in the capacity of the APS to serve the community and the parliament as well as the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, of course, the Labor Party can see the benefits of this legislation to themselves should they be returned to government. They are not too unhappy with the idea of a Labor Prime Minister flexing his or her muscles over the departmental heads. They are not too concerned about the APS being in the pocket of the government of the day if it is a Labor government and a Labor pocket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do acknowledge that the opposition, with the Democrats' support, have acted to significantly improve the bill, but their inability to go that step further signals that they, too, see the APS as belonging to the government and not to the public. The Democrats do not share that view and we will not support a bill which puts that view into practice.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to put the Democrats' position on the amendment. If the government was more committed to understanding the process of consultation, this bill's passage would have been a lot smoother and it would have passed with a great deal more confidence than is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> currently the case. It is against my better judgment to pass a bill which is clouded by uncertainty and unknowns. One of the concerns I raise is having to deal with an export related bill when the major exporting states, including New South Wales and Western Australia, are telling me that the format of the bill is still questionable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also been difficult to get from industry groups information on the matters being debated. I would like to acknowledge the efforts of farmers from New South Wales and Western Australia as well as from the Victorian grain industry task force. They have provided information which highlights some of the key issues and unknowns which surround the Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill. We were pleased to be able to follow up their issues and concerns on their behalf. I also acknowledge advice from Ian Macfarlane, who is from the QGGA, and the Grains Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of my consultation, however, the first loyalty I have is to Queensland grain growers and to their association. They, along with the Grains Council of Australia, are confident that they are able to best meet the needs of wheat growers by having this legislation passed. The information they provided, as recently as yesterday, has helped to give me confidence about their intent and the intent behind the legislation. But we must acknowledge that there are still no guarantees with regard to the memorandum and articles of association or the listing on the Australian Stock Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing I have not been able to find a reasonable explanation for is why this issue is dealt with in two bills rather than one, but I will not take up time on that matter. I would like to raise a related concern which now lies in the hands of government. With the government's withdrawal of its guarantee on borrowings, the wheat growers of Australia stand to lose to the tune of $35 million to $50 million each year, depending on the interest rate at the time. It would seem reasonable to compensate them by providing their requested rulings on income and capital gains tax. The growers would like to see full conversion of their wheat industry fund with no income or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9190"> capital gains tax on the value of the shares on the day of the listing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is bad form, in my opinion, for the government to refuse to provide a taxation ruling prior to the passing of the current legislation, particularly when the negotiations between industry bodies and the government have been going on for such a long time. However, I will go with the advice provided to me by the QGGA, the Grains Council of Australia and the government. In their judgment, the wheat growers of Australia have no choice but to trust the arrangements put in place by this legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator McGauran, for your support. A lot has happened in the Newcastle and the Hunter since 29 April this year when BHP announced its decision to downsize its steel making facilities. The BHP announcement foreshadowed the loss at that time of 2,500 jobs by the year 1999. The estimated loss on top of this was a further 4,000 positions downstream from the production process. BHP was, on the other hand, centring its steel wire making process in Newcastle, creating an additional 800 jobs. But still there was a major net downsizing of the work force as a result of this process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I wanted to report to the Senate tonight is that the very negative feeling that this generated in the Hunter at this time has now given way to a more positive outlook as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9191"> the Hunter economy repositions itself and begins to forge ahead. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> reported this news in glowing terms on 14 November this year. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hunter Valley is the home to 220 forthcoming and potential economic developments worth more than $8.5 billion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I repeat that: $8.5 billion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with the potential to generate 60,000 jobs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Tonight I want to report in particular on the reason for this optimism and also on the potential growth in the Hunter region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the genesis of this goes back to the very successful visit to the Hunter Valley in July by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) which actually changed the whole climate and atmosphere from one of gloom to one of hope and optimism. His two&hyphen;day visit in July marked a turning point. It was symbolic but it was actually more than that. What he did during this time was promote a very optimistic vision for the city when he met with business leaders, civic leaders and members of the community over a period of two days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister marshalled very strong local union and community support for his plan to use a whole range of initiatives federally and also in conjunction with the state and with BHP to pool a series of separate projects and two major projects which are to be announced in the next few weeks. The federal subcommittee of cabinet came to the Hunter. Quite a few ministers moved through the area and announced at that time an additional $19.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of this has been to assist in the creation of a climate of optimism in the Hunter. Now a private study has given us some great hope for the future in what has been generated as a result of this changing climate. The study was presented at a jobs summit in Newcastle last Friday and has confirmed in hard evidence that the Hunter region is `going for growth'. The study was compiled by a local businessman and publisher, Mr Lex Thomas. The Hunter Economic Development Corporation has backed the study's findings. A spokesman for the HEDC is quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Herald</EMPHASIS> as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it was a comprehensive and encouraging appraisal of the region's economic potential. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Thomas study illustrates the sheer magnitude of the job creation that is now under way in the Newcastle and the Hunter. There are 223 individual projects under way. The projected value is a staggering $8.5 billion. Thirty thousand new jobs are to be created during the construction phase. Using the conservative multiplier of 2.5, those 10,500 jobs would create another 26,000 places. Therefore, the potential new employment for the Hunter is 66,000 jobs coming on stream at a time when BHP is downsizing by only 2,500 jobs. If you look at the balance between what is going from the Hunter and what is coming to the Hunter in a range of very exciting new industries, you see there is a great hope and future for this region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me cover some of the specifics of the projects. There are 15 projects worth $100 million or more. Typical of these bigger projects is the $1 billion British Aerospace lead&hyphen;in fighter construction and maintenance project at Williamtown RAAF base. The Prime Minister recently announced assistance for the National Power project of two power stations in the Hunter, at Redbank near Singleton, worth $600 million. The federal government, in terms of assistance in relation to the replaced infrastructure bond scheme, is putting in $30 million. It was this that was the catalyst for this particular $600 million worth of investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The study identifies four other categories of projects, against a dollar value, ready to go into the Hunter. In the $20 million to $99 million category there are 26 projects, valued in total at $1.2 billion, including a number of mines that were announced by our minister for good news up here in the Senate, Senator Parer. He came up to the Hunter and announced more good news up there with the opening and proposed development of a range of new mines in the coal industry. In the $5 million to $19 million range there are 49 projects valued at $450 million in total. There are 91 projects in the $1 million to $5 million value range, in total $183 million, and another 41 smaller ventures worth in total $30 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a whole range of business activity in the Hunter&mdash;huge projects, medium sized pro 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9192"> jects, small projects&mdash;the region is very clearly experiencing a boom. This is in mining, engineering, aerospace, tourism and the power industry sector. Following the understandable despair that was left after BHP's announcement of the downsizing of its steel plant after 80 years, the region is climbing back with a vengeance. I commend these positive developments for the people of the Hunter. I particularly would like to thank the Prime Minister for his role in turning the mood around and helping to generate these new projects for the Hunter. It has been a pleasure for me tonight to inform the Senate of these new developments.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9192"><TITLE>Mr Alan  Bond</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like many Australians I have been frustrated by the failed pursuit of the Alan Bond millions. In early 1994, Federal Police began investigating possible offences committed by Alan Bond whilst in bankruptcy and Bond's apparent failure to fully disclose to his trustee all of his assets and possessions. The trustee, Mr Robert Ramsay, was highly dissatisfied with the level of cooperation of Bond, who claimed he could not remember certain significant transactions but on the other hand remembered precise details in gifting $33 million in cash and assets to various family members and trusts in the two years prior to his 1991 bankruptcy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of example, Bond claimed he was suffering memory loss and could not recall the exact location or details of ownership of several major artworks, including the 1782 portrait of Captain James Cook by John Webber. This portrait left Australia on 6 January 1990. In March 1996 Federal Police seized the portrait, a valuable piece of our history, along with several other major artworks, in the United Kingdom, with the assistance of Britain's Serious Fraud Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that Bond's denial about these transactions has since been exposed by Bond Corporation liquidator, Mr Richard England, as `a sham intended to disguise a fraudulent scheme'. I am further advised that Mr England claims Bond family interests `maliciously conspired and combined amongst themselves' to defraud the company and recently com 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> menced civil action against Bond family members to recover certain paintings and the proceeds of others sold by Bond family interests. I am advised that the bulk of the moneys were shown to have been paid to various Liechtenstein bank accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994, Mr Ramsay released a series of confidential reports to creditors detailing the involvement of Bond's Swiss `para&hyphen;banker', Mr Jurg Bollag. In September of 1994, via the then Attorney&hyphen;General, Mr Lavarch, the AFP made the first in a series of requests to the Swiss authorities to execute search warrants upon a number of Swiss banks and the home of Jurg Bollag. In the same month a number of search warrants were executed against Bond, his family members, and certain business associates around Australia. The information obtained under these warrants was finally released to Mr Ramsay after an extensive legal battle, but only hours before creditors were to vote on a deed of composition put forward by Bond to discharge his bankruptcy. It proved too late for the information to be of any good purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that documents recovered by the AFP have revealed a number of significant transactions involving millions of dollars spirited into and out of the country by Mr Bond during his bankruptcy, none of which has ever been disclosed to his trustee. These transactions apparently confirmed Mr Ramsay's 1994 knowledge of Bond's dealings in a number of offshore entities, particularly those in Liechtenstein, which are at the very heart of the AFP investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In agreeing to the 1995 settlement with his creditors, Mr Bond signed a warranty stating he had disclosed all his assets. Mr Bond intentionally and covertly misled his creditors and he still refuses to deliver up the tens of millions taken from the Australian public. It appears self&hyphen;evident now that Alan Bond deceitfully withheld material information about his personal assets from his trustee in bankruptcy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1996, Bond began serving the first of two jail terms, one for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">La Promenade</EMPHASIS> art fraud. Later, in 1997, Bond pleaded guilty to his role in stripping $1.2 billion from Bell Resources. It was revealed during preliminary 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9193"> hearings that at least $66 million was siphoned to the family company Dallhold, the conduit by which Bond managed to personally benefit from his corporate philandering. None of this money has ever been recovered. It is still missing and at large, like so many valuable assets, after many years of investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AFP investigation is now four years old and has not yet delivered any charges. Thousands of hours of investigative work and many millions of dollars have been spent investigating Bond. It seems Mr Bond has had available to him these missing millions and has consequently been able to mount a sufficiently funded legal challenge to every possible threat of prosecution. Why any lawyer would be prepared to profit from such missing millions is beyond understanding. Federal Court Justice Ron Merkel, in dismissing a recent application by Bond and his banker, Jurg Bollag, said it was audacious and a serious misuse and abuse of the litigation process. This abuse continues this very day as Bond continues to fight orders of the Supreme Court of South Australia in an action where Bond is sought to be examined in that jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of applications for special leave to appeal to the High Court of Australia have since been lodged by lawyers acting for Bond who now also wish to challenge the length of his sentence. Such an abuse of the legal process is a sad indictment upon our legal system which allows wealthy individuals to mount a number of successive appeals not available to ordinary Australian citizens. This is especially unpalatable when the wealth has been acquired, as has been proved beyond reasonable doubt in the Bond case, from corporate victims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AFP suffered a series of budget cuts in 1993-94 and many resources are now unavailable to the AFP in its fight against drug importation, organised crime and other crimes. We must ensure that the allocation of funds available to our crime fighting agencies is money well spent. We must guard against a repeat of the corporate excesses of the 1980s and we must have effective legislation to combat our white&hyphen;collar criminals like Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bond. In recognising the efforts made by successive governments, I now ask the present Attorney-General (Mr Williams) what is to become of the Bond matters. Will the Federal Police investigation lead to charges and, in turn, produce successful convictions against Bond and others who have assisted his crimes against the Australian people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of our corporate criminals have not been brought to justice in the Australian courts. For instance, Mr Skase and Mr Goldberg are still at large. There is also the lengthy case by the Australian Securities Commission against former Bond Corporation director, Mr Tony Oates, whose case for extradition has been before the Polish authorities on a number of successive occasions, so far without achieving a result. The next consideration of this matter is on 27 January 1998. Let us ensure our legislative processes are ever vigilant against the likes of Bond and Skase so, as we move towards the next century, the Australian people will have faith in the ability and priority of government to bring those to justice who would otherwise seek to damage our reputation as an honest and fair country.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9193"><TITLE>Native Title</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Parliament can sometimes be a place where myths and legends begin or are perpetrated, where folklore can become fact and where facts can be blurred in the later detail. Tonight I would like to examine some of the myths and legends that have come to surround the former government's Native Title Act 1993. We must never forget that the Native Title Act which this nation now has was not Labor's original grand plan to implement the High Court's 1992 Mabo decision. It was merely the compromise that ultimately came out of the backroom deals made in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real plan of the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating&mdash;his ideal solution to the challenge created by the Mabo decision&mdash;was embodied in the Native Title Bill 1993 introduced into the House of Representatives. In fact, so important did the former Prime Minister consider this bill to be that he swept aside the responsible minister of the day, Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9194"> Tickner, to personally introduce the bill. He did so on 16 November 1993. His speech reveals the personal dreams and the extent to which he personally was involved in its formulation. In fact, his speech emphasised the fact, describing the introduction of his legislation that day as `a milestone'. He said his plan would represent a new beginning for indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at what the former Prime Minister wanted the bill to deliver. One of the great myths that has been created by the swirl of modern spin doctors is that it was never Mr Keating's original intention to extinguish native title. In fact, the plan is clearly explained in the explanatory memorandum. Fancy this. Under the heading `Extinguishment of native title by validation of some acts' is this enlightening statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The validation of past acts and grants will only extinguish native title where there has been what the Bill terms a category A past act . . . that is, a grant of freehold or the grant of a commercial, agricultural, pastoral or residential lease . . . or the construction of a public work.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There it is. Labor's original native title plan clearly demonstrates that it was their intention to extinguish a significant amount of native title, including, explicitly, pastoral leases. Bucket loads of extinguishment you might say. Let us not be fooled by the codes at work here. Does it matter if you say `validation', because, in this case, it would have resulted in native title rights being substantially reduced in any case. Just to be sure that everybody understood, the Prime Minister backed up his speech on ABC radio when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">his grand plan&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will mean is that native title will be extinguished on pastoral leases, that is not to the extent of any inconsistency, but extinguished.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The explanatory memorandum spelt it out clearly. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mabo</EMPHASIS>  decision clearly indicated that governments are able to affect and indeed extinguish Native Title.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So we learn not the myth but the reality. From the explanatory memorandum in which the former Prime Minister was so proudly 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> involved, that extinguishment of native title is entirely consistent with Mabo and would in no way represent an overturning of the Mabo decision. There it is as plain as day. Of course, as we all know, that bill passed through the House of Representatives without amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in its passage over the Great Hall to the scrutiny of the states house, the house of review, the myth of a `new deal for black and white Australia', to use Mr Keating's words, was put to rest. His grand plan began to undergo a metamorphosis. It was subjected to considerable change and to substantial compromise. In the end, the captain of the team did not get the plan he wanted. He got the Native Title Act 1993, which, though still bearing his imprint, was light years away from what he really wanted and from what he introduced that day in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the legend remains. Just this past week, the former Prime Minister emerged from the shadows to perpetrate it yet again. In doing so, he chose to describe the coalition's native title plan as racist. In fact, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now if there's a piece of Commonwealth law which allows the States, or anyone else, to do their dirty work and to deny people . . . their common law title . . . it's racially discriminatory and therefore it's racist.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How kind his memory is and how mythical his recall. This is the fellow who, before the myth was perpetrated, introduced a bill which proclaimed very proudly that the Mabo decision clearly indicated that governments are able to affect and indeed extinguish native title. A myth began and a legend was perpetrated. But the truth is revealed by the veracity of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . As we consider how well this bill delivered for this nation, the truth and the reality of Mr Keating's dream must not be forgotten by those who have the opportunity to remember the truth.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9194"><TITLE>Fringe Benefits Tax</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME><STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(8.24 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of tax questions this afternoon were directed to the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), including one from Senator Bishop on the fringe benefits tax. It is quite evident that the Labor senators asking those questions did not really fully understand the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9195"> import of the questions which had been obviously prepared for them. They also did not appreciate the background of the Labor Party in its development of the fringe benefits tax scheme during the 13 years of its disastrous regime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a moment, for the benefit of senators, I will go a little into history. It was the Labor Party that fundamentally changed the law regarding fringe benefits tax. It moved the responsibility from taxing the employee to taxing the employer. The tax is paid regardless of the profitability of the employer. After 13 years of Labor mismanagement, which was also evident in the fringe benefits tax regime, we moved from, as I said, taxing the employee to taxing the employer. Initially it started as a tax on salary related type payments by the employer. Progressively, that net was widened and widened. The Labor Party also progressively raised the amount of revenue from fringe benefits. At the same time, it increased the cost of compliance substantially on the employer. In many cases, we had fringe benefits compliance costs being significantly higher for some firms, particularly small firms, than the tax they paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The impact of the FBT in some situations was disastrous nationally and on the states and local communities. Many of Labor's fringe benefits taxes on employer provided car parking, for example, worked contrary to local government's good community planning measures, which encouraged employers to provide on-site parking. When this fringe benefits tax on employee parking came along, the employers shoved the employees' cars out onto the streets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party also initiated changes that have today opened up unlimited opportunities for rorting, particularly by a number of state governments and their agencies and charitable organisations. The Labor Party also initiated changes to remote area taxation which have played havoc for so many small mining towns, particularly to the north. Many of them have been wrecked, especially those traditionally regarded as company towns. To such an extent, because of the FBT, we now have large mining organisations that fly their employees in from major metropolitan cen 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tres. For example, the Argyle company flies its people in from Perth on a weekly or fortnightly basis to their Argyle mine in the Northern Territory. So it has completely changed the features of, and community spirit in, many small mining towns. Such has been the havoc wreaked by this fringe benefits tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the change of government, the new Liberal&hyphen;National Party government has made a number of significant changes. We still have a long way to go. I will enumerate a number of the changes we have made. We have raised the threshold for minor items. We have changed the regime on car parking for small businesses. We have abolished the fringe benefits tax on taxi travel and the like. We have exempted record keeping from the fringe benefits where those benefits have a taxable value of $5,000 or less, which is very significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Businesses which elect to take advantage of such an option provided by the Liberal&hyphen;National Party coalition will pay fringe benefits on the benefits established in the base year. This record keeping exemption will provide a reduction in compliance costs for many small fringe benefit tax payers, which is estimated to be close to 75 per cent of all enterprises paying FBT who do not make a material change in the amount or type of benefits provided each year. It is anticipated that more than 50,000 Australian businesses will be relieved from this form of onerous record keeping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bishop's question this afternoon raised the issue of benefits provided by third parties&mdash;say, to a business employee. One of the problems of extending fringe benefits to benefits provided by a third party is that it is often difficult for the employer to be aware of such practices&mdash;including the provision of meals by third parties. Although the meal issue has been somewhat simplified in recent years from what it was previously, I believe perhaps the simple solution, except in isolated circumstances, is to scrap both the income tax deductibility and the fringe benefits tax on meals.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. In conclusion, I would like to refer to the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Getting it right for the millennium</EMPHASIS>  released last week by Mr Jon Hutchison, its architect, and the federal Minister for Sport and Tourism, Mr Andrew Thomson. The report will provide a framework for the government's national tourism strategy and it lays a foundation for tourism beyond the Sydney Olympics to 2005. One of the measures included in the report's recommendations is a fringe benefits tax exemption for meals. I wholeheartedly support this measure as part of a vital reform which I believe will be of great benefit not only to the tourism industry but to Australian businesses generally and ultimately to all Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask everybody listening to this speech to be very conscious of the very detrimental role the provisions of the fringe benefits tax have had on the national outlook in Australia and the problems they have caused for our mining industry and the small mining towns. The Labor Party tax opened up the opportunity for tax rorting by a number of state governments, their agencies and also charitable institutions. The tax has also caused problems for small business, plus there has been the very high cost of compliance. I commend the Liberal&hyphen;National Party on their changes, particularly the changes in relation to fringe benefits that have had a very significant impact on reducing compliance costs for small businesses. I thank the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="8.33 p.m." PAGE="9199"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 8.33 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Regional Development has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Consistent with the announcement by the previous Minister for Transport on 29 May 1997, changes have been made to the Sydney Airport Noise Amelioration program to reflect the changes to aircraft noise exposure flowing from implementation of the Long Term Operating Plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has involved a reprioritisation of the program to focus insulation on areas east and west of the airport while those to the north have been reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pending the production of an ANEF based on actual operating experience with the plan, areas of eligibility have been determined on the basis of an Australian Noise Exposure Concept (prepared in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> association with the Long Term Operating Plan). This represents the current best assessment of aircraft noise exposure associated with flight paths to be used under the plan. Invitations have been sent to home owners to the west and east of the airport likely to be within a future 30 ANEF. Invitations that have already been sent to households to the north of the airport, up to Stanmore Road, will be honoured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Insulation will be offered to public buildings, such as schools, pre&hyphen;schools, hospitals, and health care facilities and churches which are likely to be within the future 25 ANEF contour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Work has been completed on 17 schools and colleges, 19 pre schools and child care centres (funding for the replacement of a further 2 has been offered to Marrickville Council), one nursing home and is under way at Newington College. Work has also been completed on approximately 1400 homes out of the 3300 eligible under the reprioritised scheme. Public buildings newly eligible for insulation under the reprioritised scheme, subject to verification of eligibility criteria, include 7 schools, 8 pre schools and child care centres, 5 hospitals and health care facilities and 22 churches. Five churches to the north of the airport eligible under the previous program remain eligible. Maps have been lodged with the Table Office showing the areas eligible under the reprioritise program. * Attachments 1 to 4 for residential insulation assistance and * Attachments 5 to 9 for eligible public buildings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) As at 2 October 1997, a total of $151.8m had been spent on the program comprising $37.4 on acquisition and demolition of properties in the 40 ANEF zone, $40.9m on the insulation of schools, $3.2m on child care centres, $0.4m on health care facilities $54.4 on residential insulation and $15.5m on project management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The total expenditure this financial year is expected to be of the order of $60m. The forward estimates currently include an amount of $164.5m.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The program is a voluntary one and progress depends to a large degree on the speed with which home owners and owners of eligible public buildings take up the Commonwealth's offer of insulation assistance and the details concerning the works can be agreed. However, based on past experience, the program is likely to continue in operation for at least 2 more years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Commonwealth has offered a number of surplus lighthouse properties, including Cape Bruny, to the Tasmanian Government. The Tasmanian Government, subject to a number of conditions, has agreed to accept these properties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) A condition of the transfer requires the State to manage the property in a way that will protect its heritage and conservation values. The property must be reserved under the Crown Lands Act (Tas) 1976 or dedicated under the National Parks and Wildlife Act (Tas) 1970 within two years after the settlement date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) That part of the road that is on property presently owned by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) is maintained by the Authority to a level sufficient for its purposes. The remaining 18 kms of the road is within lands owned by the State and managed by the Tasmanian Department of Environment. A part of the offer for transfer of the lighthouse properties is a financial contribution by AMSA towards the costs of upgrading the road within the Labillardiere Peninsula State Reserve. Future maintenance of the road is a matter for decision of the Tasmanian Government.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1(a) Based on currently available information, the forests of the Portland Forest Management Area (FMA) are likely to provide habitats for a number of rare and threatened fauna species, including the Red-tailed Black Cockatoo and Powerful Owl.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1 (b, c) Of the species mentioned, only the Red-tailed Black Cockatoo is listed under the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 (ESP Act)&mdash;its status is endangered. The Powerful Owl is listed as threatened under Victoria's Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988 (FFG Act) but is not on the schedules to the ESP Act. While the Yellow-bellied Glider and Yellow-tailed Black Cockatoo both occur in the Portland FMA, neither is considered to be threatened under the ESP or FFG Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1 (d) Other species likely to occur in forests of the Portland FMA which are listed under the ESP Act include the Spot-tailed Quoll (vulnerable), Heath Mouse (endangered), Striped Legless Lizard (vulnerable), and possibly the Swift Parrot (vulnerable). As part of the CRA/RFA process, proposals are currently being developed to undertake surveys for both flora and fauna in the West RFA region, which includes the Portland FMA. These surveys will provide valuable information on the range and status of these and other species, including species occurring in the Cobboboonee and Narrawong State Forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) All areas of native forest contribute to the conservation and survival of forest-dependant species. Flora and fauna surveys to be undertaken as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9203"> part of the CRA/RFA process will provide valuable information as to the relative conservation significance of different areas of native forest in the Portland FMA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) No. Areas of native forest in the Portland FMA are currently subject to an Interim Forest Agreement between the Commonwealth and Victoria. I am satisfied that under this agreement, current management of these forests for timber production will not foreclose options for the conservation and survival of rare and threatened species pending the completion of an RFA for western Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) A range of existing mechanisms provides protection for rare and threatened species in the Portland FMA. Of the five species listed under the ESP Act that are considered likely to occur in the Portland FMA, draft recovery plans exist for the Red-tailed Black Cockatoo, the Striped Legless Lizard and the Swift Parrot. All five species have Action Statements either in place or in preparation under the FFG Act. In addition, the Victorian Code of Forest Practices for Timber Production requires that local prescriptions be put in place to provide for the protection of all known records of rare and threatened species. I am confident that these measures will ensure the survival of rare and threatened species in the Portland FMA pending completion of an RFA for Western Victoria.</PARA>
