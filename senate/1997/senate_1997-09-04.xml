<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate adopt the committee's recommendation and agree to the transfer of responsibility for the administration of senators' travelling allowances from the Department of the Senate to the Department of Administrative Services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will not speak very long to this. I think it was the view of the opposition very early on that travel allowance should be centralised in one department and not cut across two. This view has generally been supported both by the government and opposition. Senator Bourne, however, has put in a dissenting report. I regard most of that dissenting report as irrelevant to this decision, although not irrelevant to the decision making of government. I think some of the issues Senator Bourne has raised in that report, which has also been raised by Senate officers, will be pursued in the estimates process both in regard to the Senate and DAS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we in the opposition are responding to is a government decision, not the Baxter report. I want to make that absolutely clear. If the Baxter report is flawed, we will be looking at the flaws and the amount of expenditure that has been paid. However, we take the view based on two factors for the centralisation of TA. First, it is easier in our view to cross&hyphen;reference all this material in one department, and the very departmental jealousies we have seen that were involved in the reception of the Baxter report will not come into play.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even more so, we would much rather make the Department of Administrative Services accountable than the Department of the Senate. It is a very simple process. We do not like to get into an adversarial position with Senate officers, the clerks, the President and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6405"> the department as a whole. It is a much more friendly relationship that senators have with their own department than they necessarily would have with DAS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people might even suggest that a poisoned chalice is going across to DAS. I am not sure that is particularly right. They understand that, by taking it over, they will be subject to a fairly rigorous examination process. Whilst I have a lot of sympathy with  the general points made by Senator Bourne, I do not agree with the basic principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I do not think you do get better scrutiny across two departments. You get better scrutiny in one department provided we, as senators, the Auditor-General and everyone else puts proper scrutiny on that department. I cannot accept the conclusion, even though I can accept the thrust of what Senator Bourne has said.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Ray for being so measured and polite in his response to my dissenting report. My dissenting report is based on a couple of things. I would like to see the Baxter report for a start. I have not seen it; no-one in the Democrats has seen it. I understood that the proposal to transfer administration rested on the Baxter report, but I do not know that for sure because I have not seen it and I have not been given a copy. I would not know what was in it except for the information that has been tabled in estimates, which I have also attached to this dissenting report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a couple of problems with changing everything into the one department. I do take the point that it is easier if it is all in the one department, but it has been in two departments and it is not the Department of the Senate that has caused any problems. I do not even think it is DAS that has caused problems; it is circumstances that has caused problems. I would like to see cross&hyphen;checking. I think cross&hyphen;checking is more effective and easier when it is in the two departments. I think that is an important point. I recommend that all senators read the dissenting report and the document that was tabled in estimates. I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hope that that will prove to be useful for future estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last point I feel I have to make is that I believe every single person on the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing&mdash;and probably pretty well everybody in the Senate&mdash;wants to make sure that this is done properly; that that is the outcome of any changes or of keeping it the same; that there is very strict scrutiny of what happens here. Absolutely none of us wants to take money that we are not entitled to. The end result is just stupidity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think there is anybody who would want to do that, certainly not on the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing. We are all absolutely sure that what we want is a fair and reasonable system where we only get what we are entitled to and where mistakes cannot be made. It is far more difficult to make mistakes and do anything, even inadvertently, that would go against the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I still believe that what I said in the dissenting report is correct. I still believe it should be kept in the two departments and cross-checked. I will be voting that way, but I understand, as I did in the Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing, that the numbers are well and truly against us here.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the proposal before the chair. The opposition has made very clear that any proposals in relation to the administration of the parliamentary entitlements need to meet certain criteria. The sorts of criteria that are of concern to the opposition, which I have outlined previously, are those of transparency, accountability, equity, workability and independent arbitration. I hope that those criteria have been uppermost in the government's mind as it reviews the parliamentary entitlements system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key issue before the chamber at the moment via the vehicle of the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing is that of centralisation of entitlements in DAS. This has the support of the opposition. Very early in this debate I think the opposi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6406"> tion was the first political party in this country to argue that case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation where currently salaries, electorate and travelling allowances and some other minor entitlements for senators and members of the House of Representatives are administered by the parliamentary departments&mdash;the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate respectively. All the other entitlements that go to postage, telephones, stationery and papers are administered by DAS. DAS han dles ministerial salaries and travelling allowance and entitlements for ministers and entitlements for other office holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say that this creates unnecessary confusion and duplication of effort. We believe that&mdash;to avoid that confusion and duplication, to ensure that there is transparency and accountability and, I hope, for many of the reasons that Senator Ray indicated, to improve transparency and accountability of the system of administration of all salaries, allowances and entitlements&mdash;the centralisation in one department, in this case the Department of Administrative Services, will lead to that more desirable outcome. That improvement is what many in this parliament and, I am very confident, many outside this parliament are looking for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, too, accept the spirit of what Senator Bourne has said, and I appreciate where she is coming from. I suspect that her objectives in this are no different from those that I have expressed. The issues of accountability and transparency and the issue I have raised in relation to workability are all very important ones that I hope would be shared by the vast majority in this chamber and in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the opposition proposes to support the 27th report of the Appropriations and Staffing Committee. I commend the question before the Senate to senators. </PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6407"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Scrutiny by the Committee of regulations providing for the leasing of Commonwealth airports</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 7 May 1997 the government announced the successful bidders for the long term leases of Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports. The announcement advised that the leases would maximise efficient airport operations and facilitate future airport developments on a commercial basis. Total consideration for the leases was $3.34 billion, with Brisbane airport bringing $1.39 billion, Melbourne $1.31 billion and Perth $640 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government announcement further advised that, while sales proceeds were an important element in the sale, the evaluation methodology took into consideration a whole range of other criteria. For instance, the successful  bidders were all high quality, committed operators with international experience, who would bring world best practice to the management and operation of these airports. Also, the private leases would introduce a level of innovation and competitiveness otherwise difficult to achieve within the previous management system. All the successful bidders had agreed to comply with the government's post privatisation pricing regime, which would result in substantial real reductions in aeronautical charges over the next five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result of this process was so successful that on 12 June 1997 the government announced that it was offering a further fifteen Federal airports for simultaneous trade sale, including Adelaide, Hobart, Darwin and Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All this appears a satisfactory outcome of a process which commenced under the previous Federal government and which is now being completed under  the present one. What may not be well known, however, is that the whole basis of the operation of leased airports was established largely by regulations. Indeed, the actual choice of Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports as the first to be privatised was prescribed by regulation. The broad framework of the scheme was provided for by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Airports Act 1996</EMPHASIS> , the second reading speech for which advised that regulations would play an important part in the final supervisory framework. A quantitative indication of this importance is that the original Airports Act includes 236 references to "regulations" or to "prescribe", which in the context of Commonwealth legislative drafting means to make regulations. In addition, earlier this year an amendment of the Airports Act included fifty&hyphen;five more references to "regulations". A more general indication of their importance is that the Minister circulated drafts of the regulations for information and comment, which is not usual Commonwealth practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The administrative scheme of the Airports Act was in fact implemented through no fewer than six 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> different principal regulations, due to the amount of detail to be included in the regulatory regime. The Appendix to this paper sets out the full citations of these regulations. The first set of regulations, the Airports (Building Control) Regulations, provided for the approval and supervision of building works at leased airports. The Airports (Protection of Airspace) Regulations established a system to provide for the safety and efficiency of air transport around leased airports. The Airports (Ownership&hyphen;Interest in Shares) Regulations provided for increased Australian investment in leased airports by establishing a system of exemptions for the foreign ownership provisions of the Act. The Airports Regulations, which were the key regulations, actually prescribed that Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth airports would be leased and provided for their leasing and management, for land use and planning, and for accounts and reports of airport&hyphen;operator companies. The Airports (Environment Protection) Regulations, which were the longest regulations, provided for environmental strategies, duties of operators of undertakings at airports, monitoring and remedial action, and enforcement. Finally, the Airports (Control of On&hyphen;Airport Activities) Regulations provided for the control of commercial activities and vehicles at leased airports, including the control of liquor, gambling and smoking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee scrutinised all these regulations with the assistance of its independent legal adviser, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan AM, to ensure that they complied with its high standards of personal rights and parliamentary propriety. The Committee detected a number of apparent deficiencies in four of the six sets of regulations and, as it does in these cases, wrote to the Minister seeking an explanation. I will now describe what the Committee regarded as deficiencies and the response of the Minister to the Committee's concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most important aspects of the work of the Committee is to ensure that legislative instruments are legally valid. Every year the Committee scrutinises legislation which is invalid for a number of reasons. In the case of the Airports (Environment Protection) Regulations the Committee questioned a provision which authorised the use of environmental testing methods approved by the United States Environment Protection Agency or by two other United States bodies. The Committee was concerned because s.49A of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</EMPHASIS>  provides that legislative instruments may incorporate or adopt material, apart from Acts and regulations, only as in existence at a particular time, not as in existence from time to time. The reason for this provision is that incorporation of material which might be changed without the approval or even knowledge of Parliament would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6408"> effectively delegate legislative power, a process which would be most undesirable. The Committee noted that, in contrast, four other provisions of the Regulations expressly incorporated Australian material, from both government and non&hyphen;government bodies, that was in force at a particular date or at the date of commencement of the Regulations. In the case of the Airports (Environment Protection) Regulations the Minister agreed to meet our concern about validity and the Airports Act was amended to provide legal authority for the incorporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another aspect of the Committee's work which is of crucial importance is the protection of personal rights, which the Committee interprets in a very broad fashion. Every year the Committee detects many provisions which appear to breach personal rights and raises these with the relevant Minister. The Committee was concerned at the following aspects of personal rights relating to the different regulations providing for the leasing of airports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Airports (Environment Protection) Regulations provide that airport lessee companies have the right of entry to a sub&hyphen;lessee's premises and of access to any document under the control of the sub&hyphen;lessee, with penalties for non&hyphen;compliance. The Committee noted that these are very wide powers, which even the police do not have without a warrant. Also, the entry provisions did not include the usual safeguard under which those entering must produce photographic identity passes. As well, the people given power to enter did not appear to be employees of the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency and therefore may not be subject to the safeguards provided under, for instance, legislation relating to privacy or the Ombudsman. The Minister advised the Committee that the airport lessee company needed these powers to monitor environmental impacts and that entry must be at a reasonable time and after notice in writing. However, the Committee's concerns would be referred to the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department for advice. Also, while some powers of entry would be exercised by a private entity, related powers to enter to perform remedial work would be exercised by a statutory office holder, who would be subject to the usual safeguards including privacy and the Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Airports (Environment Protection) Regulations also provide for a system of penalties imposed by infringement notices. The Committee does not object to such provisions, which may be appropriate in the circumstances. In this case, however, the provisions did not include the usual and necessary safeguard that infringement notices should advise that, if the fine is paid, then payment not only discharges the liability and prevents any prosecution for the matter, but also the person affected is not to be regarded as having been convicted of an offence. The Minister advised the Committee that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Regulations would be amended to provide for this advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final concern about personal rights which the Committee had in respect of the Airports (Environment Protection) Regulations was a provision that notices or directives from a government official to a member of the public could be given by a number of methods, including by pre&hyphen;paid post. The Regulations, however, did not extend this concession to notices given to officials by the public, who were required to deliver notices to an office during business hours. The Minister advised the Committee that the Regulations would be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Airports (Control of On&hyphen;Airport Activities) Regulations also included provisions which may have affected personal rights. Four provisions in those Regulations included the appropriate safeguard that action which would affect a person adversely could be taken only if reasonable. One provision, for instance, provided that a vehicle may be removed if the driver cannot be found within a reasonable time after reasonable inquiries. Two other provisions, however, did not include this reasonability safeguard although it may have been appropriate to do so. In this instance, however, the Minister persuaded the Committee that reasonability provisions were not necessary in these two cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Airports (Building Control) Regulations included the appropriate safeguard that if the building controller does not make a decision on a building application within twenty&hyphen;eight days then he or she is deemed to have rejected the application. In three other similar cases, however, there was no such effective time limit. These related to variations of approvals, certificates of fitness and variation of certificates of fitness, all of which could have important commercial consequences. The Minister advised the Committee that the Regulations would be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Airports Regulations provided that if an airport lease is terminated then the Minister may direct that the Commonwealth or a nominee of the Minister be substituted for the former lessee. The Committee advised the Minister that this appeared reasonable, but questioned a further provision that the substituted nominee would not be liable for any existing liabilities. The Committee asked whether this would prejudice the creditors of the terminated airport lessee company. The Minister assured the Committee that the provision would not affect the rights of creditors or their legal options in relation to any obligations owed to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another aspect of the Committee's work is to ensure that legislative instruments provide for appropriate merits review of administrative decisions. At the Commonwealth level it is broadly accepted policy that persons who are adversely affected by the exercise of an administrative 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6409"> discretion should be able to have the merits of that decision reviewed by an independent external body, which would usually be the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This general principle is a safeguard subject to only a few limited exceptions. In the case of the regulations providing for the leasing of airports each of the four sets of regulations about which the Committee was concerned in respect of validity and personal rights also did not appear to provide in all cases for administrative review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Airports (Environment Protection) Regulations provided for environment testing by accredited laboratories, but did not appear to provide for review for a laboratory refused accreditation. Also, although some decisions made under the Regulations were subject to full AAT review,  numbers were subject only to internal review by the Secretary. The Committee suggested that it may be  suitable to provide for ultimate AAT review, even if preliminary review by the Secretary was appropriate. Some other discretions, including commercially valuable decisions, did not appear to be subject to any review. The Minister advised the Committee that the accreditation body was the only suitable accrediting agency in Australia, but if this should change then it would certainly be appropriate to amend the Regulations. Laboratories are informed of any deficiencies and of how these may be remedied. Laboratories may then apply again for accreditation and request a different assessor. The Minister further advised that he had asked for a review of the other discretions and the Regulations would be amended to reflect that review's findings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Airports Regulations provided for commercially valuable discretions to exempt subleases  from a general prohibition. The Minister advised the Committee that the Regulations would be amended to provide for AAT review. The Airports (Control of On&hyphen;Airport Activities) Regulations provided for a number of discretions in relation to the control of the sale of liquor, with no apparent AAT review. The Minister advised that State liquor law would apply at leased airports and that the present provisions were intended to facilitate this application. AAT review was therefore not appropriate. The Airports (Building Control) Regulations provided for extensive AAT review of decisions by the building controller but the Committee noted a few gaps. The Minister advised that the Regulations would be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that the quality of drafting of regulations should not be less than that of Acts. In the present case the four sets of regulations all included drafting errors and oversights which the Minister agreed to amend.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is grateful to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, the Hon John Sharp MP, for his cooperation in this whole 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exercise. The Minister's actions demonstrate a commitment to personal rights and parliamentary propriety. These sets of regulations were among  the most important dealt with by the Committee this year. They illustrate not only the importance of regulations in contemporary public administration but also the actions of the Committee in ensuring that regulations are of the highest quality.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A bill is being presented to the parliament which provides the base funding for what is supposed to be a new five&hyphen;year agreement regarding the Australian National Training Authority, which is the funding basis for the Commonwealth's contribution to TAFE colleges across the country. The Senate would be aware that some $3 billion a year is spent in this area, of which a Commonwealth contributes about $1 billion. This report highlights that this base funding proposal&mdash;which the minister uses as the index year on which he says real funding will be maintained&mdash;has been wound right back as a result of two rounds of efficiency cuts to various programs in vocational education and training and TAFE programs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is $158 million over the forward estimates; a further $72 million in this year's budget; a further $12.8 million dollars, or a 27 per cent reduction in ANTA's operating funds; the unilateral decision to end the $70 million growth funding which was an integral part of the last ANTA agreement and the basis on which the Labor government funded the TAFE system; and the removal of about $1.8 billion in labour market programs which are the basis on which much of the funding went to TAFE colleges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The baseline funding which this bill is proposing that we should pass and be the basis for the funding over the next five&hyphen;year agreement is inadequate of the task it ostensibly serves. This committee inquiry has revealed that it quite clearly does not meet the level of the demand within the system which at the moment&mdash;and I am sure the Senate would be aware of this&mdash;is running at some three times the level of the unmet demand in the higher education sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposition being advanced by this government suggests that this growth in vocational education and training should be funded entirely from efficiencies by the states themselves. This report reveals and details that the measures being proposed by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone&mdash;who has been participating in the meetings around this issue&mdash;are that the states fund the Commonwealth's initiatives in this area and that the states be required to pay the cost of the Commonwealth's largess. When you add the various initiatives in regard to the new apprenticeship scheme, the Commonwealth youth allowance and the various vocational education in schools programs that this government is claiming to champion, you see that it does not put its money where it mouth is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The KPMG consultancy report undertaken by ANTA revealed earlier this year that the level of underfunding is quite substantial and it is getting worse. What we are seeing from a range of sources now is that the TAFE system in this country is being seriously put at risk by the policies of this government because it is not providing the proper 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6411"> resourcing to ensure that there is adequate provision across the country. Further, because of the changes that they are undertaking in the new programs being introduced, this is leading to a substantial decline in quality. There is a real serious risk here in terms of the provision of programs to TAFE institutes which would lead to a deterioration in the level of the training provided and a deterioration in the level of service provided which would lead in my judgment&mdash;and there is some grave concern&mdash;to a deskilling of the Australian work force and would further undermine what is already a relatively poor record in regard to our international performance in such a critical area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that, a program is to be initiated by this bill for the widespread privatisation of  TAFE in this country. Some very serious issues are developing as to the way in which the Commonwealth is seeking to impose these policies without proper discussion in this country and without proper consideration of the costs of these policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whole proposition that the states should fund this measure is intellectually flawed. It is flawed on the basis of logic or public policy and will lead to a very serious deterioration in the quality of services actually provided. Such a policy assumes that the states do have efficiencies of such size that will provide sufficient funds to actually fund growth in the TAFE sector. The policy does not acknowledge that particularly for TAFE teachers that means a further reduction in the conditions they are employed under and will lead in the case of Victoria&mdash;which is often used as the benchmark for such measures and where the wages and conditions for TAFE teachers are some 10 per cent behind that of the rest of country&mdash;to yet a further reduction in the conditions under which they work. What it ignores is that the states already provide substantial efficiency dividends to their budgets through the TAFE sector. On a whole series of measures it cannot be sustained that such a proposition can be funded through efficiencies of the scale that this government is proposing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is considering the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R279">States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , and nine associated bills. It is a very important package of legislation and very complex. I will not read the titles of all of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation arises largely from the recent High Court decision about the states `fees' on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products. Whilst we are critical of the handling of the issues relating to this legislation by the Commonwealth Treasurer (Mr Costello), the Labor opposition is taking a responsible attitude to this legislation, and we will be supporting its quick passage through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor has supported the relaxation of the cut&hyphen;off rules in the Senate to allow swift consideration of this legislation. It should be known that the government ruthlessly guillotined this package through the House on Tuesday evening, even though the opposition had given a commitment to pass it anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package of bills proposes to implement the temporary Commonwealth safety net taxation arrangements announced by the Treasurer on 6 August 1997. The need for these proposed new arrangements has arisen from the decisions in what is known as the Ha and Limb and Walter Hammond cases, which were handed down by the High Court on 5 August 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These cases considered the constitutional validity of the Business Franchise Licences (Tobacco) Act 1987 of New South Wales. This legislation prohibited persons under penalty from selling tobacco, whether by wholesale or retail, without a licence. These licences are issued on application for periods of up to one month. The licence fee payable prior to the licence period was $10, plus 100 per cent of the value of the tobacco sold in the two months prior to the period of the licence. For example, the fee for the month of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6413"> August 1997 was payable at the end of July 1997 and was based on the sales which occurred in June 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question at issue in the cases was does the licence fee constitute an excise for the purposes of section 90 of the Australian constitution? The first portion of section 90 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the imposition of uniform duties of customs the power of the Parliament to impose duties of customs and of excise, and to grant bounties on the production or export of goods, shall become exclusive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The first condition of section 90&mdash;the imposition of uniform duties of customs&mdash;was achieved at 4 p.m. on 8 October 1901. From that time onwards, the Commonwealth has had the exclusive right to levy customs and excise duties. The plaintiffs claimed that the New South Wales statute breached section 90. New South Wales, with the support of all the other states and territories, submitted that the licence fees were not duties of customs or of excise within the meaning of section 90.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The specific argument of the states was that the term `duties of custom or of excise' does not cover all taxes on goods but merely duties imposed respectively on the importation or the local production or manufacture of goods. The submission sought to reopen issues decided in previous cases on the basis that incorrect reasoning had been used and that the reasoning had been followed in later cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Specifically, the states argued that the extension of the definition of `excise' to include taxes on the distribution and/or sale of goods was incorrect and should be reviewed by the High Court. The High Court did agree to reopen the issues. However, four of the seven justices found for the plaintiffs and therefore against the states, thereby invalidating the New South Wales legislation and, by extension, the legislation of the other states and territories concerning licence fees for tobacco.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst not certain, the decision probably meant the court would strike down the licence fees on petroleum and alcohol as well. The revenue threat to the states and territories of these decisions is estimated to be $5 billion in 1997&hyphen;98, which is around one&hyphen;sixth of their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> own source revenue. Clearly, this is a very major issue for the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only options for the states were to either recoup the threatened revenue from other tax bases or to request the Commonwealth to use its power under section 90 to collect the moneys effectively as an agent and to on&hyphen;pass the revenue. State and territory leaders unanimously requested the Commonwealth to utilise Commonwealth tax bases to collect the revenue formally raised by the BFFs and to remit these moneys to the states and territories. The Commonwealth agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of the Commonwealth stepping into the breach is complicated by the fact that the states and the territories impose their own BFFs on differing bases and at different rates. As the constitution limits the Commonwealth to impose identical taxes across the whole nation, compromise rates have to be struck and a complicated formula devised to equitably share the revenue. Accordingly, the Commonwealth government has announced increases in, firstly, the level of customs and excise duties on petroleum products by 8.1c per litre; secondly, the level of customs and excise duties on tobacco by $167 per kilogram; and, thirdly, the rate of wholesale sales tax on alcoholic beverages by 15 per cent, except for low alcohol wine, which will not be affected. These bills seek to implement these announced increases. The Commonwealth has stated that these increases will be reviewed within six months prior to permanent measures being decided upon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To ensure that the increase in the wholesale sales tax rates does not detrimentally affect small business, the small business exemption and the quarterly remittance regime, which both provide greater assistance to small business than the normal administrative arrangements, will be calculated with the additional tax on alcohol being excluded. These small business adjustments are appropriate and are supported by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, I wish to formally set on the record that the opposition supports the amendments moved by the government in the House to the  Sales Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1997 , which has introduced a crediting system 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6414"> that was absent from the original bill. This addresses potential anomalies&mdash;for example, where damaged goods are returned&mdash;which would have arisen without any crediting arrangements. The crediting should then be taken into account when the grants are made to the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The total revenue raised is estimated to be around $6 billion. This is obviously substantially more than the lost revenue for this financial year of $5 billion. No details are provided. The revenue from each of the increased taxes is measured on the basis that the financial impact on the Commonwealth will be nil. This is not sufficient reason to not inform the Senate of the amounts estimated to be raised. These bills propose an enormous increase in Commonwealth receipts&mdash;in excess of one per cent of gross domestic product per year&mdash;and there must be a full account of the estimates of the revenue effects of each decision. I would ask Senator Kemp,  the Assistant Treasurer, to provide full details to the Senate of the estimated receipts flowing from each of these measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All revenue raised, less the Commonwealth's administrative costs, will be passed on to the states and territories. Labor supports this approach as there is no justification for the Commonwealth to benefit financially from the High Court decisions. The  States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1997  was amended in the House last week with opposition support to facilitate the on&hyphen;passing of the revenue to the other jurisdictions. Identified proportions of the separate revenue streams are to be handed back to each jurisdiction. In turn, the states and territories have the responsibility of making payments back to producers and distributors to ensure that businesses and consumers are not detrimentally affected and so that no windfall profits are made by governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in this final phase&mdash;the reimbursement of businesses&mdash;that the whole response to the decision has been mismanaged. The High Court decision did not come out of the blue. Everyone knew the potential gravity of the decisions and the timing of the judgments. Accordingly, there is no excuse for some of the chaos that has reigned after the temporary 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth arrangements came into effect. The potential for this result was known years ago and the former government had considered the issue back in 1993. There is no doubt that the Treasurer should have formulated detailed contingency plans with the other jurisdictions prior to the decisions which could have been implemented immediately. Apparently little, if anything, was done beforehand, which is a damning indictment of the judgment of the current Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issues are apparently still not resolved. In the area of tobacco there is apparently the likelihood of a significant price hike in the price of a packet of cigarettes in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 27 August reports that these three conservative state governments&mdash;I might say, in the case of Tasmania, a state Liberal government supported by a Green party&mdash;have boycotted a recent meeting between Commonwealth Treasury officials and industry representatives to try to sort out the confusion. In that article the industry estimates that the new regime could result in increases in cigarette prices of between 84c and $1.75 per packet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was a further article by Stuart Washington in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reporting an apparent increase of around 2.5 per cent in cigarettes which will flow from the flawed implementation process of this package. Consumers are entitled to ask why this has happened. The Commonwealth Treasurer has assured the public that they would not be detrimentally affected, yet there appear to be substantial price hikes in some or all of the three commodities affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some government members have sought to link the High Court decisions with the need to introduce a GST. The Labor opposition rejects this absolutely. Indeed, we argue that the botched implementation of what is a very minor change compared with that which would occur with a GST is an indication of the absolute chaos that a GST would involve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already had Mr Stockdale reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 14 August as complaining that profiteering was occurring and the liquor industry was using the High Court decisions to rip people off. If a very conservative state 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6415"> treasurer is prepared to go on the public record in this way, it indicates that the implementation process is flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clearly, the huge changes which are inevitable under a GST would involve enormous cost to consumers over and above those that would flow from the imposition of a new tax. I do note that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has re&hyphen;christened the GST `a broad based indirect tax', or BBIT for short. It has an interesting ring to it. I am sure we will hear a lot more about the BBIT. I am surprised that Senator Kemp&mdash;and I note that he is here&mdash;did not re&hyphen;christen the GST a `GSS', or a goods and services surcharge, given the performance of this government in this area to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to affecting the current and future revenue of the states and territories, the High Court decisions have opened up the possibility of past licence fee payments being reclaimed by taxpayers. This would both  severely damage the fiscal position of the states and territories and provide a windfall gain to the taxpayers, as the licence fees have already been passed on to consumers. To overcome this unfair result, the three windfall tax bills in the package will impose a 100 per cent tax on any refunds of tobacco, alcohol or petroleum licence fees originally paid before 5 August 1997 where the refund arises because the licence fee is unconstitutional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from the other problems I have identified, there is a further significant commercial issue which arises from these bills. The use by the Commonwealth of the excise tax base instead of the wholesale sales tax base is expected to significantly affect the profitability of the three tobacco producers. Estimates provided to Labor from an analysis by Deloitte, Touche and Tohmatsu and the Allen Consulting Group indicate that moving from an ad valorem or value based system to a weight based system of taxation for tobacco will change profits significantly for the three domestic manufacturers. Estimates are that Phillip Morris will lose around $5 million per annum in profits, Wills will lose over $31 million and Rothmans will gain around $36 million per annum. The actual effect will probably now be greater, given that the total 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amount of taxation being imposed on tobacco is being increased by around half a billion dollars per annum. The Treasurer has acknowledged the issue in his press release of 6 August. However, the response does nothing to ameliorate the effects of the decision. Labor will seek an assurance from the government that the switch to excise will not result in any job losses for the thousands of people involved in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our response to the High Court decision, my colleague the shadow Treasurer, Mr Gareth Evans, indicated there were four principles which we need to be assured of to facilitate the passage of this legislation; namely, that the revenue package has the agreement of the states and territories, that it fairly distributes the revenue to the states and territories, that it does not involve extra taxes being imposed on Australians and that it is equitable in its impact on businesses immediately affected. We accept that the first two of these conditions have been met by the temporary Commonwealth response. We are concerned that the government has been less than competent in ensuring that consumers and businesses have not been detrimentally affected. Nevertheless, we realise that these bills are urgent to ensure that even further confusion and chaos is avoided and we will be supporting their passage. However, as I said earlier, I ask the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, to provide the revenue details which I have requested so that the Australian people are properly informed about the important package of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to make comment about the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill. The States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill is critical to the smooth functioning of the federation and is a non&hyphen;controversial measure. Around $16.8 billion in funding is being provided through this bill as originally introduced. In addition, the government amended the bill in the House to facilitate the on&hyphen;passing of the revenue from the Commonwealth's temporary revenue safety net arrangements which is estimated at around $6 billion in 1997-98. Labor will be supporting the bill's passage through the parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6416">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite literally, the quality and in some cases the actual existence of the state and territory government core services, such as health, education, law and order, public transport et cetera, rely heavily on the grants appropriated by this bill. The monies appropriated in this bill represent a large proportion of the financial phenomenon known as vertical fiscal imbalance, VFI, a subject I will comment on later in my speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill proposes to implement the general revenue assistance measures `agreed to' at the 1997 Premiers Conference. Of course, senators would know that when push comes to shove it is the Commonwealth's position which is agreed to at the Premiers Conference. These grants are the untied funds provided by the Commonwealth for general use by state and territory governments according to their own priorities. These untied funds are provided for two purposes: firstly, to compensate for the takeover by the Common wealth of the income tax base during World War II and, secondly, to fulfil the horizontal fiscal equalisation obligations of the Commonwealth&mdash;that is, to grant particular states and territories the additional revenue they need to provide an average level of services without resorting to above average revenue effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1997 Premiers Conference agreement involved a reaffirmation of the funding formula introduced by Labor; namely that of the real per capita indexation of the financial assistance grants&mdash;commonly known as FAGs&mdash;pool of previous years. Of course, the sting in the tail for the states and territories was that they agreed to make fiscal contributions to the Commonwealth in 1997-98 of around $627 million, building on the estimated $609 million contributed in the 1996-97 years&mdash;that is, they are to have their funding cut relative to the real per capita arrangement originally struck by Labor. In order to appease the states and territories, the method of calculation of the fiscal contribution will not reduce the base by which future years' grants are to be determined, only the allocation over the three years of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding this fiscal contribution for 1997-98 and that proposed for 1998-99, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Commonwealth has extended the real per capita funding guarantee until 1999-2000. Given the reneging by the Howard government of its pre-election commitment, which has been massively breached, to not cut grants to the states, many of the states are no doubt nervous about the likelihood of actually receiving the amount set out in the forward estimates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the government will commence making the competition payments this financial year through this bill. Again, this is a significant Labor initiative under the national competition policy to share the benefits of increased competition fairly through the various levels of government. These competition payments are estimated to total $215 million in 1997-98, being equal to $200 million in 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will speak for a couple more minutes. But, given the time and enormous importance of this legislation, when my time expires I will circulate the remainder of my speech and ask that it be incorporated.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill is the annual reminder of just how ludicrous state and federal relations have become in this country. Under this act the Commonwealth will transfer $16.8 billion to the states in general revenue assistance. Combined with specific purpose payments and the compensation arrangements under the franchises bills packages that we will consider shortly, the Commonwealth now provides about 60 per cent of the running costs of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6420"> states. That level of fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states is excessive and needs to be reviewed, but such a review should not be limited to just a fairer share of revenue; it should also have a cold hard look at spending powers as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some areas, such as health and TAFE, where most of the funding already comes from Canberra and the policy setting is also nationally driven, I think we should ask whether the states should hand them over completely, thereby saving the states around $8 billion a year. Senator Murray will expand on this in his comments on the franchise fees bills. The Democrats see some merit in a national taxation system, rather than breaking it into nine separate tax systems. But I also recognise that the current system is entirely unsatisfactory. It is unsatisfactory because the states can make cuts and blame Canberra and because Canberra can make cuts to the states grants knowing that it will be the states that bear the odium, not the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hawke-Keating government worked out very early that states grants were an easy target for cutting spending in what was for Canberra a fairly painless way of extracting  a few billion dollars. Grants fell in real terms each year from 1984 to 1991, falling from 18 per cent of Commonwealth outlays to just 12.6 per cent. The cuts in grants during the 1980s forced the states to shed around 12,000 jobs. Since then grants were largely retained in real per capita terms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard, as part of his federalism policy, promised to retain states grants in real per capita terms. That was a promise that his Liberal colleagues Mr Jeff Kennett, Richard Court, Dean Brown, Ray Groom and Rob Borbidge were hoping he would keep. But at last year's Premiers Conference they, like the other 18 million Australians, found that what Mr Howard regards as a promise and a core promise were very different. The genuine anger at last year's Premiers Conference and again this year exposed the agenda of Mr Howard and Mr Costello. A fiscal contribution of $1.5 billion over three years was agreed upon. That represents another 10,000 to 12,000 jobs lost.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, at this year's Premiers Conference, having been assured by Mr Howard and Mr Costello, the Premiers were slugged again. This time it was TAFE, public housing, local government, public health, rail infrastructure and privatisation receipts that were raided. It is little wonder that the state premiers can find so little good to say about this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I want to confine my comments to two aspects of this bill where I will be moving amendments in the committee stage. The first is the application of competition policy to the local government sector. The act before us makes available to the states a pool of $215 million in payments to promote competition policy. The Commonwealth will take into account the advice of the National Competition Council as to whether the states have made sufficient progress in implementing the competition principles agreements. That was all agreed at COAG and, even though the Democrats believe that competition policy is yet another hard&hyphen;right, ideological attack on the public provision of essential public services, at least both levels of governments agreed to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But competition policy has also been inflicted, without agreement and with only the minimum of consultation, on the local government sector. Right across Australia local government is being turned upside down in trying to come to terms with that. Local government workers are now losing contracts to private contractors from, in many cases, outside the area. When they lose the contract, the district loses employment and money flows out of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Competition policy reform has for many rural and regional areas been a very significant force for centralisation. Local councils are no longer able to engage in `buy local' campaigns because that breaches competition policy. As the regulatory review processes crank up, locally determined by-laws will be reviewed, reducing the options available to communities to determine what they think are appropriate rules on town planning and community amenities if the National Competi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6421"> tion Council regards them as potentially anti-competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Victoria all councils must put to competition virtually all their services. Forced competition policy introduced during the time when local government was controlled by state government appointees is also used to significantly reduce services and conditions of staff. It has also turned out to be very costly to administer and very uneven in terms of delivering cost savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Competition policy will be, and in some states is already, very intrusive into local government services. Yet, despite all that, there is no guarantee that local government will receive any payment from competition policy payments under this act because these payments are subject to agreement between just two levels of government. This is a very clear breach of coalition policy before the last election, which promised:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A coalition government will build an effective partnership between federal, state and local governments based on frequent and high level consultation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The coalition promised to recognise the important role of local government in the national economy. It said it would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . seek to resolve issues of long-term importance to local government, including the declining share of revenue allocated to local government and the best way local government can participate in the benefits of national competition policy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It would also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . monitor the impact of the Hilmer reforms on rural communities to ensure that they receive their fair share of the benefits.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And so on. Principle 7 of the competition principles agreement signed in 1995 makes it clear that the agreement applies to local government but it is up to each state government to determine how.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this point only two of the six states in Australia&mdash;that is, Queensland and Western Australia&mdash;have agreements with local governments on how competition policy payments will be distributed between the two levels of government. The other four have not. If competition policy is to be seen as a partnership between all levels of government, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> then I think this legislation needs to be amended to bring local government into the loop. I will be moving an amendment in the committee stage to add a condition with which the states must comply before receiving competition payments&mdash;the condition being that the state has reached agreement with representatives of local government in that state on how the competition payment will be shared. This is not a prescriptive provision. Clearly the application of competition policy at the local government level is different from state to state. What it does acknowledge is the importance of a real partnership and of the significant role that local government has played in implementing that policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second amendment I will be moving is also a very important one. It will require the Treasurer, before he makes payment of any general revenue assistance to the states, to be satisfied that the state government has in place an independent state auditor&hyphen;general. For 97 years now every state has met such a criterion&mdash;and easily so. This has only become an issue at all in the last year&mdash;in relation to Victoria where the Premier has virtually declared war on our Auditor&hyphen;General. If the Kennett government is allowed to proceed with its proposal to nobble the Auditor&hyphen;General's office, it will be able to spend Commonwealth funds in any way. Essentially, it will be unaccountable and unchecked. The Auditor&hyphen;General's role will be reduced to a symbolic and powerless one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Kennett plans have been attacked by the present Auditor&hyphen;General Mr Baragwanath, former Auditors&hyphen;General, coalition backbenchers, the Speaker of the Victorian parliament, academics, audit professional bodies and public administration experts, not to mention many thousands of ordinary, worried Victorians.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At its conference in Sydney earlier this year the Australasian Council of Public Accounts Committee recognised the crucially important role of an independent auditor&hyphen;general to underpin the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy. The council set out what it regarded as minimum conditions to establish the operational independence of the auditor&hyphen;general. Clearly Mr Kennett's plan 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6422"> in Victoria falls very far short of that standard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government was elected with promises of improving financial accountability for public funds. It has beefed up the Audit Bill and the Financial Management and Accountability Bill of the previous governments. Those bills, to be considered by the Senate later this month, are welcomed by the Democrats, as is the charter of budget honesty. These are very worthy initiatives. But to allow $16.8 billion of grants to slip through to the states without proper auditing of the expenditure must be unacceptable, and it is inconsistent with the generally commendable stance of this government on financial accountability issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be moving an amendment to make it essential that the Treasurer, before he makes any grant to a state, be satisfied that moneys will be audited by an appropriate state auditor&hyphen;general. This amendment will ensure that Victoria cannot change the mandate of its auditor&hyphen;general without risking its federal grant. That is constitutionally valid, as the states have no right to financial assistance grants per se.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment we have drafted was also drawn up based on advice from the Australasian Council of Auditors&hyphen;General. I hope for the Senate's support for this very important  accountability measure, when we get to that committee stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some fundamental problems: they are the revenue powers between state and federal governments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no power for national social standards&mdash;education, health and housing&mdash;so we have issues within the constitution which fall between the cracks. We have no inclusion of local government within the constitutional debate. Local government is within the constitutional framework by grace and favour of state and territory governments&mdash;or, in the case of the territories, by grace and favour of the Commonwealth. There are no uniform pollution standards on things like lead in petrol&mdash;nor is there any ability to ask for them. There is no bill of rights and there are no fundamental rights for individuals or communities. The recognition of the Magna Carta is hardly significant.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6423"> be resolved within closed rooms with the heads of governments already existing within the flawed constitutional structure. I believe that the lead&hyphen;up to the turn of the century is the ideal time to address these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also obviously issues about the equitability of consumption taxes, whether or not our current forms of taxes are equitable and smart the way they are charged and the way they are collected, the means of collection and the complexity of taxes. We have got the issue of consumption taxes that are not and cannot be currently targeted in terms of their environmental impact or social impact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We talked yesterday about the ability of the private sector to be able to demand that they can compete against government services despite the other issues and other values involved; their ability to demand that they can tender on what they consider to be an equal basis, on cost. However, we have a situation where there are many market imperfections within our system. We have a situation where the community are being asked to shoulder the burden of pollution, asked to shoulder the burden of future climate change, asked to shoulder the burden of dirty water or rivers that cannot be used for their original purpose and so on, or rivers drying up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community is being asked to shoulder that burden because of the activities of industry. That is a market imperfection. But we  have left ourselves currently without the ability or the will to design our tax system so that those unfair costs are not being shouldered by members of the community who have not benefited from the revenue from those activities. So those are issues we ought to be talking about, and whether or not it is fairer to tax pollution rather than employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the possibility of more targeted taxation. At times it may be as simple as replacing a tax on leaded petrol with a tax on lead additives to petrol. Using less lead will create an incentive for manufacturers as well as creating a differential price for consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate could include such things as a carbon tax, which could effectively replace much of our petrol and other fuel taxes. We have got to think about these things, because often people say, `Oh, we can't think of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> things like carbon taxes,' but we have current tax regimes and excise regimes on things like petrol. Why not design those regimes so that they do reflect the ecological sustainability of the use of those particular resources and energy inputs? Why not utilise a smart tax system which has at least more than one dividend?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A carbon tax could effectively replace many of our other petrol taxes. It could discriminate against dirtier transport and energy production, as well as high pollution energy consumption generally. We estimate that a carbon tax of about 7c a litre, properly hypothecated, could be used to virtually attain our greenhouse obligations. That is a small amount of the 44c a litre people are now paying. We could be doing this; we could be thinking smarter about our tax regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hypothecation includes equity measures such as housing and urban reconstruction, so that it replaces money now spent on similar programs without environmental targeting. You build in your hypothecation so that you have the ability to make access to transport more equitable, so that those people with the least resources in our community are not badly affected by environmental taxes and they have the ability to access roads, cycleways and public transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hypothecation includes those things, if it is well done. It also can be directed in other socially desirable directions. There are options for minimising a carbon tax through minimising polluting transport practices. Many measures are possible as part of the equity principle for providing means of minimising transport needs without compromising quality of life. Many could indeed improve the quality of life. For those people who are getting the notes to say what the public directions are in relation to the smoky haze over many of the cities of Australia&mdash;now even Perth&mdash;you can see it as you go outside your house and you find that you are coughing because of the smoke in the air. You can imagine that there are things that can happen that can improve your quality of life on a winter night or getting in and out of an airport in haze and mist and so on. There are things that can improve people's health and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6424"> quality of life which might also be good for the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other kinds of consumption taxes. These could be taxes on packaging, which would go a long way towards eliminating overpackaging and the use of non&hyphen;recyclable materials. It will also reduce costs for things like tip construction and waste collection, removal and treatment. Part of the problem here is that the local governments, which are often left with looking after the mess that everybody else makes, are the ones that shoulder that burden. So obviously there needs to be that debate on how that burden of the costs of waste can be shared and can be rationalised with the levels of government which often are the ones which make the laws in regard to things like packaging and taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could also target more wealth oriented taxes. If we are going to target consumption it might be beneficial, but it would depend on how we target consumption and what kind of consumption we are targeting. There are many possibilities within the tax debate, and I think if we mean to have a debate on taxation we could and should consider the broadest possible framework.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The group of bills that we have been asked to consider today initially were the franchise fees windfall tax bills and associated sales tax and customs tariffs bills. On to that was  tacked the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1997 almost at the last minute. I would like to foreshadow an amendment to the second reading of the franchise fees group of bills in relation to the need to widen this debate. We have what is considered by many people, including me, to be a very flawed process in relation to the Constitutional Convention, but it does seem to me that there is a unique opportunity for that Constitutional Convention to start looking at the wider issues that are brought up in such things as the court decision in relation to state taxes and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It becomes hugely obvious that there is now an opportunity to talk about the constitution, the issues that are important to people, whether there are problems in the constitution, how 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we might as a community work out innovative and creative decisions appropriate to the next century, how we might talk about the realities of state, federal and local governments and, of course, issues such as human rights, the bill of rights and, potentially, the rights of citizens to ecological sustainability. Those kinds of issues should not be held out of the debate if we are going to look at changing the head of state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the official ALP position on this issue is that the Constitutional Convention should deal only with the head of state, which is interesting because one of those three issues is supposed to be the form of the potential republic. However, I am not even sure whether they are carrying their own supporters with them on that issue. It may well be the official position of the Australian Republican Movement, and that is fine, but I am not even sure whether that is the position of the vast number of people in Australia who want Australia to move towards a change of the head of state. Personally, I do not see much point in simply changing the head of state given what I see as the problems that we ought to be addressing in our constitution. Simply changing the head of state does not help much in addressing those real issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have an opportunity. This set of bills is a very good pointer to where we should be using that opportunity to widen that debate. It is not appropriate to limit that debate to those who are already within the political system. The second reading amendment that I have foreshadowed suggests that the forthcoming Constitutional Convention should develop mechanisms and a timetable to facilitate community debate on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us go out to the community and not be frighted to ask people about what they want and about the timetable for change. Instead of that, we will be coming up again and again trying to address the problems caused by our current taxation system&mdash;the vertical imbalance&mdash;and the enforced problems due to the changes wrought on local, state and federal governments as a result of such things as competition policy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6425">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a huge debate in relation to competition policy and revenue. Often those decisions are made on high, and this should not be the case. We should be talking about what we think is appropriate and where the revenue should be coming from. The debate should also be talking about what kinds of things the community thinks the government ought to be involved in when spending the revenue we collect. If we change the debate around, we should be looking, firstly, at what is an appropriate level of tax for those things which the community thinks are important. When we have discovered that, we can work out a fair way to collect it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no problems with the ALP's second reading amendment, but I also urge the Senate, despite the indication I have received so far, to support the move to broaden that debate, to not just come back here again and again with bandaid solutions to what is obviously an ongoing problem with taxation and to start talking about it in a constitutional sense.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R279">States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  and associated bills represent the Commonwealth's urgent response to the decision of the High Court on 5 August 1997 to overturn the power of the states to collect franchise fees on tobacco, alcohol and, by implication, petrol. It is the intention of the Australian Democrats to give you every assistance to pass this bill urgently today. </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This decision has blown a huge hole in the revenue power of the states&mdash;a $5 billion revenue hole. This package of bills will increase the sales tax on alcohol and the excises on petrol and tobacco to plug that hole. The states will be reimbursed all additional revenue raised, with the responsibility then being on the states to reimburse the tax collection which is in excess of that which would have been collected under the former state laws. It is, altogether a very messy business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is because under section 99 of the constitution the Commonwealth cannot set different revenue rates for different states&mdash;quite rightly, too. This has obviously created 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a serious problem because in this case the rates of franchise fees differ markedly between states. This is particularly the case in terms of petrol franchise fees which range from zero in Queensland to 9.7c in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats will support these bills. It is a good thing to move towards uniform rates of taxation across the states in as many areas as possible, especially in terms of what are colloquially known as `sin taxes'. The tax competition between the states has been largely self&hyphen;defeating. Appropriate tax policy for the states is as much in need of debate and reform as is federal tax policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us examine some of the state taxation measures available. The states bartered away their right to collect inheritance taxes, making Australia one of the few countries in the world without any taxes on wealth. The states were given payroll tax powers in 1971 by the Commonwealth, but have already bartered away about half of the revenue base there by exempting about 85 per cent of businesses from that tax. That may be applauded by those who are against taxes on employment, but it is a big decision given the financial needs of the states. More recently, led as usual by Queensland, the states bartered down hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue on stock exchange transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, Queensland coming cap in hand to every premiers conference and arguing disadvantage rings a bit hollow when it refuses to raise sufficient revenue on goods like petrol. It would be far more environmentally and economically responsible to do so. And, contrary to all Queensland's rhetoric, Queensland's low taxes have not led to economic growth; other factors apply there. On a per capita basis, the higher taxing states of Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales have been leaving Queensland for dead. Not just that, Queensland's low tax status has also failed to lead to quality jobs, with the wages of Queensland workers well below those of other states. In our view, the move to uniform tax rates is welcome and will help iron out phoney state tax competitiveness.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6426">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should note that the Queensland government has foreshadowed that it will be reimbursing all its petrol franchise to keep Queensland petrol rates low. This, in our view, is an inappropriate action, but the Queensland cost of motoring picture is not at all straightforward. Queensland has its taxes on private vehicle use completely the wrong way around. It does not charge duty on petrol, so making petrol 8c to 9c cheaper than in other states, but Queensland boasts the highest annual motor vehicle registration fees. On a standard Ford Falcon, Queenslanders pay $314 a year for the right to drive. That is $174 a year more than Victorians, $113 a year more than New South Wales people and $200 a year more than Western Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put that into perspective, a Queensland driver has to drive over 18,500 kilometres a year more than a Western Australian driver to end up lower taxed, because of Queensland's high up&hyphen;front motor vehicle registration fees. Given that most drivers drive substantially fewer kilometres than 18,500 a year, most Queensland drivers end up paying more state taxes on motoring than do Western Australians, even though Western Australians have higher petrol taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For many years the Democrats have been calling for up&hyphen;front motor vehicle registration fees to be replaced by higher petrol taxes. This is classic user pays: the more you drive, the more you burn fossil fuel and add to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, the more you should pay. Instead, Queensland  opted for a very high up&hyphen;front fee but no user pays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find myself in complete agreement with Jeff Kennett, who proposed that the states should use the opportunity of the High Court decision to move to more uniform tax rates on an averaging principle. Under the Kennett plan, Queensland would have agreed to a petrol excise but would have dropped its massive regressive up&hyphen;front flat&hyphen;rate motor vehicle taxes. This bill gives Queensland the opportunity and the impetus to go ahead and make such an environmentally and economi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cally responsible restructuring of its tax system as regards petrol charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This set of bills also sets up a windfall tax collection mechanism to ensure that business is not able to take financial advantage of the High Court decision, to avoid paying state fees before the federal tax. It remains a matter for the states to ensure that there is a full reimbursement of any taxes that are also paid to the Commonwealth. All states but New South Wales have now put such mechanisms into place, and the Democrats will encourage New South Wales to follow suit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to make two other comments about the High Court decision. The first is about tax reform. The Democrats do not regard the High Court decision as making any significant contribution to the debate about whether or not Australia should have a GST. Alcohol, tobacco and petrol are taxed outside a VAT in virtually all OECD countries&mdash;that is, for social and environmental reasons, these items have always been taxed higher than other goods and services. That goes back to the sin tax or moral tax version, as they are often called.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Absolutely no&hyphen;one outside of the National Party and its secular arm, the National Farmers Federation, would advocate that excises should be replaced by a GST. Let us remember that, with these bills, excise collections in total are now over $18.5 billion. That is $4 billion more than the take from the entire wholesale sales tax system. That means that abolishing excises of this kind would add about six per cent to any proposed GST rate across all other goods and services. I can assure those of my colleagues who are in the National Party that I cannot see the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) agreeing to that. If anything, the High Court case has made the possibility of a GST replacing all the taxes listed in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Fightback</EMPHASIS> less likely rather than more likely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I want to make is about Commonwealth&hyphen;state relations in financial terms. The thing that the High Court decision does make absolutely essential is reform of Commonwealth&hyphen;state financial relations. As a result of the decision, over 60 per cent of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6427"> state finance is now based on federal funds. That is a ridiculous position to be in. On the one hand, it reinforces the long&hyphen;held Democrats view that our nine governments are a costly anachronism that should be either put to death or be radically reduced as soon as possible. They really would have no viable role to play in our overgoverned national life if local and regional government were restructured to do the job. On the other hand, if we are to have states, let us have fewer rather than more. Their financial status has to be clarified and improved. The Prime Minister seems to be saying he is stuck with whingeing state premiers who get up his nose. They, in turn, say they are stuck with their financial reliance on Canberra and the annual scrap with the federal pit bull terriers, smug and otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to clean up the relationship to level up the taxation and spending powers. I do not believe that it needs to be a one&hyphen;way street with Canberra simply ceding taxing powers to the states. As I said earlier, the states have proven to be in many respects poor defenders of their revenue base and they have a historical habit of giving away the powers that they were given. Further, given the small size of the Australian markets, the general failure of competitive federalism and the pressures of foreign competition, there is a strong case for uniform taxation rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I emphasise that the reform of federal&hyphen;state relations should look at both taxation and spending. I cannot see any reason why, for example, the states should not hand over the public hospital system to the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth already funds the vast bulk of the system through Medicare. It  sets the standards for public health through Medicare and the NHMRC. It would save around $300 million to $400 million a year in state bureaucracy costs just to hand the whole thing over, and cut federal&hyphen;state grants accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal matters and industrial relations should be handed over to the Commonwealth. Once again, we were delighted with Jeff Kennett's proposal to move industrial relations across. That made a great deal of sense to us. Those kinds of things would even out 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the deficit a bit more. Then we should look at giving the states a more certain and long&hyphen;term funding base for the rest of their genuinely state orientated needs. Such a plan requires not just Commonwealth&hyphen;state agreement, but also cross&hyphen;party agreement for the necessary constitutional changes and for the necessary changes in our direction. For that reason, I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment to the motion for the second reading of this bill, asking the government to set up a conference of federal, state and local government party leaders to reach a new consensus on reform. I urge senators to support my second reading amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have traversed an interesting debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R279">States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> which is now before this chamber. I am able to provide some information that Senator Sherry sought on the revenue from the sales tax and excise. The explanatory memorandum for the sales tax bills indicates that $760 million is expected to be raised from the 15 percentage point increase in the sales tax on alcohol from 1997-98. The explanatory memorandum for the excise bills indicates that $5.56 billion per annum is be expected to be raised from the increase in excise on tobacco and petroleum products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am able to provide the Senate&mdash;I think this will be of interest to Senator Sherry&mdash;with some further details on the estimated revenue collected on the basis of equivalent full year figures for 1997-98. These numbers are therefore slightly different from those appearing in the explanatory memorandums. The estimates on a full year 1997-98 basis, based on safety net arrangements as announced on 5 August, are as follows: tobacco excise, $3.26 billion; petroleum excise, $2.48 billion; and increased sales tax on alcoholic products, $914 million. The total is in the order of the $6.65 billion. I think that provides the figures that Senator Sherry was seeking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is always a pity that Senator Sherry cannot resist the temptation to take the odd pot shot at the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6428"> other chamber. I think he probably feels a bit safer taking pot shots over here. Every time the shadow Treasurer, Mr Evans, takes a pot shot, he seems to end up on the floor; and the same applies to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). But I think Senator Sherry feels, from the safety of the Senate chamber, that he can perhaps try to do what his colleagues fail to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry was a bit worried about chaos following this announcement. The only chaos that I am able to detect is the chaos on the Labor Party side in relation to tax reform. It is very difficult to find a Labor Party position in relation to tax reform. Every time someone&mdash;whether it be the shadow minister for Transport, Mr Tanner, or some of the Young Turks, or even the shadow Treasurer&mdash;puts their head up to make a view the Leader of the Opposition comes out the following day and chastises them and changes his mind successively. The nation recognises the chaos which exists in the Labor Party on taxation. We commiserate with Senator Sherry for having been dropped once again as shadow Treasurer. We thought he may have been able to make a contribution to resolving this chaos, but he seems to be adding to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the other comments which have been made, Senator Margetts traversed a very wide range of topics. I think Senator Margetts took us back to the Magna Carta at one stage and brought us forward to the Constitutional Convention and raised a variety of issues which she thought were important. Let me say that, unlike the Labor Party, Senator Margetts is purely prepared to enter the tax reform debate. I note her views, and it is not surprising that Senator Margetts would raise issues in relation to environ mental taxes. I think Senator Margetts recognised that there were some real problems with the current tax system&mdash;as did the Australian Democrat speakers. In their remarks both the Greens and the Democrats indicated that they saw particular problems with the tax system and raised some issues which they thought should be addressed. I must say that some of these issues go far beyond these bills. Nonetheless, we are interested to receive comments.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My old friend Senator Murray mentioned&mdash;and he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;putting the states to death. That is a very strange thing for a Democrat senator to say. Democrat senators do not win any seats in the lower house, Senator Murray. You actually win seats in the upper house as a result of state&hyphen;wide elections. It did seem to me, Senator Murray, that you are sawing off the branch that you are sitting on. I did think it was a strange remark to come from a Democrat senator. But Senator Murray raised a lot of issues in relation to tax reform and some of the anomalies that he felt were present in the current system and could not resist taking a swipe at a number of the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills before this chamber are very important. They are bills which we need to progress quickly. I note the many comments that have been made by senators. Some of the comments I thank senators for; other comments I totally and absolutely reject.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment is essentially designed to maintain the status quo in terms of safeguards in the auditing functions currently in place in the states. The Victorian Auditor-General recently found evidence that senior members of the Department of the Premier and Cabinet spent $300,000 on corporate credit cards and breached internal procedures in doing so. He found and published evidence of possible corruption in an ambulance services contract tendering process and he criticised the government for failing to demand $174 million more in licence fees from Crown Casino after allowing Crown an extra 150 gaming tables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I mention this is that the Victorian government responded to these criticisms by ordering a review of the Audit Act and it appointed a three&hyphen;person panel to conduct that review. For the Senate's information a member of that panel is a director of the Crown Casino and is also a former director of KPMG.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review panel recommendations were that the Auditor-General should be removed from direct control over his department and that this department be made into a government enterprise called Audit Victoria. The Auditor-General would become one of a three&hyphen;member panel which would decide whether the privatised Audit Victoria or private accounting companies would be awarded contracts for the financial audit of all 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6431"> government departments. Of course, the Auditor-General can be outvoted by government appointed members, that is, the other two members of the panel. The Auditor-General would be made an officer of the parliament and the budget for his office would be allocated by parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government claims its legislation will strengthen the independence of the Auditor-General. It claims it was required to conduct this review under national competition policy&mdash;and that is the key here. It claims that the Auditor-General and Audit Victoria will be more efficient and save taxpayers' money. I challenge those claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The office of the Auditor-General already contracts out much of its work to private auditing firms, with contract audit fees for 1995&hyphen;96, for instance, amounting to about $5.9 million. That is out of a total of $17.7 million. It is imperative that the Auditor-General have the primary responsibility for the audit function. Efficiency reviews are very often prompted by information which is gleaned during that auditing of accounts. This opportunity would be very significantly diminished if the responsibility for the audit function was spread across a number of bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most fundamental issue is that the Auditor-General's office is not just any government instrumentality. It enjoys a unique role in our system of government because its principal purpose is to assist the parliament to hold the executive government to account. In my view, the costs of performing these functions cannot be reduced without undermining its reason for existing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Auditor-General argues that this attempt to nobble him is an ideological experiment. I will quote from something he wrote recently. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am more convinced than ever that the direction proposed by the review team will lead to a situation in which a future parliament, if confronted by either an oppressive or a corrupt government, would be relatively impotent and not privy to information which would allow it to call such a government to account. The team's model has been postulated in a report which is devoid of empirical 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> evidence and is characterised by unsubstantiated assertions, textual inconsistencies, uncertainty as to the likely outcomes and recommendations based on minority views.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Thousands of Victorians have openly criticised the state government over this review&mdash;including the Law Institute of Victoria and the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. In fact, the latter said that there is no way that the Auditor-General under this new arrangement could protect Audit Victoria and private auditors being subjected to commercial or political pressure. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The independence of auditors&hyphen;general and their contributions to open, democratic government cannot be overemphasised. A hands&hyphen;off approach by government to the role of the Auditor-General is the only acceptable way that democratic processes can be safeguarded.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In 1995 the Democrats predicted that the public sector would be forced to restructure in far&hyphen;reaching and not necessarily positive ways. We said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Competition Policy Reform Bill 1995 . . . will force public service agencies to reassess their role, their relationship to the public, and to realign their operations.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Operators of contracted out services, executives of corporatised and privatised services and companies competing with public services will not accept the same level of public accountability for service delivery and quality that government departments accept as appropriate for ensuring the public has adequate lines of redress.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that we are now realising some of that potential. I would argue that this agreement between the two levels of government very conveniently has been used as a vehicle for the sort of extreme ideological position being taken by, in this case, the Victorian coalition government. I would also argue that we have in Victoria a state government which is so arrogant that it dares to demolish yet another body which Victorians knew they could rely on&mdash;all in the name of competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment will see that the Victorian government is not able to put at risk Commonwealth money going to the states. It is a sensible safeguard and one which would ensure that competition policy reform is not used as an excuse for secrecy and an oppor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6432"> tunity for corruption. A truly independent Auditor-General in each state is a guarantee of that safeguard.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="6432" TIME="11.41 a.m." SPEAKER="Murray, Sen Andrew" NAMEID="3M6" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="AD" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator MURRAY</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(11.41 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Auditor-General has a central place in the accountability chain and has a fundamental watchdog role in the Australian system of government. The Auditor-General's office is responsible for the external audits of the financial affairs of the Victorian public sector, for the public sector in every state and every government, and for the performance audits which assess the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the management of public sector resources in the state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It therefore plays a key role in the accountability process of the government to the parliament, and ultimately to the taxpayers and the public of Victoria. There is no doubt that Senator Allison's amendment is directed at correcting an appalling assault, in our view, on the independence and the accountability of the Auditor-General in that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the Kennett government initiated a review into the Victorian Audit Act 1994, in line with national competition policy rules. That an accountability agency should have been dealt with in this way was extraordinary, and the move rang alarm bells in all sectors of the community concerned with accountability. The report, which was handed down in late April, intends to considerably alter, to the detriment of the people of Victoria, the powers and the role of the auditor and threatens to materially weaken our system of responsible government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1992 WA Inc. royal commission emphatically stated the importance of the Auditor-General in the chain of accountability. The royal commission said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The office of Auditor-General provides a critical link in the accountability chain between the public sector, the parliament and the community. It alone subjects the practical conduct and operations of the  public sector as a whole to regular, independent investigation and review. This function must be fully guaranteed and its discharge facilitated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again that royal commission in 1992, which was established in the wake of allegations of corruption and illegal and improper conduct 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the affairs, investment decisions and business dealings of the Labor government of Western Australia, reported on the essential nature of the independence of the Auditor-General from the government and the executive. The royal commission said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor-General is the parliament's principal informant on the performance of the administrative system. The parliament therefore has a special responsibility to ensure both that the independence and the effective resourcing of the Auditor-General are secured.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">While the Victorian report proposes to enhance the independence of the auditor by making him or her an independent officer of the parliament&mdash;which would be welcomed if it were accompanied by the financial independence of the parliament&mdash;the extensive reduction of the auditor's powers with the audit program makes the increased independence farcical. The proposal that financial audits and performance audits be conducted by private auditing firms underestimates the scope of the Auditor&hyphen;General's tasks and its function as a fundamental accountability agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government and other senators here may ask whether this is the appropriate place to put an amendment which would ensure that auditors-general in the states deal properly and are able to deal properly with funds given to them by the Commonwealth on behalf of the people of Australia. We see no other place to put it. We cannot lay it down in general principles. It has to be in an act which governs the transference of money from the Commonwealth to the states. We would urge senators to consider that, if they allow the erosion of that process of accountability, that erosion of the proper auditing function, within states they are allowing the potential for corruption and improper conduct to be advanced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one in this chamber has ever wanted that to happen. But it is our view that, if those changes occur, the potential for improper conduct will indeed be enhanced, and we believe the Commonwealth has a role and a responsibility to the people of Australia to make sure that the moneys given to every government in this country are properly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6433"> looked after. I therefore strongly support and commend Senator Allison's amendment to senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will close with a clarification. During my contribution to the second reading debate, Minister, you asked me about my view on the governments. I have the view that nine governments are far too many for 18 million people, and I think some of those governments need to be done away with. We need fewer governments in this country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am concerned about this particular measure, and I would ask the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) whether or not he would agree with the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants&mdash;a well&hyphen;known radical body of persons in this country&mdash;who say, in their press release of 1 August this year, that competitive cunning and the survival of the fittest may suit a market economy but are entirely inappropriate for ensuring honest government. Also, according to the CPA's Director for Accounting and Auditing, Mr Colin Parker, competition policy as enshrined in the Hilmer report was never meant to be applied to entities such as the Auditor&hyphen;General's department, whose primary function was public service. I would be concerned to establish whether or not the government was in agreement with that proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to establish whether or not the Commonwealth government was in agreement with the statements of the South Australian Liberal Premier, Mr John Olsen, and the Queensland National Premier, Mr Rob Borbidge, who both rejected the proposition that auditors&hyphen;general be subject to national competition policies. They have rejected the moves being taken in Victoria in regard to undermining the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be concerned to know, Minister, whether or not you share that view of the governments of Queensland and South Australia or whether you share the view of your 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Victorian colleagues in the Victorian branch of the Liberal Party. I would also be interested to know whether or not you share the view of the New Zealand Auditor&hyphen;General, who has in fact undermined the claim by the Victorian Premier, Mr Jeff Kennett, that the reforms relating to the Auditor&hyphen;General in the state of Victoria were in fact modelled on the New Zealand example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New Zealand Auditor&hyphen;General was reported on 27 July 1997 as saying, `I would be uncomfortable with and would not accept such a model being forced on me.' I would ask, Minister, whether or not the Commonwealth shares that view and whether or not it believes it is appropriate that in the state of Victoria such action is being taken to undermine what is, of course, an essential part of the Westminster tradition within this case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be also concerned, Minister, to establish whether or not you were concerned about the level and extent of the attempts by the Victorian government to undermine public accountability of its public officials in that state. I would be concerned to know whether or not you supported the sackings of judges and quasi&hyphen;judicial officers that have occurred in this state; whether or not you were supportive of the way in which the Kennett government hounded statutory appointees from office and the way in which it delayed democratic elections in local government; whether or not you were supportive of the way in which it forced out of office the Commissioner of Equal Opportunity and the Director of Public Prosecutions in that state, and the way in which it sought to and succeeded in weakening the parliamentary committee system in this state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be concerned to know whether or not this government actually supported the actions taken in Victoria to silence critics within the education system, to prevent teachers making public comment on important issues in regard to eduction, and to prevent doctors making public comment on the hospital system in the state of Victoria. I would be concerned to know whether or not this government supported the actions taken by the Victorian government to remove from various acts of parliament in the state of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6434"> Victoria on some hundred occasions the right of appeal to the Supreme Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, I would be concerned to know whether or not Minister Kemp supported the general attacks upon the democratic rights and freedoms in this state which saw the Auditor&hyphen;General, the last bastion of independent thought in that state, brought to heel in the manner in which this Premier sought to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us recall some of the reports that the Auditor&hyphen;General in Victoria drew to public attention. He drew to public attention the blatant corruption that occurs in that state between the various agencies of government, the links with big business and the manner in which the legislative process had been subverted by the Liberal Party in the state of Victoria. We have seen that, for instance, in the case of the casino licence. We have seen misuse of the community support fund through the casino and misuse of political advertising. We have seen the corrupt practices that have taken place in regard to the granting of the Leeds Media contract and the actions taken with land developers to secure school sites in the state of Victoria, to secure the profits for speculators. That is now a longstanding practice in that state, with its having occurred over the last four years. We have also seen the abuse of child protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we have seen the corrupt practices that have been exposed in regard to the ambulance contracts in that state. We have seen the public hospital system completely destroyed by the cutbacks that have been made in that state, and the corrupt practices that have taken place in regard to the administration of the health portfolio in that state. I would be concerned to know whether or not Minister Kemp supported those actions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also be concerned to know whether or not it was the case that this government acknowledged that no other state in the Commonwealth was pursuing these sorts of policies. No other government in this country is prepared to adopt the actions that the Kennett government is prepared to adopt to  subvert the democratic process and undermine the fundamental principles on which government throughout the rest of the country is undertaken. What we have here is a funda 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mental principle, the independence of the office of the Auditor-General, being quite seriously attacked in the state of Victoria. It is quite clear that what we see before us are actions being taken by the state of Victoria which I think really put at risk some pretty basic principles about the freedoms and the rights of citizens in this country.

We are talking about very serious consequences for the revenue of all states if it is not passed quickly and urgently. We believe it is inappropriate to tack on a measure like this to a piece of revenue legislation. We may consider it in respect of the Auditor-General's bill that will come before the Senate.

However, I will be quick.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nature of states grants being more and more untied automatically would indicate that it is more necessary now than it ever was to make sure that those funds are properly, responsibly and independently audited. If ever there is an argument that that should be done it is when the grants are of an untied nature. I find it extraordinarily hypocritical of people to come in and say that without providing the funding for the sufficient training of ATSIC officers to do all the auditing that is required by government&mdash;there is an expectation that it is done on every last dollar of ATSIC funding, which is fine&mdash;you can provide untied grants to state and territory governments and not demand specific auditing requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is important when you think of specific issues such as Aboriginal spending. We

And yet there is no auditing to see whether or not the funds allocated in general for those purposes are actually spent for those purposes. I find the hypocrisy of that absolutely unbelievable. So I indicate that I will support the Democrats' amendments on this issue, and I will look forward to hearing the debate on the bills relating to the Auditor&hyphen;General, to see whether or not a similar amendment is supported then.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address a couple of the remarks that were made during the debate. Senator Kemp says that this is a threat to the agreements between the federal government and the states, but I suggest that all states, aside from Victoria, would welcome this very much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the Senate's attention to the recent review in Western Australia of their Auditor&hyphen;General's functions. It said: `The parliament should appropriate resources for the Auditor&hyphen;General to audit as he thinks fit and take a role in determining the budget of the office separate to the executive.' In New South Wales, much the same thing happened. Their review said: `All possible measures should be taken to strengthen the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General from central government.' The former Commonwealth Auditor&hyphen;General, John Taylor, and the former state ombudsman, Norm Geschke vigorously opposed these changes. I could give you a very long list of people who are similarly opposed and appalled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not affect the agreements with the states; in fact, all states would currently fall in line with such a provision. What we are saying is that we want to remove a threat, not threaten anything which is existing. We want to maintain the status quo. So I think it is quite wrong of the government to suggest that this would be in any way a threat to anybody.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6439">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More than anything else, I am disappointed with the response of the ALP. Senator Conroy tells us that every day there is more and more corruption in the Victorian state parliament, that they have closed down scrutiny, but these words ring hollow in the Senate. Most of what he says is irrelevant anyway to today's debate. I have to say, too, that I think there will be a number of people in the ALP in Victoria who will be very disappointed that the ALP in the Senate has shown such weakness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a relevant place in which to introduce this kind of safeguard. I will certainly be looking forward to the role that the ALP will play when we come to the Auditor&hyphen;General's bill but, as far as I can see, this is not an appropriate place to deal with the question of the Victorian Auditor&hyphen;General. I would be happy if someone would correct me on that, but from my reading of the situation that would be totally inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have shared platforms with a number of people from the ALP in the past few months in the many public meetings that have been held in Victoria about the Auditor&hyphen;General, and it will come as some surprise to the audiences who have turned up in their hundreds, and their thousands in some cases, to learn that the ALP is not willing to take this very small step which would put in place those safeguards that it has supposedly been calling for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well for Senator Conroy to talk about the sentiment of the amendment. We are not here to talk about sentiments, though; we are talking about a substantial amendment which will do what Senators Carr, Conroy and Sherry have been saying they would like to see in place. But they are too afraid or too unwilling&mdash;I am not sure what the reason is. They make many excuses for not actually taking that step.

As I said earlier, we have serious concerns about the Auditor&hyphen;General and proposals in Victoria for change, but we have similar concerns about state expenditure in respect of some other states. It seems to me that, if the Senate has a role in that process at all, you do need to examine the Auditor&hyphen;General arrangements in all states, whether they are satisfactory or unsatisfactory. If we come to the conclusion that they are unsatisfactory, not just in Victoria but in a number of other states or territories, it requires a comprehensive approach.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Schedule 1, item 3, page 5 (after line 4), at the end of section 10, add:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Treasurer must deduct an amount under subsection (1) if the State has not reached an agreement with the body representing local government authorities in that State on the manner in which the amount of financial assistance grant is to be shared between the State and local government authorities in that State.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We were told in 1995 that the national competition policy would have to involve local government if it was to penetrate into every level of government activity. The federal government took the stick and carrot approach and put in place incentives to make that happen. One of those incentives is a reward or a bonus of $250 million, which is intended to be shared by the states for their competitive achievements and to help promote further competition endeavours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have said many times that competition does not necessarily lead to better outcomes. We do not hold the same view as the major parties that the marketplace has all the answers. We think that there is a very significant role for public services and for public servants. We also think that it is important that the decisions about how and by whom services are delivered should be made by weighing up all the advantages and disadvantages. We do not accept that the private for profit models are always applicable and we do not accept that the public sector is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6441"> inherently inefficient, needing only a bit of competition to get it to lift its game.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, having said all that, competition policy is now a reality. In states such as Victoria, competition policy has been compulsorily imposed on every council in the state. By law, councils must contract out 50 per cent of their total expenditure. Because total expenditure includes everything from interest on bank loans to depreciation to executive salaries, and because all of it must be counted in the equation, the effect is to force councils to contract out around 80 per cent or more of their actual services. In many councils the figure is much higher than that. This is particularly so in the more remote councils where that amount can be over 100 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst Mr Kennett's commissioners controlled all of local government in the state with the exception of Queenscliff Council, they saw to it that services would not be excluded from the process at all. So maternal and child health services, meals on wheels, parks and gardens, planning and libraries all went out to tender. Even the most economic rationalist country in the world&mdash;Thatcher's Britain&mdash;drew the line at libraries and maternal and child health services. In the first round, the majority of in&hyphen;house teams actually won their tenders but not before services had been reduced and salaries and conditions were lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost to local government in real dollars has been very high. Spending on consultancies to draw up specifications, creating a new bureaucratic level within councils to administer contracts, and dividing councils into so&hyphen;called `client' and `provider' organisations has been very high. For a medium sized council such as that in Ballarat, the cost is around a million dollars a year just to put in that bureaucracy. In other councils, the promised savings from contracting out have not eventuated. The council to which I pay my rates budgeted for a $2 million saving but it turned out to be a cost of $2 million, and it is $4 million worse off than it expected. By and large, the state government has kept the lid on the very variable successes of this brave new world of competition policy in local government. Councils have been told to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> put up and shut up or to run the risk of, again, being sacked just as Darebin council was a few weeks ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to make here is that the implementation of competition policy has not been all beer and skittles. It has often been very painful, and it has been very costly. I have been to countless small towns that have had the stuffing knocked out of their economies because their particular council has gone altogether from their midst through amalgamation, and with it has gone the handful of jobs that made the difference between sustainability and otherwise. When you combine the huge job losses in local government at the grassroots level with the job losses of the downsizing experts in the areas of banking and state and federal government agencies, the pain is very deeply felt indeed. Contracts are won by big and even bigger businesses, and the towns lose jobs in favour of regions and then the regions lose out again to capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The downside of competition is the very real fact that competitors aim to rid themselves of competition, and it tends to be an opportunity not for small business but rather for bigger business and for cities. As for local government, very often there is no going back. It is very doubtful that a council would ever be able to re&hyphen;enter the garbage collection business or maternal and child health services field down the track. Those trucks and health centres have been sold off very often at bargain basement prices, and the council's being able to again afford expensive infrastructure is very unlikely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe that the federal government should recognise not just the difficulties and the costs of entering competition policy reform but also the risks and the ongoing costs, and they are, of course, social as well as monetary ones in many cases. It should show more than a passing interest in how its competition reforms are progressing at the local level, and it should insist that the states do not trample on councils by using only that stick approach, as Victoria has already done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recommend that the Senate acquaint itself with the agreement that was drawn up earlier 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6442"> this year between the Queensland state government, the Local Government Association of Queensland and the Brisbane City Council. It is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National competition policy: financial incentive package for local governments</EMPHASIS>. This document affirms the commitment for two levels of government to work together in a cooperative manner. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that local government is a separate and autonomous sphere of government and each respective council is ultimately responsible for the introduction of competition reforms at a local government level . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is worth noting that this agreement specifically rejects the notion of compulsion on local governments to introduce competitive tendering or to privatise any of their activities. The financial arrangement in this document is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government proposes to set aside an amount of $150M of its "bonus" competition payments . . . from the Commonwealth for allocation amongst those local governments which implement NCP reforms. This amount to be indexed annually.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So this $150 million in Queensland will be used for training and assistance to local government to conduct reviews and to act as an incentive. I think I can guarantee that competition policy reform in Queensland will be implemented in a way that is far more sensible, far more sensitive to local needs and, at the end of the day, much more lasting than it has been in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment that I have put today insists that state governments put in place agreements, such as this one in Queensland, with their local government organisations. Western Australia, as I understand it, has also entered into arrangements for agreeing on something similar. This is Commonwealth money, and it is an opportunity for the federal government to put into action some of its rhetoric on local government and, for once, to show that it is willing to embrace a meaningful partnership.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Yesterday in discussions with Senator Faulkner, I undertook to provide the Senate with a briefing on the contract let by my department with South Pacific Cruise Lines Ltd under the training for employment program. I indicated yesterday that I hoped to come back to the estimates committee or the Senate with the fullest possible answers because I am determined to get to the bottom of this issue. I am not in a position to do that today. I will come back with more information when the picture is clearer. Today I will address all of the outstanding matters raised by Senator O'Brien in the Senate last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter needs to be considered in two parts. The first relates to the likely outcomes under the contract. Let me put on the record the picture as I am advised at this point. In summary, some 290 trainees will soon complete the onshore component of the training intended under this contract. The contract was extended on 20 August for a few weeks from 29 August to 12 September to enable one element of the training to be delivered. The Commonwealth will pay no additional mon 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> eys to either South Pacific Cruise Lines or William Angliss as a result of that extension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that those offered employment by the company will be flying to Singapore at no additional cost to the Commonwealth. There is a final training component funded under the contract which must be completed on board the ship. The  trainees, at that stage, will be employees of South Pacific Cruise Lines and no longer eligible for formal training assistance. I am not in a position to say at this point whether South Pacific Cruise Lines will complete the ship&hyphen;based training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The arrangements made with the company and with William Angliss 2000, the principal training provider, have already resulted in a substantial number of formally case managed or long-term unemployed job seekers receiving accredited training and in all likelihood the opportunity to secure a job that may not otherwise have come their way. Indeed, if anything, the likelihood of success is stronger now than when the original arrangements were entered into, because the department has received assurances from the training provider to assist with the placement of those who successfully complete the course should they not be offered a job by South Pacific Cruise Lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This assurance was first given on 16 June this year and reconfirmed to the department on 28 August. Clearly, I have serious concerns about the process which I will address shortly. However, the trainees have had substantial training and are in a good position to obtain employment in the tourism industry even if employment with South Pacific Cruise Lines does not eventuate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of this matter concerns the process which led to the letting of the contract. The original proposal emanated from William Angliss 2000 in late January 1977. William Angliss 2000 is a reputable training provider with experience in delivering under contracts with DEETYA. The details of the training arrangements, including the unit cost, were settled between the department and William Angliss. South Pacific Cruise Lines was a participant in these processes since they were the intended employer once the proposed training had been provided.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6445">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Towards the end of negotiations that began in January I am advised that South Pacific Cruise Lines proposed, and DEETYA and William Angliss agreed, that they should be the principal to the contract. The principal explanation provided for this request to date is that it would assist to lock in the links with the potential employer and that, from the company's perspective, it would help SPCL with their prospectus. I am not entirely satisfied with that explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">William Angliss's agreement was conditional on them remaining the training subcontractor and project manager. I understand that on 16 May a contract was signed between the department and SPCL covering the period 23 June to 29 August. The full amount of the contract was $2,794,799.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the arrangements that were agreed, 80 per cent of the contract sum was provided to South Pacific Cruise Lines as an advance payment. I understand that all but $700,000 of this sum has now been paid by South Pacific Cruise Lines to William Angliss. This $700,000 is not yet due for payment. The advance payment was made at a time when there was evidence of the bona fides of the parties involved in that a substantial training program had been designed and the process for the selection of trainees was well advanced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By 5 June, the date of the advance payment, some 200 of the eventual 340 commencing trainees had been selected. That exercise was completed by 16 June, in time for the training to start on the 23rd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not lost on me, as it is no doubt not lost on senators, that at that point those associated with South Pacific Cruise Lines could have pocketed the advance and disappeared. That is a serious process issue. The fact that South Pacific Cruise Lines did not take that course of action, and that we are now in a position where the vast bulk of the training has been delivered, perhaps points to a positive outcome, despite the shortcomings of the process. The remaining 20 per cent of the contract sum is only payable in the event that 70 per cent of the commencing trainees are employed for a period of at least six 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> weeks following the completion of the training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the decision to make so large an advance payment&mdash;amounting to some $2.2 million&mdash;entails an unacceptable risk for a contract of that size, when the principals and their financial credentials are unknown. I am informed that it reflected a judgment by the DEETYA officers concerned that the payment would both assist in securing the employment outcomes and assist the company in launching its proposed prospectus. I note for the information of senators that, to date, no prospectus has been issued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make my position on that point very clear: I do not believe that it is the role of government training programs to be making a payment to a company in order to improve the appearance of a potential prospectus. Advance payments are permitted under the program guidelines, but are intended to be applied more restrictively than was the case on this occasion. The department is revising the guidelines of this program to prevent future advance payments of this size being made, unless the financial risk has been appropriately assessed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No financial checks were made at this time regarding South Pacific Cruise Lines&mdash;a company which had been in existence only since December 1996&mdash;or of its principals. This is clearly inexcusable, not to mention being inconsistent with the relevant guidelines. I understand, however, that the officers concerned relied heavily on the security afforded by the involvement of William Angliss, which is well known to the department, in forming their judgments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The officers involved were also conscious of the Queensland government's clear support for the establishment of a cruise ship industry to be based in that state and the potential benefits of securing employment for potential trainees. Nonetheless, the officers concerned agree that they should have been more rigorous in the application of the guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The department reviewed the arrangements in light of adverse media reports around mid&hyphen;June. This included some financial checks to confirm that the moneys advanced under the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6446"> contract were being expended in accordance with the contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conclusion at that time was that there was no breach by SPCL that would justify termination of the contract&mdash;and, indeed, there has been no breach to date&mdash;and that termination on other grounds would lead to possible claims for damages by the company and certain damage to the employment prospects of a large number of unemployed people. Indeed, the trainees had been selected and training was commencing on 23 June; and William Angliss had given the department an assurance that it would assist with the placement of trainees not offered a place by South Pacific Cruise Lines at the conclusion of the training. Nevertheless, it was decided to monitor the performance of the contract closely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was around this time that the matter was raised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>. As a result, my office made inquiries of the department's Queensland central area office and on 12 June received a brief report from, and prepared in, that office concerning the arrangements. My office soon after requested a further brief from the national office. Some information was provided informally and as material for question time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now have a preliminary report on this matter, and this statement is largely based on the contents of that report. Senators and, indeed, I, have also questioned the average cost per trainee. I understand from the investigations which have been undertaken to date by the department that there are substantial gaps in the documentary record regarding the progress of negotiations and the justification for the unit price finally agreed. Because investigations are still proceeding, I am simply unable to answer questions on these aspects as fully as I would like at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The secretary of DEETYA has arranged for an experienced auditor and an experienced investigator to be in Queensland at present to make further inquiries of departmental officers involved, as well as representatives of William Angliss and, as appropriate, South Pacific Cruise Lines. Until those inquiries have been completed there is little more that I can say about that element of the process. It 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is, however, clearly unsatisfactory that the documentary record is so unclear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will report further in light of these inquiries at a time that is mutually convenient. I do, of course, agree that should the estimates committee wish to reconvene we will provide all the relevant information and, in that event, timing of mutual convenience and the availability of sufficient relevant information will be important. I am sure that senators will want to address a number of questions to departmental officers at that stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear that the processes that were followed were simply unacceptable. The secretary will take these matters up further with the relevant officers once the facts have been more fully established. Allegations regarding the alleged fundraising activities of South Pacific Cruise Lines with US based interests&mdash;casinos et al.&mdash;go beyond the specific interests of my portfolio and the investigative capacity of my department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding these remarks let me assure the Senate that my understanding is that, at this point, no Commonwealth funds have been lost, nor has the originally contracted sum been exceeded. There is some further outstanding training required under the contract which is yet to be delivered. In the event that the outstanding training is not delivered&mdash;which is not to suggest that I have formed a view that it will not be; it is just in the event that the outstanding training is not delivered&mdash;the Commonwealth will either make a claim against South Pacific Cruise Lines to recover that portion or seek to withhold the outstanding 20 per cent payment, as appropriate. By all accounts the hospitality training is complete and the remainder is on the way to completion. Back in June, action was taken to strengthen the level of assurance provided to the Commonwealth, notably because of William Angliss's undertaking to assist with the placement of those trainees or any trainees who did not secure employment with SPCL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would repeat: this information is as I am advised at this point. If there is any change that needs to be made I will, of course, advise the Senate. I repeat that I will, in any event, come back when the picture is clearer.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reasons that opposition senators have been questioning the minister on this issue I think have now become very clear indeed. We have a situation where the minister has just reported to the parliament that, in relation to the contracting with South Pacific Cruise Lines, no financial checks were made by the department at the time these arrangements were undertaken. The minister has reinforced our concerns about that by indicating to the Senate that this is a company which had been in existence only since December 1996. Also, the minister has informed the Senate that the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs failed to make any checks in relation to the principals of South Pacific Cruise Lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me quote the words that the minister has used in the chamber this afternoon on this matter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is clearly inexcusable, not to mention being inconsistent with the relevant guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am concerned that the minister would not be providing such a report to the parliament except for the insistence of opposition senators on this particular matter.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="VANSTONE" NAMEID="7E4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That's not true.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the interjection from the minister, who says that is not true. The reason the minister is in here is that she has been forced in here as a result of debate in this chamber yesterday. I find that a most extraordinary comment from you, minister. On reflection, even you might consider your statement to be outlandish in these circumstances. There are significant issues here that will require close parliamentary scrutiny and that will require answers from the minister and from the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the minister's statement, the issue was apparently raised by the minister's office in June. That had not been made clear when the estimates committee dealt with this particular matter on 19 August. The minister's office and the minister became involved as a result of the issue being raised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>. The minister reports to us that her office made inquiries of the department's Queensland central area office and that on 12 June she received a report from, and prepared in, that office concerning these particular matters. I was surprised to hear that because that information has not previously been made available. Certainly, the involvement of the minister and the minister's office was not made clear during the hearings of the Senate estimates committee. I request that the minister provide to the Senate today the report that was made available to her and received on 12 June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that the minister has indicated that she received a further brief from the national office. She has indicated to us that there was some additional information provided informally and as material for question time. I assume `informally' would mean that this is not written material. The minister nods, and I accept that that is the case. I assume the material for question time that she referred to in her statement is likely to have been a question time brief or a possible parliamentary question or the like. The minister indicates that that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as the formal brief, described in the minister's statement as `a further brief from national office', is concerned, that ought to be provided to the Senate and provided today. I would also request that the minister provide the preliminary report on this matter. I do note that the statement that she has made to the Senate has been largely based on the contents of that report. In these circumstances, that ought to be made available to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I canvassed with the minister yesterday was the possible need for the estimates committee to reconvene on this particular matter. I note that the minister has indicated that she would agree to a reconvening of the estimates committee. That is an important acknowledgment on her part.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6448">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue that the minister raised about timing of mutual convenience is important, but I think it is reinforced very much by the fact that she has indicated to the Senate today that the secretary to the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has made arrangements for both, as I understand, an experienced auditor and an experienced investigator, although I am not entirely clear whether they are one and the same person. The minister has just indicated that they are not. So both an auditor and an investigator will be in Queensland making further inquiries with, one assumes, departmental officers as well as others from outside the department about these particular issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does strikes me that, for us to ensure that these matters are properly canvassed at the forum of a Senate estimates committee, it would be sensible that those particular investigations and inquiries were concluded before we undertake that particular process of reconvening the estimates committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do think it is important that we hear from the minister today&mdash;I hope when I sit down&mdash;about what she believes is a likely reporting date in relation to both the auditor and the investigator. I think that is essential information for the Senate to have available as we make some assessments about how this might proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to stress the seriousness of this issue. In the minister's own words, it is clear that the processes that were followed were simply unacceptable. That of course is of great significance not only in this particular case but I think it brings into question a whole range of internal processes in the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs under the stewardship of Senator Vanstone. Those are matters that the opposition intends to progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that any reasonable person, having heard the qualified partial explanation of Senator Vanstone, would have major concerns not only about the issue of the South Pacific Cruise Line's contract with the department for this training but also I think there will be a need for the parliament and the community to be satisfied that arrangements are in place at a departmental level to ensure that this sort of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> circumstance never happens again. Any minister worth his or her salt would be in the business of ensuring that we do not have a repeat of this particular circumstance. We will be interested to hear in the future what the minister plans to do to ensure that there is no repeat of this particular circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many questions that remain unanswered by the minister's statement. The opposition accepts, however, that there are some matters that are better progressed at an estimates committee and accepts the point that was made in the chamber yesterday by Senator Vanstone that, even with the best will in the world, there may be some matters that she was unable to complete a report and investigation on prior to the end of this parliamentary sitting period. I did accept that yesterday and I accept now that that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say this: we have fundamental concerns with what occurred after this had been brought to the attention of the minister's office. We want to know what this minister did, how she did it and what exercise of her ministerial responsibilities occurred after 12 June through to the period of the estimates committee, which was the first opportunity that opposition senators had to take this matter further. I  can assure the minister that we will be progressing those matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have a situation where serious concerns were raised not only in the media but also in the state parliament of Queensland about this issue. At no time were senators informed by the minister as she responded to questions at the estimates committee on 19 August that her office had received a report on this particular matter that had been generated by her office as a result of the press article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has indicated that she has concerns about this. We have very serious concerns about this. We have very serious concerns about not only what occurred at the level of your department, minister, but about what has happened at the level of your office and how you undertook the management of this issue after it came to your attention on 12 June. Those are issues that we intend to progress. I ask at this stage that the material 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6449"> that you referred to that is available be made available to senators. I request of you that that be made available as soon as possible. Obviously, this is close at hand and ought to be provided literally within minutes. I would appreciate you tabling that information in the chamber today as soon as you can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would think it appropriate, Minister, if you indicated to us what the time lines are of the investigations that are being undertaken. I think it is important that we hear from you your intentions in relation to making those reports of the auditor and the investigator available for scrutiny by members of the estimates committee. Obviously, it is essential for us to understand as we look further into this very serious issue in relation to the administration of your portfolio when this material will be made available to those of us who have a close interest in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think, Minister, that there are some very significant issues here in relation to the administration of your department. I hope that you will take these requests seriously. I think that is absolutely essential because of the importance of the matters that have been raised and the nature of some of the comments that you have made in the statement that you have presented to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that you have indicated that you treat these matters with a fair degree of seriousness. I think that those concerns are very much echoed on this side of the chamber. When a minister deals with an issue like this in the terms that you have, indicating that you believe that they are clearly inexcusable, not to mention being inconsistent with relevant guidelines, let me assure you that we want to get to the bottom of it and we want to get to the bottom of what you did about it at the time, and we intend to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, if you could respond in relation to the reports of the auditor and the investigator and the time lines that you are envisaging so that we can work out a mutually agreed time for the reconvening of the estimates committee and if you can indicate to the Senate that you will make those reports that you have referred to in your statement available to the Senate, that would be of some assistance to those who are taking an interest in the matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly I did not mislead the Senate. I think it would be really good for us to take Senator Carr to a retraining school, because he is obviously very confused. When I was talking about a common youth allowance not requiring young people to stay in school, I was dealing with the allegation which is being peddled around the country by a number of Labor members and senators in relation to the under&hyphen;18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you will recall, Madam President, the common youth allowance, except in certain special circumstances, will not be available to under&hyphen;18&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who are not in some form of training or education. The reason for that is that they are three times as likely to be unemployed as people who go on for a further couple of years of education or training and we do not want our young people to become permanently unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that the Labor Party would have had the same view as to the goals that we want for our young people and the

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is disappointing that then Senator Carr, in some part of his question, talks about this furphy that we are requiring young people to stay at school. We are saying that training of any kind is important, whether it is through TAFEs, industry traineeships, school&hyphen;based traineeships, vocational training in the schools or apprenticeships. There are a variety of ways that young people in the 16&hyphen; to 18&hyphen;year&hyphen;old range can acquire the skills that we are trying to encourage.

<ANSWER PAGE="6454" SPEAKER="Parer, Sen Warwick" NAMEID="KI4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Resources and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Ferris for her question. The Native Title Act clearly has not worked. It was one of the great failures of the previous Labor government. Of all people, Mr Pearson knows that. Much of what he said yesterday on radio is nothing but arrant nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Native Title Act being unworkable, compounded by Wik, is not just this government's view. It is the view of all thinking Australians, pastoralists, mining companies and, I might say, Bill Hayden and apparently the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, and shadow minister Stephen Smith.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently I attended the diggers and dealers conference in Kalgoorlie with Senator Crane. Notwithstanding the fall in the gold price, it was clearly pointed out by AMEC, which represents small miners and prospectors, that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the biggest problems by far were Wik and the Native Title Act. However, they pointed out that Mr Beazley and Mr Smith had recently visited the area and had recognised the problem and that they&mdash;the AMEC group&mdash;were confident the Labor Party would support the coalition's 10&hyphen;point plan. Time will tell.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the Alcan proposal, let me say this: the government very much welcomes the agreement regarding the development of the Ely deposit, which is adjacent to Weipa, in Far North Queensland. The government supports the use of voluntary binding agreements relating to native title issues. The current Native Title Act does not provide sufficient flexibility to allow a full range of agreements with native title claimants. The government proposes that amendments to the Native Title Act will greatly increase the capacity for agreements to be made with valid native title claimants to resolve native title issues outside the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does welcome Mr Pearson's support for our proposals regarding native title agreements. The statutory right to negotiate remains essentially for mining development on vacant crown land. The statutory right to negotiate will continue to enable valid native title claimants to negotiate over proposed mining projects on all vacant crown land&mdash;which, I point out, constitutes 36 per cent of Australia. In relation to land covered by pastoral leases, valid native title claimants will be guaranteed the same procedural rights as pastoralists in relation to any proposed mining development on a pastoral lease.</PARA>

The recommendations in its report are just that&mdash;recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review said that it recognised that the government might want to make a positive decision about a new reactor, for the same reasons and in the same way as it does for defence and other national interest issues. It also said that there was no need to make a final decision back in 1993 and it set out a number of conditions which it considered, if satisfied, would make it appropriate for a positive decision to be made on a new reactor after about five years. I note that Senator Schacht released a press statement to that effect in November 1993&mdash;that the government put off 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6461"> its decision for five years as a result of the review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its response to the report, the previous government said that, while it broadly accepted the review's findings, it did not accept them all. The conditions in the report by the review are not essential requirements for a decision by the government, as was recognised by the review itself. Nevertheless, the government has followed up the conditions set out in the review, and the present position is as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the high level waste site, the previous government did not accept that a high level waste site should be established and nor does the present government. Rather, the government has decided on a strategy to clear existing spent fuel holdings and those that will arise in the remaining life of the reactor. This strategy involves the repatriation of the spent fuel to the countries of origin&mdash;namely the United States and the United Kingdom. A decision on management of spent fuel from the new reactor is not needed for another 10 to 15 years, because there will be no spent fuel ready for disposition until then. A decision towards the end of this time and based on the technologies available then would be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to spallation neutron sources, unlike a multi&hyphen;purpose research reactor, a spallation neutron source could provide only a limited capability for bulk radioisotope production and it could not provide for Australia's requirements for neutron beam science or for commercial irradiations. ANSTO has advised that a spallation source and associated facilities would cost more than $600 million. The review that Senator Margetts mentioned said that, if a spallation source were to be chosen, a small reactor would also be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the cyclotron radioisotope production, significant technical problems remain unresolved with proposals to use cyclotrons for the commercial production of technetium. There are no plans to do so anywhere in the world. The United States Department of Energy concluded in 1996 that the utilisation of cyclotrons for the commercial production of technetium&hyphen;99m will be

If ANSTO has a $600 million report in relation to spallation technology, is that publicly available? There are a number of issues that have been mentioned there. If those issues are available in point form or if they have clearly been looked at by the government, is that available to the public?

I refer to concerns raised regarding the impact of wholesale sales tax on different types of retailers, where higher sales tax is paid by independent retailers compared to large chains with distribution arms, like Coles and Woolworths. With grocery chains now controlling 75 per cent of the national grocery market and a prediction by Woolworths managing director that the two major chains would jointly have 70 per cent of the market share by the year 2000, this puts small business below critical survival level.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the Minister for Small Business, Mr Reith, has recently met with representatives of the National Association of Retail Grocers of Australia and representatives of the independent wholesalers. The government is very much aware of their concerns and Mr Reith has asked them for further information. When the industry provides that material, the minister will be in a position to take further decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to appreciate that this is an issue that this government, unlike our predecessors, is prepared to tackle. Indeed, on 13 August the Prime Minister announced that a task force would be established within the government to prepare a framework of options for a reform of the tax system. That is a very important committee. It is just another one of those too hard issues as far as the Labor Party was concerned, but we are fortunate indeed that Senator Brian Gibson will be chairing that committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Gibson, of course, has impeccable credentials because he comes from the real world, and he stands in stark contrast to those on the other side. If you had a royal commission into the union movement, they would be fighting each other and falling all over the place to get into it. But on virtually every other issue they are absolutely stark naked; they do not understand the first principles. We are indeed fortunate that Senator Gibson and, I am sure, a number of his colleagues&mdash;particularly Senator Ferguson, who is an ex officio member of that committee and once again has some very relevant real life experience in the area&mdash;will be able to make a very useful contribution to that committee's work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the principles that will guide the work of the task force is that consideration should be given to a broad based indirect tax to replace some or all of the existing indirect taxes, and in evaluating the options for tax reform an important consideration for the government will be to ensure that Australia's tax system does not disadvantage smaller businesses and is conducive to growth and

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for this very important question. I am aware that the New South Wales Legal Practitioners Admissions Board accepts into its diploma of law course HSC graduates with a TER of 50 and a 60 per cent pass in two&hyphen;unit general English. That is in very marked contrast to the 95&hyphen;plus TER scores that students need to secure themselves a place in a university law course. Completion of the diploma of law through the Legal Practitioners Admissions Board qualifies its graduates to practise as solicitors, to proceed to the bar exam and to therefore practise side by side with university graduates. By all accounts, it is a very rigorous course of study.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see Senator Forshaw nodding&mdash;I do not know if that includes him. Take the Minister for Finance, John Fahey. He is a graduate of the solicitors admissions board, as is, of course, Justice Michael McHugh, who now sits on the bench 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6465"> of the High Court of Australia. He is a product of the former barristers admissions board examinations. Now he holds one of the highest legal offices in the land, and all of this without a degree from a university and without having to say, `I have got a 95 TER score' to get in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These two examples clearly show that a person's ability to excel in their chosen field has very little to do with an artificial supply and demand mechanism such as the TER score. Unfortunately, for those misguided ideologues who believe in the TER as a single measure of assessing one's suitability for a place at university, the success of people such as John Fahey, Justice McHugh and others ought to blow their argument right out of the water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Shadow education minister Mark Latham is one of the misguided. He argues that the TER is a good system that rewards students who work hard. As we all know, he shamefully argues that people who are willing to pay to invest in themselves are the dumb rich. Of course, Mark Latham has to believe in the infallibility of the TER. He has to have faith in those two decimal points as an infallible index of merit&mdash;not to would completely undermine his logic for rationing publicly funded places in universities and for labelling people as `dumb rich'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Would he be prepared to argue in front of the High Court and a judge that you are not worthy of a place in a university law course if you fall below the TER cut&hyphen;off? I think not. Is he prepared to argue that anyone who might want to pay the full cost of a place in a law course and who does not quite make that precious TER is just plain dumb? Why does he keep implying that? Frankly, I do not think it is an argument he could sustain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, Senator Tierney's question serves only to highlight that the TER on its own is not an appropriate mechanism for admission to university, and it certainly highlights that it does not indicate that you are dumb if you do not get the TER that the admissions board requires for you to enter that university course. It clearly underlines that. </PARA>

They must have fainted with shock at the sight of her&mdash;that is the first thing.

This is not just political rhetoric; this is real. It is statistical proof; it is real.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that Senator Newman came up with was something about trips to Fiji and unions fighting for survival and so on. Not once during her answer did she give any evidence at all, other than some anecdotal rubbish about once going to Clyde Cameron College, about how women came off second best under the award system. Why didn't she give any evidence of that? Because she has not got any evidence&mdash;that is why. She does not have any evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say that, if Senator Newman went today to a meeting of women shop stewards similar to the one she went to in Clyde 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6466"> Cameron College, I doubt that she would get out alive, given what the women were saying yesterday. These women are not what that lot on the other side call the union elites. These are not national secretaries. These are not national presidents. These are organisers. These are shop stewards. These are workplace delegates&mdash;people on the ground&mdash;and what they are talking about is that women are now worse off than ever before, not just in the area of industrial relations. We could go through this, but it is a bit of a litany and it might take a lot longer than I have got. We have got cuts to legal aid; we have got cuts to aged care; we have got the outrageous cuts to child care&mdash;absolutely outrageous; and we have got a decrease in women's participation in the labour force&mdash;women are dropping out; they just cannot get jobs. Why are they dropping out? Could it have something to do with cuts to child care? Probably. Could it have something to do with the fact that, when women are going out and attempting to find jobs, most of those jobs are casual? We have got a casualisation of the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to industrial relations, let us come to one of the major features of the new industrial relations legislation and that is the Australian workplace agreements. Everybody here probably knows a bit about the Australian workplace agreements. We know they exist and we know that some people are signing them. We know that some employers are using them.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would have thought a female senator, of all senators, would have been concerned to see that women workers in particular had more choice than before. Under a union dominated award system women came second best.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I really do not know where Senator Newman gets her evidence. We still do not know where she gets her evidence after today's answer to the question because she gave no evidence. It was a bit like her answer yesterday where she could not even bring herself to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6467"> mention the word `sport' once in relation to a question on women in sport. Not once could she find it in her vocabulary or within her resources to refer to sport in answer to a question which quite clearly asked for information about the Prime Minister's women in sport awards. So her record seems to be getting even worse. We got not one piece of what you could, in any sense, regard as evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators that were involved in the inquiry into Workplace Relations Bill would have a much clearer idea of what evidence exists out there in that sense. We heard a considerable amount of evidence, both Australian and international, on the effect of decentralisation of an industrial relations system on women workers and on other disadvantaged groups&mdash;evidence upon evidence. It is internationally recognised that women do not do better under a decentralised system. Yet Senator Newman still feels she can come forward and parrot ideas like: women will have choice and flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know when Liberal women will ever understand&mdash;it does not seem that they will ever understand&mdash;that flexibility without protection means nothing. There is no such thing as free choice in a fully decentralised environment. Choice without those protections will leave women even more disadvantaged. They have no real choice. For Senator Newman to have made that response in relation to a legitimate question about sick leave entitlements and a potential burden on the social security system was utterly ridiculous. It deserves ridicule. It is an ongoing trend, unfortunately, that Senator Newman is continuing with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is similar to her response on the issue of consultation. She says that she is talking to people, but the problem is she is not listening. The women in the trade union movement that would have met with her in Albury-Wodonga at the university, which does not exist anymore, would have said, `Sure, she was here but she did not understand anything we said.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know you are struggling. I know you are having a hard time with this reform agenda. I know it is particularly difficult for some of the women on the back bench.

Yesterday's first speech, as we noticed today in question time, was very interesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know what is going to happen to women in Victoria if that is the view taken towards welfare and women's access to social wage entitlements and their access to other areas of protection which assist many women in areas such as those in which I work. The number of women in the retail industry that are on part&hyphen;pensions or other welfare entitlements would have been disgusted to hear the types of views that were put forward about social wage measures, about women's rights to expect some support in our society.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She is probably doing more important work. I have rarely heard such nonsense as what I have heard in this place in the last few minutes. As I recall, the average incomes of women in our society are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6468"> lower than men and have always been lower than men. They were so under a centralised system and they were so under the decentralised system that the ALP introduced. We have had yet a further revision of policy today because this party opposite is in fact calling for a return to the centralised system of wage fixing. I did know that that was the ALP policy. Wasn't it the ALP that brought in enterprise bargaining in this country? Have they now abandoned that? Are they now calling for a return to centralised wage fixing? Are they demonstrating that they are further out of date than we realised?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women will have better opportunities under a decentralised system because they will be able to take advantage of Australian workplace agreements, and they will be able to negotiate with employers terms and conditions that suit their particular circumstances. They will be given greater freedom to do that for their benefit than they have ever had before. That greater freedom is the advantage of working under this system of industrial relations, as opposed to the previous system. The other important thing is that the new system does have in&hyphen;built safeguards and in&hyphen;built protections. That is what this Labor Party is refusing to acknowledge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am afraid that Senator Hill has not been doing his homework again. He does his best to try to represent Senator Newman, who should be in the chamber. Senator Hill, are you not aware that the United Nations `noted with concern that the legislation on industrial relations providing for the negotiation of individual contracts between employer and employee may have a disproportionately negative impact on women'?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not what the Labor Party is saying, although we have said the same thing; this is from the United Nations. It was very critical of the Australian government report in July. We have heard nothing of that from the minister. She is not game to come into this chamber and talk about this report because it was so critical. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part&hyphen;time and casual workers, of which women formed a disproportionate share, are usually in a weaker position than other workers to negotiate favourable working agreements, in particular with regard to benefits. The reservation to the Convention with regard to paid maternity leave, and Australia's non-notification of ILO Convention 103, remained a concern for women workers with family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If Senator Hill is so determined to speak up in relation to this matter, I wonder whether he will ensure that this government adopts the recommendation made by the United Nations: that is, that an evaluation should be conducted of the Workplace Relations Act 1996 assessing its impact upon women of different age groups with different educational levels and in different occupational groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, will the government be adopting this recommendation? Apparently not. The government should also assess whether the act leads to increased or decreased part-time and casual work and its impact on women workers' benefits and on workers with family responsibilities, particularly the ability of women to obtain child-care leave. A similar evaluation assessment was recommended for Australia's new child-care benefits scheme. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6469"> Minister, you will find out in New York that everybody is rather concerned about this government's record in relation to women. Furthermore, I will express grave reservations and concern about the direction of this government in failing to live up to its obligations. It has signed the convention; it has to meet its obligations, and it is not doing to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I seek leave to table the round table report of the non-government organisations that met with Minister Newman and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) last week. Yesterday the minister said that the women's organisation said that issues are on the agenda, they are being addressed by government and they are getting a good hearing. I claim that the minister has misled the Senate. This document proves to me, on my interpretation at least, that non-government women's organisations are not overwhelmingly happy at all. For example, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of what gets onto the agenda is also a matter of concern. Under the previous government, there was some flexibility in that NGOs could submit their issues of concern, but this government wants to control the agenda.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I invite the minister to take a very close look at the report from the non-government organisations, check her comments to this chamber yesterday and come back into the chamber, apologise for misleading the Senate and set out precisely what her government is going to do to implement the convention on discrimination against women and to start implementing the Beijing platform of action.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just commenting on the same matter, I will introduce my remarks by saying that I was industrial relations minister for Australia between the years 1990 and 1993. The question addressed to Senator Newman today was about the gender gap in wages: the difference between the aggregate rate of wage paid to women in the employed work force compared with that paid to men. Senator Newman ducked that question. She talked about everything else but&mdash;and well she might. I want to take this opportunity just to get some of the facts straight on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of women's wages in the Australian work force is interesting and it is certainly one that the conservative side of politics should not talk about. Up to the election of the Whitlam government in 1972, the difference between women's wages and men's wages in Australia was that women got about 62 per cent of the wage that men got.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the election of the Whitlam government, an equal pay case was taken in the federal Industrial Relations Commission&mdash;the arbitration court, as it then was&mdash;and the then conservative government opposed the concept of equal pay for equal work. That is to say, where women did exactly the same work as men, they opposed the proposition that women should get exactly the same pay as men. The then government fought that case tooth and nail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Whitlam government came to power, the government then supported that case, and it succeeded. We had enshrined in Australian industrial law for the first time that women should get the same wage as men if they do the same work as men, a principle that I thought ought to have been recognised as a basic human right. But the gender gap was about 76 per cent in favour of men when the Whitlam government was elected. When the Whitlam government left office in 1975, the gender gap had closed to about 85 per cent. That was a great reforming government; it brought women's wages closer to men's wages. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6470">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Fraser government came to office, the gender gap widened. Under a conservative government, women started to fall back in terms of the rate of wage they got compared with that of men, and it went back to something like about 70 per cent. When we came to government in 1983, the gap began to close again&mdash;and these are indicative figures, not precisely accurate figures; I can get those accurate figures later, but these are figures that do illustrate the point&mdash;and it closed to something like 93 per cent of the male rate. They are the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is now happening in the work force, under a conservative government again, is that the gender gap is widening&mdash;and it is widening because of the introduction of individual work contracts under the industrial relations law of this nation. I find it absolutely mind blowing that anyone can think that a migrant worker employed by a large company can negotiate her wages with a major employer on an equal basis. I find it absolutely amazing that a shop assistant can be thought of as being able to negotiate her wages with her employer, being a major supermarket chain, on an equal basis; or that a junior worker has the same bargaining clout, acumen and knowledge of all the precedents to enable them to negotiate their wages with a major employer on exactly the same basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as that is the system we now have in play, it is not surprising that, with this inequality of power in the negotiating situation, people are exploited with their wages being pushed down. That is the record of this government. Most of all, women workers are vulnerable to that, and women workers' wages are falling under this government. They are the circumstances, and I just wanted to put them on the record to get the facts right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Newman was wrong in saying that women workers in New Zealand have done better. They have not. The system of individual work contracts was introduced into New Zealand well before it was introduced into Australia. As a consequence, female wages in New Zealand have declined in comparison with the level of male wages in New Zealand. This is because, again, women are vulnerable 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the workplace, they do not have the bargaining clout, and they have been exploited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is about time we got these facts recognised. The government might wish to explain them in other ways. But these are the facts. You cannot hide from them, you cannot run from them and you cannot pretend that they do not exist. The truth is that women workers out there&mdash;and many of their male colleagues know this to be the case because they live it daily, they experience it in the workplace every day&mdash;feel insecure about their employment future. They know that through their wages they are being exploited and they are uncertain about where they are heading. That is the legacy this government is giving women of Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Labor Party members on the other side seem to forget, when talking about union membership and about allowing and opening up employment opportunities for people to negotiate contracts with choices that, as Senator Hill mentioned, they were the ones who initiated enterprise bargaining. Mind you, when Mr Howard mentioned it many years before, you would have thought the earth was about to fall in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that those opposite never talk about some of the bad aspects of compulsory unionism, some of the aspects that have really affected women. I will just remind them about something that politicised me. It occurred when there was a general strike at Monash University where I was working at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The woman who was working, cleaning, in our halls of residence came to me at the end of that strike. She was desperately upset, she was distraught, and I asked her what the matter was. She said, `I hope you didn't see me picketing at 5.00 a.m. in the morning.' I said, No, I didn't happen to see you picketing.' And she said, `I didn't want to picket, I didn't want to strike. But I was rung up and told that, if I didn't picket and if I didn't strike, my kids wouldn't get home from school.' Those opposite forget to tell us that those are the sorts of bullyboy tactics that went on&mdash;and many of the people who were victims of those bullyboy tactics were women.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6471">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that politicised me when I was a young person was my mother being forced to join a union when she did not want to. She came home in tears because she had an employer who was tremendous, an employer who gave her all the flexibility she needed in her employment&mdash;and she was made to join a union against her will. If you want to know what politicised me in my youth, that would have had to have been one of the major things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women, in many cases&mdash;not always, but in many cases&mdash;have been bullied by the union movement into picketing, into striking, when they did not want to. So do not come in here and tell me that everything on the union side is rosy, and that it is all good and proper if you have a central wage fixing system and compulsory unionism. It is not a bed of roses, and it is not a bed of roses for women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can give you example after example; I have just given you two examples. The one that absolutely floored me was the woman in the halls of residence who was terrified that her kids would not get home from school. Whether it was just an idle threat or not, she did not know. You can stand up here and be holy Joes, but the boot is on the other foot in a number of cases with respect to the behaviour of the union movement towards women.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1997 (No. 3)</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997, which is now before the chamber, contains a number of amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1995. I will outline the changes of substance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in schedule two of this bill abolish the Canadian margin of preference on certain petrochemical products of chapter 39 of the customs tariff. These changes took effect from the first of January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concerns have been expressed for some time regarding the overall balance of benefits under the Canada&hyphen;Australia Trade Agreement, CANATA. CANATA provides for the exchange of tariff preferences on a range of products traded between the two countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most significantly, in 1995 Canada proposed the extension to several of its developing country trading partners preferential tariff treatment for raw sugar which would have been equivalent to that enjoyed by Australia under CANATA. Because of the significance of sugar in our overall exports to Canada (accounting for 20 per cent in 1995), such a decision would have had the impact of substantially eroding the overall value of CANATA preferences to Australia and shifting the balance of benefits under the agreement decisively in favour of Canada.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, elements of the Australian manufacturing community have also registered some concern at the benefits accruing to Canadian exporters under CANATA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following consideration of these and other related issues, the trade minister advised the Canadian minister for international trade in 1995 of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia's intention to remove CANATA preferential rates of duty from Canadian imports of certain petrochemical products, specifically polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polyvinyl esters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following a review of the situation by the incoming government and action by Canada to extend preferences on raw sugar, the minister for trade and the minister for industry, science and tourism decided to implement the withdrawal of the preferences on these petrochemical products. Trade in these products is currently at relatively low levels (amounting to only $1.6 million in 1995&hyphen;96). Moreover, the phase in the general rate of duty on the first of July 1996 to 5 per cent  has meant that the possible impact on downstream users will be minimised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule three of this bill accords developing country preferences, under the Australian System of Tariff Preferences, ASTP, to imports from the territories administered by the Palestinian authority. This action was operative from the tenth of march 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable members will be aware of the middle east peace process started in Madrid in October 1991 and the Oslo declaration of principles whereby Israel is transferring to the palestinian council, powers and responsibilities for certain areas formerly administered by the Israeli Military Government. The Australian government fully supports the peace process and the implementation of these agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extension of ASTP concessions to the palestinian territories will assist their economy to transform itself to an exporter of products made in newly established industrial enterprises. It will also enhance bilateral trade with Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule four of this bill will operate from the first of July 1997. It contains amendments which will abolish customs duty on imported sugar and certain sugar by&hyphen;products and implements Australia's tariff obligations under the Information Technology Agreement, ITA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect to the changes of duty on sugar, on the fourth of March this year, my colleague, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Honourable John Anderson MP, announced that the recommendations of the joint industry and government sugar industry review working party had been accepted by the Commonwealth government. These recommendations provide an integral package of reforms designed to promote a sustainable and internationally competitive sugar industry and for the removal of the customs rate of duty of $55 per tonne from sugar and certain sugar by&hyphen;products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendations have also been endorsed by the Queensland government and have the unani 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6479"> mous support of industry leaders on the working party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendations in regard to customs tariff rates of duty are implemented in this schedule.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of the ITA, in Singapore, on the thirteenth of December 1996, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Honourable Tim Fischer MP signed on behalf of Australia the ministerial declaration on trade in  information technology products&mdash;the information technology agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ita represents a package of sectoral liberalisation which, in combination with the agreement on basic telecommunications, establishes the trading framework which will underpin the continuing rapid growth of global information and communications infrastructure. The agreement seeks the elimination of tariffs on technology and telecommunications products by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When negotiations were completed on the twenty&hyphen;sixth of March this year, the ita had forty&hyphen;one member countries including our major APEC trading partners, the European union, other European countries and India. The signatories account for 92 percent of the $750 billion in world trade in these products. Each participant agreed to undertake the necessary domestic procedures to meet their commitments for the ita to come into force on the first of July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the negotiations, australia made clear its requirements for an acceptable and balanced package of liberalisation being achieved and for the participation by a core of our regional trading partners. We ensured that the emerging asian markets participated in the agreement and that their participation was on a similar basis to that of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia stands to gain substantially from the ita. The agreement will provide australian industry with increased export opportunities to help redress the $6.9 billion trade deficit in this sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia could not have secured the market liberisation achieved under the ITA through direct bilateral negotiations. Working through APEC and the WTO allowed Australia, in coalition with other major economies, to bring our key regional trading partners to the ita negotiating table.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule four of this bill also contains amendments to reinstate the intended tariff assistance on surgical drapes and clarify our international tariff obligations in regard to certain types of lamps and power supply units for computers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remainder of the amendments in schedules one and five are of an administrative nature. In the main they close&hyphen;up national seven and eight digit tariff splits which were created in the nineteen eighties to apply different rates of duty to certain textile goods. As the tariff phasing regime means 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the rates of duty will be the same from the first of July 1998, this opportunity has been taken to close&hyphen;up the tariff subheadings, where possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE (SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, this bill introduces a statutory exemption for the Austudy and Abstudy schemes from the operation of the marital status discrimination provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present the Austudy and Abstudy schemes discriminate on the basis of marital status in two key ways. Firstly, there are differences in the way legally married students are treated as compared to students in de facto relationships. Secondly, there are differences in the way legally married students are treated in comparison to single students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of these differences go to the broader issue of the assumptions of dependency that underpin Commonwealth allowances generally. Rates of allowance and the income and assets tests, including those applied to receipt of rent assistance, are based on the assumptions, which also underpin other Commonwealth allowances, that a person with a partner has access to the financial means of their partner to meet their combined costs, and a single person who is independent of parental assistance does not have the opportunity to share costs for accommodation and other living expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to these broader issues, a number of the problems which Austudy and Abstudy has in relation to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 are specific to the schemes. Unlike the social security situation, the recognition of de facto relationships in the Austudy context would generally result in increased eligibility for benefits. In the social security context, beneficiaries actually have a financial disincentive for establishing de facto relationships, as their combined eligibility is reduced as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Austudy, a person who is married is considered to be independent for purposes of the scheme, and is eligible for a higher rate of Austudy than the rate payable to a student who is considered to be dependent. If de facto relationships are treated the same as marriage, that is as a ground for independent status, there would be financial incentives for establishing the existence of a de facto relationship so that the student is eligible for a higher rate of Austudy. This would make it difficult for the scheme administrators to verify the legitimacy of de facto relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Abstudy experiences similar problems under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 in relation to living allowances, income testing and eligibility for rent assistance.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6480">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Austudy and Abstudy schemes, initially, had a legislative exemption from the operation of those provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 proscribing discrimination on the ground of marital status. The Austudy and Abstudy schemes currently have an administrative exemption from the human rights and equal opportunity commission in relation to the marital status provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. The administrative exemption expires on 31 December 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non&hyphen;legislative options for dealing with this issue have been explored, however, these would have serious social or financial repercussions.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This motion obviously expresses concern about the government's mismanagement of an absolutely essential part of our national economy&mdash;that is, federal-state relations. Unfortunately, this issue has attracted media attention for all the wrong reasons. Headlines such as `Howard attacks Kennett on high taxes' and `Kennett talks down federal feud' are appearing in the media with monotonous regularity. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Originally it was my intention to incorporate many of these media references into my comments today, but I ended up having to incorporate them into my notes because what I had would have made a thick pile, and I decided that in the chamber I would probably get lost in the maze. For the media are now highlighting time and time again what appears to be a complete breakdown in federal-state relations at a time when such relations are absolutely crucial, particularly given the High Court's recent decision to prohibit the states from raising revenue through franchise fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has put in place measures to enable the states and territories to retrieve the approximately $5 billion per annum in revenue that they raised through these measures. Let us hope that these measures produce a more stable long-term solution to the problem than might have been expected after we witnessed the absolute shambles of the initial federal response to the problem.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We ask: why has the relationship between the states and the federal government reached such a low point? My contention in moving this motion is that, as with its lack of leadership on the economy, and most particularly jobs and growth, the government, through its arrogance and incompetence, has completely mismanaged federal-state relations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to examine the first two points of the motion together&mdash;that is, the deterioration in Commonwealth-state relations resulting from actions and policy of the Commonwealth government and the worsening relations between the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the state premiers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> contained a title which adequately sums up the frustration and despair of the states&mdash;`States of confusion'. It is fair to say that federal-state relations got off on a fairly rocky road right from the very start. You would think, with all but one of the premiers in the country being Liberal, that relations would have been more smooth. But not for this government. You would have thought that a government whose ideology is to favour states rights and which has an ideology of devolution could do more than just simply devolve costs. That is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6481"> all that has been happening, and that is what the premiers have been complaining about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous Labor government had initiated major federal-state reforms through the COAG process. Reforms were made in areas such as health, disability services, electricity supply, gas supply and competition policy. COAG had been established to resolve the often overlapping and conflicting Commonwealth&hyphen;state roles and responsibilities in the critical areas of service delivery, such as health and aged care. For example, it is estimated that the duplication between the Commonwealth, state and local governments in the health care system is costing taxpayers up to $1.5 billion per year. But it has all been stalled.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These reforms under Labor were conducted cooperatively and for the most part in good spirit, notwithstanding the  occasional tensions which arose and premiers from different parties. But this government has made a hash of its relations with the states from day one. In the first year of office it decided to cut $1.5 billion in revenue to the states over the three years starting from 1996-97. This was the so-called fiscal contribution.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But on top of that fiscal contribution&mdash;whatever your arguments for that may have been&mdash;it undertook a range of funding cuts in a number of sensitive service areas. It announced cuts of $120 million over three years to legal aid, Senator O'Brien. After adjustments, negotiations with the states and public protests&mdash;all listed throughout the media&mdash;the cuts are now closer to $75 million. It also decided to cut $80 million in funding from the state public hospitals system over a four-year period from the 1996-97 budget. Victorian hospitals have certainly suffered from this measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Major roads were not a priority either. The government, in its first budget, decided to trim an additional $622 million off the national highways scheme funding over a four&hyphen;year period. For good measure, on top of all of this, $400 million was cut from nursing home care with the additional introduction of means&hyphen;tested up&hyphen;front entry fees for nursing homes. Anyone listening to Senator Newman would think it was a little fairytale, but we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> know and the public know that this means people our age now will have to sell their family home to get a nursing home bed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Getting back to the original point, how are these measures supposed to facilitate federal&hyphen;state relations? It is not surprising that we are hearing the stories we are. The states had to respond to these federal government initiatives by closing hospitals and hospital beds, cutting access to legal aid and reducing public housing. Not only did the government savagely cut funds to the states in critical areas, but they also stalled on processing major reform agendas which had been initiated under the previous Labor government and would have saved money. They would have saved duplication and they would have allowed some of these sensitive service areas to continue&mdash;such as the dental scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">COAG meetings to proceed these reforms were delayed and are still being delayed. COAG has not met since June of last year. As a result, it is not surprising that the states are confused and concerned. They are asking questions&mdash;questions such as: what is happening to Medicare? They remember that the federal government is supposed to negotiate an agreement with the states by 1 July 1998. But where is the evidence of any progress in such an essential service area? Why are health ministers still unaware, at this close stage, of what level of funding may be available for funding public hospitals in 1998?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After Minister Wooldridge met his state counterparts last month, the New South Wales health minister, Dr Refshauge, was scathing about the talks, the seventh in the last 14 months on the Medicare agreement. It was reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The meeting has been a dismal failure,' he said. `We have been asking what is the amount of money that is going to be put into public hospitals?'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Obviously we have been getting no response. But Dr Refshauge and the other health ministers can take heart. At least now they know that the Medicare agreement will be called the `Australian health care agreement'. We have a title&mdash;after 14 meetings!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a belief by state ministers that COAG has been killed off by the Howard 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6482"> government as a reform vehicle. This has caused concern to the states because COAG is quite clearly the best mechanism to achieve reform. We have learnt that from progress to date. Anyway, what hope is there for the reform process when there are differences between key ministers such as Dr Wooldridge and the Treasurer, Mr Costello? It is problematic. Last November, Dr Wooldridge pointed to the problems for the reform when he said of Mr Costello:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What do you expect when you have a Treasurer who believes that aged care is simply a matter of buying a pair of incontinence pads.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You guys talk about yourselves that way!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Costello certainly has done his best to foster federal&hyphen;state relations. One of Mr Costello's more notable efforts at building federal&hyphen;state relations was an attempt in 1996 to remove, without any prior consultation, the wholesale sales tax exemptions which applied to state governments. In fact, Mr Costello has been so successful at building relations that his purported political ally, coalition Queensland Premier, Mr Borbidge, was quoted in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> article on 12 August 1997 as claiming:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As usual, Mr Costello is not being much help. He can't help himself; it's a personality problem.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Who wants enemies when you have friends like that!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard's lack of leadership in this area has been stunningly obvious. Instead of speaking individually with the premiers, he resorts to attacking them. He attacks the conservative state premiers of Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland in, of all places, coalition party room meetings, accusing them of shunning the national interest. Mr Borbidge took Mr Howard's attack so seriously that he subsequently claimed in parliament that internal party research showed that his government was travelling a lot better than the Howard administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This reference to internal party research had followed an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> where Mr Borbidge's press secretary, Mr Frank Jackson, had written to Laurie Oakes threatening to release highly reputable research if Mr Howard continued to attack the Queensland Premier. We are getting along very well, guys! This 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is at a time when the Howard office is negotiating with the premiers a special summit on tax reform. I would like to be a fly on the wall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard has not been forgotten by South Australia. The Premier of South Australia, Mr John Olsen, demonstrated his dissatisfaction with Mr Howard at a Rotary Club function in Melbourne in April, where he accused the Howard government of `lacking vision in its economic policies' and `working in a policy vacuum'. We know that they have been saying that in respect of other areas, such as industry policy, for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The essence of the deteriorating relationship between the federal government and the states is the unwillingness of the federal government to confront urgent issues that need attention. They react only when a crisis occurs, such as the High Court decision. Given that the High Court decision had the capacity to wipe out 16 per cent of state revenues immediately, it was amazing that there was no contingency plan&mdash;it was, `We were just hanging around waiting for it to happen. We had no idea of what they were going to do about it. We're not really in government. Who knows what leadership really is!' Why, immediately after the decision was handed down, were the federal and state governments frantically scrambling around trying to find a solution to a $5 billion disaster like passengers on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Titanic</EMPHASIS> seeking lifeboats?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Howard government's determination that states and territories fund Commonwealth initiatives is another major problem. Initiatives such as the government's TAFE funding plan are abhorred by the states. Again, the government has managed to enrage conservative state and territory governments with its TAFE measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This time the government, through the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), is guaranteeing that it will maintain the Commonwealth's contribution to TAFE funding, worth $4.5 billion over five years at current real levels, but only if the states fund the growth of up to 500,000 places over five years out of efficiency sav 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6483"> ings. In return, the Commonwealth will not impose any future cuts over a five-year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The efficiency dividend was, according to Minister Kemp, identified in a report by the Australian National Training Authority entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Funding growth in VET places under a new ANTA agreement</EMPHASIS>. However, an inspection of the report reveals that the authority sees the attainment of this efficiency dividend as problematic, like relations between states and the federal government. Additionally, the document goes on to undermine the entire basis of Dr Kemp's proposals to the states by admitting that `a reliable estimate of real efficiency possibilities as opposed to notional possibilities requires access to detailed information on state-territory system budgets that is not available'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response, the Victorian minister for training, Mr Honeywood, claimed that the TAFE funding plan may lead to the dismantling of the system and the introduction of university style fees. Mr Honeywood also claimed that the federal plan was `viewed by the states as a way of forcing them to deliver up to 40 per cent more TAFE places with no extra funds from the Commonwealth'. He questioned whether the aim was to dismantle the TAFE system by squeezing it to produce impossible efficiencies while&mdash;and listen to this&mdash;encouraging private providers to take over training, which may well be the real agenda, and you have a conservative state complaining about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Honeywood has also labelled Dr Kemp as a total centralist who is trying to force the states to sign an agreement which would represent the biggest cost shift since Federation&mdash;devolution of costs. In fact relations between Dr Kemp and Mr Honeywood are so bad that Mr Honeywood has called for the responsibility for the TAFE sector to be taken away from Dr Kemp. Perhaps we should give it to Senator Vanstone&mdash;give her a bit of a boost, a bit of a promotion; it would not hurt her at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The atmosphere of crisis was further exacerbated as late as yesterday when Dr Kemp called on Mr Honeywood to guarantee state funding for the TAFE sector for five years. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> This was explained quite rationally by Mr Honeywood as an impossibility, as the Victorian government was unable to lock in funding for five years when the state budget was prepared annually and could not anticipate demand level for a sector over the time frame proposed. Dr Kemp's sensitive response was this explanation to the state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Failure to provide a stable funding base leaves a cloud of uncertainty over the future of TAFE colleges.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What about all these young unemployed people who are now going to be in the vocational training sector because they cannot get any assistance in any other way? It is obvious that they are going to have problems getting access to training as well because it has been devolved to the states and they do not have the funds. The coalition's announcement this week of 220,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships over the next two years has also brought a scathing response from Mr Honeywood, who claimed that the new apprenticeship scheme was so poorly designed that it might force the government into setting up a HECS scheme for TAFE colleges. Mr Honeywood said that the Victorian government would have to find up to $54 million to fund new TAFE places created by the scheme&mdash;the state government, not the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth announces measures, but the states have to fund them; that seems to be the new style. However, Mr Honeywood was pessimistic about finding the funding. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I won't (find the money). The Premier and our Government have a policy of not filling a financial hole that's been left by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Federal-state relations is one of the most important elements of government in Australia. Under the Howard government this relationship is a shambles. It is a shambles because of the lack of leadership by the Prime Minister and his senior ministers. A new senator from the coalition came in yesterday and she was beaming with praise in relation to her state Premier. But what did we hear about the Prime Minister? Nothing. That is where the leadership is in her mind, at the state level, and we have nothing at the Commonwealth level.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6484">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as the Prime Minister has offered no leadership to the country in a whole range of areas, such as economic policy, jobs and jobs growth&mdash;I have already referred to industry policy, and the promotion and defence of our multicultural community&mdash;he has shown a total lack of leadership in building a positive relationship between the Commonwealth and our states and territories. Ordinary Australian citizens are the ones that lose out again and the ideology is not even met from the coalition. </PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for that contribution, Senator Collins. I know that you did say that, but my point is still valid. If Senator Carr was so concerned about this matter, one would have thought that surely he would have turned up. But the nub of Senator Collins's very wide ranging speech that sort of wandered everywhere was about the budget savings in relation to states and that there was $1&half; billion less for states. Of course you will recall, Senator Collins, the whole reason for that in the budget context of the times was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the $10 billion Beazley black hole that we all faced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are you suggesting, Senator Collins? That perhaps in repairing this budget deficit the states take no role in that at all? Surely the states have other means to raise money. I point to New South Wales, my state. Apart from an absolute windfall the state government is now getting in its finances from the real estate market and the stamp duties that come from that, it is proposing to flog off the $26 billion electricity industry. The New South Wales government, for one, is going to be awash with money and, with the excellent reforms to the Victorian economy, I am sure the Victorian government will be as well. That was the nub of Senator Collins's arguments in the earlier part of the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Jacinta Collins went on to discuss how this government was not getting on particularly well with the states and territories. I feel that is a bit rich on a number of counts. At the Northern Territory election on the weekend we had an absolutely romp home victory, totally devastating the Labor Party in the Northern Territory. It does not seem that the territorians are that concerned about the issue she has raised today. They seem very comfortable not only with their territory government but also with the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point that she raised related to getting a better balance between the state and federal governments in terms of who is doing what and in their relationships. I am amazed that she is showing such concern about the states, given the Labor Party's track record and attitude towards the states in our federation. We only have to go back to that great Labor icon Gough Whitlam to find out Labor's attitude to the states. It wants to abolish them. That keeps coming out time and again in Labor rhetoric. That great centralist Gough Whitlam was saying this 25 years ago, but we have some more recent examples. Bob Hawke, a former Prime Minister and Labor leader, had plenty to say about that in his `20-20 Vision' speech in 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I assert now that Australia would be much better off without the level of state government. All my 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6485"> experience as leader of this country for nearly nine years reinforces without qualification my argument.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Hawke went even further, to advocate the elimination of the states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to see the debate extend to the abolition of one tier of government, the dismantling of the states.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Former Labor Premier Neville Wran leaves no-one in any doubt about his thoughts on the federal system. His words are brief but certainly unmask federal Labor on this issue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State governments . . . we'd be better off without them. </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I now want to focus on some of the specific claims that have been made about state-federal relations. I am going to focus on the claims made in relation to education. Senator Collins raised a number of issues in that area. My colleague Senator Synon will be talking about health issues, Senator Troeth will be talking about family services and Senator Ferris will be talking particularly about Labor's relationship with the states, I suspect some of the minor states. We have an interesting contribution at the end from Senator McGauran.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will focus initially on the ALP's flawed claims about cost shifting arrangements between the state and federal governments in the area of education. This is where I am incredibly surprised, again, that Senator Carr is not here for this debate, having given notice of a motion&mdash;because I know this is one of his pet areas of interest. He keeps making these assertions through various committees and in the chamber at various times. I want to point out that what he has been saying is arrant nonsense, using figures from official figures to show that this is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government schools will receive over the next four years another $2.3 billion. Commonwealth funding per student will increase by about 17 per cent in government schools and by about 14 per cent in non-government schools over these four years in an era of incredibly low inflation. So there will be real gains. Even though, as I mentioned before, there were enormous budget difficulties repairing the Beazley black hole, this government has made a major commitment to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> education and to schools by providing those increased amounts for the public schools and for the private schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a focus in all of that on a number of key areas where we have to repair Labor's neglect over its 13 years. In that money the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr David Kemp, has promised another $160 million for literacy, $156 million for students with special learning difficulties, $54 million for language studies and $187 million over four years to expand vocational education and training in the secondary school system, an area which was greatly neglected by the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take particular issue with the ALP's false assertion that the Howard government is shifting these costs from the Commonwealth to the states. I want to talk, in particular, about another one of Senator Carr's favourite topics&mdash;what a great pity he is not here&mdash;the enrolment benchmark adjustment figure. He does a lot of voodoo economics on that but disguises the reality of what is happening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this country we have a very gradual drift from the public to the private system. Labor has been very alarmist about that and says that, as students shift, a disproportionate shift in funding will follow. That has been disproved by the figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a start, the actual shift in numbers of students is quite small. The figures are out for the first year, and they reveal that the net number of new schools, over the increase in Labor's last year, was seven&mdash;across the whole of Australia. For every state and territory, that is about one new school above what was happening each year under Labor. Big deal! What was the scare campaign all about towards the end of last year? There is not a great deal of shift from the public to the private sector, and it has slowed down. Even the projections we have laid down will probably prove to be too high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, under this enrolment benchmark adjustment, when students do shift from the public to the private system, only half the $3,400 in funding for that student follows them to the private schools. The private schools might claim that that is a bit unfair. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6486"> Why should they not get all $3,400? They get $1,700, and $1,700 stays with the state system, even though the state system does not have the student any more. This is one of the reasons that states like New South Wales are screaming about this one&mdash;what they used to do was pocket the money. They used to put it back into consolidated revenue. They used to put the lot back&mdash;all $3,400. Under this arrangement they can probably still pocket the $1,700&mdash;which, as I mentioned, they keep even though the pupil has gone&mdash;but what we would certainly encourage them to do is to spend it on pupils in the schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area in education that I want to briefly focus on relates to the Australian National Training Authority and what we are doing in that area. Again, the minister has made a very generous offer to the states. He has promised that the Commonwealth will maintain funding at the 1998 level for the following five years&mdash;this is a federal government offer for vocational education and training of $4.5 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this government we have a major focus on vocational education and training. If you look at the record of the last Labor government, over 13 years you had a situation where, under the so&hyphen;called Working Nation program, which was directed at the long&hyphen;term unemployed, 70 per cent of those people never got a job, and so they wasted an enormous amount of money on training that led nowhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are going to be doing is focusing on training that will lead to jobs, particularly for youth. The level of youth unemployment when Labor left office was 34 per cent, and we have that legacy to contend with. That is why the minister has created the new apprenticeship system and has promised to deliver another 200,000 places in that scheme. I had the honour to be at the launch of that scheme last week. It is a new approach which will be more flexible, will be delivered in a way which is more in accord with what employers are doing and will cover a very wide range of areas&mdash;not just traditional trades. It will cover tourism, hospitality, sport, on&hyphen;line services and electronic commerce as well as these other measures.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the education areas&mdash;both schools and apprenticeships&mdash;that I have dealt with, what I have said has proved that the sort of cost shifting claims made by the Labor Party are blatantly false and that this government has a real commitment in those areas to supporting what are the major responsibilities of the states by providing proper funding for those measures. I have dealt with education, and when my colleagues speak they will deal with a number of other areas which will prove what a nonsense this motion is.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking through the clippings and comments that have been made about this government by state and territory governments, the only state and territory leaders I can find who have a kind word for this government or this Prime Minister are those who are either involved in or about to be involved in an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6487"> election campaign&mdash;and only when they are in receipt of some pork&hyphen;barrelling promise or poll&hyphen;driven development decision or go&hyphen;ahead promise. Is it surprising that we see the Northern Territory government or the South Australian government smiling and saying, `Thank you for the promise of some federal money just before our election campaigns'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that context they are hardly likely to say that the Darwin to Alice Springs railway promise is the sort of pie in the sky promise which, frankly, it seems to be. That is not just me talking. The Western Australian government representative on transport has the same view, talking about a pie in the sky promise which is basically for an election campaign. We cannot take that seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we have had numerous examples of conflict between this government and the states on issues not just of funding but also of social policy, the role of the states and the involvement of the Commonwealth in preventing the states from exercising their proper roles. Let us look at the recent heroin trials issue. All state and territory health ministers had agreed to a process, and that agreement involved the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). The process was not only agreed; it was agreed after a lengthy discussion period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation was that, after the government's own minister had agreed to this, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) decided that he was going to roll it in cabinet. Was he criticised for this? Of course he was. He was criticised by Mr Kennett and he was criticised by Kate Carnell here in the ACT. He acted after an agreement was reached. What a way to deal with state and territory governments: to sit down with them, to negotiate with them over many months, to agree with a process, through your health minister, and then to roll them, to say, `I have got a way of undermining this. We did agree but I am going to change it. After we have agreed, I am going to roll this agreement. I am going to use an ability I have to effectively block this, even though I have agreed with it.' What a way to deal with the relations between the states and territories and the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many will say in relation to the euthanasia debate that this was a private member's bill, but I do not think there can be any doubt that the Northern Territory government blamed the Howard government and the Prime Minister for an attitude that its legislation could be overridden. There is no doubt that that is the view; that is the publicly expressed view of Mr Stone, the Chief Minister. There was also comment on that issue in relation to the federal government's position from Mr Kennett. Again, the states and territories that I have mentioned considered that their rights were being overridden by this government&mdash;a government that professed to support states rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had an attack on the legal aid funding system by this government, effectively saying to the states, `We are going to withdraw from the arrangement that has been in place for many years. We are going to set up a new arrangement, and we are not really interested in what you have to say.' I was interested to see the comments made by Mr Foss, the Western Australian Attorney&hyphen;General, in relation to what he described as the attitude of Mr Williams, the Attorney&hyphen;General. He said, in a letter to Mr Williams which was reproduced in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have created a crisis by your unilateral decision . . . I would have thought the duty was on you to fix the mess you have caused.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand you don't like the States criticising your decision and warn that you may retaliate in kind. You apparently don't like the truth, and you seem to forget that you started all of this.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The terminology of that exchange between a state minister of a Liberal government in Western Australia, in fact a state minister from his own state&mdash;Mr Williams represents a Western Australian electorate&mdash;and the coalition government at a Commonwealth level reflects an absolute crisis in the relationship between the two ministers, and that, frankly, depicts the relationship between that federal minister and other state and territory ministers on the issue of legal aid. I frankly say that it depicts the level of relationship between this government and the state and territory governments, which are predominantly governments of the same political persuasion as this federal government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6488">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen attacks on Family Court funding, and there has been a lot of concern in my state, the state of Tasmania, about closure of family courts in breach of undertakings  given before the election. What have we seen there? We have seen a reduction in the level of service to the state of Tasmania which is out of proportion to the level of population serviced, say, in Sydney. No proper consideration has been given to this by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the example with the superannuation surcharge, or tax&mdash;we know it is a tax, not a surcharge. This government was seeking to impose this tax on the states and have them administer it for their employees. The states quite rightly said, `You do not have the capacity to impose that on us.' That is another issue of conflict between the states and the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had many attacks on this federal government by state governments, particularly the South Australian government and the Victorian government, on the issue of car tariffs. Finally, those attacks and the attacks of the Australian Labor Party on this government led to this government's absolute backflip on the issue of car tariffs. They had to run up the white flag and say, `We can't sustain our ideological position on this. We are going to change policy.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You know what our policy is. Premier Kennett's position on this is absolutely clear. He has no time for any position other than the freeze on tariffs that this party is calling for. He is at one with the Labor Party on this issue, as I understand his comments. Frankly, we have not heard from this government anything that gives us any certainty about what might happen. Is this going to be another issue of conflict between 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Commonwealth and not just Victoria but all states which have an interest in the preservation of jobs in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Premier of Tasmania, my state, is in Canberra or about to arrive, I believe, to discuss that very issue. He wants an assurance from this government that the industry will be protected so that hundreds of jobs in the state of Tasmania will be protected&mdash;just as the other premiers want assurances. There is terrible uncertainty over this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> While he is here he will also be talking about the RFA process and the agreement that is under negotiation in Tasmania. Premier Rundle is on the record as saying that the only thing that is preventing the finalisation of the negotiation and nailing down of the regional forest agreement for Tasmania is the money that the Commonwealth must put into the process to make it workable. Premier Rundle has said that the Commonwealth has not come up to the mark, to the expectation, to the promises made to fund the RFA process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not just Premier Rundle who is saying that. He has the support of the industry in Tasmania. I am not talking about the CFMEU, which has the same view, but also all the employer and contractor groups in the industry. They have the same view. What did the Prime Minister say yesterday? He effectively said, `Premier Rundle and all of you industry groups are not being honest; you are not being accurate. We have provided more than enough money for the fulfilling of the RFA process, for the completion of the process.' Frankly, he is the only one who believes that. There is no&hyphen;one in the industry in Tasmania who believes it. There is no&hyphen;one involved in the process who believes it. The Premier of Tasmania does not believe it and he is here to convince the Prime Minister that he is wrong. What sort of relationship can the Prime Minister have with his own political colleagues, the Premier of Tasmania being an example, when he is effectively saying, `You're misleading the public because we are offering all the money you need.' It is not true that this government is coming up to the mark on its promises on the RFA&mdash;just as it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6489"> does not come up to the mark on many other issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there have been issues in relation to Queensland. We had the backflip by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) over drought relief for certain areas in the state of Queensland. And in relation to reviews of areas of Western Australia, I was present when Senator Crane was absolutely astonished by the process followed by Minister Anderson in relation to drought relief. The Western Australian government was equally critical of this government in relation to the withdrawal of the drought relief declaration in certain areas of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From the state of Queensland, the minister for primary industry, Mr Perrett, said he was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . rapidly losing confidence in Mr Anderson's handling of the worsening Queensland drought conditions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He also described Mr Anderson as `callous and foolish'. If that is the sort of terminology that describes a good relationship between state and federal ministers then, frankly, the English language needs a rework. It certainly does not mean that to any reasonable or thinking person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And, while we are on the subject of Queensland, Mr Borbidge has said of the Treasurer, Mr Costello, that he has a personality problem. That depicts a great personal relationship between the Queensland government&mdash;a coalition government&mdash;and this federal coalition government. We have also heard what the New South Wales health minister, Mr Refshauge, thought about Mr Wooldridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also heard descriptions about what Dr Honeywood from the Victorian government said about the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp. As reported in the paper, he `called for his removal from responsibility for TAFE until he agreed to work with the states'. If you have friends like that, you do not need enemies. Dr Honeywood and all the other people that I have mentioned&mdash;ministers in state governments, premiers of state governments, territory ministers, chief ministers&mdash;have expressed views which are extremely deprecatory of this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government and its relationship with the states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government and federal ministers, including the Prime Minister, have made an art form of slagging state premiers and ministers whenever there is an issue on which there is a disagreement. If you go through the media clippings from Premier Kennett in relation to his relationship with the Prime Minister, I think you could fill a couple of volumes. On 27 February this year the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Premier, Mr Jeff Kennett, risked further strained relations with the Federal Government yesterday by dismissing its much&hyphen;vaunted $600 million private health insurance plan as money down the drain.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On 8 March he said, when describing the actions&mdash;or inaction&mdash;of the federal government:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">On 7 March in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>  he is reported this way:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">What a great relationship there is between this government and Premier Kennett.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Little more needs to be said other than that this government has an appalling relationship with the states. Enough has been said, particularly by Senator Jacinta Collins, about the awful cost shifting of this government. If I go to what Senator Tierney said about the basis for cost shifting, being the tired and worn reference to the so&hyphen;called $10 billion budget black hole, I am curious as to why he did not also mention the $3 billion budget black hole of Treasurer Costello, which Treasurer Costello decided to shore up by taking an advance from Telstra&mdash;asking it to borrow the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6490"> money, which in effect is taking an advance from the sale of Telstra because it will reduce the value of Telstra. It must do so because it adds to its debt. By taking that money, instead of the money from Telstra repaying debt, which was the government's promise, the money from Telstra&mdash;or that portion of it&mdash;is going into recurrent expenditure. This is the great Treasurer of principle. Is it any wonder that this government's relationship with the states is so low? The states know that there is no principle that they can rely on behind this government.</PARA></SPEECH>

It is somewhat of a shame that the time we have given and will give to this debate could not have been more usefully spent discussing some of the issues more critical to the hearts and minds of Australians&mdash;perhaps even unemployment.

And so we have a Labor Party being as irrelevant in opposition as they were in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead we are here to discuss what is merely the natural flow of bids and counterbids between the Commonwealth and the states, a process that has been going on for dozens of years.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So you don't want $300 million?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Stone said in response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I would have liked as much as I could've got. You know what it's like in federal&hyphen;state relations, there's always the big bid.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This motion of Senator Carr's, moved by proxy, seeks to drive out of desperation a wedge into the most successful political coalition this country has ever seen. It will not work. The Liberal Party or coalition is in government in every state and territory, other 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> than New South Wales, and it is just a shame that the ALP cannot spend some of its time more usefully developing solid alternative policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator O'Brien talked of Queensland. May I, Madam Acting Deputy President, also talk of Queensland? Senator Carr's motion is simply an example of the pot calling the kettle black. We all know about Premier Wayne Goss's constant chiding of Keating for rarely visiting the state of Queensland. His party's polling showed that Labor voters in its Brisbane heartland were deeply hostile to the then federal government. After Goss's defeat, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Victory</EMPHASIS> by Pamela Williams, Goss brutally assessed the former government's chances of winning in 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Queenslanders are sitting on their verandahs with baseball bats just waiting for Keating to come. They've been sitting there for a long time. But the really chilling thing is they don't care how long they have to wait. They will get him whenever he comes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">May I suggest, Madam Acting Deputy President, that that is an example of severe deterioration?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I would like to turn to the positives, and there are many positive examples of our party working closely together with our state and territory colleagues. One very recent example is, of course, the funding announcement of the Alice Springs to Darwin railway line out of the Federation Fund: $300 million&mdash;a splendid example of territories and governments working together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senator Conroy interjecting</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FQ6">Senator SYNON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Conroy, I would like you to listen to this, please. The federal, state and territory health ministers under Labor met once a year. Under our government, they have met seven times since March 1996, with a further meeting scheduled for November this year. The coalition recognises that dialogue and communication is critical and it is committed to that end. For the first time, the Commonwealth and the states are working together to address the underlying structure of the health system and are cooperating in exploring better ways of delivering services and pooling funds. Indicative of that is the COAG decision of 1996 and the Aus 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6491"> tralian Health Ministers Conference communiques of 1996 and 1997&mdash;and perhaps the ALP members on the opposite side might care to peruse those at some stage. For the first time, the states and the territories have joined together with the Commonwealth in combined integrated health promotion campaigns tackling the critical issues of child immunisation and tobacco usage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In education, there are many issues and initiatives arising out of MCEETYA, the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs. These are just some of them: national benchmarks for numeracy and literacy; a new national review of the goals for schooling in Australia; a national strategy in schooling to prevent paedophilia; collaborative work on education programs for gifted and talented children; early childhood education; guidelines to implement apprenticeships and traineeships whilst in the school system; capital works programs to upgrade existing schools and build new schools; improving the immunisation rate  of Australian children at school; a national approach to the Olympic education schools campaign; and a national teacher recruitment strategy. Clearly, these are not outward manifestations of a severe deterioration in relations between the Commonwealth, states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bids and counterbids that I referred to earlier are not reflective of fundamental relationship difficulties but of our taxation system. We have a taxation system that is driven by vertical fiscal imbalance, a situation stemming from Labor's actions during the Second World War where the income taxing powers were taken from the state governments and, despite challenges, the federal Labor government retained them after the war.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1982, the Liberal Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, in a spirit of conciliation, passed legislation to assist the states in the event that they wished to raise income themselves. This legislation indicated that the Commonwealth would collect tax on behalf of the states, if they wished, and forward the money on to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1989, this legislation, having been passed initially to assist the states, was repealed by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Keating as part of his ongoing war with the states. This mood of cooperation fostered by the Fraser government was lost until the advent of the Howard government last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hawke years were certainly not conducive to positive Commonwealth-state relations. The darling of the Labor left, Joan Kirner, said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> on 27 April 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All the state premiers will be saying we cannot any longer tolerate the situation where we have to provide the services but the Commonwealth constantly cuts back on the money.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Does that sound familiar? I suggest it does. Further, Labor's Wayne Goss, proving that relations were not smooth, even with Hawke, said on 7 May 1992 in an ABC radio interview:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All states and territories want reform of Commonwealth State relations. The truth is the Commonwealth has cut the states back in their grants in the last 10 years. The states have been made to take the cuts while the Commonwealth has not cut its own budget.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I referred earlier to the vertical fiscal imbalance. Until this country has a fully honest partisan debate on taxation, we will face the same issues year after year from coalition and Labor premiers alike. We have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6492"> a dysfunctional taxation system which is the root of these problems&mdash;not personalities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tax reform is necessary so as to prevent the political grandstanding undertaken by premiers of all political persuasions at premiers conferences.

I am equally proud of the Prime Minister, John Howard.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are talking about the level of replies to backbenchers, the level of immediate replies that I have had from ministers is eminently satisfactory. However, I would like to quote a letter that I wrote to the then Minister for Communications and the Arts, Michael Lee, when I was a backbencher. I wrote that letter in November 1994. Some 16 months later, by which time the coalition had attained government, I received a response from Minister Lee. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age </EMPHASIS>was kind enough to calculate that, for the time it had taken the letter to travel from Minister Lee's office in New South Wales to my office in Broadmeadows, Victoria, the rate of progression would have been something like 0.3 of a kilometre per day. I was extremely gratified 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6497"> to receive a response but, nevertheless, would point out what a very long time it took.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact that Senator Carr has proposed this motion today but is not here to debate it simply points out the sort of tunnel vision Senator Carr has and the time warp in which he lives. He is forever fighting the class war and he is forever noting, particularly, I suspect, the state of play in Victoria. As a senator you would suspect that his interests would be far more at the national level and that he would debate federal issues, but this is something that never happens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would, however, like to turn particularly to the area of child care and some other related issues before putting into context this whole debate, which is indeed based on the natural desire of state premiers to stand up for their own bailiwick and the natural desire of a Prime Minister to fight for the federal scene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw to the Senate's attention the booklet called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Labor's child care mess </EMPHASIS>which was put out by us in opposition and which criticised very strongly the way in which a federal minister&mdash;it was Senator Crowley at the time&mdash;had failed to coordinate in any way the relationship between the state and the Commonwealth in the child&hyphen;care system. The booklet, dated December 1994, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a lack of fit between state and Commonwealth systems and the Commonwealth and states have so far not reached an adequate level of coordination. The states provide heavily subsidised preschools which are not integrated into other child&hyphen;care services and yet lead to topping and tailing of other services to fit in. Child care is a key area which has been damaged by the Keating government's confrontational attitude to the states.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  of 23 August 1994 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth and the states and territories must renew discussions and negotiations about the use and purposes of the whole range of children's services, kindergartens and preschools to ensure much more flexible usage and increased resourcing. In addition, the needs of children and their parents must be placed at the centre of these negotiations and the reforms which flow from them. This must replace policies which maintain demarcations and rigidities in service types, demarcations and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rigidities between the responsibilities of the various levels of government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed, from an even more authoritative source than the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> , the Auditor-General's report of 1993-94, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mind the children</EMPHASIS> , said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The needs based planning process carried out cooperatively by the Commonwealth and states in its current form&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">this was in 1994&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is not adequate to provide an accurate assessment of needs or the development of appropriate services to meet those needs.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Law Reform Commission interim report of November 1994 read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear that the present program of coordination between Commonwealth and state child-care systems imperfectly implements the principles of access, equity, affordability and quality.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In contrast, when the coalition attained government we moved immediately to right some of these wrongs. For instance, in the May 1997 budget, the Commonwealth government announced measures to effect the location and rate of growth through a fully integrated planning system for child care. This is something that I continually asked the then minister, Senator Crowley, about in the various estimates committees that I attended, and no adequate answers were forthcoming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the program that we put forward in the May 1997 budget, we announced that there will be a one-off period of two years&mdash;1998 and 1999&mdash;when new private long day care centre based places eligible for Commonwealth child-care assistance will be limited to 7,000 places a year. The reason for doing this was to provide for overall integrated planning measures to be put into place&mdash;unlike the previous government, which allowed untrammelled growth so that services were located in places that did not adequately serve the population.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our measure of May 1997 provides that child-care assistance will be approved only to centres located in identified high need areas. We certainly saw that as a very necessary part of planning. Similarly, we forecast that during the coming years Commonwealth expenditure on child care is expected to grow from what had been a base level of $215 million in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6498"> 1989-90 to approximately $1.3 billion in 2000-2001, with an average real rate of growth of three per cent from the years 1997-98.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, we expect to establish 83,000 new child-care places between 1997-98 and the year 2000-2001. The new child-care places are actually new places, unlike those existing child-care places which were shuffled about by Senator Crowley. That includes 44,000 new private sector places, which allows access for an additional 76,000 children. In addition, 39,000 community long day care, family day care and outside school hour care places will be established over the same period to cater for an additional 60,000 children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, another initiative which was long resisted by the previous government&mdash;that is, to implement quality assurance for family day care&mdash;will be implemented by the present government. We are committed to developing and implementing quality assurance in an appropriate format for family day care and outside school hours care. Indeed, in the May 1997 budget, research funding has recently been provided to the National Family Day Care Council to commence work on the development of a quality assurance system for the family day care centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all of these ways, the present coalition government is working with the states to ensure that child care is put on a proper basis. However, let us put this whole debate in its correct historical perspective. My colleague Senator Synon remarked that trenchant and stringent comments by state premiers have always been a part of the natural interaction between state and federal governments. Indeed, if we go back and look at some of Mr Keating's statements, as recently as November 1995 he, too, put this in its present context. He was busily engaged in stirring up trouble between the federal government and the states by making the sorts of comments he made on 9 November 1995 in a Canberra doorstop. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But to give them a share of income tax?</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean, it's just an insincere ploy that they know has not a snowball's chance in hell of happening from us.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He also had something to say about the design of the casino in New South Wales. The subject of architectural design was always very dear to the previous Prime Minister's heart. He made this statement, which could only be designed to be extremely conciliatory, on 13 July 1994 on the John Laws program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They want to build a building as ugly as sin in Pyrmont which will destroy that whole area over there and basically that's because of the lowest common denominator guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That comment must have been very well received by the New South Wales Premier. All of this is in the historical concept of federal prime ministers talking to state premiers. On that same program on 13 July 1994, Mr Keating, when talking about Robert Webster, who was the then minister, and about the Fahey government, said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we think that the present tariff debate sometimes becomes somewhat acrimonious, we should read what Premier Kirner, as she was then, said on the eve of the 1992 National Labor Party Conference.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I would like to deal particularly with Victoria and the way in which the then Labor government interacted with the then federal Labor government in 1992. Mrs Kirner and Mr Keating had no problem about discussing state governments. I think that, if the Labor Party senators on the other side took the time to go back and look at some of the press excerpts from then, they would see that it was a great pity that both Mrs Kirner and Mr Keating were not able to stick around for the announcement of Commonwealth funds for many projects.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, the only way in which Mr Beazley and Mrs Kirner could get Victoria out of a rut was by a change in government and, fortunately, Victorians chose to do that in the 1992 election.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the Moody's report on the then state of Victoria we can understand why Victorians changed their government. Com

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been usual for some time for the federal government to come each year to the Premiers Conference and seek to reduce state grants as much as possible. The premiers come to try to argue both for more money and for a greater percentage of the pot to go 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to their state. The style is always somewhat gladiatorial. The situation arises from the fact that for historical reasons the states have given away much of their revenue making power. We learnt about a lot of that in school in relation to the powers that changed over during the war, but of course there are other issues historically as well. At the same time, there was never a formula devised to assure the states of a portion of the revenue or to clearly delineate their responsibilities to the people they administer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray noted this morning in the debate on state grants that the states have also given away some of their existing revenue powers&mdash;not just in the deep dark history, but some of their existing revenue powers&mdash;like stamp duties on speculation in the stock market. So it is somewhat ludicrous for them to come and whinge too loudly. They have encouraged speculation and then say, `We haven't got as much money. Give us some more.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also valid reasons why most taxation should be uniform and why taxation that is imposed sub&hyphen;nationally should relate to state, local or regional situations. A petrol tax on urban petrol, to go partially towards addressing the health problems and other problems caused by petrochemical smog and urban traffic, and to go partially towards reducing the cost to rural uses upon which cities depend, would be appropriately administered at a regional or state level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There really is an issue of whether the states, as currently constituted, serve Australia. There is also the issue of why on rational, civil or ethical grounds Australians living in territories should be treated differently from those living in states. Perhaps the state-territory distinction is a colonial holdover that we could well do without. In many respects some of these issues are strongly related to the motion before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has specifically made deals to cut state funding in return for more autonomy and less accountability in how the money is being spent. The direct result of this policy is the sort of thing we see in Victoria&mdash;the boys club at the top playing fast and loose with revenue. In Western Australia 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6501"> we do not&mdash;oh, of course we do not&mdash;have those sorts of problems! Our Premier has quite responsibly invested his money&mdash;excuse me, state's money&mdash;in projects like Global Dance, set up by his father with his father's mate, or the Elle McPherson yachting venture!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that pales into insignificance when you look at proposals to spend half a billion dollars on the Premier's brother's project at Oakagee in Geraldton for a port facility. When the original proponents wanted to go inland, the government said, `No, put it near the coast, will you, Ken. And here's half a billion dollars to help you get there. We'll provide the port facilities. And, by the way, we'll also give you subsidised gas for the whole project and you can sell it off at more expensive prices and put more money in your own pocket.'</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="NEAL" NAMEID="B36">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very generous.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very generous. This is, of course, a very good use of money in a state which has substantial waiting lines in public hospitals, which has overcrowded and under&hyphen;resourced schools, which has a hard time providing adequate housing for the poor people in the state and whose public housing scheme, Key Start, is responsible for hundreds of aspiring home owners going into debt in spite of the lessons of the late 1980s!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the Premier does have discretion on spending, given in return for taking on more responsibility for health and housing without getting a transfer of money to cover that. The deal was that any requirements, such as those this government supported in relation to such things as the housing bill, which required public housing provision to be tied to social and environmental outcomes, were wiped out and the money given untied. So health and housing go begging while money is poured into pet projects like the Northbridge tunnel, with its massive pumping requirements because it was built below the watertable and its heavy social cost in destroying the heart of the few thriving social centres in Perth. We have to wonder how much money is going to go into the government's new pet project of damming the Fitzroy River.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this motion is really about is not a one-sided issue. The Commonwealth wants the economic reins, to be able to make economies by squeezing the states economically and saying that it is in the interest of forcing efficiency on those profligate wastrels. At the same time, it is quite content to eliminate any effective control on what public money it gives. So, if there are wastrels in state government, they can indeed be profligate and the federal government no longer has to take the responsibility. There is no longer a requirement that ties road funding to things like rural highways or black spots. Now it is poured into stupid plans that devastate the central city or simply encourage more road use with no apparent social or economic gain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a unique problem caused by this government. Paul Keating also had his problems with the premiers, but his solution was to cut money and then to promise to give it back only if the states signed competition policy. That is now, ironically, being used against state Auditor-Generals to eliminate accountability at the state level. Paul Keating promised to give them back some&mdash;guaranteed&mdash;as long as they met his competition policy objectives as quickly as he wanted them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is also an issue about local governments, an area which is so often left out of the debate on funding and tiers of government. Local government tends to get routed&mdash;I was going to use a ruder word&mdash;by state governments, who simply ignore local wishes when they want to build a road or facilitate the construction of a hotel or office block or help a mate from the big end of town. It also gets the raw prawn from federal government, who refuses to recognise its existence and who, in organising competition policy, has harmed local government more than any other level of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a central issue. This is the issue of the tiers of government, areas of responsibility, accountability and the ability to obtain a secure revenue base. It should not be the case that the states are given responsibility and then have their funding reduced&mdash;in part because the federal government decides to generously lower taxes! Likewise, it should 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6502"> not be the case that states lower their own revenue through creating tax stamp duty reductions for stock speculation and then come pleading poverty to the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The states, or whatever intermediate tier of government may be appropriate, should have clear responsibilities and there should be some standard and accountability in meeting those responsibilities. They should also be guaranteed a portion of revenue on an equitable basis with other states that is adequate to meet their responsibilities. For some states that will cost more per capita. That is just the way it is, and the responsibilities still need to be met. Avenues for state governments to raise revenue should be clear and the minimum portions of expenditures to be raised in such a way should also be clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Likewise, local governments should have constitutional recognition and a clear definition of powers, responsibilities and avenues for revenue. They should get a clear portion of the Commonwealth revenue base either directly or through the states. It is ridiculous that it has become almost impossible for the Commonwealth government to communicate directly with local governments. They should also be held accountable for the proper fulfilment of their responsibilities to certain standards through the use of this funding. It is not necessarily the case that the Commonwealth is the organisation that should hold the responsibility for the oversight or setting of standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have suggested that, in many respects, it is the collection of members of the same level of government that can most effectively set standards. For example, local government knows more about waste management than federal government. I think that if you had a congress of representatives of local government bodies, you would see far more effective and innovative standards for national waste disposal problems than through any top&hyphen;down process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The resolution of powers, duties and responsibilities of the various tiers of government is a major issue in Australia. It is something that, ultimately, should be decided directly and democratically&mdash;from the bottom 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> up. It is one of those issues that is crying out for wider community facilitation of the debate and it should be part of the entire debate in relation to the proposal for constitutional change in relation to the republic. There is no point in constitutional change of a minimalist nature without looking at the appropriate levels of government for such things as revenue raising and responsibilities, as well as the wider issues that the community wants looked at now within any debate on constitutional change.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, `woof' is quite correct because I join this debate this afternoon and it is interesting that, in so doing, I note that none of the people opposite have referred to the motion that is before the chair, and I think that that is fairly important. I am not going to go through the whole motion but, specifically, it refers to:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the severe deterioration in the relationship between the Howard Government and the States resulting from actions and policies of the Howard Government;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That has failed to be addressed by those opposite. What they have concentrated on, unfortunately, is history past&mdash;history gone&mdash;which bears no relevance to the debate that is before the chair this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst there were comments made about the fact that politicians, politics in general and political debate may be robust, and that politicians will grandstand from time to time, this debate was portrayed by one of the earlier speakers as having `friction around the edges'. That will be shown to be clearly not the case as I go through the material that I brought to the chamber this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am going to look specifically at the relevance of this debate to the state of Queensland. There is no doubt that, on the material which I have before me, we are not looking at something that is just `friction around the edges'; we are not looking at just `robust political debate' or `robust politics'; and we are not looking at `grandstanding'. We are, in effect, looking at outright war&mdash;outright war between the federal government 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6503"> and, in the case that I will refer to, the Queensland government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleagues spoke of the deteriorating relationships between the federal government and other states. But why is there such a war out there? Undoubtedly, in my view, it is a self&hyphen;serving war for both parties&mdash;the federal government and the state governments&mdash;and particularly with my state of Queensland where we have a minority government. So we have a real foundation for them to be at odds with the federal government. They are not just at odds with the federal government, but they are in open conflict with it because, from a minority government position, they want to adopt positions which make them look tough, seem tough and appear to be the answer to all people's hopes and prayers. Of course, that is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have within that framework a premier who is trying to gather a profile. The common factors between the federal government and the Queensland state government&mdash;and there are a number of them&mdash;are that, in both cases, they lack ability, foresight, policy and leadership. Those are the things that are common and, because they are common to both of them, one sees the ultimate happen, and that is an outbreak of war between them. When you look at a Queensland government that has not won an election and which fell over the line in a freak by&hyphen;election supported by an Independent, then you can understand why they are out there trying to prove themselves. They are posturing to show that they are tough and they want to appear, at least to the public, as though they have some sort of teeth and some sort of bite so that they are an electoral prospect in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But how did all this come about? It is worthwhile looking at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> of Monday, 4 March 1996. That is only a couple of days after the federal election which was held. There is a report in that paper about comments that Mr Borbidge made. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Borbidge said yesterday that Saturday's election result heralded a new era of co&hyphen;operation between the National Party&hyphen;dominated Queensland coalition and the Liberal&hyphen;led federal coalition.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On a cursory glance by a Queensland reader, they could think that peace had broken out, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that we were going down the path of some form of love&hyphen;in or that there was going to be a holding of hands between the federal government and the state government in Queensland. One should not be fooled by that because exactly 12 months later, in a headline in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  of Tuesday, 4 March 1997, we have gone from being in a `new era of cooperation' to `Strident Borbidge may well have an election in mind.' And what does that article say? It sums up how the relationship had deteriorated in that period of 12 months. I quote from the article, because I think it is absolutely essential to this debate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Something happened to Rob Borbidge over the summer holidays.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What could have happened? Anything. Who knows? The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">After taking stock of his electoral prospects with the passing of the first anniversary of Queensland's Coalition Government, the normally mild&hyphen;mannered, middle&hyphen;of&hyphen;the&hyphen;road Premier started to talk tough.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Borbidge has accepted advice from the National Party that the sort of right&hyphen;wing, Canberra&hyphen;bashing demagogy that is increasingly marking his utterances is the stuff that successful Queensland leaders are made of.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the gauntlet was thrown down. We went from a love&hyphen;in and an era of cooperation to the start of an era of confrontation. People must ask themselves why. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet Borbidge has taken a big leaf from the former Premier's book.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What could be more of a disaster than to take a leaf out of the former National Party Premier Sir Joh Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen's book? It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So once again the rest of Australia looks on askance as a Queensland Premier struts the national stage muttering dark warnings about the evils of Canberra decision&hyphen;makers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We went from a situation where there was supposed to be an era of new cooperation to an era of confrontation. And this was a bit more than robust political debate or robust politics or friction around the edges and a lot more than grandstanding. It was purely and simply a means for the government in Queensland to try to make its presence felt.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6504">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And what did we see in retaliation? We saw nothing more than the reaction of the federal government. As people know, to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. What we saw emerging was war in terms of politics in the state of Queensland. This was a stark contrast with 12 months previously. The battlelines had obviously been drawn. They were determined to fight in the ditches. It was tantamount to trench warfare. And the old maxim, `Take no prisoners', was to apply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moving on, we see how this deteriorating relationship was manifest once again in the media. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> of 2 May this year, Wallace Brown, a respected Queensland journalist wrote in his column:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be a good idea if most major participants in the Howard&hyphen;Borbidge&hyphen;Coalition&hyphen;Wik&hyphen;Hanson&hyphen;Aborigines&hyphen;pastoralists&hyphen;and&hyphen;Right&hyphen;wing crazies maelstrom calmed down.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They did not leave anyone out, and there was no doubt that the right&hyphen;wing crazies maelstrom calmed down. Here we have Wallace Brown calling for calm in what was, apparently, war not peace breaking out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That article goes on to pose the inevitable question. There were several questions and I am not going to go through them all here this evening, but the first question Wallace Brown asked was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is Premier Borbidge so desperate for survival in his own constituency that he and Queensland National Party director Ken Crooke have to threaten there will be some sort of a re&hyphen;run of the ridiculous Coalition&hyphen;splitting Joh&hyphen;for&hyphen;PM campaign of 1987, the bushfire that was going to sweep across the nation?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There we have a very simple example of how we were no longer at peace in Queensland. And there was the expected retaliation from the federal government as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And it did not end there. We go to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> of 24 March. The headline there was, `High stakes in tilting at Canberra.' I do not think we are talking about Don Quixote here; we are talking about the Premier of Queensland. It is interesting to look at this article, because it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Borbidge said his government could have got a better deal from Paul Keating than it had from John Howard and Peter Costello. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What an admission. No wonder war has broken out between the two governments. Without any doubt, he could have got a better deal from the Keating government. And Mr Borbidge by this time was coming to his senses. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Borbidge says the Federal Government's cuts to specific&hyphen;purpose grants are unacceptable and he will wage a public campaign to overturn them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Maybe one could interpret that as posturing or say that it is friction around the edges. But it does nothing but get worse. The tilting at the windmill was not about a better deal for Queensland but about the posturing of a government and a premier desperate to save themselves. What we have is a deteriorating set of relations between the state government in Queensland and the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as I said, it gets worse, because we go to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS> of Tuesday, 12 August. The headline on that day was, `Borbidge blast for Costello over tax.' I do not know what the blast was. I do not know whether it was a bazooka, a hand grenade or what, but it was a blast. The impact of that headline was that the blast was not something that was frivolous or just a little bit of robust political debate. In the article one reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Premier Rob Borbidge launched an extraordinary attack on federal Treasurer Peter Costello yesterday claiming he had a "personality problem".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to quote Mr Borbidge as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"As usual, Mr Costello is not being much help . . . He can't help himself . . . it's a personality problem.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Arising out of that, we will take a look at Laurie Oakes's article of 26 August, and this is where the crunches start to come in over 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6505"> that particular incident. Laurie Oakes says in his article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of the 26th:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Howard phoned Borbidge to tell him the comments were completely unreasonable and shameful . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is not a very loving sort of relationship; that is a relationship that is in tatters. It is a relationship that requires counselling, and I will come to that later. Laurie Oakes goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Borbidge next day pretended to the media that the purpose of Howard's phone call had been to enable the two leaders to sort out personally the difficulties Queensland faced over the tax issue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So it was pretended. That was put out the next day. The article goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Howard was forced&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">a pretty strong word in anyone's language&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to send his media advisers to the parliamentary press gallery to brief journalists on what had really happened&mdash;namely that the Prime Minister had given the Premier a blast.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is certainly not a cuddle in anyone's language. A further article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  on 13 August again refers to the same incident. It is headed, `Howard carpets Premier for tax attack.' This shows how warm and loving a relationship these two people have. Down in the article it really shows how much they talk to each other. It mentions the telephone conversation between the Premier of Queensland and the Prime Minister where the Prime Minister blasted him. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The telephone conversation&mdash;the first time the pair have spoken since the premiers' conference three months ago&mdash;underlines the tense relationship existing between the two leaders.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So no&hyphen;one could in any way interpret that as being a warm, loving relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then the debacle goes on to a letter written by Frank Jackson, who was the Premier's press secretary, I believe. He wrote a letter to Mr Oakes as a result of the article and copied it to Mr Grahame Morris, who is the chief of staff and the main political adviser to the Prime Minister. This prompted Mr Oakes to write another article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 2 September. The letter, remember, went to Mr Oakes. The comment in Mr Oakes's article is as follows:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The letter asserts that my criticisms of Borbidge&mdash;painting him, according to Jackson, as a "bogeyman"&mdash;were "based on another mischievous and dishonest briefing which we strongly suspect came from th e prime minister's office".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So here we have the Premier's press secretary implying, alleging, that they strongly suspect that the briefing came from the Prime Minister's office. If that is not poison, nothing is. The article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That line, in itself, says heaps about the poisonous relationship that exists between Borbidge and his federal Coalition colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given his view that Howard's staff fed me the anti&hyphen;Borbidge material he complains of, Jackson clearly intended, by copying the letter to Morris, to deliver the threat to Howard himself.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on further in the article to really sum it up:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With friends like Borbidge and Jackson, Howard has no need of enemies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On the same issue there is an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  of the 28th. This is a different view of the world. In an article by Craig Johnstone, the national political editor, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The letter's consequence is a further souring of the relationship between Howard and Borbidge.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unlike Jeff Kennett, who has had his share of run&hyphen;ins with Canberra, Rob Borbidge appears to have little support among business and community leaders for his continued attacks on John Howard.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So this is not an era of cooperation; this is an era of deterioration of the relationship between the federal government and the Queensland government. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither have the Borbidge Government's other tactics, including threats of physical violence, done its portrayal in the media much good.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The next article sums up most of it. It is headed, `"Blackmail" escalates Borbidge, PM tension.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hogg has referred to the substance of Senator Carr's motion here today, in an amazing diatribe plucked from the library. He must have spent hours in the library this afternoon. I suspect the journalists involved will be delighted with the publicity. Senator Carr's motion today is a bit of a mystery to me. He has not even spoken today. He has only just come into the chamber. Where has he been all afternoon while we debated this really important and substantial issue? He has never spoken on this issue before. It is not as if there are rafts of public information or utterances from Senator Carr on this very complex and crucial issue. Despite his motion today the database on Commonwealth&hyphen;state relations still does not have a tag for Senator Carr. I can only conclude that when it came to putting this motion, Senator Carr's bean came out of the barrel. It had nothing to do with his commitment to the issue or the priority that he has given it. He let other members of the sandpit club come in here and have a go instead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is not the only one, of course, who has given a low priority to this issue. After 13 years as a minister, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, can take absolutely no pride in his record as a member of the previous government. They were all totally irrespon 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sible on this most important issue. The former Deputy Prime Minister and one of Senator  Carr's close factional colleagues, Brian Howe, was very revealing when he said, `I think it is entirely right that the Commonwealth should retain the whip hand in these taxation matters.' Let us be realistic; Labor has an absolutely abysmal record in addressing the balance between federal tax revenue and payments to the states. In fact, they spent most of the time when they were in government compounding the problem and fighting amongst themselves, as we all now know, over who was going to take over from Captain Wacky. It had nothing to do with Commonwealth&hyphen;state relations whatsoever.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for that contribution, Senator McGauran. I agree&mdash;trampoline economics. Labor's record on federal&hyphen;state relations provides a stark contrast to the coalition's approach. Quite recently we saw the opposition leader, Kim Beazley&mdash;I am very sorry that Senator Hogg has left the chamber&mdash;turn his face towards Queensland and whistle up Wayne. `Come on down, Wayne; come on down.' Mr Beazley will want to be very careful. He will need to watch that when the office of the Leader of the Opposition is inhabited by Mr Goss from Queensland it does not undergo a conversion to `Wayne's world'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a lot tonight about Queensland. Let us look at what your previous Premier Mr Goss said when he was holding that office and passed a vote of absolute no confidence in Paul Keating's federalism. He was forever complaining that under Labor the federal&hyphen;state relationship was simply not working. In July 1993 he said that Labor operated premiers conferences as a `farce'. As a farce, Senator Conroy. He was one of your team. And he thought that you operated premiers conferences as a `farce'. Why didn't Senator Hogg include the comments of his colleague Premier Goss in his speech tonight? He did not include them because they did not suit the factional argument he was putting together, no doubt with his preselection in mind. What Premier Goss said at the time 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6507"> was: `Mr Keating acts as Mr Keating normally does at premiers conferences', that is, `He does what he likes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Sunshine State was not the only state to have a view about federal&hyphen;state relations under the Hawke and Keating governments. Your New South Wales Treasurer, Mr Egan, has called for a `complete reappraisal of Commonwealth&hyphen;state relations, recognising that the system Labor left us with is simply not working'. Again I quote because I do think these quotes are quite interesting in the sense that they recognise the difficulties. How much more of a damning report card could federal Labor have from these colleagues, these state cohorts? Some still in, some thrown out, but they all said the same: the process was not working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In May 1990, then Prime Minister Hawke made Treasurer Paul Keating the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Commonwealth&hyphen;State Relations. Wow, surely he must have known that he had just promoted the sorcerer's apprentice. Goodness me. What a promotion. Just 18 months later Paul Keating had taken over as king of the castle, and he had taken up permanent residence in the ivory tower. He had no contact with the people of Australia, and especially the premiers of our states. In the meantime, he torpedoed any attempts by the states and their premiers to achieve real reform of Commonwealth&hyphen;state relations. He was interested in a desperate campaign to take possession of the palace. During that time poor old Prime Minister Hawke lost all interest in reform of federalism because he was too busy trying to save his skin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we all know, his successor never faced up to the issue again. He did not need to. He had won&mdash;game, set and match to the sorcerer's apprentice. In contrast, the coalition's record in this area is already taking shape. Senator Conroy, you might be interested in this. The Howard government has forged powerful working relationships with various state premiers and in the process has notched up a series of quite significant achievements. Let us have a look at a couple of them. You might find them interesting.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was the Prime Minister's leadership in the aftermath of the tragic events at Port Arthur where the premiers all cooperated to get rid of some of our more insidious weapons that had been, sadly, available to too many inexperienced people in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was the very public spirit of cooperation during the recent negotiations on the Alice Springs&hyphen;Darwin railway line. I was privileged to be in the audience when the Prime Minister, together with the Northern Territory Chief Minister and the South Australian Premier, John Olsen, were able to hear how that vision, which under you had become a mirage in the desert, was about to become a reality. Let me say that last Saturday, as I stood on the stand at the Royal Adelaide Show, I was delighted to hear from so many railway employees of the relief that they felt that at last a federal government has assumed responsibility for the disastrous situation of the railways. They hope that their children, when they grow up, will ride on the Alice Springs&hyphen;Darwin railway, and I have no doubt that they will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a great spirit of negotiation and cooperation on the development of that proposal, and I have no doubt that, under this government, there will be a railway line from Alice Springs to Darwin for the first time since the empty promises of Andrew Fisher, on your side, in 1910. That's not a bad record&mdash;80 years and empty promises. But we are going to deliver on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at the extensive consultative process undertaken by this government with the states over native title. We are going to see the legislation in this place before the end of the year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have got some more evidence for you, Senator Carr, of this cooperative federalism. Very typical of the can&hyphen;do attitude is the situation that we had in response to the recent High Court judgment on the excise taxes, where we saw our federal Treasurer (Mr Costello) immediately recognise the difficulty, the likely very severe financial problems and the implications for state revenue. He immediately put solutions in place and worked through the problem together with the states. There was not the empty noisy debacle that we became used to from your side in those dreadful days of Labor's neglect on this important issue.</PARA>

That is what we promised Australia, and that is what we are going to deliver.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are tackling the hard issues like tax reform&mdash;another of the issues that your lot opposite were not prepared to take on in 13 years. There was the absolutely disgraceful 1993 Keating scare campaign, which was rapidly followed when you got back into government by an across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board two per cent rise in wholesale sales tax. What a joke! What a cruel deception of those true believers whom you all welcomed on that night in 1993. What a reward they got. And they did not forget it when it came to March last year&mdash;they left you in droves. Even Labor Premier Bob Carr has welcomed the Prime Minister's announcement that we will be moving on tax reform&mdash;but those opposite have not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just like their record on federal&hyphen;state relations, Labor's policy reform is moving at their usual glacial pace. By the sound of it, and I have been dusting the cobwebs off my old archival box as well, I can hear the remnants of the scare campaign coming out again. I can see it now. I heard your leader the other day using some quotes that I was able to find in one of the emperor's old tax pamphlets, one of those scary old pamphlets that Australians are not going to believe any more because, Senator Carr, Australians have woken up. They have woken up to you and they will not fall for Labor lies the next time around. They will not fall for your lies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, that has already been demonstrated in a recent Morgan poll: 57 per cent of Australians are already in favour of tax reform. Can there be a greater example of an opportunity to improve federal&hyphen;state relations than tax reform? Can there be a better example of it? It is the coalition that has got this issue back on the agenda. We are not going to hide in the ditch at the first whiff of grapeshot from your side. We are actually going to stand there and we are going to fight for, as the Prime Minister of the time in 1993 said, `the gentleman in Melbourne who drives a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6509"> tram'. Do you know any of those people, Senator Carr&mdash;the gentlemen who drive trams and those family people who actually fell for your scare campaign in 1993?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite Prime Minister Keating's utterances back in 1985 that tax reform was on the go, he walked away from it and you are going to try to walk away from it now without any policies, without any principles and without any chance for the families of Australia&mdash;none whatsoever. That is policy reform at a glacial pace. Maybe, just like the ACTU, you had better come up with some of those cash rewards and prizes. What was it I saw Jennie George suggesting? A cash reward for union membership of 50c a week off your petrol at the bowser. If ever I saw an incentive, it has to be that one&mdash;50c a week off your petrol at the local bowser if you have a union ticket! I do not think she will be crushed by the hordes going for that one, but we will see. Certainly the statistics do not show it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have put the issue of tax reform back on the agenda. We are going to do it fairly, equitably and, most importantly, honestly. There will be no scary stories from us. Thirteen years in government was not long enough for the now opposition to fix these and the dozens of other problems that we are discussing in this place every single day of the week.

I speak of Dr Dorothy McRae-McMahon, a minister of the Uniting Church in Sydney. She has recently resigned her position in the Uniting Church and is said to be under some threat of losing her ordination. I want to simply put on the record my appreciation of her life, the contribution she has made to the Christian faith and the support she has given to people who live on the edges of life in our cities and in our country&mdash;but particularly in Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dorothy McRae-McMahon was the minister of the Pitt Street Uniting Church, which was never a flash church like some of its other in Sydney. In fact, it was a church that was very run down. Dorothy McRae-McMahon turned it into a refuge for people on the edges of life, particularly in the city of Sydney.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She is a woman of great faith, great courage and deep spirituality. To show her courage, I have to recount to you some of the things she has had to face in the years she was minister of the Pitt Street Uniting Church. She had her church and property fire bombed; she had excreta and graffiti smeared over the front of her church; and she endured scurrilous attacks from the National Action, which is simply a Nazi group in disguise. The material about her that was circulated for years by that group I would not even bring into this chamber and table because it is so scurrilous and so false.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet, through all of that, she continued her work with people on the street in Sydney, people with AIDS and many other people who were at the bottom of the pile. She championed them. She stood against racism. She was a champion of the anti-apartheid movement and was one of its strongest supporters here in Australia. Yet this woman is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6510"> being pilloried by people in her own church and outside it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to place on the record my deep appreciation for the ministry she has offered to me over the years and for the fact that she is someone with incredible perception of the pain of humanity. She was always willing to address that pain and to put her own life at risk, as she did on many occasions. Her courage is something that I could not hope to emulate and something that I can simply admire from a distance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened to Dorothy on a number of occasions, both as a preacher and as a teacher. I want to say that both her preaching and her teaching demonstrate deep faith and a deep spirituality. She does not deserve what is being done to her in a public way by certain people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to enter into that debate, because I believe that is something the church itself must address. But I do want to bear testimony to this woman and publicly support her in the struggle she is going through. Dorothy, you have my support. I hope you will come through this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the last election the coalition was swept to power by the overwhelming vote of a group of people who have come to be known as Howard's battlers. Readers of Pamela Williams's recently published book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Victory</EMPHASIS>  will know that, in the lead-up to the election, the coalition measured its policies against a typical Australian family: a young couple known as Phil and Jenny. In this profile, Phil was 38 and Jenny was 34, they had been married for eight years, they had always voted Labor&mdash;even in 1993&mdash;and they had a six-year-old son Jason, who had just started school. They were battlers; they were battlers on $30,000 a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jenny had three part-time jobs to try to make ends meet, and these are the people&mdash;and there are thousands of them around this nation&mdash;whose enterprise and enthusiasm have been cruelly nobbled by the present 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian taxation system, with all of its absolutely hopeless complexities made all the worse by 13 years of Labor neglect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at how this complicated and quite unfair taxation system affects the lives of the Phils and Jennys of this nation. It would be a very good idea for those opposite in the chamber to pay attention to these experiences because they might find out the reason why these people voted with their feet to sweep to power John Howard's coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Phil heads off in the morning to the warehouse where he works, as I say, at $30,000 a year. His employer might even be one of the companies that pay only 17 per cent of the total tax burden in Australia. He is wearing his tax exempt work clothes. They might look like clothes that you and I might wear, but they are designated as work clothes so there is no tax on them. He drives his 1982 Commodore. He cannot afford a new car, even though he would like to get one so that, with lead-free petrol, he can improve the environment for his son, Jason. His Commodore does the job, but it is well overdue for a service. He cannot afford to get the car serviced. Even if he could afford to get it serviced, he would find himself paying 22 per cent tax on any replacement parts required for the car.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At lunch, Phil's counter meal is tax exempt but the tinny he washes it down with is taxed by excise&mdash;again, a hidden tax. The carton of milk that he has on the way home is tax free, but the packaging is taxed, as are the truck that picked the milk up from the farm and the processing machinery that made sure the milk was hygienic for his family to drink.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is the weekly visit to the supermarket, Senator Faulkner, that would open Phil and Jenny's eyes. If only they understood the hidden web of taxes that has been put on the shelves of every supermarket in this country. Most of the products that they would choose are taxed at one of three tiered levels of wholesale sales tax. Their household detergents are taxed at 22 per cent. Their chocolate, ice-cream, biscuits and potato chips as well as the cordial their son likes to drink are all taxed at 22 per cent.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6511">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sliced bread, cornflakes and dog food are not taxed at all, but the chain store cosmetics that are all Jenny can afford and the personal chemist items that she would like to buy are taxed at 32 per cent, because Labor decided that they were luxuries. In fact, by the time Phil and Jenny get to the checkout with their trolley, the tax man has got his hand in Phil's wallet, even though he cannot feel it and he cannot see it; make no mistake, it is there. Eighty per cent of what is in the shopping trolley goes to the tax man in one form or another in one of these hidden three-tier tax levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Along the road from the supermarket there are people eating lobster and caviar at a restaurant of their choice, and they are not paying any tax at all. They are in the service sector. At the local market on the way home where Phil and Jenny buy their vegetables and fruit, trying to live as healthily on a low budget as they can, they realise with a great deal of resentment that many of the items available there could be part of the cash economy and that, unlike them, these people have the opportunity to minimise the tax they pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, Jenny has part-time jobs. She works in the service sector, where most of the work she and hundreds of others do is on a cash transaction basis&mdash;no tax there. But Phil is not so fortunate, and that is why he does not want to work any overtime. He is a PAYE taxpayer, and at $30,000 per year, if he worked back one night a week, the factory would put him into the top tax bracket. What a joke! Instead of working back to improve the productivity of the company that he works for, he goes home and has a relaxing evening; something that not many of us are able to do.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inconsistencies and anomalies in the current tax system are now absolutely clear and very well known. The tax reform debate will move steadily forward, as Australians like Phil and Jenny know that they and hundreds of others have a real chance of getting a fairer and more equitable tax system which is open to greater scrutiny; and when the tax man puts his hand in their pocket, they will know how much they are going to pay, why the tax is being charged&mdash;and, more importantly, how it will be spent.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6512"><TITLE>Senator Childs: Retirement</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak tonight on the retirement from parliament of Senator Bruce Childs. Bruce has been a political and industrial activist from a very early age. He was apprenticed in photoengraving and then became the clerk of the printing chapel at 17. He led his first strike over a &pound;2 wage increase while still an apprentice at 17, and was reported to the arbitration commission by his employer who sought to invoke penal clauses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At 18 he was elected to the board of management of the Amalgamated Printing Trades Employees Union. At 21 he became vice&hyphen;president of the union and the clerk of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> chapel. At 22 he became an organiser of his union&mdash;a full-time official. At 30 he became the assistant federal secretary of his union. At 31 he became the New South Wales secretary. He was part of the negotiating team that led to the amalgamation of two printing unions that led to the formation of the Printing and Kindred Industries Union. So in 1966 Bruce became, at the age of 32, the Joint State Secretary of the Printing and Kindred Industries Union.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, though he has made a significant and important contribution to the trade union movement, his contribution to the Australian Labor Party has been extraordinary. He has been a party activist since the age of 16. He was a delegate to the famous 1954 annual conference of the New South Wales branch of the ALP and to all conferences since that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For people of my age and generation, it was Bruce's election in 1971 to the position of assistant general secretary of the New South Wales branch that was a real watershed in New South Wales Labor history. I have known Bruce very well since that election&mdash;a tight election, in fact; one that he won by just 19 votes in nearly 1,000. I have known Bruce Childs longer than I have known anyone else in this chamber. We have shared some confidences that neither of us or the Labor Party could afford to have shared by others. For a quarter of a century we have worked closely together. So Bruce's retirement means an enormous amount to me in a personal sense. It is a very big change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I recall his early days in the Labor Party office in Sussex Street. They were pioneering days of power sharing in the Labor Party. They were not easy days. They were particularly difficult days for Bruce. He suffered more than his fair share of slights, of snubs, at that time and more than his fair share of humiliations. He was often isolated. But he came through that, and so did the Labor Party. Our party was better for the experience. I suspect that Bruce himself was better for the experience. We all learnt from those experiences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By 1980 it was time for Bruce to leave the machine, full&hyphen;time machine politics. He was replaced by a loose cannon by the name of Faulkner in Sussex Street. I have always thought, I must say, that, if you serve a 10&hyphen;year sentence in Sussex Street, you deserve a seat in the Senate&mdash;and I am sure that is common ground between Bruce and me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce's parliamentary career has been a distinguished one. He has always treated the parliamentary Labor Party, our caucus, seriously. He has always treated the caucus committees and the caucus processes serious 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6513"> ly. He has been a real contributor in the parliament, and in the committees of the parliament. Senator Ray paid tribute yesterday to his service on the Privileges Committee. I think he said that his was service he did not expect anyone to match in the future. But Bruce has shown that same commitment across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to say on the day of his retirement from the chamber that I am sure there have been disappointments for him in the 16 years that he has spent in the federal parliament. Bruce was very unlucky not to be a minister in a Labor government. But, for all that, he was always there. He was always willing to take up causes on behalf of the people he so ably represented. He was always there during the difficult times and the difficult issues. He was always willing to have a go and he never&mdash;not once&mdash;let the side down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I, obviously also as a member of the Left, also want to acknowledge Bruce's service to the Left of the Labor Party, particularly the parliamentary Labor Party. Bruce has been a convenor of the national Left from the early 1980s until now and a convenor of the parliamentary Left from the time of the election of the Hawke government until now. That has been a very long innings and it has been very important service. It has been important to the faction that we are both members of but very important, more broadly, to the Labor Party. He has been a real unifier both within the Left of the party and within the party itself. I think that is acknowledged well beyond just the Left of the party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce was also the convenor of the Palm Sunday anti-nuclear rallies in the 1980s. He was a leading Labor voice in the peace movement and the anti-nuclear movement. Without his efforts, they would have been very different movements indeed. That again was not an easy task. It took someone with his skills, patience and capacity to undertake that role. It was important for our party and it made a very substantial difference in community attitudes on those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to say to Bruce tonight how much I appreciated his personal support over the years. I really cannot say any more than this: I know that you supported me at times over 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the years when you actually thought that I was wrong&mdash;and you were probably right.</PARA>

It is true for many other members of the parliamentary Labor Party at both the state and federal level.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to say a few words on my own behalf, and on behalf of my colleagues who are not able to contribute to this debate, to wish Bruce well in his retirement from parliamentary life and to acknowledge his contribution to the Senate and to public life. It was interesting listening to the contribution of Senator Faulkner because I, from the other side of the chamber and the other side of politics, share the views pretty much as expressed by Senator Faulkner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately in this business sometimes we get rated by our public profile. A high public profile does not necessarily mean that you are making the greatest contribution; sometimes to the contrary. Senator Childs may not be as well known by the public at large as some others, but we who have worked with Bruce, albeit across the chamber for the last 16 years such as I have, recognise 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6514"> the contribution that he has made. It has been a very important contribution to public life and to the standing of this institution in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sorts of words that come to mind when I think of Bruce Childs as a politician and a man are that he is straight, fair, decent and very committed to his beliefs. I think that that is something that is vitally important in public life. I see him as somebody who really has committed himself to work for the disadvantaged, or at least those who are not as well off. I think that is very important too, because the strong and the wealthy will always be able to look after themselves but there are many others who need a strong voice to look after them. That has always been part of Bruce's contribution. Those beliefs and the strong sense of social justice that they lead to will be identifying marks by which I and my colleagues will remember the contribution of Bruce Childs to public life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce, I think that you have been a bit unlucky too. When I match your talents against those of many others on your side of politics&mdash;some of whom you would have seen achieve loftier office&mdash;I think that you could have done a much better job than many of them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a sad day when we say goodbye to our colleagues whom we have known, in the case of Bruce Childs, for 14 years. I would like to join with both Senator Faulkner and Senator Hill in congratulating Senator Childs on the way he has represented his side of politics in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose when we think of Bruce, we all think of different things. Senator Hill has given his attributes. The word that I would describe Senator Childs with is `fair'. We have been on some committees together where he struggled to get a consensus. In the earlier days of the government, I think the government always had the numbers on the committee. In those days, he could have used the force of numbers to just push his or the government's point of view through. But he did not. He sat there and struggled to get an agreement on all sides. As a new member at that time, I was very impressed with the way Senator Childs handled his responsibilities as chairman of the particular committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After 16 years as a senator, Bruce, I suppose a lot of different things are going through your mind: freedom; `I don't have to cop this'; and `I don't have to come down here every week.' Yet you will miss your colleagues, particularly those on the left of the Labor Party, and you will miss the day-to-day activity of being part of driving a government when you were in government and being part of a vigorous opposition now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have stuck to your beliefs. You are from the left, and you have stuck to the principles of the left. You have stood up for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6515"> the underprivileged and the people who do not have a strong voice. On the more conservative side of the parliament, I know that you have represented those people well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have had a successful career in the union movement, and you have had a successful career in parliament. You can measure success by the friends you leave behind, and I have never heard in this place a bad word against Bruce Childs or any word that would condemn you in any way. So, if you can leave parliament without anyone ever saying anything critical about you, then you have been a success, irrespective of your not having had a position in the ministry. Luck is a fortune in anything. Luck is a fortune in politics. It is a fortune in farming. People say that one inch is the difference between a good farmer and a bad farmer. You were always knocking on the door of ministry, but that was never to come to you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce, I wish you the best when you go out of this place. I wish you a happy retirement. I wish you success. Whether you go into business, into some help organisation or back to assisting the Labor Party, I know that you will be successful because you will give it all you have got as you always have given all you have had in the past 16 years.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6515"><TITLE>Senator Childs: Retirement</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, over the years Bruce has recognised the importance of this institution, as has been said by a number of speakers.

Bruce has also done a stint on the Appropriations and Staffing Committee, an important committee of this Senate which is necessary, I believe, to ensure that this institution maintains its integrity and maintains its important position in a parliamentary democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce has been on a number of other committees, including the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee. I have served on a lot of other committees, but I have served on only some, not all, of those committees. Our paths, therefore, have not crossed a great deal in that particular forum.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of Labor senators who were unable to get on to the speakers list for one reason or another tonight have asked me to pass on their high regards to Bruce and to wish him well in his new form of political work. Senator Chris Evans has had to leave, as has Senator Barney Cooney, who asked me to make this statement on his behalf:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have known Bruce Childs since coming into the Senate in 1985. Over that time he has forever been a man of good grace, true humility, keen intellect and enormous energy. He has done well by this chamber, the state of New South Wales and Australia. He will continue to contribute mightily to this nation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In saying farewell to Senator Childs in terms of his contribution to the parliament, I want to pay a personal tribute to him. I hold him in very high regard personally. I have valued enormously his friendship and his advice to me&mdash;particularly since I came into this chamber but throughout the 1980s, when he and I worked very closely together as co-convenors of the national Left. His strong commitment has impressed me enormously, and on many occasions he has provided me with enormous inspiration. I am sure many others share his 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> values and have equally been inspired by his commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce comes from a long line of Labor socialists who believe that the Labor Party is the most important vehicle for social change in this country. Bruce, like many before him and, I believe, the many who will follow him, has a commitment to the need for substantive social reform, which is being expressed through the Australian Labor Party and through the trade union movement. It is through only the Labor movement that there can be any real attempt to address the inherent inequalities of this society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Faulkner very adequately summed up Bruce's history in the trade union movement and his enormous contribution to it from the age of 17. It is through the Labor Party that I have known him most and through his work in, firstly, New South Wales and later the national Left of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Bruce has always understood the dual nature of the Labor Party and the dual activity that those socialists within it see as an important and fundamental ingredient to making sure the Labor Party works effectively. He understands the policy priorities of a political party are inseparable from the development of a strong organisational base within that party, and to this end Bruce has devoted much of his time and energy to ensure that the Left is effectively represented within the various councils of the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it would seem to many within the Labor Party that, despite what seems to be a gigantic, heroic and all&hyphen;consuming task, Bruce has never lost the broader perspective of political work. He has always understood that there is more to being part of Labor than just winning elections and wielding power for the sake of it. He has always understood, in my experience, the dual nature of the work within the community at large and the importance of ensuring that strong socialist values are being articulated through not just the trade union movement but the broader community groups at large.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce has also understood how important it is to work closely with the peace movement and a range of other progressive community movements and organisations. These are the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6517"> links that he has inspired many others to follow and that he has maintained in his political work throughout the 1980s and 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know Bruce to be a tireless campaigner for disarmament and a vocal opponent of uranium mining and Australia's contribution to the nuclear fuel cycle. But it is not just on peace and disarmament issues; it is on human rights and various other social justice issues rather than just the straight economic issues that some people sometimes see as being the fundamental issues of inequality. Bruce's political work has been based on the firm belief that only by collective action could the resources of the state be channelled effectively to ensure that all people, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, have the opportunity to actually fulfil their full human potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think at various stages in his political career, and probably right now, it has been fashionable for many to argue that it is a market driven economy that is the basis on which we should distribute social goods. Bruce has not accepted that. No matter what pressures were on, no matter how fashionable it was to hold such a notion, he has not succumbed to that view. In fact, some of those views are often fashionable for only a very short time, as we are seeing now. He has maintained a coherent philosophical set of values and he has argued those values whenever it has been necessary. It strikes me that this is a characteristic of Bruce's personal courage and his personal commitment. It is a commitment that I think all senators here tonight would recognise is essentially based on integrity and basic decency in terms of his human relationships. In politics all too often we see examples where there is a lack of integrity. I do not think that case can ever be made out in the dealings that anyone has with Bruce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has always been a person one could turn to for an honest opinion, and I think that applies to just about anybody in the Labor Party. No matter how important they thought they were, Bruce was the sort of person you could rely upon to tell you as it was and to provide advice on the best way of achieving 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a result that actually was consistent with the values that we aspire to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce is often known to be a very gentle and kindly-spoken person. I have seen him in other circumstances, not that he expresses himself necessarily in the same manner that I do from time to time. But I do know that he is greatly moved by the injustices and hypocrisies of the political processes. He has stood up against those forces wherever it counted throughout his political life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I particularly admire most about Bruce is that he has not latched on to the latest trend and fad. He is not the sort of person who is easily won over by cheap popularity. He has the capacity to stand straight and true, no matter what the personal cost is. In politics, including Labor politics, that is all too rare an ingredient across the broad spectrum of opinion. It is very important that we acknowledge this in our public figures, and Bruce is a shining example of those qualities that result from his personal strength and integrity which is founded on a coherent philosophical view of what it is that actually moves society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I find remarkable about Bruce is that he has not been intimidated by the cheap put&hyphen;downs. He is not the sort of person that is persuaded easily to give up the struggle when so many around have over the years. I do not believe that he has been persuaded that it is easy to alleviate social problems by cosmetic changes. While it has been said that he is retiring from this place, there is no way that Bruce will be in any way retiring from the struggle of the Labor movement. His work as the President of the Evatt Foundation will see him move into a new arena of struggle. I look forward to him being able to articulate those visions and those values on behalf of a wide spectrum of Australian opinion, a wide spectrum of opinion that is given far too little airing in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am confident that he will be able to provide enormous benefit to the Labor movement in the period that follows this one. I am sure that his participation will continue to be valued. His experience and his wisdom will be able to be shared with many that come after him. I trust that he will be able to take 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6518"> up that challenge. I sincerely hope that Bruce, in the next stage of his very active life, enjoys perhaps a little more personal peace and perhaps a little more time to develop his own interests. I trust that he will be able to develop a great deal in terms of personal satisfaction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce, I take this opportunity to thank you for all the assistance you have lent me, many of my colleagues and many of the younger members of this Senate who have turned to you for advice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to join with my colleagues to say farewell to a friend and to thank Bruce for his unselfish contribution to politics. Bruce's life at times has been tinged with sadness, but never did he express his sorrow or anguish. At all times he kept his personal sadness to himself. Although I have not necessarily agreed with all of Bruce's views, I must say that on many occasions we shared common interests and common views, particularly in relation to manufacturing in Australia. I have come to respect his very significant contribution to committee work and his dedication to the less well off and to a world at peace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce has served on and participated in many committees of the Senate, but I will refer to only two. He was chair of the Economics Legislation Committee while I was a member. We have served together on the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation for many years. During those times his consultative manner and his genuine desire for soundly based and informed decisions has been invaluable both to me and to the committee process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of his own colleagues referred to him as a decent human being. From my experience in working with him, I would concur with that assessment of his character. Glenn Milne in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> once described him as mild-mannered and cautious. Another reporter from the same paper wrote of him as being gentle and unassertive. Whilst I might question that `lack of assertiveness' 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> description, I know that he has many achievements that are not on the public register. It is these sorts of qualities that I have come to respect and for which I hold Bruce in very high regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although committee work can be very tedious, it is only when one is working with people like Bruce that one is able to identify the most appropriate alternatives and to focus often on the real issues. Senator Childs has always made a habit of fully consulting with his colleagues on committee work. I have found this to be a special skill, and his effectiveness in this area is particularly praiseworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The constitutional role of the Senate as a house of review can only be undertaken when there is a commitment to consultation and also to negotiation. Bruce was at the forefront of the taxation debate during the Hawke government and he presented views on behalf of the left wing of the party. Again, while I might have differed on the direction he proposed, I want to acknowledge his genuine contribution to what was an informed debate. I noticed with interest the paper that he issued to members of the Labor Party in January 1985 that he was prepared to acknowledge, amongst many other issues, that broad consumption taxes do have some merit in that they are relatively difficult to avoid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an activist for peace, he was prepared to distance himself from the party's position on the Gulf War. He also led opposition to nuclear testing in the Pacific by personally organising Australians to protest in French territory in the Pacific. It is this type of commitment to ideals that has been demonstrated in the role that he played in organising a Palm Sunday rally in Sydney as convenor of the Sydney nuclear disarmament coordinating committee. He commented that this kind of peaceful demonstration is really representative of a very healthy democratic process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce will, in his parliamentary retirement, still be very much at the forefront of ideas in leading the think&hyphen;tank called the Evatt Foundation. Tonight, we lose a senator with a social conscience in this parliament. I take this opportunity, Bruce, to wish you every happiness and trust that you will be able to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6519"> indulge more frequently in some of your pastimes of reading, going to the theatre and other activities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise as the most junior of the Labor senators in this place tonight. I say that in the sense that I am the last of the Labor senators to come to this place. I became acquainted with Bruce Childs before he came to this place. Nothing that Senator Faulkner said tonight surprised me because I have known, both through my personal observations and by the observations of many of Bruce's colleagues from the past, of the high regard in which Bruce has been held within the trade union movement, within the ALP and, now&mdash;not surprisingly to me&mdash;within the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce, my short time here has shown me that you, with your experience, your lack of pretension and your unstinting willingness to help a new senator such as me, are an excellent role model for a new senator in terms of the integrity and diligence with which you approach your tasks, both here and, as you have always done, within the ALP, particularly the left of the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It must give you great satisfaction to know that you have come through, from your union involvement, your party involvement and now your involvement in the Senate, as part of the vanguard of a group of people who have pursued the issue of peace. I can recall when the pursuit of peace was not a popular issue; in fact, it was something that was somewhat sneered at, even within the ALP. In the mid&hyphen;1960s it was people such as you, Bruce, who led on the issue of opposition to the Vietnam war. I think that you must get great satisfaction now, to see the acceptance that those issues have in the whole of the community, not just within the party. It must be good to know that, having reached this high point in your life, you can look back and say, `I really have achieved something; I've achieved something that will never be taken away.'</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot recall precisely the first time I met you, but I know it was back in the 1970s, when you were involved in the Vietnam moratorium movement and I was a student at Sydney University. Irrespective of the factional politics within the New South Wales branch at the time, everyone appreciated your leading role in that struggle. Despite the criticisms you&mdash;along with others&mdash;had to bear in the early days in that movement, you were proved right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also recall your days at head office as assistant secretary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You will never get the chance to even contemplate it, Senator Kemp. It is tough. You need heaps of courage 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and perseverance as well as a tough hide and, particularly, patience. Bruce, you have all those qualities, and that is why you were able both to survive whatever was visited upon you at that time and to come on to have a distinguished career here in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested in Senator Carr's comments, because I am not sure whether some of your successors as assistant secretary&mdash;on both sides&mdash;who have come to this building have been able to demonstrate the same degree of patience, although they, equally, have many of those qualities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night, as you know, I was not able to get to the function early on because of another commitment. I will be going to the one in Sydney, but I managed to get to the one last night towards the end. I stood there for a while, and I stepped back. I saw Senator Faulkner, who is a former assistant secretary, Anthony Albanese and Leo McLeay, also both former assistant secretaries, all deep in conversation, discussing their various exploits and achievements in the well&hyphen;known pastime of branch recruiting. It is a great club this group of former branch officials and, if everyone got together from both sides, it would probably be the strongest faction we had in the place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, Bruce, in the short time that I have been in this place&mdash;and, as others have said, in all the years that you have been here&mdash;you certainly have demonstrated the qualities of patience, of perseverance and of sheer hard work on behalf of the party and of the state. People have spoken about your work on committees, and I certainly remember being able to ask you for advice when I first arrived and being able to rely on the advice you gave me in the committees we shared membership of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly want to mention also, as Senator Faulkner did, your service to the trade union movement and the fact that you have continued to pursue the cause of trade union members and of working people generally in this place. On this side we regularly get criticised and attacked for having trade union backgrounds by people on the other side, but you wear that as a badge of pride. So do I, and I know all the others on this side do. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6521"> know that it has given you, as it gives us all, the opportunity to understand more fully the issues that affect the working people of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I came to this parliament I replaced Senator Richardson, who was a resident of Phillip Street as well. So, along with Senator Bourne and you, we have been able to share experiences at Level 12, 70 Phillip Street and, as you know, there has always been a great cooperative attitude amongst the three offices there. I extend the best wishes of the members of my staff and particularly those of my staff member Marion Grace who has worked for people going back to the days of Tony Mulvihill and Les Johnson. I know that you will appreciate the sincerity of those best wishes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a Labor senator you have had to look after duty electorates throughout New South Wales, as we all do. You have been responsible particularly for ALP members in Cook and the Sutherland shire. For quite a few years you were the duty senator for Cook. I know you have a lot of friends and a lot of colleagues in that area who equally would like to be able to speak tonight. Some of them have moved on, like former Senator Arthur Gietzelt and others, but I am sure I speak on their behalf as well in thanking you for the work you did for the party members and for the electorate there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Bruce, to you and to Yola, all the best.

Unfortunately, I had to go away for an hour or so, but you more than anyone else would understand that in this place you cannot always be where you want to be at any particular time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very fortunate when I came into this place some 5&half; years ago to be appointed to an industry, science and technology commit 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tee of which Senator Childs was the chairman. I was fortunate also because on that committee was former Senator Brian Archer, whom many of you will remember. I do not know that anybody could have had a better introduction to the committee system&mdash;how politics can sometimes work with two sides getting together&mdash;than working on a committee with Senator Archer and Senator Childs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me say that right from the very start, when you first come into this place, you think everybody on the other side is the enemy. After you have been here for a while you think they still are, but you have a different view of things. I remember saying to Senator Archer one day, `I don't know whether we ought to be doing this.' He said, `Listen, laddie, don't worry, just sit and listen for a while and you will see how things work out.' In fact, it was a very quick lesson, because I quickly learnt from Senator Childs, the chairman, and Senator Archer, who was his deputy chairman, just how much good can be done by a little bit of cooperative thinking and a bit of cooperative working to try and get a result which they both believed was in the best interests of Australia and of the Senate and what we were all trying to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those early lessons followed on for a long time, because I have continued to work with Senator Childs in the whole 5&half; years I have been in this place. I would not want to give away any secrets, but I do remember that after I had been here for a couple of months a friend of mine at home said, `Do you know any Labor guys?' He did not expect that we would mix very much. I said, `Yes, I do. As a matter of fact, even at this early stage there are a couple of them that I prefer to a few of my own.' I would not want you to repeat that anywhere else, and I would not want to identify anyone on this side. But Senator Childs and I, while we have been away, have been able to have some very good discussions and talk about a wide range of topics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know of many senators on the opposite side of the chamber of whom I can say this, but in all my time here I have never heard on our side a bad word said about Senator Childs. I never heard a bad word said either about his integrity or his trustworthi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6522"> ness, because he was totally trustworthy in everything we ever did. I remember that soon after I became chairman of the committee and Senator Childs was my deputy, we had one new young Labor senator who I found was being particularly difficult in the writing of a report that we would have liked to have been unanimous at the end of the day. I can still remember Bruce saying to me, `Come up into my office and we will see what we can do.' So he and I went up there and he said, `Let's sit down and talk about all the things we agree about first.' So we sat down and talked about all the things we agreed about in 10 chapters, and there was only one chapter where there was any disagreement at all.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EP5">Senator FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it wasn't the conclusions. It was right in the middle, actually. He said, `There is one thing I can't agree with because the government wouldn't agree with me saying those sorts of things.' I said, `That isn't actually what I want,' and he said, `In that case we won't have a problem,' and so we came up with the unanimous report that was approved the next day. That was the way that Bruce Childs worked. He always stood up for exactly what he believed in and he never gave an inch, but he was prepared in the end to come up with a decision which was in the interests of everybody.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Senator Childs, I think what we will miss in this place with your going is the information that you can pass on to newer senators as they come into this place. Your long service in this place means you have an understanding of the institution itself and the procedures and the way things ought to be done. In recent times there has been a large turnover of senators in this place. I have been here for just over five years and there have been 42 new senators in the five years that I have been here, and the sort of knowledge that was in this place for so long and the rapid changeover of senators means that sometimes new senators do things that they would not do if they knew what the procedure really was. I think it takes older senators, and particularly senators like Senator Childs, to pass on that information so that people can 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> actually learn as they are coming through this place the way things ought to be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly remember in the last couple of years, while I was chairman and you were on that committee, Bruce, the difficult times you went through with the illness of your second wife, and the way that I had nothing but admiration for the way you continued with your work.

The thing that struck me about Bruce was his quiet and gentlemanly demeanour, particularly in this chamber, which was in marked contrast to the usual firebrand attitude that we expect to see from Labor's left wing. I notice Senator Carr sitting over there in the front row. He is an exemplary example of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from observing that, as I say, gentlemanly nature, I really did not get to know Bruce all that well until we served together on what was the Senate industry committee. That was a result of an amalgamation in early 1993 of the previous Senate Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, on which I had served, and the industry committee. Ever since that time I have served with Bruce on that committee and its successor the Senate Economics Committee. It did not take long after joining that committee to realise how knowledgeable Bruce was on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> range of matters that came within the bailiwick of that committee's responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He certainly was a member of the left wing of the Labor Party, but in pursuing the work of that committee, without leaving his basic underlying philosophy behind he certainly left party politics behind. He tested evidence that was brought to the attention of that committee in its various inquiries very strongly. He obviously tested it on the basis of his philosophical beliefs, but, as I said, he left party politics behind. The conclusions which Bruce reached in those committees were always based solidly on the evidence that had been put before the committee. He then worked with his quiet persuasion to persuade other members of the committee to similarly accept those conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In doing that, as Senator Ferguson has already mentioned, Bruce always worked very hard to maximise the possibility of achieving unanimity in committee reports. He did that not simply for the sake of achieving unanimity but because it revealed the measure of Bruce's political wisdom&mdash;dare I say perhaps a bit of political cunning&mdash;in that he clearly understood that the way to maximise the chances of having the recommendations of a Senate committee accepted and implemented by a government, whether of our persuasion or of his own, was to have the recommendations and the findings of that committee unanimous. He also recognised, on the other side of the coin, that if there was disagreement among a committee then there was very little likelihood of the committee's recommendations being accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, I did observe on committee trips occasional exceptions to this quiet demeanour and non&hyphen;partisanship. I well remember last year&mdash;I think it was in Brisbane&mdash;during the hearings that the committee was conducting on the proposed industrial relations legislation of this government, when Bruce took leave of the committee for a while and disappeared from the hearings. The hearings were being held in a hotel conference room and, as it happened, I had occasion to leave the conference room to go in search of a telephone to make some calls during the hearings. I wandered out into the street downstairs to see, lo 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6524"> and behold, Bruce there with a megaphone to his mouth, haranguing a crowd of trade unionists for all he was worth. So the quiet demeanour we saw of Bruce in the committees did not always hold true. Nevertheless, Bruce returned a little later to the work of the committee and was certainly subjected to a bit of chiacking for the activities in which he had been involved during his absence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we were on those committee trips interstate, Bruce was good company after hours, over dinner or elsewhere, as Alan has already said, discussing a range of issues and personal matters. So I will certainly miss his contribution to that committee work and the association that I have had with him through the work of what is now the Senate Economics References Committee. I wish him and his new wife a long, interesting and very happy retirement and an enjoyable one together. His successor will certainly have big shoes to fill. He will find it very difficult to fill the shoes that Bruce Childs leaves behind in this chamber.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6524"><TITLE>Senator Childs: Retirement</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to pick up on a point made by Senator Chapman earlier because last year, when I was a new senator, Bruce Childs showed me just how supportive and what a good comrade he is. His guidance in my early days in this place was absolutely critical in my coping with the pressures of the new job. Bruce, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you very sincerely for that support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That support has continued, of course. I have been here for only 18 months, so I do not share the length of association with Bruce that many in this chamber do, but I heard about Bruce Childs many years ago when, as a young union activist working on building sites in Canberra, I and my colleagues knew of Bruce Childs the legend. We knew him as someone who kept in touch with the rank and file of unions through the branch structures and who would let us know what was going on in federal parliament from Labor's point of view. Bruce, I remember our local branch receiving correspondence from you on matters at that time as part of your strategy to keep 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rank and file members of unions informed of what was going on in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to mention that because it shows that, in his capacity as a senator, Bruce has always got part of his mind turned to the working people out there on the ground. Part of his mind is always attuned to the needs of those people, and that is one of the great strengths of Bruce and of his views and of his contribution to this place. If I am able to follow that lead in any way, it will put me in great stead to perform my duties as a senator in the best way possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The practical guidance in this place that I spoke of earlier goes far beyond just being good at what he did. It is Bruce's methodology in making a difference in the broadest political sense that has made him, in my view, a person of such substance. It is one thing to have a strong ideology and to have commitment; it is another thing to be able to put in place a working strategy so as to have those views expressed and fulfilled through the work that you do in your capacity as a senator. Bruce was able to achieve that. We have already heard the references to his work on committees&mdash;in developing committee reports that had strength through unanimous recommendations, and in the depth that Bruce's contribution has added. But ideology without the skills to progress those views is not complete and, Bruce, you complete the full circle in effectiveness. I do learn from you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I want to say about Bruce&mdash;and this is touching on an area where I only know of his past deeds through legend and, as I say, through the anecdotal evidence that I have certainly heard not only over the last few days but also over the last 18 months&mdash;is that I do not think that the depth and substance of his contribution can be fully appreciated unless one has an appreciation of the history of the labour movement in this country. It is those stories and anecdotes that have helped build the character of Bruce Childs in my mind. Whilst we have people like him as part of the Senate, it will always be a stronger and better place. Bruce, in losing you, the whole Australian Senate is losing something extremely significant. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6525"> will all miss you very much, and from me personally: thank you, comrade.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6525"><TITLE>Senator Childs: Retirement</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to associate myself with the comments made tonight in the valedictory for Senator Bruce Childs. I suppose each of us addresses this matter from the way that we have come to know Bruce during our time in the Senate. In my case, it has been on the Privileges Committee over the last four years, and during that time I believe the committee has done a lot of good work for the Senate and I think that has been largely due to the contribution made by Bruce.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I joined that committee as a new senator, and I learnt greatly from Bruce's experience. I think Senator Lundy's description of his methodology is a very good one and one that I would certainly endorse. Sometimes you can advance your cause in this place much more by logic, methodology and force of argument than by bluster, and that is where Bruce has been formidable. I want to pay tribute to the way that he has advanced his views. Where he comes from on the political spectrum is not a place where I find myself, but, nonetheless, I respect the views that he has expressed in this chamber. During the time that I have been here, he has expressed them with conviction and force while, at the same time, being able to understand the other side of the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to pay tribute to Bruce as a person who has served not only his party well but also the Senate well. I think both of those are extremely important attributes for a Senator to have. After all, the party system is an essential part of Australian democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I say: Bruce, thank you for your cooperation, your contribution, your counsel, which I have found to be very substantial, and your wisdom in relation to matters on the Privileges Committee. It has been a pleasure working with you. I learned only today that you were newly married. I congratulate you on that and wish you and your new wife a very happy time in your future life after this place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some sympathy for Bruce. I will not keep the poor bugger any longer than he needs to. You have had to endure a lot here tonight, as, indeed, you have had to endure a lot over the years that you have served the people, the trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party in this place. You have done all of them proud in your contribution, and recognition of that has been made by previous speakers. I will not dwell any further on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will draw attention to the disservice you do us by leaving this place, because you age each and every one of us. As I look around this place at the senators assembled here, there is only one in this place who has served longer than I have after you have gone. While Senator O'Brien talked about himself being a junior senator, next time we assemble he will not be quite so junior because there will be somebody who will have served a shorter time than him. So you are doing us a disservice and ageing us in the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other disservice you are doing me particularly is that by you moving out and getting replaced I will lose my uniqueness of being the only Irish-born senator, or the only Irish-born member of the Australian parliament. Your successor will actually share that honour with me. I suppose that will be a magnificent achievement for the Australian parliament to have two of us; the representation will have increased by 100 per cent. Again, another disservice, but perhaps in an around about sort of way it is a real service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have worked with you for many years&mdash;before I came into this parliament&mdash;as an activist within the trade union movement and within the Labor Party from the distance of Perth and from Western Australia. You assisted enormously with advice in those early days when we were trying to build up the faction, trying to counter some of the things that were happening within our party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The early years were perhaps very difficult because we were not in government, and we certainly did not have the numerical strength within the party to exert a huge influence. However, on reflection&mdash;as one does; as one 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6526"> ages, one reflects&mdash;I think the most difficult years we had were when we were at the pinnacle of our power. This was the period between 1990 and 1993 when you and I had the glorious honour of being conveners for the parliamentary wing of the Labor Party. They were very turbulent years&mdash;in particular, 1991 when the party was tearing itself apart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reflect, too, on my performance in that and on my leadership role. Perhaps there were times when I should have more readily taken your advice, been a bit cooler and had a longer fuse or waited before I put the match to the fuse. You and I did not always agree, not so much on the individuals who were involved in the tussle, but on the methodology during those difficult times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank you for your comradeship during those times. Even though we did not agree on each and every thing, we were still able to discuss things with each other&mdash;as we were able to do with the rest of the comrades and other factions of the parliamentary party at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You played a role much broader than the parliamentary left wing of the party at that time. That should be properly recognised some time in the future. Perhaps if you do get around to writing your memoirs you can correct some of the records that have been kept to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had the pleasure of serving on a couple of committees with you&mdash;none the least of which was the old Industry Committee&mdash;where I learned a tremendous amount from you on how committees should operate and how you should relate to your colleagues on those committees. Colleagues from all sides of the chamber have paid tribute to you on that. I add my thanks to you for your assistance there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it is not so much what happened during the committee work that sticks in my mind. One night the committee was in Adelaide for, I think, one day of hearings and a day of inspections. We had to go and have a meal. We enjoyed our meal and were walking back to the hotel when we witnessed an altercation where some individual had been apprehended by the police. They were trying to put him into a police van.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce said, `Let's just stay here and see that this individual is treated properly. He deserves to be treated properly.' I think there were three, possibly four, police trying to get this one individual into the van. Bruce had a concern for the individual. I think I might have been happier had we kept on walking and gone to the next pub up the road. But he had a concern for the individual, who was clearly outnumbered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the police saw this gathering of individuals&mdash;and there was another senator with us, I think it was Bryant Burns, but I might be wrong&mdash;watching their law enforcement methods, they did not like it very much. They asked us about what we were doing. They actually suggested to us that we ought to move along or we might be invited to enter the van with the individual they were putting in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bruce pulled his card out of his wallet, gave it to him and told him that he was a member of the Australian parliament and just going about his lawful business. The individual did not get bashed up&mdash;at least, he did not get bashed up in front of us. But that little incident stayed with me. The work of Bruce Childs the man is much more than what we have seen in the parliament, much more than what we have seen in his parliamentary committees and much more than what we have seen within the Australian Labor Party or, before that, in the union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are leaving the parliament tonight, but you are not leaving political life; you are not leaving active life. You will be continuing with the Evatt Foundation. Undoubtedly, you will, as you promised last evening, be making contact with each and every one of us, particularly on this side of the parliament. But I hope that you will not forget those who sit on the other side of the parliament or those who sit in the centre of the parliament in aiding and assisting in that work. It will be good for those in government to have an alternative and different view being put to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join with each of the previous speakers to congratulate you on your recent marriage and to wish you and Yola all the best for the future. I trust that you will have a long and happy life together. You certainly deserve a

I would particularly like to thank Senator Faulkner and Senator Carr and others who helped organise such a long time tonight for a discussion about me. It seems quite wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to make sure that I do thank also my staff who are here, and one of them away&mdash;Tanya Plibersek, Miriam Williamson, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Christine Hawkins&mdash;and so many former staffers who have been so important to me. I would also like to make a point of thanking Harry Evans and Anne Lynch, who are not here just at the moment; they have another very important meeting to attend to. But I would particularly like to place on record my long association with, and thanks to, Anne Lynch in working over so many committees on privilege. I have been absolutely impressed with her dedication to that privilege work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should thank all the members of the staff, and I will not try to thank all the different departments of the Senate. But I would just like to mention a couple, apart from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, who are so important and who we probably will be holding up at any moment now. I would like to thank a couple of officers from the industry economics committee's process, and Rob Diamond is sitting here at the moment. I have worked so closely with him, and he has worked so well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Peter Keele is in the same category of having worked in the same area&mdash;and I think he is just about to go on an overseas trip, taking parliamentarians to other places&mdash;and Peter Hallahan, who has also worked closely with me. I do have to say, because I know we all feel it, it is such an intimate bond, when they do all the hard yakka and finally report results and we as chairs of those committees get usually the credit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I think the thing I always feel is that you learn from everyone. It is a great privilege that you learn from your staff, from the secretariat, from your political opponents. I think that is one of the charming things. It is very hard for the press to understand that. They think it has been sort of a bit lovey&hyphen;dovey in the last couple of hours. But I illustrate it always by how I have learnt about the farmer's perspective from people like Senator Alan Ferguson, Senator Crane and the late John Panizza; they taught me so much. I hope that I might have taught them something about a trade unionist's perspective as well in the same process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, when I talk about farmers, Madam Deputy President, I want to make it quite clear that if it were something about rural or regional Australia, and particularly 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6529"> New South Wales, then I would certainly ask you too in checking what they told me. Nevertheless, it is one of the great advantages. It means you do learn so much. It means that a person of average intelligence always looks better when they have had that great experience that we enjoy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it sounds as though what I am saying is a bit soft, I looked at my first speech, and I must say that on the fundamentals, the ideological differences that we have, then I have not changed one iota from my first speech and the feelings of where I come from. Nevertheless, it is that contradiction between your basic fundamental beliefs and what you learn in the process that is so broadening and so marvellous, and makes you proud to be a parliamentarian. I have never identified with being a politician, but I really do identify with being a parliamentarian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support a strong parliament. That was why it is a bit strange that John Faulkner and others have mentioned the issue of privilege. Why is a leftie so concerned about privileges? Why has the Left of the Labor Party supplied so many people on the Privileges Committee? From my perspective, once I went onto the Privileges Committee, I realised that it is about protecting the committees of the parliament; it is protecting our witnesses, even to the extent finally of the whistleblower&mdash;one of the extreme of the people who we need to come before the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why I as a leftie support this strong parliament is because you have to have an effective countervailing force to the executive government, because my long experience now with executive government is that there are unintended consequences, there are foul&hyphen;ups and muck&hyphen;ups all the time. And there are little people being squashed at any point, if we do not have all these democratic procedures to try to protect people with. Whether we are supporting people coming before a committee, or whether we are just giving people the right of reply, which this chamber has pioneered, then we are guaranteeing that we are preventing them from being abused by too much power which sometimes can be in the hands of people in power.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, where I would differ from my colleagues on the other side&mdash;although I am sure that some of them would agree with not letting big government get too much power&mdash;is that I would go a bit further: I would want to apply the same principles to the private sector. I would like to devolve power in the private sector&mdash;and, of course, that would be called a dirty word like `industrial democracy'. But that is a debate for another time, and I will not develop it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just like to thank everybody for the kind words that they have said tonight. I thank them on behalf of my wife Yola, and I do appreciate those words. I thank my trade union mates. All I can do is thank my friends here tonight from every part of the chamber and wish you good health and wisdom in future deliberations of the Senate.</PARA>
