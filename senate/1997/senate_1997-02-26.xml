<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to Senator Newman, the Minister for Social Security. Minister, is it true that your department briefed you late last year on their assessment of the Austudy actual means test? Is it true that your department identified numerous defects in the actual means test regime and concluded that it did not stand up to scrutiny and would require substantial revision? Did you pass on your department's concerns to your colleague Senator Vanstone? If so, when? If not, why not?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I have had briefings at different times about means testing. After all, my department I think would quite reasonably be able to lay claim to being specialists in the technicalities of means testings. When I became the Minister for Social Security I was very concerned that the previous administration had not been able effectively to deal with people with substantial means who were accessing social security entitlements. I understood very early on that there was in DEETYA a means test which was trying to deal with this, to stamp out people who, in most people's judgments, would not have been entitled to but were receiving Austudy. So I was very interested to learn about it. In fact, at that stage I did get a briefing about how the Austudy actual means test was working.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My department has also been doing work on means testing people with substantial means, particularly people with private companies, trusts and such like. That work is proceeding. I have not recently had any detail about it, but I do know that that work is being made available across portfolios as the technical people are talking to each other.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it was at least a year ago that I had that briefing. From memory, I would not have described it in exactly those terms, but they did express some concerns about the actual means test which the previous government had introduced. They felt, while we were all committed to this common cause of eliminating the access of well&hyphen;to&hyphen;do people to taxpayer&hyphen;funded benefits, that there may well be improvements that could be made to the actual means test; therefore they were setting off down a route of trying to improve our ability in social security. I could not comment on the specifics of that because I do not recall what was briefed to me all that time ago.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to Senator Parer as Minister for Resources and Energy and as a former prominent member of the mining industry. I ask: now that the Century Zinc negotiations under the Native Title Act have failed, with some of the 12 native title groups failing to reach agreement, what has been the effect on exploration and mining of the Wik decision and the failed Century Zinc negotiations?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="983" SPEAKER="Parer, Sen Warwick" NAMEID="KI4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Resources and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I thank Senator Boswell for that question; it is a very important one. The miners as well as the pastoralists have been misled on this issue&mdash;and many other issues&mdash;by the previous Labor government when it assured them that pastoral leases extinguish native title. This is yet another Labor mess which we inherited which must be addressed as a matter of urgency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The collapse of the negotiations over Century Zinc&mdash;against the wishes of the majority of the local Aboriginal community, the company and the state and Commonwealth governments&mdash;highlights again the failings of the Native Title Act. Yesterday a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="984"> number of senators, including myself, were visited by representatives of the Waanyi and Mingginda people, the majority in the Carpentaria area, who requested legislation to correct a situation where a few dissidents could effectively veto a project to the detriment of the majority of their people. They told me that should ATSIC call a vote on the issue there would be a 90 per cent acceptance of that project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Century Zinc project offers 3,200 real and indirect jobs in the construction phase and an estimated 4,150 jobs when it goes into production in a region of Australia where there are very few job opportunities&mdash;let alone the $600 million per year contribution to the other Labor legacy of a massive foreign debt. The Waanyi and Mingginda people understand the opportunities which this project will provide for them and, more importantly, their children&mdash;jobs training, better community services, and opportunities to deliver their own business enterprises. It offers the opportunity for financial independence and escape from the welfare net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the collapse of the Century Zinc negotiations is a disgrace. It represents an enormous loss in not just time and money but in the hopes and aspirations of all those involved. If every other project in Australia is to be a repeat of Century, the country will grind to a halt. As Senator Boswell implies, it sends an ominous message to investors in our mining and pastoral industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thousands of exploration and mining titles are now under a cloud. Those issued post&hyphen;1993 are particularly vulnerable and billions of dollars of investment are at risk. Unless the Wik decision and the unworkability of the Native Title Act are addressed quickly, major adverse effects for Australia will be felt, but not for about four or five years when exploration programs finish and are not replaced and when new mines fail to come on stream to replace worked out deposits. Probably equally important is the fact that we are now seeing a large degree of downstream processing, which is something that I think most people in Australia have been looking for for many years&mdash;and that will also stagger.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the Prime Minister met the Waanyi and Mingginda representatives he assured them that the government is now even more determined to press on with its native title amendments and that their suggestions would be taken on board in determining the outcome. The Prime Minister also said that he hoped the Labor Party, the Democrats and other parties in the Senate would listen carefully to the concerns of those Aboriginal people and support the government's fair and reasonable amendments before the Senate. This is a message which should be heeded by those opposite.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

After 13 years of Labor government many indigenous Australians were left to live in appalling conditions with very few resources to enable them to improve their situation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last year, and we found that the area of Aboriginal Affairs was an absolute disgrace. We celebrate one year of this government this year and we are looking forward to those celebrations because of the change that we have wrought in many areas of policy. Many indigenous people have been trapped in a poverty cycle from which they have no power to free themselves. This government has set a new direction in Aboriginal affairs and the hallmark of the new era will be economic independence and self&hyphen;empowerment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indigenous Australians want to work to provide jobs and training for their children. I had the pleasure, with Senator Parer, of meeting the Waanyi and Mingginda people yesterday. They emphasised they want the changes, too. They want this so their people and their children can have jobs. Senator Kernot is trying to interject. I ask her, `What have you done in the time you have been here?' You have done nothing to help them, either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since being appointed Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in March last year, Senator Kernot, I have visited more than 50 communities around Australia&mdash;and I will continue to do so&mdash;in remote, urban and semi&hyphen;urban areas. The strong message coming through is that in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> digenous Australians do not want to be forever dependent on government handouts, which is what the previous government did; it kept them dependent because it thought it could control their votes. I see that Gary Gray&mdash;do you remember Gary Gray?&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we had on more occasions, as a government, said that we were sorry and acknowledged where we got things wrong, then the result in March of last year would have been very different.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We see the Hindmarsh Island bridge decision that you, Senator Kernot, and the Labor Party are perpetuating. Madam President, they have not learnt anything out of the Hindmarsh Island bridge fiasco&mdash;and they have not said they were sorry. They should listen to Gary Gray who said that if on more occasions then they had said they were sorry they might be out of the debacle they are in now&mdash;but they are going to continue that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal people want to foster a work ethic in their young people; they want their young people to have the self&hyphen;esteem that goes with having a job. Indigenous Australians are the only Australians who voluntarily work for the dole through the community development employment projects. Over the past few months I have highlighted many examples of Aboriginal enterprises that have recently been established in providing employment and generating income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the community at Warburton and the people of Badu Island in the Torres Strait who are cultivating and selling pearls, and growing and exporting lobsters to Japan. One of the most outstanding, and one that deserves some publicity, is the Jawoyn Association based in Katherine in the Northern Territory. Last month I had the privilege of flying to Katherine with my colleague Senator Parer for the launch of the Jawoyn Association five&hyphen;year plan. The plan focuses on economic independence and providing a future for the Jawoyn people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman. Minister, have you read and analysed the ACOSS commission research which shows that all households, irrespective of their incomes, are losers from the 1996-97 budget and low income households with incomes between $15,000 and $20,000 are very big losers? Do you agree with the conclusions of this research?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention was drawn to the ACOSS ACTU sponsored study, Senator. I was disappointed that it was in some way selective of the evidence that it used. The situation was that the incidents which might have happened to a range of families were, I understand, all deemed to have occurred to one family. If one family had a reduction in one area they were also deemed to have had a reduction in this, that and the other area, so that you had multiple effects from the budget on one family. The ACOSS ACTU study then put them together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not had a formal detailed briefing on this, but the brief advice I have had from the department when it first came out was that some of the assumptions were very questionable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is correct that there are a series of  briefing sessions being conducted by the department in relation to a number of matters of particular community concern&mdash;certainly the revised telecommunications national code, which only lasts through until 1 July, and the regime thereafter, and, of course, public health issues. It ought to be perfectly clear that we are, as a government, very concerned to ensure that no-one is exposed to any level of radiation that might be in any shape or form considered to be dangerous. That is why we announced a $4.5 million program over five years to ensure that adequate research continues to be done on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no shortage of research that has been done. All of that research to date very much indicates that there is no basis for community concern. The most recent is from the Australasian Faculty of Occupational Medicine, which acknowledges that there is considerable uncertainty in the mind of the public. I might say this is due very significantly to people like Senator Allison who continue to ignore the facts and try to play to very emotive and quite often irrational concerns that people have on this issue. The faculty says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the opinion of the faculty, at this stage it is not possible to quantify any relationships between radio frequency exposure and subsequent human health effects.

You went on to say that none of these reports indicate any significant level of concern but, put together, the weight of evidence suggests that there is a serious problem.

It is just ludicrous. I am not surprised that Senator Allison has waited until now because she has obviously been hoping that that press release will disappear into the vapour. I can assure you that it will continue to get a run as far as I am concerned because it simply indicates that you are not serious about the issue.</PARA>

In other words, it would come as no surprise to find that people are reflecting their own commercial interests in the arguments they advance in relation to cross media and it is not always the case that the public interest is foremost in their minds. That is not a criticism; it is simply a reflection of commercial reality.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by Senator Harradine, to a question without notice asked by Senator Brown today, relating to the appointment of the Chair of the National Health and Medical Research Council.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do so because I want to give Senator Harradine the opportunity to supply the Senate with the information he indicated he would supply in the course of his answer. I have taken a very close interest in the appointment of Professor Larkins to head the National Health and Medical Research Council. As is public knowledge, the nominee of the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) was Professor Funder. As is also public knowledge, Senator Harradine went to the minister for health with information relating to Professor Funder which came from an as yet unnamed source. I think we can assume it was another scientist. That information was instrumental in having cabinet, in effect, reject the nomination of Professor Funder and look elsewhere.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an extremely serious matter. The motion before the Senate, which Senator Harradine has on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, talks about the rights and responsibilities of parliamentarians to govern matters relating to human embryo experimentation and genetic engineering and a whole range of other things, even including privacy. Senator Harradine's motion&mdash;and I am not going to debate it&mdash;is one with which I have a great deal of sympathy. But I am concerned by the idea that members of parliament ought to be able to extend beyond the debate on the ethics of matters technological to censure, or indeed change the career path of, people with different points of view to those which we as individuals hold. That is the fundamental issue here. It is one of our accountability as democrats, as liberals in the wider sense of that word, and as members of a pluralist society in which the widest public debate and the widest expression of viewpoints has to be fundamentally accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an air of censorship, even a tinge of McCarthyism, that comes into our democratic affairs when, in secret, a member of parliament holding a critical vote in this place can influence government appointments, using secret information from an unnamed source to affect one of the highest appointments in the land and to affect none other than the appointment to the chair of the National Health and Medical Research Council, the premier body when it comes to research in the area of health and medicine in this country. It is an extremely serious matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accountability is necessary. Senator Harradine is frequently on the record&mdash;and I would support him in this&mdash;in demanding public transparency and accountability. Indeed, in the debate about this very appointment, one of his complaints about the appointment of Professor Funder was that it had not been adequately canvassed publicly and it had not been transparent enough in the nomination for his appointment to that chair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it seems totally contrary to that aspiration to public accountability and transparency that Senator Harradine went in secret to the government with secret information from an anonymous source and effected the withdraw 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="999"> al of that nomination and effected the placement in the chair of another person. That is an extremely worrying trend. It is dangerous. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This week has been important in terms of the accountability debate and it has been interesting to observe the processes of this coalition government when it comes to making appointments. I want to put on the record that no&hyphen;one is saying in this debate that no individual senator has lost the right to make a statement and to have a view on candidates for appointment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Brown said, the issue is about transparency. I think transparency of process is really important. On the matter of the appointment of the new head of the NHMRC, it seems to me that this government has now erected a wall of denial around what was previously a fairly transparent process. That loss of transparency opens the way for nepotism. It opens the way for qualified potential appointees to be excluded on the grounds of their political or moral beliefs. It opens the way for them to be excluded on grounds of race or some factor entirely unrelated to their ability to do the job. The Democrats have said that we would prefer to see some kind of independent commissioner for appointments to take away this politicisation of the process, but I could talk about that at another time because I think there are other elements that I want to discuss here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the first instance, the chair of the NHMRC is meant to be an appointment based purely upon medico&hyphen;scientific criteria. I think that the cabinet owes the Australian community and specifically the Australian scientific community an explanation as to why other factors apparently made their way on to the list of selection criteria, because it is clear that other factors did make their way on to that list. Why for a start did we have the extraordinary step of the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams)&mdash;not a voting member of cabinet&mdash;actually requesting Professor Funder, through a third person, to set out and justify his position on abortion? There has been lots of to&hyphen;ing and fro&hyphen;ing on this matter and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Harradine has had a role in that. That is why we look forward to his tabling of this information in a moment. But we are entitled to know the reasons why cabinet rejected the recommendation of the Minister for Health and Family Services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a wider concern here, too. Does this now mean that moral arguments and moral principles are going to become part of the criteria for appointments to high&hyphen;level positions? Does it mean that anyone with a particular moral axe to grind can foist their views on the rest of the population through backdoor wheeling and dealing?</PARA>

If she wants to have a debate about cabinet appointments to any positions, she should have the commitment to that cause and that debate on that issue by moving some sort of motion to have it debated formally before this chamber. There has been an informal agreement between parties in this chamber that we would limit the taking note of answers. In fact, the government and the opposition have both agreed not to take note of answers today so we could proceed directly to the estimates hearings. It is impossible, under those circumstances, for the government to stand by that informal agreement if it is going, under the guise of a taking note debate, to be attacked by Senator Kernot in relation to a motion moved by Senator Brown and where she is straying a long way away from the substance of that motion.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>

I ask this question: if Professor Funder's views on abortion were relevant to his appointment in this particular case, can we now expect that candidates have to state what their views are on contraception and euthanasia?

Where does it start and where does it end if you are required to write to the Attorney&hyphen;General to explain your views on abortion?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I would say is that it may not be a case of who is next but what is next on the hit list. The issue is where the influence is being exerted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to place on record the Democrats' disappointment that Professor Funder was not successful, but that in no way detracts from the qualities of Professor Larkins.

The wider issue is that the scientific body of this country is suffering from a lack of confidence in whether they can now give independent, fearless and honest advice to the government. That is what the repercussions of this are going to be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I want to commend the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge). He seems to have come out of this with a great deal of honour. He made a judgment. He went ahead with his recommendation. He had that recommendation overturned and, although he is disappointed, he has behaved honourably.

Let me say that source is no longer anonymous; it was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on Saturday, and it

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The practice is that, if you have representations made to you, you pass them on to the relevant minister, and that is what I did. It is then for the minister to examine whether they are correct or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since I have been asked what the representation was and from whom I got it, I have obtained permission from the academic involved. That academic is a very senior academic indeed.

But in the light of the latest allegations surrounding you, we are no longer prepared to be tolerant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be seeking your replacement as deputy chair of the regulations and ordinances committee and the publications committee. As I have said, I have asked the President for her advice in relation to your membership of the Parliamentary Retirement Allowances Trust and the Australian National University Council.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Of course the opposition can consider what it might do on any number of matters but I think it is unfortunate, might I suggest, and sets a very bad precedent for the opposition on the basis of unproven allegations to take the steps that it is considering. Unless there is some clear evidence that an officer of this parliament or a member of a committee is not performing the duties appropriate to that committee then, clearly, that officer or member of a committee is entitled to remain and retain those offices and membership of the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the case of Senator Colston, might I say as an observer that Senator Colston is one of the most hardworking members of this chamber. He spends probably more time in this chamber than do most other senators, because that is the nature of his duties&mdash;he is Deputy President and Chairman of Committees. As I see his operation in those offices he does an excellent job. A recent example was on a point of order by, I think, Senator Brown when he made I believe a very good and impartial decision. Might I also say it is not easy for him to have to get over, as I have, all the matters that come before this chamber, without the benefit of a party system. He still is able to exercise the functions with which he is charged and the responsibilities he has on our behalf in this Senate chamber.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1004"> injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator Knowles</NAME><FROM>(from five citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER>and <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator Woodley</NAME><FROM>(from 25 citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  and to continue my remarks later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first report which I have tabled concerns the proposed development of the Army Logistics Training Centre and the Bandiana Logistics Group at Bandiana and Bonegilla, Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal examined by the Committee involves the provision of office accommodation, trade training and structural facilities, weapons storage and repair and upgraded engineering services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated out&hyphen;turn cost of the proposed works is $16.081 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the work should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Army's facilities at Bandiana and Bonegilla have been developed over the past two decades. Facilities occupied by the Army Logistics Training Centre are a major investment for the training of soldiers. Activities range from initial trade and employment training to Non&hyphen;commissioned Officers and officer level courses. The types of courses offered include trade training, integrated logistics training, career and promotional training and equipment training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that there is a need to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">upgrade several administrative facilities for the Bandiana Logistics Group;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">rationalise training facilities to support the creation of the Army Logistics Training Centre</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">rationalise messing in North Bandiana; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">further upgrade engineering services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The scope of the proposed work examined by the Committee includes the adaptive reuse of seven existing buildings, the construction of extensions to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1009"> four buildings and the construction of three new buildings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that the proposed development will rectify a number of deficiencies which have arisen as a result of organisational changes and can be justified because the Bandiana/Bonegilla area will remain as the Army's major logistics training establishment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of organisations representing community interests strongly support the proposal. All pointed to the Army having been a long standing and significant part of the Albury/Wodonga community and an exemplary corporate citizen. In addition, the Army has integrated well within the regional community, and has contributed to regional income, employment, skills and infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Second report which I have tabled is the Committee's Sixtieth General report. This is for the last calendar year, but it must be remembered that members of the Committee were appointed in May and the first reference was not received until June.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee received ten references during 1996 and reported on five of these. The remaining five references have either been reported on or will be reported on shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of projects reported on during the year was $88.526 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The year in review was marked by general agreement on public works proposals from organisations and individuals consulted by departments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes this is due to departments being more conscious of their obligations to consult early and widely during the development of proposals, before they are referred to the Committee.One positive result has been that public hearings have not been unduly protracted. Another result has been the avoidance of extraneous debate on issues of marginal relevance being introduced into the Committee's deliberations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recognises that public works projects often result in benefits flowing to local communities, in addition to the actual buildings and services provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was illustrated in two of the Committee's investigations during 1996. As part of the development of facilities in Townsville for the 5 Aviation Regiment and for infrastructure on the Townsville Field Training Area, the Townsville City Council commissioned a study by the Centre for Applied Economic Research at James Cook University, illustrating the economic benefits of each proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The study showed that economic benefits flowing from the two Townsville projects amounted to a total of $120 million. The projects were also each predicted to create over 300 full&hyphen;time and part&hyphen;time jobs for members of the local community. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fifth conference of Commonwealth and State Public Works Committees was hosted by a committee of the ACT Legislative Assembly on 5&hyphen;6 August 1996, in Canberra. Representatives of the Commonwealth, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australian, Tasmanian, ACT and New Zealand legislatures were in attendance. The conference provides a forum for discussion on the operations of public works committees across Australia and New Zealand and compares methods of scrutiny of funding for public works.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Public Works Committee Act 1969, all public works estimated to cost $6 million or more must be referred to the Committee. Medium works&mdash;those with an estimated cost of between $2 million&mdash;$6 million may also be referred. The Committee is aware that some departments may divide a single project, costing more than $6 million, into two or more components to avoid the need for referral to the Committee. To avoid this, the Committee requests information from departments on medium works. The plans and sites may be inspected by the Committee, to determine if further investigation is warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee did not examine any new overseas works during the year. However, it did agree to a request from the Overseas Property Group to increase funding for the refurbishment of Australia House in London from $14.25 million to $21.28 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consultations are continuing with appropriate Ministers to improve the Committee's effectiveness by enabling Committee Members to undertake on site inspections of overseas properties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the year, the Committee discussed the merits of amending the Public Works Committee Act 1969, to reflect current construction prices and to improve the Committee's administrative arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Suggestions included:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">increasing the statutory limit for referrals from $6 million to a figure reflecting the higher cost of construction;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">requiring that the Committee be kept informed of all public works within a certain range and, if considered in the public interest, allowing the Committee to conduct formal examination of any such project;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">inserting a clause in the Act to allow the Committee to give approval for concurrent documentation; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">requiring a central agency to prepare an annual consolidated list of public works proposals for a given financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of 1996, the Committee was continuing its consideration of these matters, especially 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1010"> amendments to the Act and consequential arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During 1996, the House of Representatives Committee Office, which administers the Committee Secretariat, was restructured. The result of the restructuring is the linking of the secretariat with that of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs. Resources are shared and staff allocated according to each Committee's workload. So far, the reorganisation has not affected the operations of the Committee.</PARA>
