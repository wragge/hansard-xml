<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>

The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Petition of the undersigned shows that only one group have been excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) where such group has performed honourable overseas `active service'. That group being members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 which were excluded under `Operational Service' at Section 6. (1)(e)(ii) of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various claims made in Statements to the House and the Senate and the contents of correspondence from various Ministers to maintain the exclusion are answered as follows, the answers are from documents obtained under FIO and from public record:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) `They were never allotted for operational service', (contained in a letter from the Hon. Con Sciacca Minister for Defence Science and Personnel 1995). A letter from the Secretary Department of the Navy to Treasury dated 11 November 1955 stated `the date that the Navy were allotted for operational  service was 1 July 1955'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) `Members of the RAN were only doing the duty for which they had enlisted', (October 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). This applies to all Service personnel everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) `They were in no danger', (November 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). They shared the same danger as all other Australian Service personnel serving in Malaya at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) `They were not on Special Overseas Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop Minister for Defence Industry 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1923"> Science and Personnel to Mrs Williams of Adelaide dated October 1996). Requirement for Special Overseas Service was introduced in 1962 without retrospective conditions, therefore has no relevance to events of 1960.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v) `They were not on Active Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop Minister for Defence Industry Science and Personnel dated October 1996). It is now, as it was then, that Service Personnel had to comply with one of three requirements for Active Service, this group complied with two, or twice as many as is needed. The one that they did not comply with was, `is in military occupation of a foreign country'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request that the Senate should remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act, thereby giving the Australian sailors involved comparative recognition with the Army and RAAF personnel that served at the same time, and all other Australians who have served their Country on active service overseas.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator Woodley</NAME><FROM>(from 32 citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to report two matters concerning the committee. In the Senate on 13 February 1997 Senator Short raised issues about the operation of the resolution providing for the declaration of senators' interests: firstly, what does a senator do who holds shares in a company without detailed knowledge of the company; secondly, what is a relevant interest that should be declared during a debate or a division; and, thirdly, should not the fact of a written declaration preclude the need for an oral declaration again during the debates or votes? During debate yesterday Senator Gibson also raised the issue of what is a material interest that should be declared in debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee considered the issues raised by Senator Short and wrote to him about them. The committee took the view, firstly, that senators should make reasonable efforts to find out the activities of companies in which they hold shares. Secondly, we considered that what constitutes a relevant or material interest is usually not difficult to determine. At the margin it is a matter for each senator to think carefully about the consequences of too narrow or unreasonable a view of relevance. Thirdly, the rule about oral declarations during debate or before votes should not be changed. This rule enables the Senate and the public to be informed during proceedings of any conflict of interest so that the conflict can be taken into account by all concerned at the relevant time, otherwise potential conflict declared in the register would not appear in the relevant <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">YOUR QUERY IN THE SENATE ABOUT ORAL DECLARATIONS OF INTERESTS</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At its meeting on 18 March 1997 the Committee considered the remarks you made in the Senate on 13 February 1997 about aspects of the resolution concerning the declaration of senators' interests. You asked that the President refer the matter to the Committee. However, the Committee itself can respond to particular submissions and it decided it should do so to assist you and other senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You raised three specific points. First, what does a senator do who holds shares in a company without any detailed knowledge of its activities?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the question of what is a "relevant" interest may be a difficult one: for example, in a debate or division on a company law bill or a superannuation bill does a senator holding shares have a "relevant" interest for the purposes of that debate or division?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, in any event, should not a proper written declaration in the Register of Senators' Interests be sufficient for all future occasions where, currently, an oral declaration is required?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against the background of these issues you invited the President to refer the operation of the resolution to the Committee for examination and report in light of the past three years of experience with the Register.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This broader question of a full review of the operation of the resolution is at this time perhaps more properly one for the Senate to consider. However, on the three specific issues you raise the Committee offers the following advice. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1926">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The essential purpose of the Register, and the procedures for oral declarations during Senate and committee proceedings, is to enable the Senate and the public to be aware of private interests that senators and, so far as their interests are known, their spouses and dependent children have which might conflict with their official responsibilities, so that those interests can be properly taken into account by all concerned each time a potential conflict might arise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general terms, the Committee considers that where a senator (including a spouse or child) has a financial or other real, personal, interest in a company, body, activity or place, and that interest or that company, body, activity or place could reasonably be advantaged by the outcome of a debate, division or committee inquiry, the senator should declare that interest in debate, prior to the division, or during the committee's proceedings, if the senator participates or votes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a senator holds financial interests in a company it would be expected that a responsible senator would know of, or seek to find out, the activities of that company and be in a position to declare an interest in proceedings that might reasonably affect that company's activities to the senator's advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate's procedures ensure that on each occasion of debate, voting or committee participation senators declare the fact that they have a private interest which might be advantaged by a Senate process in which they take part. That fact can then be taken into account by all concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The interest does not, of course, necessarily preclude the senator from participating&mdash;though on some rare occasions it might, in the senator's judgement, require his or her abstention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any event, the declaration of the interest in the midst of debate, while not removing the possibility of conflict, protects a senator from any insinuation that they have not been open about the position they are in and from which they enter the debate or the vote. Under the Senate resolution it is a serious contempt to fail to disclose a relevant interest; it is not a contempt simply to have such an interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of passing the resolution (17 March 1994) it was clearly the Senate's intention that senators should orally declare relevant interests on every relevant occasion. Most relevant interests can be clearly identified by senators and understood by the community from the terms of the Senate resolution and the Explanatory Notes. On the margins, identification of a relevant interest that should be declared is a matter for the senator concerned. In the past, the committee has stressed the personal responsibility of individual senators in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this regard. In its First Report (June 1994) the Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">". . . the Committee advises that while it may, from time to time, provide guidance on the interpretation of particular matters set out in the resolution, final decisions on the appropriate interpretation of the resolution must be the responsibility of individual Senators."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the same vein, the Explanatory Note accompanying declaration forms states:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"No form can cover all possible circumstances and senators should consequently bear in mind the purpose and spirit of the return in deciding which matters should be registered."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee takes the view that appropriate oral declarations should continue to be made in the Senate and in committees, as provided by the resolution. The committee also considers that, apart from the plain words of the resolution itself, the Explanatory Notes and any special guidance given in Committee reports, the question of the relevance of an interest is a matter for the senator's individual responsibility. Senators should err on the side of caution and make declarations if they wish to preserve "the purpose and spirit" of the procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of the day, senators must, at all times, be alive to the potential for conflict of interest between their private interests and their official responsibilities. When this potential manifests itself, the Senate and the public are entitled to be reminded of the senator's personal interests when that senator participates in Senate proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope this is helpful to you. The matter you have raised is important and I propose to table in the Senate a copy of this letter for the information of all senators.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The committee also considered whether the explanatory notes used by senators in making declarations should be amended in relation to shareholdings. This would clarify the requirements about declaring actual shareholdings held by family and business trusts, partnerships or nominee companies; thus, where a senator alone or with their family can exercise control over the voting rights or disposal of shareholdings, the actual shareholdings should be declared.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has decided to amend the explanatory notes to remove the possibility of any misunderstandings about this. The House of Representatives has also decided to do this.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Auditor-General Bill 1996 which is currently before the parliament, provides the Auditor-General with unfettered powers to obtain any information required to fulfil audit functions, this power would be enhanced considerably if it were specifically referred to in contracts between the Commonwealth and third party providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 6 in Report 349 therefore urges the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, when establishing contracts with private sector employment placement agencies, to include contract provisions which make explicit the Auditor-General's statutory authority to obtain information from third party service providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, it is clear that much work needs to be done by DEETYA and DSS (within a relatively short time frame) to ensure that integrated and contractually sound performance measurement and monitoring systems are in place for the introduction of the employment placement market. The committee believes it has played a part in ensuring that both departments are fully aware of the need to incorporate accountability requirements into the management arrangements they are drafting for the new programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, I now turn to the 1996-97 audit reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two reports of the Auditor-General were the focus of the first quarterly public hearing for 1996-97. These were Audit Report No. 5, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Accounting for Aid. The Management of funding to Non-Government Organisations</EMPHASIS>  and Audit Report No. 6, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth Guarantees, Indemnities and Letters of Comfort</EMPHASIS> . Report 350 focuses on the main issues raised during the public hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCPA notes the audit finding in Audit Report No. 5 that AusAID's regime for the management of funding to NGOs is generally of a high standard and that aspects of the management framework are at the leading edge of international best practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee is reassured by AusAID's advice that evaluation and audit activities will continue, as a check on the new performance reports to be provided by NGOs. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCPA awaits with interest the Simon's review of the overall priorities, objectives and focus of the Australian aid program and, in particular, the findings of the review in relation to the role of NGOs in the delivery of Australian aid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report contains two recommendations for further action in relation to Audit Report No. 6, 1996-97, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth Guarantees, Indemnities and Letters of Comfort.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendations in Audit Report No. 6 are designed to improve agency awareness and management. In order to encourage agencies to focus on a responsibility that most Chief Executive Officers have been neglecting, the JCPA recommends that the Department of Finance seek statements from agencies on the steps they have taken to address each relevant recommendation in Audit Report No 6.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCPA considers that the current state of reporting on liabilities is clearly deficient and recommends that full statements of off-balance sheet liabilities associated with guarantees, indemnities and letters of comfort should be a mandatory inclusion in annual financial statements of departments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, I am confident that our new review and reporting procedures will result in more timely and effective parliamentary examination of audit reports and that this will be to the benefit of all parties involved: the Parliament, the ANAO and audited agencies. The JCPA looks forward to receiving the government's response to its reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">May I conclude, Madam President, by thanking all those people who contributed their time and expertise to the JCPA's round of scrutiny hearings, held between July and October 1996, upon which these two reports are based.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present report No. 351 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An advisory report on the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996</EMPHASIS> . I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to advise the Senate of the history of this report. In early 1995 the Joint Committee of Public Accounts decided to do an investi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1931"> gation on fiscal responsibility legislation. I am proud of the fact that I was the initiator of that move. At the same time I managed to persuade Mr Costello and Mr Howard that the coalition should take on board fiscal responsibility legislation as a coalition policy which we called the charter for budget honesty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This resulted from the excellent work done by the public accounts committee in 1995. I pay tribute to all members of that committee, particularly the chairman, Les Scott, for agreeing to take that on board. That investigation in 1995 meant that the departments of treasury and finance were able to do all their homework over several months in preparation for this work. When we came to government last year, the government was able to proceed forthwith with the charter of budget honesty. I am delighted to see that it is now progressing through the parliament. I seek leave to incorporate the rest of my speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As honourable senators are aware, the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill was referred to the JCPA on 3 March 1996 for tabling today. As a consequence of this tight deadline, the committee held only one public hearing, taking evidence from the stakeholders in the public sector and from peak representative groups in the private sector. Those groups which were unable to attend managed to make submissions within our tight timetable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee supports the framework outlined in the bill as it implements mechanisms for improving the accountability and transparency of government fiscal policy objectives, strategies and outcomes. The JCPA believes that the Charter of Budget Honesty Bill is another element in the improvement of the overall fiscal accountability framework. Transparency is the essence of such a framework and this bill legislates for the provision of regular published reports so that the public may be better informed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During its review of the bill, the committee encountered widespread general support and very little criticism. However, there are several important aspects which I wish to draw parliament's attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SCHEDULE 1- CLAUSES 12(3),16(3),19(2) &amp; 24(3)</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the committee applauds the requirement for the fiscal reports to be prepared in accordance with recognised external reporting standards, the committee believes firmly that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reasons for any deviations from those standards should be fully explained in the reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SCHEDULE 1&mdash;CLAUSES 12(4), 16(5) &amp; 24(5)</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the committee recognises the need to suppress information of a confidential commercial or national security nature, it believes that a statement, providing a general description of the information being suppressed and its aggregate amount should be included in the reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SCHEDULE 1- CLAUSES 13,17, 28 &amp; 32</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee is pleased that the fiscal reports being legislated by this bill provide an approximation of whole-of-government reporting. However, the above-named clauses enables Commonwealth agencies to withhold information. Where this occurs, then a statement, showing the effect of this omission and its aggregate amount should be included in the reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SCHEDULE 1- CLAUSE 22</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee notes that a pre-election economic and fiscal outlook report is to be released within 10 days of the issues of the writ for a general election. Given that a writ can be delayed up to 10 days after the dissolution of parliament, the committee believes that it would be more sensible to have the pre-election reports released within 10 days of the dissolution of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My final point, Madam President, is to seek the government's agreement to including a review component in the schedule of the bill so that the full reporting process can be assessed after the next election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident that our report reflects the concerns of the parliament. The JCPA looks forward to receiving the government's response to Report 351.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the JCPA has a proud history of co-operation among its members: very few of our inquiries have ever resulted in a dissenting report. I mention this because the l9th committee has excelled itself in completing this report within the tight time frame imposed on the committee. It has held a public hearing, received submissions, deliberated on the issues and produced the report I now table.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of this was done within 16 days, Madam President:&mdash;16 days which included 2 state/territory public holidays and 2 weekends! I therefore wish to record my thanks to my fellow committee members for their willingness to rearrange busy schedules at short notice in order to participate in the review of this bill. Without them the committee could not have conducted the review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">May I conclude, Madam President, by thanking those people who contributed their time and expertise to the JCPA's public hearing, held on 13 March 1997, and those who sent in submissions. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1932"> The JCPA has been appreciative of the full co-operation it has received from the people involved. In particular, I wish to record the committee's thanks to His Excellency, the New Zealand High Commissioner who very kindly provided the committee with a comprehensive overview of the changes to economic and fiscal reporting in New Zealand after the introduction of its Fiscal Responsibility Act in 1994. Without them the committee could not have conducted the review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would also like to thank Hansard who did a marvellous job getting the transcripts back to the committee in record time. Without these the committee's report drafting would have been much more difficult.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night when discussing my amendment we found out that each time a question was asked we went in a larger and larger circle, or perhaps a tighter and tighter circle. Then the circle went off in many different directions. Rather than clarifying the situation, we found that the problems had multiplied. There were problems of understanding and definition. There were problems associated with consumers understanding their current situation and future situation&mdash;a situation which seems like a nightmare. I think the administrative aspects for networks and governments handling the kinds of issues that are going to come up are going to be a nightmare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, what I have asked for in my amendment is that we clarify the situation and take it back to where the network boundary is at the plug then, if it is necessary, over the next couple of years renegotiate that. If there seems to be a commercial necessity, then that is possible. The indications from last night's debate are that certainly there are so many problems, so many issues, associated with the change that we might not be acting responsibly as a Senate if we allowed it to go in that direction without any further clarification of the implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is still not sufficient explanation given as to why consumers&mdash;and I think they are the important ones&mdash;do not have more availability of competition. I have spoken here on a number of occasions that competition itself does not bring the benefit, but it does have some actual benefits. The benefits have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1933"> to include being able to understand what is being done, who is responsible and being able to get an answer from somebody or get the lines fixed if something goes wrong. The indication from last night's debate is that the benefits to the consumers may well be far less than the complications and uncertainties that this move to change the status quo will entail.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate committee never dealt at any length with this amendment. There were some major submissions in this area. Certainly, the CEPU I think, as Senator Margetts has said, have some concern about this but it never became a major issue at the Senate committee. At the Senate committee we only dealt with issues about which major submissions were made and debate amongst various players, so to speak, was available. I certainly have always stuck to the view that the committee was dealing with major issues raised by the community and by organisations. I certainly accept that this is now an issue in the debate which has arisen as a result of the Greens amendment. In the discussion we had last night there are now a number of issues that do create some concern for the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last night, towards the end of the discussion, you, Minister, made a couple of comments which I hope you might be able to clarify. One is that you said that, in effect, when a line comes into the box in a multiple residential building that is already operating, implying that the legislation that is now before us to change the definition was catching up on the practice. That is the way I would interpret it. If that is the case, does that mean that the existing legislation which is being amended was being ignored or was out of date or did it allow that to occur? If it did, why do we need to change it in the definition?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, last night we asked questions about changing the definition of a network from the socket inside in a normal house back to the outside of the building. We asked who owned the cable, now laid by Telstra in 99.9 per cent of cases. Was that an asset of Telstra that suddenly, by expropriation, was handed over to somebody else; namely, the con 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sumer? You replied that, if it were a normal telephony line, Telstra would still own it and they would lease it to the person who wanted to change their carrier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My view is that if Telstra are to lease it&mdash;and that means they are not the carrier providing the actual service&mdash;why should there be any need to change the definition of the boundary? If Telstra are leasing it to another carrier under some commercial arrangement for the operation of the service, I cannot see why there should be any change to the definition. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The further issue you mentioned was that, with the development of new on-line services, carriers may have to put new cabling in to provide the capacity for the expanded on-line service that the present copper wire pair cannot provide. But that is an additional service; it is not the standard service of telephony. We are obviously changing over the years&mdash;and I am one who wants to change and expand the definition of the standard telephone service to include, as we debated yesterday or the day before, digital data capability. But that is an additional service, so if any carrier wants to go in and negotiate to put an extra line in for on-line services that is not the standard guarantee of a telephony service, which is in the existing legislation and in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If carriers want to get an agreement to wire the building and put that extra line in, that socket is in the network for the standard telephone service that we are talking about. If Telstra maintains the ownership of the cable, irrespective of who the carrier is, and has to make arrangements for leasing, I still see that as the existing definition of the socket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept these examples are in quicksand, and I accept that there is always going to be difficulty in being absolutely correct in answering every example we are trying to raise. Minister, the issue is not so much that of supporting the Greens amendment but of maintaining the existing definition of the socket, which is on page 10 and 11 of the Telecommunications Act 1991, until we get more practical experience of how this is going to operate in this area in the deregulated model. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1934">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that you are not deregulating; you are not changing the cable that is already there, which is overwhelmingly Telstra's. You are saying that it looks like they are going to lease it to another carrier to provide the subscription. You are not handing the ownership of that cable over to another carrier and/or to the building or to the consumer, whether it is a single consumer or a number of consumers in a strata title building or tenement and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subject to your answers, I believe there is a good case for saying that we ought to stick to the present definition and look at it with a review from the ACA in, say, 12 to 18 months to see how this is evolving. I am a bit afraid that we may accidentally throw the baby out with the bathwater and that, in particular, consumers will be left in a more difficult position as to knowing what their rights are and how they can have things dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, I am not opposed to changing boundary networks&mdash;I think one should have an open mind about that to make sure consumers get the best growth of services&mdash;but it seems to me that what we are dealing with here is not the provision of on-line services, because that is going to need in most cases new cabling to be put in. What we are dealing with here is who owns the standard cable copper pair that provides the standard telephone service under this new network arrangement. I strongly oppose&mdash;I am sure you would&mdash;Telstra taking a hit in the neck as a result of saying that the asset they had suddenly disappears or is handed over by accident to either a consumer in ownership or another carrier.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason this has not been a contentious issue and was not discussed at any length in the Senate committee hearings is that this has been around for years. You say that we should adjourn it to enable the ACA to have a good look at it, but you have a report from Austel of September 1993 in effect saying that the use of the first telephone socket as the network boundary, network termination point in the residential sector has the effect of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> restricting competition and disadvantaging some customers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SCHACHT" NAMEID="4J4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator Schacht</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some customers and carriers, or just customers?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Customers, because they end up paying more than they need to pay. The carriers are not opposed to this. So this idea of expropriating Telstra's assets is a furphy. Firstly, they do not lose their asset. As the situation works at the moment, the only way preselection applies to the point where you would use the existing line is for long distance and international, because you do not have preselection on local calls. To the extent that you wanted to use that existing line and be an Optus subscriber you would preselect, and Optus has an arrangement with Telstra which enables them to use the existing line.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But for new services, if you wanted Optus local calls then in the overwhelming majority of cases you would get those through Optus installing a new line. Optus would need to then come into the house and build a separate and distinct line. In most instances, again, that would provide you with the whole suite. In other words, it would be pay TV and broadband as well as local. But even if it were just local, they want to break away from having to pay the interconnect fee to Telstra, so they would have their own separate line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the Greens are implacably opposed to any concept of competition, but there is no doubt that this would be of particular benefit in the construction of new premises. At the moment, builders are required to use Telstra to install the cabling right up to the wall socket. If they are allowed to have the network boundary at the wall of the premises, then they can tender it out to whoever they like in the same way that with electricity services you just look up an electrician in the pink pages and away you go. There are already cabling contractors out there who will do this. It is simply a means of making it a competitive market.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SCHACHT" NAMEID="4J4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator Schacht</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is competitive on installation.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is on installation&mdash;and, indeed, on maintenance in a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1935"> separate way. The wall socket is currently the network boundary point for single occupier premises&mdash;residential homes. For multi&hyphen;occupier residences&mdash;apartments, flats, housing commissions and the like&mdash;it is actually the mainframe distribution point, which I think we said yesterday is usually in the basement. What the Greens would like to do is actually change that, regress to the point where it becomes the wall socket. You would then have an obligation imposed on the carrier to provide that service on a monopoly basis right through to the wall socket. That is fundamentally anti-competitive and would be very disruptive of existing arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I heard Senator Margetts mouth something about `if it appears to be more commercially attractive in a few years time', but the fact is that it is more commercially attractive right now. That is why there is such unanimity in the industry and elsewhere&mdash;including amongst consumer groups, who have all participated in these discussions over a number of years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The location of the network boundary has been subject to extensive public consultation, including several times on draft regulations under the current act. While the first socket was a workable interim solution, the telecommunications industry in general has now agreed that the building entry point is the best location, and recent consultation has focused on this definition. Having the boundary at the building entry point will not only increase choice for customers; it will also facilitate greater competition in the provision of cabling services, which will operate to the benefit of the majority of cabling providers, including the majority of CEPU cabling provider members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I probably do not need to spell it out for most members in the chamber, but the benefit of having greater competition in the provision of cabling services is that you will then  have an incentive to provide better service, better quality, lower prices. So that is why there is a very clear benefit to consumers. If you simply have a monopoly regime up to the wall socket, then no-one knows what the true cost of the service is. Telstra is able to effectively disguise it within the monthly rental 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> charge and it can be quite out of line with the true cost of the service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, if it cost you $56 to make that repair call and you were charging a dollar a week, built into your monthly rental call as a carrier, you would be laughing all the way to the bank because in 99 per cent of situations there would never be a need to even have your Telstra tradesperson go out and attend to the call. So for the odd occasion when it might cost you something like $50 you are getting a dollar a month from every consumer in the country who is a subscriber to Telstra. So Telstra is making a very substantial profit on this arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not complaining but they would like it to be more competitive because that enables them to get prices down and it improves the work practices by enabling independent contractors and cabling providers to offer their services. That is why you are seeing a number of cable contractors springing up around the country. No doubt there will be a lot more if we continue down this path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Regulations may be made so that the boundary in any particular case may be moved in either direction, back towards the core network or further into the customer's building, by agreement between the customer and a carrier or carriage service provider. There are  very significant benefits at all levels of installation and maintenance, both for residential consumers and for building contractors. Of course, the prices they have to pay are reflected in the cost they pass on to purchasers and, ultimately, consumers of telecommunications services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are, I think, a number of ways in which this benefits the industry, and the very fact, as I say, that it has been quite uncontentious tells you a great deal about the efficacy of these arrangements. Apart from a few marginal interests&mdash;they have not been in any way evident in the debate to date, so I am not sure who the Greens are reflecting in this&mdash;the fact is that industry, consumer groups, carriers, everyone else in the debate, have canvassed these issues over a number of years and that is why it is no longer a contentious issue. </PARA>

I am getting representations&mdash;and I don't know why they are not contacting the minister&mdash;from a number of people who are very unhappy about the process. People found that they had very little time to prepare their submissions and they felt that their ability to deal with such details was limited.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question to you, Minister, is: have there been contacts to your office showing concern about the process and indicating that these kinds of issues were very difficult to deal with under the process that was put forward, because of the lack of time and because the groups were told they had to come up with amendments? The 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> groups were told they had to come to the process with proposed amendments. The average consumer group, especially if it is underfunded, does not necessarily have a parliamentary draftsperson, or person with that ability, so people found it very difficult. If you have had no contacts at all, fine. Perhaps it is just our office. I will check with my office and ask them to give a list of the types of people and the groups who are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>

Perhaps I will come back later and tell you which groups, apart from a few marginal Greens, are concerned about the process. I don't think we can brush people off. Even if just one group has expressed concern, there is certainly not unanimity. I believe it has been the case during the whole Telstra debate that the people who are quite underresourced as consumer advocates&mdash;not necessarily the big commercial players&mdash;find it very difficult to participate in the process in the way that suits governments and sometimes in the way that suits major parties. I would like the minister to reconsider whether he is representing the interests of industry only or indeed representing unanimity among consumer groups. Let us include community groups in that category, because they are consumers as well. Are you standing by your term `unanimity'?</PARA></SPEECH>

That is because this issue has been kicked around over the years, and it has reached the point now where it is the conventional wisdom. We are not representing carriers' interests here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, this morning we have some more precise information from you that, for the opposition, has assuaged some of the concerns we raised in the quicksand of the discussion last night about who owned the cable and those sorts of issues. Those issues have now been clarified. If Telstra has put it in to the socket, it is their property and, if they want to sublease it to someone else, that is their decision. Now that I have got that clear, that is one issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next issue you have clarified is this. I have had a chance overnight to look at the act. It is very true that, under the existing act, on page 10, in section 6, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> An end facility is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a main distribution frame; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a telephone socket. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1939">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, clearly, Senator Margetts is correct in that, since 1991&mdash;you may argue whether that was a correct decision anyway&mdash;this act came in for multiple strata title buildings and multiple tenanted buildings where the mainframe somewhere in the basement was the end system. That is what the minister is continuing with in the draft. I do not think it is possible to go back and say that the socket, anywhere in a strata title building of 150 apartments, now goes back to being the end of the network. I think if it has been there since 1991&mdash;I have to say, in a Labor government piece of legislation&mdash;it would be a bit hypocritical to say that you have got to go back and change the network. But it does come down to the telephone socket, which is clearly, for the individual consumer in Adelaide Torrens title houses, I suppose, where there is concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister quite rightly has put his finger on the fact that a lot of consumers in Australia are not great devotees of the theory of competition policy as we would argue it here in the parliament. They just want the telephone system to work. They want to know that, if there is a fault, they can get it fixed without a frustrating series of phone calls. I also have to say that, over the last six or seven years, because of the significant improvement in Telstra's service performance, people are now, by and large, much happier. Even though it could be argued that, in competition, the price of the local telephone call could be at 20c rather than 25c, I think ordinary Australian consumers have been delighted that it has not gone up for what is now nearly a decade, because of the price capping and the arrangements and the pressure parliament has put on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consumers will also see that obviously, by not increasing the cost, even by inflation, the local telephone call has got cheaper in Australia. That is good for consumers. The argument of the aficionados may be that, with the full infrastructure competition that Optus is supposedly providing with their cable roll out, prices could get down to 18c, 19c or 20c. Maybe. But I think consumers want to balance the convenience of knowing that, if something goes wrong, the process of getting 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it fixed can be undertaken by just one phone call. I think that really is important and they are balancing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I am more than happy for you to adjourn this discussion. If you want to put in an amendment about consumer choice, I would say that that would, I think&mdash;along with the answers you have already given&mdash;assuage most of the concerns that we were raising last night. The opposition is happy to have this item adjourned while an appropriate amendment is drafted by the minister's advisers to go into the bill. I think that would be useful. I cannot speak for other parties, but that would be a reasonable compromise. Certainly, on the basis of the opposition's involvement in the process of the committee stage of this bill, I think that would be a useful compromise.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add a few points to Senator Schacht's comments about this issue. I would like to raise two issues. Firstly, the 1991 definition, obviously, as we have heard, did specify that mainframe connection point or point of entry. The new definition tightens it up, but there is no doubt that the old definition excluded that two socket in those large structures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is something else that we also need to consider, and I would ask you, Minister, to make a comment on this. I believe that we are now moving into a totally different context because we are introducing a new deregulatory regime. What impact does that have upon the regulations as they were? For what purpose is it necessary to redefine yet again exactly what that building entry point is? By virtue of the fact that it was in the previous act, in your amendments you are attempting to redefine it yet again. If we are looking at a logical flow and things not changing too dramatically, why is it being redefined? Also, what is different about the deregulatory regime that might be the motivation for redefining that entry point definition?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one other thing I would ask you respond to, Minister. Given that we have already established the ownership of that last few feet or metres, or however long it is&mdash;I will have to describe a hypothetical situation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1940"> here&mdash;if you have a carrier who provides a cable to a point of entry under your proposed definition and that carrier, to provide the service required by the consumer, also installs additional line from that point of entry to the socket, to get the bandwidth or whatever, under the act, because the network is only limited to that point of entry, does that affect the universal service obligation of the carrier to provide maintenance to that subsequent section of line? How does that definition of point of entry affect the maintenance and upkeep of the line from that point to the socket, both with respect to the USO and generally?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is true; it is not just for multi-occupied. I suppose the point really is that where there are big buildings&mdash;many units, apartments and the like&mdash;there is much more opportunity because there is a lot more cost involved in actually putting the telephone lines into each flat. The builder will then have the opportunity to get competitive tenders rather than having to take the single carrier right up to the wall socket. So it will make quite a difference at that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will also make a difference to consumers in that they will have the opportunity to choose whether they simply stay with the carrier that they subscribe to, and those carriers would accept responsibility for maintenance either on a bundled or unbundled basis, or they could opt to take responsibility themselves. That is why the idea of allowing them the choice is ultimately the way to go. You might choose to self-insure on the basis

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, I have a question on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1941"> this issue of maintenance. In looking at your drafting of these amendments, I think there would be a lot of concern with the fact that, whichever carrier the resident or subscriber chooses, that automatically means that unless they decide otherwise that carrier is responsible for the maintenance through to that unit or to the house. So it means that, if something goes wrong with the phone and the consumer is a subscriber to Optus, they ring Optus and Optus has to take on the job of checking that the phone line through the system into the unit to what is still called the socket is actually being covered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the consumer can make an arrangement when they take on a carrier, whichever one it is&mdash;and they are changing carriers for commercial reasons and better price&mdash;that automatically means that, unless they agree to reach a separate arrangement with the particular consumer, that carrier takes on the obligation, in accepting the provision of the service, to fix it up if it breaks down. If they want to go and use a subcontractor or make arrangements with the landlord, that is their business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am really after is that the consumers know that, if they make one phone call, they are not going to be switched backwards and forwards between the landlord, the electrical contractor and the carrier. So the subscriber needs to know who the carrier is for that line. If it is Telstra who has leased it out to Optus, if there is a change, Optus takes on the responsibility to get the line fixed through to the socket. If you can put that into the amendment, I think that will cover a lot of consumer concern. People will know where to ring to get that fixed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are just three points I want to quickly make. Firstly, I draw the attention of the Senate to our amendments Nos 3 through to 6, which we were going to withdraw on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> basis that we were happy with the Greens' amendments. However, one advantage with our amendments is that they, in fact, deal with this question of main distribution frame and/or telephone sockets, so that is spelt out there. So it could be that we would perhaps substitute these amendments for the Greens' amendments and that would solve the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I indicate that the Democrats would support an arrangement whereby consumers were protected. I think that this uncertainty has to do with understanding whether people who remain Telstra customers would be required to enter into some sort of maintenance agreement with them. I think that is the basis of the concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, I want to draw quickly on the submission made by the CEPU. The Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) talks about this opening up competition for new buildings. The CEPU said that communications installation industries have grown rapidly since liberalisations of 1989. A recent survey suggested there are now more than 10,000 businesses carrying out such installation work, and work in domestic premises is on the increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, there has been an increase in the number of Austel cabling licences over the period&mdash;most of which would appear to be from the non-carrier sector. In Telstra, employees now account for only about one-third of the 34,000 licence holders. So, Minister, I suggest to you that these figures do not suggest that this sector of the industry has been in any way constrained in terms of competition by the current regulations.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply say that I think Senator Allison is making the point that competition is actually working very well. That is why I think unions like the CEPU are much less unenthusiastic about these sorts of changes than they might have been a few years ago. They are recognising that cabling licensers and cablers are springing up all over the place, that the system is working effectively and it is providing choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1942">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with the Democrats' amendment is that under the current regime&mdash;I acknowledge the point that it does not go where the Greens would want to go in terms of taking the point from the MDF back to the wall socket&mdash;it does remove the regulation making power which contains a number of discretions to deal with particular situations and would impose a very rigid formula. At the end of the day I have no doubt that we would oppose both of those series of amendments. Therefore, we ask that the chamber agree on the voices, that we delay further consideration of both sets of amendments until a later hour this day.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I may just take the time to explain our amendments. Amendment 4 refers to the public interest test that is used by the Australian Communications Authority when considering industry codes. It replaces the current narrow definition with a broader one. This amendment will broaden the definition of public interest which must be considered by the Australian Communications Authority when considering industry codes. Currently, the only explicit definition is `(d) the public interest in having competition in markets'. People have heard me express concern about that very narrow definition. It is inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The telecommunication service is an extremely important one for all Australians. For the elderly and infirm, it can also be a critical service for their safety and wellbeing. Public interest must be the overriding consideration in determining codes of practice for industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our amendment 5 is to extend the definition of the universal service area to cover non&hyphen;geographically defined loss&hyphen;making services that constitute a public benefit. This     was supported by the standard telephone service review. What this means is that a designated service area could include things such as individual pay phones. As an example, a pay phone in a disadvantaged area of Sydney may operate at a loss, but be heavily relied upon by local residents who might not otherwise be able to afford a telephone service in their homes. As such, it should be declared a universal service area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government takes the view that the USO was originally, and I think it is still, designed to enable net cost areas&mdash;in other words, areas where it would otherwise be commercially unaffordable to provide services&mdash;to receive services and products. They are effectively cross&hyphen;subsidised from other geographic areas where it is very commercially 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> profitable to provide those services. So it has also always been done on a geographic basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The act does currently allow for a calculation in respect of services or products to be done within particular geographic areas. Part of our wider approach, particularly in terms of making the whole system more flexible and enabling more than one universal service provider to provide these services, is that you need to do it on a geographic basis. Otherwise, if you do it on a national basis&mdash;or as you would put it, without regard to geographic area&mdash;you will simply ensure that there is only one universal service provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think that your concerns about calculations relating to services and products are already met. What you are really trying to achieve is to do away with the notion that you might have a range of different universal service providers between different geographic areas. If you remove that geographic nexus, you will simply not be able to have that sort of competition. If you want to cost losses on a service or product&hyphen;line basis, you still need to be able to do so within a geographic framework and that is really why the service area concept is provided for in the legislation. That allows product&hyphen;line costing for a particular service, but you might also want to have multiple providers serving different geographic service areas.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Clause 115 sets out the matters that the ACA needs to be satisfied with before it registers a code. Paragraph (g) requires the ACCC not to object to the code. This is inconsistent with the role of the ACCC in other areas, including industry standards, and with the roles of the TIO and the Privacy Commissioner. The ACCC has effective powers under the Trade Practices Act to address any anti-competitive concerns it may have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats' minority report recommended that there be a requirement for consumers to be involved in the development of codes. Amendment No. 50 achieves this by inserting a new subclause. Government amendment No. 61 amends clause 131A which provides that, before determining, varying or revoking an industry standard, the ACA must consult at least one body or association that represents the interests of consumers. This provision is intended to ensure that consumer representatives are involved in the earliest stages of standard development.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments relate to the government's amendments which seek to increase consumer consultation when the Australian Communication Authority considers industry codes and standards and when the Australian Communication Authority determines, varies or revokes an industry standard. On the surface, these new amendments by the government seem to be a reasonable attempt to address the concern that many consumer groups will not be properly consulted by the ACA on industry codes and standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But a fairly short time ago during this debate we saw that the minister himself can be very dismissive of groups that might not have his own viewpoints, or might not speak out on them at the right time, or whatever. He has been very dismissive of a number of concerns. So the wording is suspect. It states that the ACA must consult at least one body or association that represents the interests of consumers. Why only one? We are suspicious that `at least one' will in effect mean `only one'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can the ACA be sure that any one consumer organisation is truly representative of consumer concerns? Perhaps this might just mean that the government has a chance to pick and choose and might get a tame one. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Surely it would want to consult all consumer organisations so as to get as much information and as many perspectives as possible. We are also concerned that the wording of these government amendments could be used to exclude consumer organisations that are seen as troublesome or radical. Our amendments remove the wording while retaining the intent of the government amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the standard telephone service report we appointed representatives from both the ACA and CTN. That, I think, establishes our bona fides and our determination to ensure that consumer views are taken fully into account. I certainly was not attempting to suggest that consumer groups had not been following the debate closely or have not put views  forward. I am simply trying to indicate to you that, apart from you raising the issues here, very little concern has been expressed over a period of years about the whole notion of network boundary other than in general terms. That is the sort of stock&hyphen;in&hyphen;trade that you have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1953"> thrived on for years. That is how Senator Allison earns a living: by basically getting up and raising concerns, doing a bit of hand wringing and sitting down again. You do not actually address a specific amendment or look at how the situation might be improved.</PARA>

You would simply never know whether you had fully complied with that obligation. I suppose it would even be possible to get an injunction to restrain the ACA or the government from proceeding with legislation because it had not properly complied with the requirement to consult every conceivable body and association that might represent the interests of consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of this amendment will be to enable carriers and service providers to escape their obligations under industry codes in the standards regime. It would certainly make the codes and standards scheme unworkable. As I say, there is every intention to ensure that consumers' views are taken into account&mdash;for the obvious reason that, unless that is done, justifiable criticism is invited. At the end of the day, it is the consumers whose benefits ought to be paramount in all of these reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there are those who would like to suggest that this is being done for some conspiratorial reason to benefit carriers or other parties. It all flows through to consumer benefits and, if you do not justify it on that basis, then you do not embark on changes. But consumer interests are what we have absolutely in mind as our paramount consideration. We very much want all of the regulatory bodies to ensure that they are fully aware of consumer views. An amendment as open&hyphen;ended and as wide ranging as that could simply never be satisfied if it were treated strictly on its wording.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite extraordinary that there does not seem to be the same restrictions in decisions about industry involvement. In fact, in relation to a number of codes, industry in general has a power of veto&mdash;the ability to object. There are no restrictions that I know of about who can speak for industry. So it seems to me there is a line in the sand which says that we can pick consumer groups but for industry groups it is come one, come all. Why don't you have that concern about an industry group, which has specific interests, when you are worried about consumer groups having the ability to approach the government and maybe the right to be heard?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consumer groups, I would contend, represent a far wider number of people than some industry groups and some industries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely; I would be into it&mdash;and so would the Greens, the Australian Democrats and the community. Clearly the ACA would be mugs to fall into a situation where, say, the Oonagalabi Consumers Association, which consisted of three people, was the one being consistently consulted, because that would be apparent in a transparent process and it would destroy their own credibility. It would also be a matter of great controversy because there are a range of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1954"> legitimate consumer groups with an interest in telecommunications besides the Australian Consumers Association, CTN and so on. They would certainly jump up and down about the fact that they were not being consulted in the process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public process will keep the government and particularly the ACA honest. If it turns out that Senator Margetts's cynicism<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> and suspicion are correct, she would find all of us in here giving the government a good kick, which would be an embarrassment to the government of the day and a particular embarrassment to the ACA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the ACA would have the wit to send material to the half a dozen or dozen reasonable consumer organisations that they have on their list of organisations that have an interest in telecommunications and to ask them to respond to it. I also hope they would have the wit to, in their annual report to parliament, comment on the number of consumer organisations they have consulted as part of their reviews and drawing up industry codes et cetera. That would be another part of the debate and transparent process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All in all, I think the process will keep the government and the ACA honest irrespective of how we define the number of associations. If we accept the Greens' amendment we could easily end up with a list that is as long as a piece of elastic&mdash;that is, it keeps stretching&mdash;because a group could start up at the last moment and say that they as a consumer association were not consulted. I think about half a dozen mainstream consumer groups with different views will consistently be involved in this area. I also hope that at a later stage in this debate the government can see the wisdom of making sure that proper funding is available to these consumer groups so that they can be healthy and vigorous parts of the telecommunications process.</PARA>

This appears to be on the basis that the amendments may result in increases of expenditure from the universal service reserve established by the bill. The amendments, however, do not directly affect expenditure from the reserve. The first amendment authorises a making of regulations to specify certain kinds of equipment and if regulations are made to specify that equipment this may result in increased expenditure from the reserve.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other amendments would authorise the Australian Communications Authority to exercise powers which, if exercised in a particular way, may result in increased expenditure from the reserve. The Senate has always treated amendments which merely empower the making of decisions which may affect expenditure as not requiring requests. A resolution of the Senate in 1981 declared that those types of amendments do not require requests. In any case, there is no money appropriated by the bill for the purposes of the reserve. The amendments will therefore be treated as amendments.</PARA></INTERJECT></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of this amendment is to introduce a clearly defined policy in the USO for payphone siting. Although such a policy is a crucial consumer safeguard for the new competitive environment, it is notably absent from the bill. While carriers may be willing to supply payphones in areas which are profit making or at least revenue neutral, they are not eager to supply, maintain or operate unprofitable ones. Currently, the issue of payphone siting density to comply with the universal service obligation to make payphones accessible to all Australians is a matter only for Telstra as the sole USO provider.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1956">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is notable, however, as revealed by the report of the standard telephone service review group, that Telstra's universal service obligation policy for payphone compliance happens to be a confidential document. Yet it is this document which addresses the arrangement for siting payphones in places such as remote Aboriginal communities. Clearly, such arrangements cannot be allowed to continue in the new environment. None of the carriers operating in a competitive environment will voluntarily want to operate and maintain loss making payphones, even if they are included in the USO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only way we can ensure they are provided as required and in accordance with the USO is to have a clearly defined policy. This was the finding and the view of the STS review group. A recommendation of their report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure public payphone siting is responsive to community needs in a multi&hyphen;carrier environment, a publicly available payphone siting policy should be developed as a code of practice by the industry in consultation with consumers and users.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">We also indicate that we will be opposing clauses 148, 150 and 151. The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that Telstra as the national carrier, which is still largely owned by the Australian public, remains the national universal service provider. It is our view that such arrangements should prevail whilst Telstra is in public ownership. If Telstra is one day fully privatised, then this policy should be reconsidered, but it is our view that that should not happen until then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposal for tendering out of the USO stems from the assumption that other carriers may be able to provide the USO services, either nationally or regionally, more efficiently than Telstra. But the only way this is likely is through selecting a company which relies on cheaper labour rates. While the government may see this as appropriate, the Democrats do not believe it is wise policy to undermine the position of a substantially publicly owned company which operates nationally through promoting companies relying on cheap labour rates. This is a point I would like to emphasise to the Labor Party. If they vote against this Democrat proposal, then they should be clearly aware of the long-term implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aside from the objective of encouraging reduced wage rates, which I do not put past the government or indeed the opposition, this proposal does not seem to have merit or indeed application in Australia. We already have a national network in place with a penetration rate of over 96 per cent. Duplication of communications infrastructure has been pursued in areas where it has been commercially feasible. It has been recognised as a major policy failure by numerous commentators. Sadly, the government and the opposition have chosen to keep their heads in the sand on this issue and persevere with more of the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hoping to introduce competing infrastructure in areas where it is not commercially viable is simply a further invitation to extend the inefficiencies which the community and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consumers have been burdened with to date. Indeed, as the CEPU has pointed out in its submission, the practical implications of the proposal do not seem to have been thought through. Telstra already supplies services to unprofitable areas. If an alternative universal service provider is selected for a particular region, then what is to occur to the Telstra existing facilities? Are they going to be sold off? What happens to them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is Telstra to continue operating a service at the same time? That is unlikely because if it is unprofitable for a single carrier to provide services, surely it is less profitable for two carriers to do so. By the same token, it is irrational to expect Telstra to act as some sort of reserve national universal service provider, ready to pick up the pieces if a regional or alternative national provider defaults.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the CEPU points out, unless the industry is willing to fund the maintenance of its facilities while they lie idle, Telstra can be expected to withdraw selectively from those areas it is no longer required to service, making the necessary divestments with consequent risks and costs for consumers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is very much opposed to this attempt to wind the clock back. The fact is that since 1991 the Telecommunications Act has allowed for multiple regional universal service providers. What the bill seeks to do is extend that to competition in the product market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the Democrats are violently opposed to competition, but they should at least reflect that this particular measure would take the national relay service away from the Australian Communications Exchange, which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1958"> won the tender fair and square, and give it back to Telstra. Why would you want to do that? In other words, why would you want to remove the capacity for flexibility in the system, where Telstra at the moment might have no choice but to provide a service in a country area and, because they are the universal service provider, there is no incentive for them to carry out that service at a reasonable price and they therefore charge top dollar, you get all sorts of feather&hyphen;bedding, and there is no concern on their part because it is going to be recouped through the universal service levy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you allow tendering to occur, and that is what can happen under the 1991 act, then you provide the opportunity to get much lower tender contracts in place which have to meet the contractual standards. In other words, there is no question of reducing the quality of the universal service obligation, it is simply a matter of whether you can do it more cost&hyphen;effectively. In this day and age, when you are likely to have a plethora of new services emerging, the ability to have multiple national universal service providers provides real and valuable flexibility in selecting who should deliver particular components of the whole USO package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, for example, digital data capability was included in the USO, it may make sense for Panamsat to deliver that by satellite in some parts of Australia, particularly remote areas. You would have Telstra doing the lot, or you would have one universal service provider covering the field. That is completely inflexible. It is not a question of duplication. In a number of regional areas there may only be the ability to cope with one carrier. In other words, it might be the closest thing you get to a natural monopoly these days. It still does not follow that that should be the one company throughout Australia. It may well be that other companies are prepared to tender for that and recoup the subsidy through the universal service levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we are looking at in an open market is much greater differentiation. The whole concept of a USO is to provide a safety net to ensure that people, wherever they live, have the standard telephone service. In that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> way there is no risk as far as the consumer is concerned. What we are talking about here is whether it can be done more cheaply and just as effectively and done through a multiplicity of service providers. I think it can certainly be said that you may well find that one universal service provider specialising in cable based delivery services could provide service in densely populated areas and another specialising in radio or satellite based delivery would provide the same services in less densely populated areas. That is what the marketplace is all about. You have got your safety net in place. If you are violently opposed to competition then, of course, you support this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports the government's position on this. Yes, it is true we put it in the 1991 act, and I believe that there is a case to say that some competition in this area would be useful. I also want to say on behalf of the opposition that we would like to see the proof in the eating of the pudding in terms of this operation of providing competition in the provision of the universal service obligation over the next couple of years. So we reserve our position in accordance with what happens in practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are concerned about is that in one sense Telstra gets it in the neck both ways. It is expected to provide the basic infrastructure across Australia as the dominant carrier. It is expected by the community to do so. As I said before, whatever our theories of competition policy are here in this chamber or between political parties, most Australians, even with partial privatisation, still see Telstra as their carrier and as having to provide that service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Particularly in rural areas, there is recognition that Telstra is the carrier and that so far the other competitors have not shown much interest, other than in a few specific examples, which may well grow, and in one sense I hope that they do. What the opposition is particularly concerned about in regional Australia is that, if there were a large number of non&hyphen;Telstra successes in winning the contract to provide the universal service obligation, that means that there would be a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1959"> winding back of Telstra's infrastructure in regional and rural Australia. There would be further closing down, I suspect, of depots&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="ALSTON" NAMEID="LD4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they could go over. I suspect, though, that that could create some apprehension in the changeover, Minister, and that is one of the concerns in the regional areas. But once Telstra have withdrawn their infrastructure and their skill level and having employees in a regional area, when that contract for the universal service obligation comes up for renewal in two or three years time Telstra may not be interested in even bidding because they will have no infrastructure, or no so&hyphen;called critical mass, left to come back and compete. Therefore you might in effect replace the Telstra monopoly in this area with the successor who gets the contract, and in three or four years time they themselves become the monopoly and start shaving the edges in their favour on the contract.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can say it is still a competitive process, but once you change the structure of Telstra in these areas, I am not sure all the consequences are automatically good. I want to put on notice that the opposition is willing, as we go into this deregulated area, to support this proposition. But I also have to say that we will watch over the next couple of years to see whether there are a large number of successes for it and we reserve our right to revisit the area in the future, as obviously any such areas of this legislation will be reviewed regularly, and there could be subsequent amendments, whoever is in government or opposition. I think the theory is correct&mdash;I do not have any doubt about the theory&mdash;but I think the practice may be a bit different from the theory, and in the end I think the people in regional Australia are more interested in the practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know how many times as shadow minister I have had concerns expressed to me in country towns of a modest size in my own state when the Telstra depot is closed and three employees are transferred back to the city or to a larger centre. Three Telstra incomes in a small town the size of, say, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Pinaroo or Lamaroo is an important economic factor for the rest of the town. Those things are flowing through. It is happening all over Australia. It is not just an initiative of Telstra&mdash;it is banks and everything else&mdash;but that is how the local regional communities see it. I think they are most interested in having the universal service obligation operating reasonably effectively. I do not think they are too much concerned whether it is costing $230 million or $280 million a year so long as they keep a Telstra, a  Telecom or, as you would say, a telecommunications industry presence in the town.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure that the competition will mean that in the end the non&hyphen;Telstra people who may win the competitive contract for that universal service obligation for that particular area will permanently station people in the regional area. I think they will bring contractors in to do whatever they have to do and then take them out. If in their own cost structure they go to a very competitive price, I think they will look at ways of reducing the necessity to have permanent employees of their own in the area. I think that is where the practice is going to be different from the theory as far as regional Australia is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On balance, we are willing to support the government's position. We introduced it in 1991. But I put it here on behalf of the opposition clearly and squarely: if this does not work out in practice, we will want to revisit this issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raised a couple of questions in my opening remarks. They related to the fact that we have no idea what this is about, essentially. The minister tells us it is to increase flexibility and to tender out the USO. What does that mean? Are we talking about the USO for the entire country? Are we talking about regions? Are we talking about municipalities? We still do not know what this means. I raised these questions at the time of the inquiry that we had and did not get any answers. I also raised a couple of questions a moment ago about what would happen to Telstra's existing facilities. Do they just get handed over to somebody else or are they sold? If they are sold, what happens to the revenue? Can Telstra continue to operate the service at the same time? If the government thinks it is unprofitable for a single carrier to provide the services, why does it think that two will somehow do it better?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are only two reasons Senator Allison would not know what is proposed. One is she has not read the 1991 act, and the second is she has not been listening to what has been said in the chamber this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said&mdash;and Senator Schacht immediately responded to it&mdash;the 1991 act allows for regional universal  service providers. For Senator Allison to suggest that she still does not know whether this is a proposal to tender out the universal service provider on a national basis or on a regional basis reflects either a profound incapacity to look at legislation, explanatory memoranda or anything that has been written on the subject or simply an unwillingness to confront the facts. This bill does allow flexibility because it moves from competition in terms of regional to competition in terms of product and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I keep saying, the universal service obligation provides the safety net that ensures that people in those areas still get those services. If you are genuinely interested in consumers, then you ought to be interested in seeing consumers get a better deal, a cheaper deal. I think it is also true to say you cannot have these sorts of debates in isolation. You have to take account of employment consequences and look at the impact, particularly on small regional towns. But be clear that is not a consumer issue. If it were, I think there would be a contradiction in terms. No&hyphen;one would suggest that reducing employment in country areas is somehow detrimental to consumers. It is likely that if there were substantial reductions then they would flow through in reduced prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not suppose anyone can tell precisely what the effect will be in terms of employment levels because it depends upon the level of productivity and the capacity of a new entrant to be able to provide substantially the same services at a much reduced price or by a very different form of technology. I think the challenge in many ways is to look at regional areas on a holistic employment basis and see how governments and others can provide those employment opportunities, but that is quite a different matter from providing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1961"> services and products to consumers. If you are interest in consumers, competition is the vehicle for doing that. If you are interested in protecting jobs, and particularly Telstra jobs, you are talking about a very different animal and that is why I share Senator Schacht's concerns. Obviously, we have to keep a watchful eye on how these things play out. For Senator Allison to suggest that she has got no idea whether this is contemplating competition on a region by region basis or on a product by product basis simply shows that she is not following the debate.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Given that the Senate has not seen fit to proceed down the path of enabling the USO to be tendered out, the Democrats believe that it is essential that safeguards are put in place to ensure that consumers are properly protected. Consumer organisations such as the ACA and the Consumer Telecommunications Network have called for carriers to be required to lodge universal service plans prior to the grant of a tender or selection of a regional universal service provider. In our view, this is just commonsense. How can the government award a tender if it has not seen the carrier's proposed plans? The bill merely states that a selected universal service provider `may' be requested to lodge a plan within three months of being selected. If the draft is not acceptable, the government is required to notify the carrier within an unspecified time and request the carrier to submit another version.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite conceivable that a whole year could roll by before an acceptable plan was lodged&mdash;that is, if one is requested at all. The purpose of these Democrat amendments is therefore to ensure that the universal service plans are lodged and approved prior to a carrier being selected as a regional or national universal service provider. We think this is essential in the interests of consumers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes these amendments as unnecessary and likely to create a regulatory gap. The bill already provides that the minister can require a draft USO plan, as Senator Allison just said, but to require the logic of a draft plan would create unnecessary inflexibility because a selection process need 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1962"> not involve a tender. If a tender process is utilised to select a universal service provider, the tender specification would be expected to set out in detail the USO requirements the successful applicant would be required to meet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, when you call for tenders, you spell out precisely what you want and you do not accept a proposal unless it meets your requirements, so to then turn around and say `you have got the tender' or `you are about to get the tender; we want you to again spell out what you have got in mind' ignores the fact that you have already made it clear what you have in mind. It is an unnecessary duplication. The minister need not employ a selection process to select a universal service provider. There may well need to be negotiations and, at the end of the day, what is important is that whoever tenders is able to comply with the government requirements which will very much address the needs of the universal service obligation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">We now get to an esoteric area called price discrimination, but it actually has a major and profound influence on the charging arrangements for Australian consumers in telecommunications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In moving these amendments, the opposition wishes to achieve the following outcome. We simply want the advantages of competition that will occur, certainly in the competitive markets of the cities, to be available to rural and regional consumers for local calls. We do not want to see what has happened in the petroleum industry, which has been a major complaint for regional people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of competition in the petroleum market in the cities, where discounting takes place on a regular basis, people are able to purchase petrol in the cities which is up to 10c or 15c a litre cheaper than in the regional and rural areas where there is a lot less competition&mdash;even allowing for the cost of transporting the petrol to those regional and rural markets. I think all of us in this place, as well as those at the state parliamentary level, have heard complaints about why country people cannot get cheaper petrol. Competition, a free market, does not work where you have a limited, small market. The petroleum companies are not willing to invest. They see it as a loss area and, therefore, are certainly not keen to reduce prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we think will occur in Australia in the telecommunications local telephone market is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1966"> that&mdash;and competition is already starting to occur but certainly will occur post-July 1&mdash;in the major metropolitan markets, particularly Sydney and Melbourne but also Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, there will be significant competition between Optus and Telstra to start off with on what should be the local call rate. At the moment we all know that Telstra's local call rate across Australia is 25c. Telstra is the only effective carrier operating in what is called the local loop, the local call zone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Optus announced last year that with the roll&hyphen;out of their cable past 20 per cent of Australian homes&mdash;of course, only in the major cities of this country&mdash;they will provide a telephony connection of 20c for a telephone untimed local call if you are in that market. So far, of course, they have had technical problems and cannot get the calls to operate. They may be successful in overcoming those technical problems, but that is their problem, not the parliament's or anybody else's. But, if they do get it to work, there will be a reduction in their charges. Telstra will obviously start responding to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we want to do is make sure that the price reductions for local calls that people in the city get from competition, which will not automatically occur in regional and rural markets, are also available to people in rural and regional areas. Most of us know that a lot of phone calls in the regional areas are actually at a community call rate. That is a variation of an STD rate, but it is a timed call. Just the same, in many rural areas there is an untimed local call in large country towns which is at the 25c rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that, if Telstra drops their price in Sydney to 20c to match Optus, in local call zones across Australia&mdash;where they are now charging 25c&mdash;they should also drop it to 20c. That is the intent of our amendment. I am sure the minister will get up in defence of his position, which is to have a price averaging arrangement which does provide&mdash;and I do not disagree&mdash;some reductions by price averaging into regional Australia. It does not offer the full unambiguous cut that we are offering by putting this proposal forward.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister will raise an issue, which I think we will probably call the Ballarat experience, whereby the council of Ballarat has an agreement with a local niche telco which has come in. It is offering, if you subscribe to pay TV, free untimed local calls for the Ballarat area. That is obviously being offered as a package. On the telephony side, that is a pretty competitive position to be in vis-a-vis what Telstra would be offering. Telstra would have to make, one would imagine, some competitive response. Whether it is a free local call or some other package, I do not know, but that is up to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister may raise that, under my amendment on behalf of the opposition, if Telstra went down and matched the local free call in Ballarat in that local call zone, they will therefore have to offer a free call in all the local call zones in Australia, including Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and the big ones where there are major revenue issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To deal with this issue, I have put in my amendment that the carrier can get exemption. Where you have a bundled price&mdash;as it might well be called&mdash;or a bundled product, the carrier can go to the minister and say, `This is not apples with apples,' in comparing Ballarat's prices with Melbourne. They can say, `It is a bundled price and a local little market,' et cetera. `We have to compete there to protect our market, but it is not the same as going into Sydney or Melbourne.' So there is a discretion for the carrier to seek ministerial discretion to exempt them from the arrangement. I think this is the only fair way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not want to cripple Telstra's prices or its income or its revenue, but we certainly want to make sure that all Australians in regional areas get the same advantages of competition. The minister may well disagree with this and say there will be robust niche competition in lots of regional areas of Australia vis-a-vis the Ballarat experience. I hope in one sense he is right. I am not arguing against that. But I doubt that it will occur in Pinnaroo; I doubt that it will occur in Ceduna in my own state. They will not even have a niche player as they do in Ballarat, which is a city of 60,000 or 70,000 people and is a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1967"> compact area. For most of regional and rural Australia, which will still have local calls, there will be no competition. The prices will not change. They will stay at the standard 25c rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, we believe it is very important that regional Australia get the same advantages of competition. We do not believe that this is going to unnecessarily and adversely affect Telstra's revenue dramatically. We believe, in fact, there will probably be an increase in volume if you reduce the prices. There might be some argument about the elasticity of the market or some economic term, but there is no doubt that, if you reduce prices, you will end up increasing volume by and large. So the revenue will still go up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also no doubt that a lot of people have commented that, with new technological development, the actual cost of making a local call&mdash;if you unbundle all the attachments, unbundle the cabling itself, unbundle the handset at the end&mdash;may be only 1c, 2c or 3c. Some people say that in America it may be down to under 1c. We do not believe that we are making a drastic impact on Telstra's revenues, but we do believe that this is a case, though there is a competitive market, to ensure that the theory of competition is not just for those fortunate enough to be in the city, but is available for local call numbers in all areas of Australia, where you are comparing apples with apples. Therefore, I commend the amendment to the Senate and look toward to the support of the Senate in supporting regional and rural Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats have amendments which are almost identical to the opposition's proposal, except for one significant difference. Where the opposition amendments refer to `eligible customers', the Democrats's amendments simply refer to `customers'. The Democrats believe all Australians should be entitled to untimed local calls, not only those who are eligible. We will be moving amendments to make this possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to deal with the issue of price discrimination. It is our view that prohibiting price discrimination between local call zones is essential if the benefits of competition are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to be equitably shared by all Australians. Allowing for price discrimination will invariably mean, as Senator Schacht has indicated, that residents in high density urban areas, such as Melbourne and Sydney, will benefit at the expense of those who live in rural, regional and remote areas. I do not think anyone is in any doubt about that. Clearly, for residents in such places as Tasmania, where Telstra is the sole carrier, there will be no competitive push for price reductions. The Democrats believe that the way around this is to legislate to ensure that all Australians share the same rights. I expect that the National Party members will want to support these amendments and I will be interested to see if they actually do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority report of the telecommunications bills inquiry, which reflects the views of government senators, was critical of maintaining price discrimination restrictions because it thought it would result in weakened competition, and thereby lessen consumer welfare. Two points need to be raised in response. Firstly, competition between carriers will still be possible. The only difference is that carriers will not be able to price discriminate across local call zones. Secondly, the alternative, as we all know, is that urban and business consumers will benefit substantially while many others will be left behind, potentially even cross-subsidising the former. To overcome the problem of making Telstra the sole carrier forced to avoid price discrimination, our amendments impose this measure on all carriers. This will ensure that Telstra is not unfairly constrained relative to its competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I think it is important to point out that the amendments I am proposing do not lock this position in. We have provided for the minister to review the operation of this within four years.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to underline what my colleague has said. We have a peculiar situation in Queensland, where the National Party spends a lot of time running around Queensland telling everybody that they do not believe in the competition reform bill, which of course they all voted for. The problem is, of course, they never admit that they actually voted for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1968"> what they now say they do not believe in. This is another occasion, I think, where we will find that Senator Ron Boswell and Senator O'Chee will in fact run around Queensland when the effects of this particular measure become obvious in remote and rural Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They will tell everybody, `Isn't it terrible?' and wring their hands and say, `Hilmer's dreadful, competition's not working, our rural constituents are not being served, we really don't like it and we think it's terrible.' But, of course, they will have voted for the exact measure which they tell everybody they do not like. I am underlining what my colleague said, and that is that the National Party must support these amendments. It must support them. If it is going to do what it has been doing&mdash;which in fact is telling lies to Queenslanders about how terrible these measures are&mdash;and does not tell Queenslanders that in fact it has voted for them, I think their hypocrisy will become obvious. I certainly will make sure it becomes obvious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am appealing to the National Party not to make hypocrites of themselves, to support what they are telling everybody in Queensland and, I suppose, in other states as well, and to vote for these amendments. If not, then we will certainly make sure that Queenslanders know that what they say and how the vote are quite different.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought it might be useful, as there are more amendments, to point out that in our amendment we make it not just Telstra; it is all carriage service providers. So when Optus is spreading its competition around, they also are bound by these amendments. It is not picking on Telstra; it is all carriage service providers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wanted to point out that, like so many in telecommunications do, we do not claim to be oracles and know where it is going to end up in a couple of years. That is why, as part of the amendment, we have included a review of the operation of this so that, before 1 July 2000, the minister has to conduct a review of the operation of this division and table a report in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that this will work properly to the advantage of rural and regional Australia. However, I concede that, with developments in technology and the competition arrangements, other things may occur which need to be looked at. I accept that one should not be an absolutist in much of the telecommunications area. Those of us who have been absolutists in the past have usually had egg on our face some six months later. I admit to being one of those in the past. I am much more cautious now than I was as a backbencher in the early 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even if the minister's amendment gets up&mdash;and I hope it does not&mdash;I think a review in this area would be a very beneficial process because issues will arise from the arguments, whether they are from carriers, the community or whoever.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of great concern that Senator Allison, in particular, spent all of 90 seconds on the merits of what is clearly a very important issue, and Senator Woodley tried to play what he thinks is a political card by suggesting that somehow the National Party ought to acknowledge that this is going to be contrary to the interests of consumers in rural areas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. It you have a system that says that you have to charge the same price across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board, then if Telstra wanted to offer a 15c local call in Sydney, that requirement would have to be extended across Australia. The end result of that would be that Telstra would not contemplate offering a 15c local call. It would offer a marginal reduction which was affordable across Australia. All right?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What would the competitor do? The competitor is bound by the same rules so, if Telstra goes down to 23c, the competitor would go down to 22c, and that is where it would sit. There are no significant benefits from competition. Instead of having vigorous competition in some areas, which can then flow on in terms of a weighted average cost price, it would simply ensure that effectively there would be a cosy duopoly arrangement. There would be enormous constraints and it would be unaffordable for carriers to offer significant reductions because they would have to offer them across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board, and they simply would not do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The carriers do not like our approach because it does not allow unfettered competition. It does not allow price differentiation in one area not to flow on to another. That is why we have accepted the recommendation of the report of the majority of the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communication and the Arts References Committee which proposed a weighted average pricing mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That mechanism will ensure that those in country areas get the substantial benefits of the price reductions that are achieved else

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should not be assumed in this whole debate that there are going to be large parts of Australia that will not get the benefits of competition. The Ballarat example, as Senator Schacht calls it, will be reflected in many parts of Australia. Indeed, as a result of the changes to the telecommunications regime in the United States, towns with as few as 500 people are now getting the benefits of competitive telephony and cable television services because carriers are able to pick and choose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A weighted average mechanism ensures that a significant part of those benefits flows on. However, if you are determined to chill competition in this way, it will effectively ensure that there will be no significant price competition in Australia. In other words, it will probably undermine in one fell swoop one of the biggest opportunities there is to achieve significant price reductions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The carriers do not like our proposal, but I can assure you that the industry will be absolutely aghast, so will consumers and so will those in rural areas, if the opposition amendments get up, because there will no longer be the opportunity for significant price reductions, either in the cities or in the bush, because the carriers will not be able to afford to offer significant price reductions in the city, and therefore there will be nothing to pass on to the bush.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If significant price reductions are achieved in city areas, with bodies such as the World Exchange talking about 15c local calls and Optus talking about 20c local calls, that will ensure that they cannot afford to offer those sorts of discounts any more because it has to be replicated across Australia. The fact that both the Labor Party and the Democrats see the need to insert a review clause shows a high degree of nervousness&mdash;</PARA>

You ought to be constantly prepared to review your position. You ought to constantly want to see how it plays out in practice. We would do that as a government, and I hope you would do it too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But to put in place a highly inflexible arrangement&mdash;the ultimate in inflexibility&mdash;is tantamount to ensuring that competition outside the city areas will be stillborn. Northgate are just one small example. Northgate would be hoping that they will be competing in a number of other regional areas. I think they have nominated 40 in the first instance. They will not be the only ones. You have people like Austar, Paynet and Rocom offering cable services. There is no reason why you would not expect a significant number of niche players to come in and provide telephony services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But they will do it in accordance with the requirements of the local market, depending upon who is there. If it is a local player offering the service, then they will want to be able to compete against that local player. But, if they are a national company, they will not have the capacity to do that because they then automatically have to offer the same price all around Australia. So there will be no opportunity to go in and target a particular market; no opportunity to compete against the local entity. The great virtue of having a weighted cost average scheme is that where you do achieve significant price reductions they are then built in and flow on to those areas where you do not have competition in the first instance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. It is critically important to understand that you will actually benefit consumers in rural areas if you allow them to get the flow-on effect of a significant price reduction in the city areas. You will not achieve that if you simply have this uniform price proposal, because any carrier contemplating offering a significant discount will stop short and say, `But hang on; we're not just talking about whether we can beat Northgate in Ballarat or whether we can compete with Optus in Rockhampton, because the minute we offer a reduced local call price we have to offer it around Australia.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an entirely different ball game. It means that you suddenly have to be completely reassessing your business plan. You know instinctively what the consequences will be, because any form of price reduction has enormous flow-on effects. So the end result is that you will not be able to offer any significant price reductions. That is the vice of this whole scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Far from the Senator Woodleys of this world trying to pretend superficially that it is not going to help the bush, it will very substantially benefit the bush. It will make sure 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that people in rural areas get the benefits of significant price reductions in city areas that would not otherwise be affordable, as far as the carriers are concerned. In an open market, a prohibition on price differentiation will severely inhibit the emergence of additional competition in local call markets. For example, Telstra will be unable or unwilling to respond to competition in a particular localised market because of the revenue effects of having to drop prices across the board.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The carriers do not like a weighted average scheme. But I tell you what: it probably suits the purposes of the incumbent because they are about the only ones who can afford to offer price reductions across the board; but they will be very modest price reductions. To suggest that a fledgling company, in relative terms, like Optus could come into the market and decide that there is an area where they can really compete and then to tell them that it has to be delivered across the board is once again ensuring that Optus cannot afford to do it&mdash;and they will not; nor will any other company coming into the marketplace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They do not come in and treat Australia as one big market. You know what is happening with competition. People are constantly revising their markets, wanting to target particular areas, assessing the competition, meeting it accordingly. You are ensuring none of that happens. You are ensuring that people can have only a national approach to a whole issue. That is the death of competition, the death of the prospect of significant price reductions in city areas and the death of any ability for those to flow on to rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will be ensuring that there are very modest price reductions in capital cities and of course in country areas because you have the same modest price across the board. Under ours we will get very significant price reductions in the city areas because carriers will be able to offer in Brisbane a 15c local call and in Sydney an 18c local call. When we average that out we are well below the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1972"> 23c call that we would have across the board. So all those rural areas will get the benefit of that average price. They will be looking at something like a 20c call.</PARA>

So the combination of the 15c call in Brisbane and the 18c call in Sydney means we will get something like 20c in the bush. Otherwise, all we will get is a 23c call across the board, so the bush would be 3c worse off for every local call.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus piece of legislation, amending quite a number of other pieces of legislation. I want to very briefly go to one amendment that is made in this bill to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a great deal of concern expressed quite justifiably about child pornography. There has been a considerable upsurge in this concern, particularly in New South Wales where teachers have been accused of taking advantage of young female students. I might mention while I am on my feet that there is a draft criminal code, as would be known by the Senate, that deals with the question of the age of consent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that in Western Australia there is legislation which makes it an offence for persons in authority to engage in sexual activities with persons who are minors, that is to say under the age of 18. But in fact the draft criminal code is actually suggesting that there be a uniform code which proposes to suggest to the state that that be overridden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have of course noted this and have asked whether the government of New South Wales, which is proposing draft guidelines to cover 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1975"> the sexual abuse of children by teachers, has been consulted in relation to the issue of consent as dealt with under the draft criminal code and whether state governments have agreed that it is appropriate for the law to allow teachers to presume on consent to sexual acts of any kind by children under their care once those children have reached the age of 16 years. That is precisely what the draft code is proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am speaking on a piece of legislation which deals with this question in respect of child pornography. I will have something further to say in the committee stage of this bill but I thought I would set the scene by indicating to the Senate that there are behind the scene moves which will affect and, I believe, put at risk female students particularly who are under some sort of authority, including authority of teachers. It seems to me quite unbelievable that this suggestion should be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am waiting and I will be very interested to hear the response from the Attorney-General's Department to my questions that I asked some time ago in the additional estimates. I hope those responses are forthcoming pretty soon so we can have a look at them, not only in respect of that matter but of a number of other matters as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now come to the question of what the bill is proposing to do in respect of the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Act 1995. I have agreed that this bill be  treated as a non-controversial piece of legislation because at least the amendments that are being proposed are, might I say, a very belated improvement in this particular area. I think the fault largely lies with the advice that the government is given by the Office of Film and Literature Classification.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards there has been considerable concern expressed over many years about the loopholes that are in the guidelines and have been in the guidelines for some considerable time in respect of these matters; that is to say in respect of how people, young people particularly, are portrayed in so-called consensual sex videos in the R or X category. I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> can remember raising this particular matter maybe 10 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising, I might say, that the Office of Film and Literature Classification and its predecessor the Film Censorship Board have been laggard in a number of these areas. I am not pointing to this particular area at all but we only have to remember who was the deputy chief censor. None other than David Haines. He left the office of deputy chief censor and went as a hired gun to the X&hyphen;rated video industry. He jumped immediately from the office of deputy chief censor to being a hired gun for that organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is it any wonder that not only the government but the community have problems in this area and have had them for some time? It was interesting to hear this morning that he was interviewed by ABC Radio National which referred to him as the former deputy chief censor of the Film Censorship Board and did not advert to the fact that he is now the hired gun for the X&hyphen;rated video industry, for the Eros Foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to refer to the amendment again by saying that it is an improvement. The amendment, as I said, is designed to tighten the child pornography criterion by making it easier for the board to deal with the material where it is difficult to determine the age of the person portrayed. Precisely, and I have been saying that for 10 years. This is in response to difficulties experienced in some cases in determining the precise age of children in the 15&hyphen;, 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year age bracket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current criterion says, `A minor who is or appears to be under 16.' The video would be refused classification if it involves a minor who is or who appears to be under 16. With this legislation that is to be changed to say, `A person who is or looks like a child under 16.' That provision provides for a refusal to approve advertisements on the grounds that the content depicts or describes, in a way that is likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult, a person who is or who looks like a child under 16, whether or not the person is engaged in sexual activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an improvement. It does away with the word `minor'. It makes what it says far more clear&mdash;that is, `a person who is or looks like 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1976"> a child under 16.' I have seen X&hyphen;rated videos, and some in the R classification, where you have a situation where the person is made up to look like a student of 16 or 17. This improvement puts into the child pornography bucket, if you like, persons who are 15 or younger.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what about the exploitative videos that deal with persons who may not be minors? They might be 18. But in these particular films they are dolled up to look like 16&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. What about them? We have had evidence to our committee that these particular videos are often hired by a person and looked at with the young person who will be the victim or who will be taken advantage of by that other person. That person puts on the video and it has a disinhibition effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is about time we had a good look at this and a good look at what is happening. I know that the age of consent has been 16 for many years. It goes back to when girls married younger. It goes back to the last century, really. But we are in a different ball game here, are we not? We are in a ball game where people are in an uproar about teachers taking advantage of young students. Oh, yes, they may not be under 15; they may be 16- and 17-year&hyphen;olds. What are we doing in the classification of publications area? Are we allowing these publications to treat 16- and 17-year&hyphen;olds in a manner that would be demeaning and would cause offence to a reasonable adult person?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I apologise for speaking longer than I believed I would, but when I saw this yesterday I believed that it was necessary to raise it. Consequently I have raised it in this second reading stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports this legislation. It is a bill that implements a number of the recommendations of the 1993 report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Checking the cash</EMPHASIS> . In particular, it implements recommendations 12, 15, 16, 18 and the recommendation requiring bullion sellers to identify customers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, we are picking up the recommendations of a committee which was established under the previous government. They are recommendations which ensure access to financial transaction report information by state and territory authorities, recommendations clarifying the definition of `transaction', recommendations relating to inadmissibility of suspect transaction report information, as well as recommendation 18 increasing the reporting threshold for certain transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill does a bit more than that. It also introduces significant cash transaction reporting by solicitors. It consolidates AUSTRAC's powers of inspection and access to records, updates the penalty provisions, updates specified provisions and corrects minor drafting errors. These are initiatives that were generated under the previous government so that, of course, in opposition we would not oppose them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two issues that are worthy of further note. Firstly, the Senate committee did raise concern about the appropriateness of privacy protection if the financial transaction report information was provided to state and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> territory authorities. This bill requires authorities to comply with the privacy principles as set out in the Privacy Act 1988, section 14 thereof, and those principles have to be complied with in order to access information. That is provided for in this particular bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also makes it an offence for an officer of a revenue authority to improperly disclose information. I think those two measures together go a long way, if not fully, towards satisfying the concerns of the Senate committee. They do satisfy our concerns from this side of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the bill extends the application of suspect transaction reporting to solicitors. This is a measure that was supported by the previous Minister for Justice, Mr Duncan Kerr, and he announced that a Labor government would introduce similar changes, changes flowing from recommendations of the Costigan royal commission, the National Crime Authority and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, all of which uncovered considerable evidence that solicitors' trust accounts may be being used from time to time to launder the proceeds of crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In raising this particular measure we note that the measures proposed in the bill, whilst not as onerous as those imposed on financial institutions, are a useful means to bring transactions involving solicitors' trust accounts within the purview of AUSTRAC. As I say, we support that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In doing so can I ask the parliamentary secretary to provide the Senate either now, if he is in a position to do so, or at an early date, with information as to whether the Attorney&hyphen;General has received representations from the Law Council of Australia relating to section 15A(1) of the bill before us as it relates to solicitors' accounts, particularly as the section relates to the definition of `transaction' and, as they say significantly, the relevant transaction is not confined to the physical transfer of currency of not less than $10,000 but includes a transaction involving such a physical transfer of currency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Law Council does raise other concerns as well in its representations. If the parliamentary secretary could provide us with infor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1978"> mation as to the status of the Attorney&hyphen;General's response to these representations either today or an at an early date, we would be appreciative of that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must advise the government that they have the strong support of the Australian Democrats for any improvements in the financial transactions area. I was impressed by the previous government's work in this area. I was impressed by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Checking the cash</EMPHASIS>  document. I have been at pains to pay some attention to the views of the National Crime Authority and the Australian Federal Police on these matters, and I have paid attention to some of the international scandals such as that which concerned the BCCI.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my opinion&mdash;and the opinion of many observers in this area&mdash;that the area of financial transactions, particularly given the nature of our computer and information exchange, is one to be assessed with great gravity and great care. The ways in which international criminals, both of the white&hyphen;collar and the black&hyphen;collar kind, use the international banks, the financial institutions and the mechanisms of modern information technology to move their funds around require governments to be extremely vigilant, not just from a point of view of morality, but also from a point of view of protecting their revenue, because it is used most of all as a process for avoiding taxation and for operating in a criminal manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have doubts that this act yet goes far enough. I believe we should continue, and I would urge the government to continue, to adopt best practice in this area and to keep a watching brief with its international counterparts&mdash;which I know it does&mdash;to keep improving it. As smart as we might think we are, it seems that those with evil in their hearts are often a lot smarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I personally am particularly delighted that solicitors are at last caught in the net of reporting. I believe that the profession, if they can be called that, the way in which the legal authorities and bodies have adopted a self&hyphen;serving, mendacious and long successful 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> campaign for exclusion from reporting, is a disgrace. I know a number of outstanding lawyers whom I regard as very moral. But I think that particular campaign was an absolute disgrace. We know within this chamber, as does the wider community, that big crooks use big lawyers; big crooks use big accountants, big valuers and big banks. That is what they need. To at last be caught within the net is an invaluable thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might have smiled when I mentioned that solicitors might no longer be called a profession. One esteemed judge in Western Australia&mdash;not a young judge; one who has been around&mdash;said to me that solicitors have long given up their right to be called a profession. He says they are just a business. Well, they were in the business of cash transactions which ought to have been reported and I am glad to see the government clamping down on them. So my compliments to you, Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney&hyphen;General (Senator Ellison), and to your government on this legislation which advances this cause one more inch forward. Thank you.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, may I thank those senators who have spoken on this matter for their contribution. I thank Senator Murray for his remarks; however, in relation to my former life, I am not so sure that I would adopt all of those remarks, especially in relation to the profession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I might touch on the definition of transaction, the only kind of transaction required to be reported here is a significant cash transaction. That is intended to mean a transfer of currency of not less than $10,000 in value. The significant cash transaction reporting provision is intended to provide intelligence to revenue authorities and law enforcement about the movement of large sums of cash.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs which wrote the report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Checking the cash</EMPHASIS>. In that report it was suggested that solicitors be exempt. Since then&mdash;and that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1979"> was some three years ago&mdash;it has come to light that in 1994&hyphen;95 there were some 2,100 transactions handled by solicitors entailing $42.7 million worth in cash. I think that is a significant matter, such that solicitors should now be brought within the ambit of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reportable details which apply to solicitors are set out in schedule 3A of the bill. The reporting requirement is confined to such matters as names and addresses of the parties to the transaction, the nature of the transaction&mdash;whether it involves a transfer of currency to or from the solicitor&mdash;the date of the transaction and identification information about the party who is not the solicitor. It is really not a requirement that there be any reporting of the subject matter to hand&mdash;that is, the proceedings that are involved or any question of communication between the client and solicitor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some concern about how far the requirement goes for reporting. I would allay any concerns in relation to that. There is no requirement to divulge any information about agreements, contracts, business dealing or the content of professional advice and, in fact, no requirement for any other matter underlying or connected with the currency transfer. Accordingly, there is no legislative authority for AUSTRAC to seek any such information in performing its auditing or compliance function. That function is confined solely to the question of whether or not a relevant person or entity has complied with the specific requirements of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reportable details, as set out in schedule 3A of the bill, proposed to apply to solicitors are similar in scope to those now applying to cash dealers, though they are less onerous in their identification requirements. Similarly, they require no information about business dealings underlying the transfer of currency and, similarly, AUSTRAC could not access such information in the course of performing its audit functions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I might just touch on bankers drafts and cheques, details of the cheque or the bankers draft are required to be reported, and the circumstances, if a transfer of more than $10,000 in cash is accompanied by a cheque 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or bankers draft forming part of that same transfer&mdash;for example, a transfer of $12,000 in cash and a cheque of the sum of $5,000 payable to the solicitor's trust account and drawn by a third party. Because $10,000 or more in cash is involved, that is an amount of cash which is considered large enough to raise a suspicion that its source may involve a criminal enterprise. Its law enforcement value is enhanced by any further information which can be supplied from associated instruments. As in the case of cash dealers, any privacy concerns relating to third parties who may have signed the relevant cheques are considered to be outweighed by the law enforcement interest in providing the best possible intelligence for the fight against major crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to foreign currency transfers, the reason for the difference in reporting transfers of currency which include foreign currency is the possibility that large sums of currency could be withdrawn from institutions for transfer overseas or deposited after being carried through the customs barrier. To date, no institutional body which has reporting obligations under section 7 of the act&mdash;and that is the section which requires cash dealers to report significant cash transactions&mdash;has advised of difficulties presented by having to comply with that provision. It seems that solicitors might be reporting such cash transfers which include foreign currency on a regular basis, and a review of that provision could be appropriate. The reporting period for reportable cash transfers which include foreign currency can be altered by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that the government intends the transactions that are the subject to the bill to have the narrow meaning explained, the meaning of the phrase `day on which the transaction takes place' in subsection 3(1) of the definition of reporting period in the Financial Transaction Reports Act will not be uncertain. Thus the concerns about the meaning of reporting period should be allayed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say that the government is aware that there has been some criticism in the legal profession about these matters but really the enormity of the cash transaction that I have mentioned has pressed the government to take this action. As I say, the bill requires solici 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1980"> tors to report significant cash transactions. As explained in relation to the scope of transaction issue, AUSTRAC's monitoring powers are restricted to auditing compliance of the obligations under the legislation. In relation to solicitors, that means records reflecting reportable cash transfers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the government's intention that the monitoring powers conferred on AUSTRAC by part IVA of the bill be limited to access to the relevant records of the relevant parties to the cash transfer. That is, AUSTRAC will not be at liberty to go through the solicitor's files, as such, and other extraneous material which could be privileged. In this case, the scope of AUSTRAC's access to records in the context of a solicitor's practice is limited by the solicitor&hyphen;client privilege. Its monitoring powers are exercised subject to the common law legal professional privilege. Having placed those comments on record, I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of the very important, fundamental and far reaching change introduced to the superannuation industry in this country by the retirement savings bills before the chamber, I would like to say at the outset that, generally, in respect of the Liberal government's handling of superannuation matters, we have a range of very grave concerns should this legislation&mdash;and, indeed, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> what certainly could be argued as being much more important legislation into the so&hyphen;called surcharge, which we will be dealing with next week&mdash;pass the Senate without major amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is Labor's contention that the legislation that I am speaking about today&mdash;the retirement savings account package&mdash;and the legislation in respect of the new superannuation tax, about which we will obviously have a great deal to say next week&mdash;potentially, if unamended, will cause a dramatic upheaval in the superannuation industry. Indeed, we contend that it will cause massive chaos generally in the superannuation industry in this country, if it goes without substantial amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the legislation that we are considering today, I would like to outline a range of major concerns we have with the concept of retirement savings accounts, as reflected in the detail that we are considering in the bills. I would like to go, firstly, to the commitment that the Liberal and National parties gave, prior to the last election, to provide employees and consumers with broader choice in superannuation. We would contend that the RSA&mdash;retirement savings account&mdash;product fails to meet this commitment. Currently, the bills provide to employers&mdash;and I stress that it is to employers&mdash;the ability to open retirement savings accounts on behalf of employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the bills are currently drafted, there is no requirement for an employee to consent to the opening of an RSA. This is contrary to the requirements of section 153 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, which requires employers to have an employee's signature on the application form before being able to proceed with the opening of an employee's superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to note that, in situations where it is deemed by the commissioner that a substantial period of time has passed, an employer is able to open a superannuation fund on behalf of an employee under section 153 of the SI(S) Act. This situation, however, is only able to occur when the commissioner believes that such a substantial period of time has passed and the employer has undertaken 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1981"> all relevant steps to attempt to get the employee's signature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Due to the product's low rate of return&mdash;and RSAs are a low rate of return product; in fact, the government boasts they are a low rate of return product&mdash;we believe that a government has a critical role to play in ensuring that employees are not trapped in a product that is unsuitable for long&hyphen;term savings. As a consequence of this critical defect in the bills, and in respect of the government's own rhetoric of choice and the imperative to maximise choice, we will be moving amendments to ensure that it is the employee's decision to open an RSA&mdash;not the employer's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area I would like to comment on today concerns, again, a commitment given by the Liberal&hyphen;National party prior to the last election. The coalition's promise states, `Banks, building societies, credit unions, life insurance companies, life offices and superannuation funds would be able to offer RSAs.' Some of you may recall the extensive leaked documentation from Treasury last year in respect to proposals to cabinet on this particular matter. Those leaked cabinet documents to the Treasurer (Mr Costello) made it very clear that superannuation funds should be able to provide RSAs. However, when the Treasurer announced, on 20 August, that RSAs would be offered from 1 July 1997, he omitted to mention&mdash;we believe, deliberately&mdash;that superannuation funds would be able to offer RSAs. Currently the bills as drafted do not allow superannuation funds to offer RSAs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been suggested that the regulations may provide for superannuation funds to offer RSA look&hyphen;alikes. The major issue that needs to be considered is whether the regulations will allow superannuation funds to offer the RSA product or an RSA look&hyphen;alike. If the regulations only allow superannuation funds to provide a look&hyphen;alike product, existing funds may be at a competitive disadvantage as they may not be able to use the name RSA for marketing purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's rhetoric in allowing banks&mdash;in particular, I highlight banks&mdash;building societies and credit unions to provide 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> RSAs is supposedly to implement a level playing field in the superannuation product market. It has been a concern of banks&mdash;I emphasise banks again because we believe that this legislation is largely driven by banks&mdash;for a number of years that allegedly they have been denied access to the superannuation money pool. This is incorrect. They do have substantial access through their wholesale management funds arms and they are particularly successful, I would have to say, in this area. So it is not correct for banks to assert that they do not have access to the superannuation money pool in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor opposition will be moving amendments to ensure that superannuation funds are able to offer RSAs. This would mean that the superannuation funds would be able to provide a deposit style account which is capital guaranteed. By allowing the superannuation funds to compete in the RSA market, this will ensure competitive neutrality and ensure the government matches its own rhetoric with action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that, if superannuation funds are able to offer RSAs, then members' moneys will ultimately be better managed. This will occur due to the fact that the various industry funds and also existing employer in&hyphen;house funds, often forgotten in this debate, have to manage their funds on a trust basis under the sole purpose test which requires fund trustees to manage fund moneys to effect a retirement income for the member.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of fees and charges, I have already emphasised that we believe that this product is driven by the banks. Of course, in dealing with banks with respect to superannuation we should not neglect to mention the issue of fees and charges. The community is all too well aware of the existing level of fees and charges that banks charge. The rhetoric of RSAs is to provide a low cost, simple superannuation account to low income earners, or to provide a low risk product to individuals who are approaching retirement. The Liberal and National parties also believe that RSAs will provide increased competition in the product market, resulting in the driving down of fees and charges.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1982">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at current fees and charges in both industry funds and in&hyphen;house employer funds, the charges range between 80c and $1.20 a week in administrative costs. In fact, many employer in&hyphen;house funds make no charge at all&mdash;the employer picks up the cost. Concerns have been raised regarding the excessive fees and charges that banks already apply to low growth and small amount deposit accounts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the recent additional estimates proceedings, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission was asked whether any government body would be monitoring fees and charges. The ISC responded that, to the best of its knowledge, there would be no monitoring of fees and charges. And here we are opening up a totally new product range to the banks in this country. The Credit Unions Cooperative of Australia gave evidence that their members would not be charging any fees and charges with respect to RSAs. The Australian Bankers Association gave evidence to the Senate committee to the effect that their members would charge fees that would be competitive with current fees and charges levied by general superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further concerns were raised regarding the capital guarantee nature of the product&mdash;that is, the capital guarantee provides that the account cannot be diminished by negative returns or losses. The contractual agreement between the provider and the holder is to return to the holder of the RSA all contributions made to the account. In the event of a bank achieving negative investment returns, these cannot be debited from the holder's account. Notwithstanding this, the product&mdash;as it is currently designed&mdash;does allow banks, building societies or life offices to debit fees, charges and taxes from the holder's account which could result in the account balance being less than the contributions. Labor will be moving amendments to ensure that, as RSAs are a capital guarantee product, the accounts cannot be reduced in any way by fees, charges and taxes, as is the general case with other superannuation products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some banks, particularly the National Australia Bank and ANZ, have announced&mdash;I suppose, from their perspective, quite proper 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ly&mdash;that they want to make a profit by making fees and charges. That is reasonable in that context. But we say it is not proper for banks in particular to make a profit through fees and charges through having the ability to reduce the member's account balance. We will certainly be arguing and moving amendments in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important to remember that superannuation is a different form of saving from that of traditional bank products, due to its compulsory and long&hyphen;term nature. Therefore, it is entirely appropriate with a product of that type, being one of a low rate of return, that the balance is protected from what in the past, with respect to banks, have been excessive fees and charges in some areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next issue I want to turn to is third line forcing. As the bills are currently drafted, an employer is entitled to open an RSA on behalf of an employee without an employee's consent. In some circumstances it may prove beneficial to the employer, not to the employee, to put all their employees into an RSA due to the relationship the employer may have with their bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Bankers Association has agreed that it is normal commercial practice for a bank to provide incentives for employers to engage in relationship banking. In other words, the bank goes to the employer and says, `Look, let's have a package deal. We'll offer you a lower interest rate on your general borrowings, commercial or personal, if you give us something in return, that is, your business.' It is not inconceivable for a bank to provide the incentive of a half to a full percentage point off a business's line of credit, should an employer make a choice and coerce employees, and open RSAs on behalf of the employees. It is certainly not inconceivable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that it is absolutely imperative that there should be no third line forcing, or coercion of employees, in respect of considerations relating to the employer's interests, which are absolutely opposed to the employees' interests in respect of their superannuation. We will be moving quite specific amendments to limit or outlaw third line forcing, as it is known.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1983">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next issue is health warnings. RSAs are to be marketed as a simple, low cost, low risk product. The focus of the marketing strategy will be to highlight that RSAs are simple, low cost products which are simple to understand, due to the fact that they will be provided by the banks. It will be interesting to see the marketing strategy, because I do not think banks will be able to convince a lot of the populace about this. Anyway, we are sure they will attempt to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that RSAs are a low return product. There is no doubt also that a consumer who is in a low return product, over a longer term&mdash;three, five, 10, 15 years&mdash;as they may well be in this case, will get a lower end benefit than if they are in a traditional superannuation product, because of the lower interest rate. Research undertaken by the Australian Consumers Association suggests that, if an individual were to remain in an RSA for the period of their working life, they could lose up to $200,000 in end retirement benefit because of the lower interest rate. Interest on interest provides a very substantial proportion of retirement income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concerns have been raised regarding the level of information an employee may or may not receive prior to a RSA being opened. It has been suggested that a health warning should be given prior to the account being opened and at critical points during the lifetime of the product, and then again when the account reaches $10,000. The Australian Consumers Association suggested that no RSA should be allowed to be above $10,000 except in situations where the RSA is being used as a safe investment vehicle, just prior to retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a Labor suggestion that account balances in RSAs should be kept at a maximum. To do so is, in reality, going to be difficult, but we will be attempting it through the series of health warnings that should be required to be issued. Certainly the Australian consumer organisations believe in a predetermined level of $10,000 and that a health warning must be communicated to the member. The health warning should ensure the holder is informed of the dangers of a low risk, low return product, is informed that a RSA is not an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> appropriate superannuation product and is given comparable information about industry funds, traditional in&hyphen;house employer funds, public offer funds and master trusts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The last area that I want to deal with is the cooling&hyphen;off period. Currently the bills provide for a 14-day cooling&hyphen;off period for employees to determine whether they do want an RSA or not. The period applies from the day on which the employee receives information regarding the account. It is important to note that, as the bills are currently drafted, the account will already have been opened on an employee's behalf by the employer. The bills as currently drafted do not make it clear when the 14-day cooling&hyphen;off period actually begins. In the event of the employee deciding not to continue with the RSA, the provider must transfer any contributions out of the account to the fund the employee directs them to, and not charge any administrative fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will certainly be seeking to extend the cooling&hyphen;off period from 14 days to 28 days. We will be moving amendments disallowing an RSA provider from opening an account prior to the employee receiving the relevant disclosure and information documents regarding the RSA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the time available I have highlighted a number of the major concerns we have with this legislation, and my colleagues who are participating in this debate will be doing the same. In concluding, I want to reiterate that the Labor opposition has a number of major concerns about the way in which the Liberal National Party coalition is approaching superannuation policy in this country. Our prediction is that if products of this type are passed by the Senate without the types of safeguards that Labor is going to be highlighting and moving amendments to, and if legislation of the type in respect to this new superannuation tax is passed by this Senate next week, unamended, there will be chaos in the superannuation industry in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take this opportunity to give a general health warning to the government. They haven't seen anything yet if this sort of legislation goes through unamended. The degree of uncertainty in the general community, the general concern that is mounting about 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1984"> this government's approach to superannuation legislation, is very significant. It is growing every day and it is massive, to judge by the number of complaints that my colleagues and I, and I know government members, are receiving on various superannuation legislation. They proceed with this approach on superannuation in an unamended form at their peril.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From a political perspective, we believe that it is a great tragedy that superannuation in this country is being undermined to the degree that it is by this new government's approach. It will be at their peril and their cost, as they will find in the coming years, if this sort of legislation passes this place unamended.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate I wish to briefly address a number of topical concerns. They are, firstly, the history and development of occupational superannuation in Australia; secondly, the potential impact upon low income, casual and other part-time workers and those approaching retirement; and thirdly, the issue of fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the history and development of occupational superannuation in Australia, as pointed out in the opposition senators' report, the superannuation guarantee charge legislation was the first pillar in what has become a unique system of superannuation savings in the world. It was based upon three readily understood principles: firstly, compulsory employer contributions; secondly, the ability to voluntarily save for retirement; and thirdly, the continuance of a universal pension safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The system of compulsory superannuation was designed around two aims. Firstly, there was the funding of a decent standard of retirement income and the achievement of that end to be consistent with intergenerational equity. In other words, the SGC had a policy objective of today's workers forgoing some of today's income to fund a decent standard of living in tomorrow's retirement. The key point to note in this context is that Australian workers were funding their own retirement out of their own wages. It was, and is, a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> remarkable example of user pays today for tomorrow's benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That initial forgone wage rise of three per cent was to grow to nine per cent by 2002 and be matched later by a government contribution of three per cent and an employee contribution of another three per cent. The final mix was to be a nine per cent employer contribution, a three per cent employee contribution and a three per cent government contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In another life I was heavily involved in the introduction, explanation and selling of occupational superannuation to a somewhat surprised work force in the period 1987 to 1992. It was indeed a surprise because in the retail, wholesale and warehousing industries, superannuation was a relatively rare benefit in those days. In retail it was confined almost exclusively to employees who fell within the following categories: they were permanent employees; they were full-time employees; they were almost exclusively management employees; and, they were almost exclusively male employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work force, of course, was notable for different features, at least since the 1970s, with the changing nature of employment and trading hours. The work force is now, and has been since 1970, notable for these features: heavy numbers of casual and part&hyphen;time workers; an overwhelming dominance of non&hyphen;full&hyphen;time workers; a work force that is heavily award based&mdash;there are few over&hyphen;award payments&mdash;and a work force, as our eyes will tell us and the statistics confirm, that is 75 to 80 per cent female.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Logically and in practice, 90 per cent of the retail work force in the middle to late 1980s was denied access to superannuation. It was, essentially, a perk offered to a few on the management side, as an incentive to remain with a particular firm. Of course, often that incentive was illusory because most of the vesting did not commence until year 15 of service with a particular firm. Even in the years around 1970, there were few employees who chose to remain for more than 15 years and hence become entitled to some form of vested benefit in superannuation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1985">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Understanding the nature of the work force in a lot of service industries means that it is no understatement to say that the introduction of compulsory superannuation was a surprise, if not a shock. That award based occupational superannuation system, developed through industry funds, is now offering the following benefits. Firstly, contrary to popular wisdom, the system has very low administrative costs, often as low as 50c per week or $25 per year. Secondly, it has high levels of return, particularly in a time of low inflation. The real returns of many funds, particularly the larger industry funds, averaged over the past eight or nine years something between eight and 12 per cent, which is quite a commendable performance. Thirdly and most importantly, there are extensive provisions&mdash;through an adequate trustee structure supported under the regulations made under the relevant act&mdash;to prevent fraud, misappropriation or financial misuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that historical context, one looks at the problems arising from superannuation arrangements and addressed by the Treasurer (Mr Costello). On 20 August, in his press release, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RSAs will be a simple, low cost, low risk product especially suited to those with small amounts of superannuation, such as itinerant and casual workers, those wishing to amalgamate several small superannuation accounts and those nearing retirement (wishing to minimise risk).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let us look at those three groups of individuals. With regard to those with small amounts of superannuation, the example given was of casual workers. In this debate, I discount itinerant workers because they have become a very minor, if not non&hyphen;existent, feature of agricultural society, with the heavy use of technology and capital in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, at the turn of the century and right up until the 1950s, there was a heavily itinerant work force engaged as railway fettlers, shearers, farm labourers, town labourers and the like. The itinerant work force on the agricultural side has almost disappeared. The itinerant work force on the development side has almost disappeared, because most of the development that is occurring involves work of the nature of two or three weeks at a location and then a week off&mdash;particularly 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in mining, bridge building, road maintenance and other such industries. So, I think it is fair to discount any significant numbers of itinerant workers needing access to a different superannuation system. But, in terms of casual workers, that is an issue&mdash;as it is for those wishing to amalgamate several small superannuation accounts and those approaching retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I analysed the bill and reflected upon its likely consequences, I came to the view that the government is most likely to fail in the objects it has set itself. Firstly, turning to casual workers, currently under the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Act large numbers of casual workers are exempt from employer sponsored superannuation contributions. Workers who earn less than $450 per month or workers who work less than 30 hours per week and are under the age of 18 are not a cost to the employer in terms of occupational superannuation because the act specifically excludes the employer from making contributions. When one analyses the ABS statistics on work force age composition, the overwhelming bulk of junior, casual and junior part&hyphen;time employees do not currently receive occupational superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is further proposed, I understand, that the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Act will be amended to increase that exemption level from $450 per month to $900 per month. Nine hundred dollars per month is $225 per week. For most award employees, that is around $10 per hour. So with the foreshadowed amendments to the Superannuation Guarantee Charge Act to lift the exemption level, nearly all junior workers and most non full&hyphen;time employees working less than 20 hours per week will not qualify for occupational superannuation whilst so employed. Therefore, in terms of objective 1, the government proposes a solution to a problem that does not exist in any meaningful way or has the most minimal application. One asks the obvious question as to why the government invents a non&hyphen;existent solution for a non&hyphen;existent problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, turning to the issue of multiple accounts, there are two possible permutations: firstly, multiple accounts relating to multiple 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1986"> jobs by one employee at the one time; and, secondly, multiple accounts relating to successive jobs held by one employee over time. Looking at the first group, the bill does not solve that problem because it expressly authorises&mdash;indeed, encourages&mdash;individual employers to open individual RSAs in the financial institution of their choice. The Treasurer, in his press release, was probably talking of the second class of employees that I raised&mdash;that is, multiple accounts of one employee in successive jobs over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge up front the potential problems: it is sometimes messy, there are some administrative fees problems and some accounts stand to be lost over time. But a simple solution does exist in the transference of funds from one account requirement&mdash;and I recommend it to the government. All you need to do now is to fill out a transfer form, post it to your new superannuation fund, they forward it to the administrators of the old superannuation fund and the account balance is transferred and consolidated in the new account. Thousands of those transactions occur every week in the superannuation industry. I used to sit on the board of a fairly large fund which received the reports from the administrators of thousands of transfers on that basis. So under current superannuation arrangements, a simple solution already exists for a real problem. This bill does not address that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Turning to the issue of those nearing retirement, it is said that these older people wish to minimise their risk. It is a fairly legitimate proposition. As people become older, they become more cautious and pay more attention to financial security. Indeed, the financial industry would advise young people to take a particular form of investment and older people to invest in products that give security. To return to the current bill, the desire to minimise risk is easily achieved by superannuation funds offering different investment mixes. Those who are more interested in a higher return can invest in equity products. That is more suitable for younger people who intend to remain in the work force for a significant period of time. In terms of capital guaranteed products for lower risk applicants, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the obvious option is to appeal to older people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem that exists is that when super funds survey members on this point, there is little to zero interest in the type of product that is being offered. So, again, we have an inappropriate solution to a problem that hardly exists or, at best, a solution already exists by offering the option of a differing investment mix.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator O'Chee for the question. It is true that this government seeks to introduce and implement the most radical changes in delivery of employment services to unemployed Australians since the introduction of the CES about 50 years ago. But today on Adelaide radio, Martin Ferguson accused the government of trying to redefine unemployment out of existence. He knows full well&mdash;he should know, as a former president of the ACTU&mdash;that unemployment is measured by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The definitions used by the bureau have not changed under the Howard government, and there is no plan to change them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He accused us of asserting that a 20 hour&hyphen;a&hyphen;week job is a full&hyphen;time job. He should know full well that that relates to when a final outcome fee will be paid to a case manager looking after, on a one&hyphen;to&hyphen;one basis, a long&hyphen;term unemployed person. The issue for this government&mdash;and it should have been the issue for the previous government&mdash;is placing the unemployed in a position that will make them independent of government assistance, to give them that independence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of whether or not a job is real does not relate to the number of hours worked. A 10 hour&hyphen;a&hyphen;week part&hyphen;time job is a real job. That person may still want more work and may still get some income support, but it is, nonetheless, a real job. We are saying that, if you get someone off benefit, we will consider that you have got them a real job; and that will be about 20 hours of work a week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the hypocrisy of this, Madam President. Under Labor's Working Nation case management guidelines, outcome fees were paid to case managers. Guess what for? For putting people into make work programs like the new work opportunities scheme. You did not even have to give them 10 hours of full unsubsidised work; you just had to plonk them in a new work opportunities scheme&mdash;into some six&hyphen;month rock painting program.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1990">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These were the Labor make work programs that simply shuffled and churned the unemployed mercilessly through program after program without getting positive outcomes. We are getting rid of those. We are shifting to a system where case managers will get their final outcome payments when someone has had a real job&mdash;that is, an unsubsidised job&mdash;for about six months. Something that Labor cannot seem to come to grips with is that that is the purpose of putting someone into case management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What was Labor's second outcome fee payment for? It was for putting a job seeker into a job for 20 hours plus a week or more. So Martin Ferguson either does not understand what Labor's Working Nation was trying to do or he was prepared to be quite deceptive on radio this morning by pretending that somehow what we are doing is a bad thing when he knows it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If those definitions of outcomes were satisfactory for Labor, they certainly should be satisfactory for us. But our outcomes demand more&mdash;they demand better service for unemployed Australians. Let me repeat: we will pay for outcomes that get people off benefits, that give them independence, that give them a real job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, it is very important to understand that, for every job an unemployed person got because they participated in new work opportunities that they would not otherwise have got, the net impact cost of a new work opportunities placement was $143,000. So the people opposite have no credibility and are in no position whatsoever to realistically discuss what should happen for unemployed Australians. All of this is coming from a government that after 13 years in office left Australia with deplorable unemployment. I can see that my time is running out.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be absolutely no doubt about the government's position on the automotive industry and the review of future policy. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism have both made it clear. The government is fully committed to the future viability of the automotive manufacturing industry in Australia. This is reflected in the terms of reference of the Productivity Commission inquiry itself, as stated in the House yesterday by the Prime Minister. Of course, we understand that the automotive industry is a major employer, a major producer of value added exports and a major source of investment and innovation. It should not surprise anyone that there will be a range of views on this significant issue from the industry itself and from the leaders of those states and regions where industry is located.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The South Australian and Victorian premiers understandably have strong views about the issue and have every right to put those views forward. But, as the Prime Minister said yesterday, this government will do precisely what the opposition did in government. The only difference is that we will listen to the views and, when we have the final Productivity Commission report, we will make a decision that takes into account the interests of all Australians. The only reason the opposition has chosen to enter the car debate now is sheer desperation. It has pinched the minority draft report of the commission and attempted to pass it off in its policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to look at Labor's record when in government. In 1984, shortly after Labor came to office, annual car production

In 1984, import penetration was around 20 per cent. In 1996, as a response to Labor's policies, import penetration was around 50 per cent.

I have cited many examples where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are adopting this philosophy, and they can see the tangible differences in their communities.

Unlike Labor, we will not let indigenous Australians live in squalid conditions without taking decisive action to implore the situation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator, for the question. I did see a report of those sorts of suggestions last week allegedly emanating from, as I understand it, Monash University, which allegedly had a plan to minimise their government funded enrolments, pay the appropriate fine on that and thereby encourage students into buying a place at Monash. I can assure you that I had my office immediately make enquiries about that. I have verbally been advised that Monash says that this story is not true. I have yet to have that in writing from either my department&mdash;or at least on by desk in writing&mdash;or, for that matter, from Monash.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can assure you, Senator Stott Despoja, of two things&mdash;one of which I am sure you already know&mdash;and that is that where there is a bucket of money, the vice-chancellors are around the bucket. They will always be trying to maximise the financial outcomes for their universities. In a sense, that is not a bad thing, because we want them to act not like businesses but to be businesslike. We do not want them to be frivolous with money, and there is a difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see you, Senator Stott Despoja, smiling at the distinction I am drawing. There is a distinction and it is a very important one to bear in mind for universities. We do not want them to be businesses and simply churn products out irrespective of quality. But, at the same time, we do want them to have some considerable concern for the Commonwealth dollars that they are using. We want them not to be businesses, but to be businesslike.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that you might not have known and need some reassurance on is that I have not the slightest intention of allowing universities in any way to subvert the government's plans to provide more undergraduate places to Australian students. You would have discovered last year, Senator Stott Despoja, as the vice-chancellors would have discovered, that I am not about to walk away from an argument if they want to have one. I am not about to let them subvert the government's plans and minimise government funded enrolments. It simply will not happen.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Carr for his question. He just does not seem to understand that the truth is not always found in the newspapers. He should understand that. But, as time goes by, he will eventually come to understand it. Dr Kemp is not about attacking teachers. He recognises the value of teachers and has consistently made that point. Teachers are a very valuable resource. They look after our children&mdash;our best and brightest, and those who perhaps are not our brightest and who perhaps need teaching assistance even more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What he has said, however, is that he is concerned, and rightly so, about literacy levels in Australian schools. You ought to know a lot about this, Senator Carr, because it is your party that was in government for the last 13 years and which did very little about this. Your party has let Australian students down. Your party has people leaving secondary school with inadequate literacy levels and inadequate numeracy skills. You know, as every other person over there knows, that when you let a kid leave secondary school with inadequate literacy and numeracy skills you are increasing their chances, heaven 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> knows how many fold, of being unemployed and staying unemployed for a very long time. You are certainly predetermining the opportunities for the rest of their life. You are predetermining that they will be in a low skilled, low paid job for the rest of their life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, before you get on your high horse and ask us about what we are doing, you might like to contemplate, Senator Carr, what your government in the past 13 years, when it had an opportunity, simply failed to do. I would say that one thing we ought to expect from our schools is appropriate numeracy and literacy skills when you leave school. Surely you can agree that that is something we ought to be getting from our schools: students with adequate literacy and numeracy skills. You should agree with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Your second question related to employment placement enterprises. Dr Kemp has raised on a number of occasions over a significant period of time&mdash;perhaps when you were not listening&mdash;the opportunities or otherwise for schools to become employment placement enterprises. He has raised this matter with me on a number of occasions and I know he has raised it with a number of schools. Dr Kemp understands in a way that your party never did that schools are not there just for the 25 per cent of school leavers who go to university. You might like that, and all of you over there with degrees might think that is the function of a school, but it is not what we think over here. The other 75 per cent of students who go out of secondary school and who do not go to university are looking for better vocational training than your government ever provided, and they are looking for a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the schools want to judge their level of success, they ought not do so simply by the number of students who go to university. They might like to look at the other 75 per cent of students and look at those who wanted a job and got one.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the slump in housing caused by Labor's policies, there are signs of a recovery. Dwelling investment in the December quarter rose by a strong three per cent, prompting Mr Harnisch, a director at Master Builders Australia, to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an early but welcome sign that the housing recovery may be starting to broaden.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The housing outlook for 1997 is also positive, with total private building approvals rising in January 7.6 per cent and finance approvals rising 6.4 per cent. Vacancy rates remain low in the two major markets, Sydney and Melbourne, and vacancy rates have fallen in most other cities in recent months. Housing affordability, as measured by the Commonwealth Bank&hyphen;HIA index, is now at its highest level since the December quarter of 1984. Australians had less affordable housing for 11 years under Labor. That was the effect of Labor's policies: less affordable housing for families.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">In the answer to the first question today we saw an inept and waffling display, as in most other answers that the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) tries to give. It was an inept and waffling display that Senator Kemp has uniquely made his own. It is a characteristic trademark attempt never to answer the question, always to evade the main point and to try to entertain the gallery&mdash;and the sum total of this effort is to fail on all three counts. Nonetheless, whatever you do, Senator Kemp, never provide this chamber with any information and never answer a question directly! That is your style.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But today you usurped your own efforts by playing pass the parcel. You are the Assistant Treasurer. You have responsibility for taxation in this country. You had a question on

You tried to pass the parcel to the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Warwick Parer, in order to avoid your own responsibility in this matter. Diesel fuel is taxed in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what did we actually see here? We have a bill coming before this chamber shortly&mdash;the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). It is not a bill whose title conveys the complexity and the meaning of what that bill contains. But that bill deals with an exemption from taxation, deals with the eligibility for rebate from a tax, narrows that rebate eligibility quite considerably and, in particular areas, removes the eligibility entirely.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government do not like it when they get pinned, and they are getting pinned on this. What was one of the most solemn promises made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) before the election, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2000"> made by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) before the election, supported by Andrew Robb in advertisements taken out by the Liberal Party before the election? There would be no new taxes introduced in Australia and there would be no extension of existing taxes. I have here an advertisement by Mr Andrew Robb on behalf of the Liberal Party in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mining Monthly</EMPHASIS>  magazine. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mining Monthly</EMPHASIS>  magazine pose the question, `Will the coalition increase the tax burden on the mining industry during the term of the next parliament?' He says, `We will not introduce any new taxes and we will not increase existing taxes.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, by abolishing the right to the rebate and by narrowing the entitlement to the rebate, you extend an existing tax. That is an economic fact which is indisputable. This is a breach of a core government promise&mdash;a breach of it to the tune of $160 million a year or, if you want to take the calculation, $640 million over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government have not answered why they have broken their election promise. My questions to them were, `Will you now acknowledge that you have, and why did you do it?' It is indisputable that they have. Of course, the Assistant Treasurer skated around, waffled on in relation to and avoided that very direct question. What does the industry think, however? In a Senate hearing on 28 February, I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you regard the narrowing of eligibility for the diesel fuel rebate as in fact an increase in tax?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Savell, representing the Mining Industry Council: `Yes, I do.' To the petroleum industry, I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the government extends the amount of tax it collects by narrowing the rebate, is that an extension of taxation, in your view?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Jones, representing the petroleum and gas industry of Australia, succinctly: `Yes.' To CRA, I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . since the effect of this legislation would be to narrow the eligibility for the rebate, do you regard that as in effect an extension of taxation?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Gray: `Yes'. Then I go on:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins, just listen and you will learn something for a change. Listen instead of just belching out words. After the election we were confronted with a big $10 billion deficit. The previous government had tried to address this issue. All those opposite have to do is talk to Senator Schacht to find out what happened. There was a series of Senate inquiries. He tried to sandbag the industry, which was the typical way that government operated: if you want to win, sandbag an industry. They got nowhere. No matter how sensible an item was that Senator Schacht might have had, every single one was opposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we met with the industry and from across the table we said, `We have a problem, and the problem is that the diesel fuel rebate is growing at an exponential rate which is greater than the growth of the industry and the inflation rate. We need to sit down and address this because we're going to address the $10 billion deficit and everyone needs to share some of the pain.' Out of those discussions came a voluntary agreement between the industry and the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook referred to the Senate committee report. I would like to mention that because that committee report referred to the original bill without the amendments. I agree that it would have been better if we had had those amendments before you at the committee. I agreed with that in the committee. However, one of the reasons for putting the bill on the table was so that industry and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2001"> others could look at it to see whether there were unintended consequences which may have deviated from the agreement reached between the industry and the government. As a result, those amendments are now before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook stands up here and says that we have broken solemn promises, and quotes some sort of magazine article from Mr Robb. He also quotes George Savell, who, I might tell Senator Cook, is not from the Mining Industry Council but from AMEC, the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, operating out of Perth. So it is not the Mining Industry Council at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, let me remind the Senate yet again: there were no broken promises. What has ended up in this legislation with its amendments before the Senate&mdash;this legislation is on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>; in fact, the second reading speech was supposed to occur at lunch time&mdash;is a voluntary agreement between the industry and the government which we have honoured and they have honoured.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It considers, as Senator Cook has amply demonstrated to the Senate, this to be a broken promise. In November last year the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) launched the small business deregulation task force report, which had been commissioned by the government at Five Dock in Sydney. I note Senator Watson is clearly getting ready to debate this issue. Perhaps Senator John Watson might like to respond to this when he speaks: the Prime 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Minister described that report as symbolising one of `the highest priorities of the new government'. He continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have become a bit of a fanatic on the role of small business in the Australian community . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He then went on to make this promise:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can guarantee that you will have a comprehensive response to all of the recommendations in this report no later than the middle of February.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senators would recall that at the heart of the government's small business policy was a promise to cut red tape by 50 per cent in their first term. In an answer to a question in the other place last month, the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) advised that a survey commissioned by the government found that on average it took small business four hours to comply with government red tape&mdash;I assume that is per week&mdash;at a cost of around $7,000 a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has failed to deliver on his promise to respond to the Bell report on small business. Clearly this task has so far exceeded the level of his promises. I understand that today was the latest launch day for the government response but it has again been cancelled. The government is now saying its response will be released next week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is now in fact adding to that four-hour average time to comply with red tape through the changes proposed to the diesel rebate scheme. Australia's family farms are, in my view, the definitive small business operators in Australia. They have to be part-time motor mechanics, accountants, lawyers, vets, nurses and agronomists as well as full-time farmers. Not only do they have to cope with the vagaries of the weather; they have to cope with the vagaries of international commodity prices and international and domestic markets. The last thing they need is what this government is about to give them: yet another, very thick, layer of paperwork.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2002"> from Senator Watson. He can rebut the NFF's submission and tell us in his five minutes where they got it wrong. The submission states that the efficient operation of the diesel rebate scheme is critical to the ongoing viability of agriculture, especially the cropping industries, which are obviously heavily dependent on fuel.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments proposed by the government will result in additional record keeping requirements being placed on farmers. The current legislation requires claimants to keep all relevant documents that come into a farmer's possession. The government is now proposing that farmers must create and retain specific documents in order to substantiate claims. Potentially that means that farmers will be required to keep a log book for every tractor used, stating the date the fuel was used and the purpose for which it was used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They will also be required to keep separate logbooks for diesel pumps and stationary diesel motors that do not have an hour meter attached to them. This is the government that was supposed to be cutting red tape to small businesses by half. This was the government that was supposed to be helping rural Australia. Rural Australia is already treating these promises with a great deal of cynicism.</PARA>

This is a customs issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am surprised that a person of your eminence, Senator Cook, who used to represent the former Treasurer and Minister for Finance in this place, is trying to bend the banana so much. What we have been looking at here is a refinement in relation to the rebate&mdash;amending the rules.

You have not been looking at your fax machine. If you had, what probably would have come across your desk would be a press release from the Mining Council. To summarise that press release, the Mining Council indicated that they generally supported the amendments now before the parliament. Where is all this alleged protest? Why is there so much noise from you when we have an industry which generally supports the proposals; an industry which was vehemently against what you put forward?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it really difficult for us to generally accept your howls of protest and your condemnation of a very good minister: Senator Kemp. All he did was say that the matter should have been referred or directed to Senator Parer, a man renowned in this place

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, this bill delivers on the government's commitment to maintain the Export Market Development Grants scheme, and to provide full&hyphen;rate eligibility, for the first time, to the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It simplifies the scheme, better targets its support to sme's and retains a well funded program despite the budget black hole of the Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the EMDG scheme has been assisting Australian exporters for over 22 years. During that time the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974  has been amended many times. As a result the act is now quite complex and difficult to use, and has been criticised as such by exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill before you is a very much easier to read document than the act it will replace. As far as is possible it puts like matters with like, it flows logically from subject to subject, and it presents concepts and terminology in relatively simple language. It uses around only half the number of words of the existing act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two significant measures have been introduced to direct more funds to small and medium enterprise. The minimum expenditure threshold has been lowered to $20,000 per grant to benefit more SME's. In addition, applicants with income in the grant year in excess of $50 million will no longer be eligible to receive a grant for that year, thus 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> freeing up available funds for those exporters most in need of assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has also recognised the significant contribution made to our exports by the tourism industry. We have increased the grant rate for all tourism providers to the full rate of 50%, allowing free samples of services provided, and access to approved joint ventures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the fiscal legacy of the previous Labor government, the cost of the EMDG scheme has also had to be addressed. The government has, therefore, decided to place a cap on annual funding. This is consistent with the government's wider goal of fiscal restraint.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most importantly, the mechanism for effecting the cap will provide for full payment of smaller grants at the time of determination. Claimants eligible for larger grants will receive a partial advance at the time of determination and a pro&hyphen;rated balance at the end of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If demand for grants exceeds the $150 million available, larger grants will be reduced. To minimise the potential reduction to individual grants, the government has introduced a number of policy changes which will simplify the scheme, address fraud and better target it at those SME's in the early years of exporting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eligibility to claim air fares continues for the first two grants, assisting businesses take that difficult first step of visiting export markets. Air fares incurred by an overseas representative will continue to be claimable for all grant years within an overall expenditure cap for overseas representatives of $200,000 per grant year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the fundamental principles of this scheme have not been altered. The scheme will continue to provide assistance to small and medium Australian exporters and potential exporters through the partial reimbursement of selected promotional costs. Under this bill the scheme retains its open access nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the interests of broad consultation with industry and getting the bill right, an exposure draft of the bill was widely circulated late last year for public comment. Over 160 submissions were received. I thank those who provided submissions, and many of the issues raised in those submissions have been included in the bill that is before the house today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, this bill demonstrates the commitment of the government to assisting Australian SME's enter and develop export markets. Not only have we retained a well&hyphen;funded EMDG scheme which encourages smaller firms into export, but we have also made substantial progress towards reducing the budget deficit and providing a better macroeconomic environment for all Australian exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to honourable Senators.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the government has introduced to this place a bill which will establish a revised and simplified Export Market Development Grants Scheme. I refer to the Export Market Development Grants Bill 1997.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EXPORT FINANCE AND INSURANCE CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last budget, the government announced that it would transfer Development Import Finance Facility (DIFF) loan liabilities from the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) to the government's account. As a consequence, EFIC would make a special payment to the Commonwealth, estimated to be $40 million. At that time, it was noted that amendments would be required to EFIC's legislation to allow the transfer of loan liabilities and associated payment. This bill implements that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">EFIC is a statutory corporation which exists to increase Australia's exports by providing international competitive insurance and export finance services. It has traditionally filled a gap left by the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> private sector, which has often been reluctant to finance or insure exports in certain markets because of the risks involved. EFIC operates on a commercial basis and meets all of its costs from revenue, including the need to build up reserves to enable it to meet future claims. EFIC operates essentially at no cost to the taxpayer and will, in fact, pay a dividend to government during the current financial year of $12.6 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1995&hyphen;96 EFIC supported $7.5 billion of Australian exports, supporting over 1,000 Australian businesses exporting to some 155 countries around the globe. Most of EFIC's clients are small to medium enterprises with an annual turnover of $50 million or less. The availability and cost of export risk mitigation is extremely important to these smaller companies. Some 87% of new clients to EFIC in 1995&hyphen;96 were SMEs, of which 60% were manufacturers&mdash;exactly the type of company needed to drive Australia's future prosperity and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">EFIC's role as a direct financier or guarantor has become increasingly important in line with the need to match overseas government supported involvement in the area of trade financing. EFIC's financing book stood at nearly $3 billion at the end of last year, all involving the export of capital goods and services from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important part of EFIC's financing role has been to deliver the soft loan component of Australia's overseas aid program through the former DIFF scheme. DIFF loans were concentrated in Asia and were long-term&mdash;up to 25 years in the case of loans to Indonesia. A DIFF grant component of some $120 million per year translated to soft loans through EFIC of some $350 million. Delivering DIFF loans of this magnitude presented EFIC with two problems. The first was the need to build up reserves in case of defaults on these loans, noting that the loans covered a significant portion of EFIC's exposure at any one time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second problem, a result of Australia's overseas aid program focussing on Asia, was the concentration of exposure in a fairly narrow range of countries. Like all insurers and financiers, EFIC would normally seek to spread its exposure. However, the concentration of DIFF loans made EFIC's loan exposures undesirably lop&hyphen;sided. In addition, this concentration also had the potential to restrict EFIC's ability to provide non&hyphen;aid medium term credit for Australian exports in these countries, particularly Indonesia. This was a matter of concern to the government given the increasing interest of Australian business in Asia. The removal of DIFF loan liabilities from EFIC's account to the government's account, managed by EFIC on behalf of the government, removes these unintended consequences. This transfer will change EFIC's risk portfolio for the better, allowing room for EFIC to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2006"> grow its medium&hyphen;term business, particularly in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the financial impact of the bill, EFIC will make a special payment to the Commonwealth of $40 million. This amount reflects the liability that the Commonwealth will be assuming for the loans. The calculation of this amount was made by the government in the knowledge that EFIC's viability, and capacity for growth, to a large extent depends upon its reserve structure and the income generated from those reserves. The government will be liable to reimburse EFIC for any losses occasioned by loan defaults or other interruptions to repayment. The Commonwealth will also pay EFIC a fee for managing the loans.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND FOOD AUTHORITY AMENDMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991 (the act) to implement provisions which will enable the Australia New Zealand Food Authority to focus its resources on issues which are of critical importance to its Australian and New Zealand stakeholders. Legislation which was before the Parliament last December created the Australia New Zealand Food Authority and a joint food standards setting system for Australia and New Zealand. This Authority and the unique system of Commonwealth, State, Territory and New Zealand cooperation it supports, will continue to protect the public health and safety of Australian and New Zealand consumers through:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the development, establishment and management of the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the development and implementation of the new hygiene standards for food processing, manufacturing and handling; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> development of improved and consistent national arrangements for surveillance and compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will enhance the Authority's ability to undertake these important tasks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Final Report of the Policy Review published in May 1993 committed the Authority to undertake a Review of the Food Standards Code in recognition that, before the creation of the Authority, food standards had not been developed according to the objectives set out in section 10 of the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991. The need for this Review was supported by all stakeholders and a timetable indicated that the Review would be completed in March 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, this time frame cannot be met because of a provision in the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991 which requires the Authority to accept all applications (which meet certain basic criteria). The Authority is then obliged to commit resources to completing the assessments associated with each of these applications within 12 months, irrespective of the relative public or commercial importance of these applications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are three main deficiencies within the current legislation which prevent the Authority having the capacity to plan, manage or prioritise its work load:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Firstly, the Authority has no control over the number of applications which it is legally bound to handle at any one time. As resources must be provided for the processing of each of those applications, the Authority is placed in the invidious situation of either compromising the quality of the assessment of each applica 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2007"> tion, or breaching its statutory obligation to finalise applications within 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Secondly, the Authority is obliged to utilise available resources on a `first come&mdash;first served' basis so preventing it from taking into account the relative importance or value of each application (according to the objectives set out under section 10 of the act).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Thirdly, the Authority's obligation to assess each application individually means that the Authority is required to make variations to the Code on a fragmented, one by one basis in response to individual applications which generally only benefit a particular sector of industry. This in turn prevents the Authority from undertaking more comprehensive and thorough reviews of groupings of standards. These reviews of groupings of standards are urgently needed to make the Code less prescriptive, easier to use and more consistent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth wishes to give an undertaking to the States and Territories and to New Zealand that the Authority will develop a joint Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code by 1 January 2000. The development of this joint Code is a continuation of the Review of the Code begun in 1993 and it will result in a revised, simplified and much more effective set of food standards. This joint Code is absolutely essential to the efficiency and international competitiveness of Australia's food industry. A failure to provide the joint Code within the three-year timeframe will erode the food industry's international reputation and could jeopardise its market opportunities in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure that the joint Code is in place by the year 2000, the Authority is establishing a three-year Standards Review Work Program. This work program will set priorities for food standards review over the next three years and will be agreed to and supported by the food industry, the States, Territories and New Zealand. Development of this work program will involve agreement from stakeholders as to which health and safety, consumer protection, industry and international harmonisation issues require priority over the next three years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A specific number of applications will be included in the work program, commensurate with the level of resources available to the Authority. It is anticipated that these resources will be drawn from Commonwealth, New Zealand and industry sources. The applications will be selected for inclusion in the work program in consultation with stakeholders. Criteria for selection will be based on the objectives set out in section 10 of the act. All applications accepted as part of this work program will be finalised within 12 months and there will be no charge to the applicant. Applications which cannot be accommodated within the work program because of resource limitations will still be accepted and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> processed within the 12 month timeframe, but will be assessed on a cost recovery basis ie: applicants will need to provide the Authority with the resources required to process the application. Alternatively, assessment of the application will be delayed until the charges have been paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Successful development of the joint Australia New Zealand Code hinges upon the amendments contained in this bill. In summary, this legislation will enable the Authority to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> ensure that the Authority's resources are spent on assessing applications within the work program by allowing it to delay processing applications which are outside the work program until such time as any prescribed charges have been paid;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> assess applications which are within the work program at no charge to the applicant;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> enable the Authority to prioritise and direct resources to its agreed work program, and to the food standards matters which are of major public interest and commercial importance; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> charge for its expertise by marketing its goods and services and to retain any fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> permits regulations to set the amount of these charges and to waive, remit and refund charges in whole or in part; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> specifically limits the level of the charge to recovering the Authority's expenses in assessing an application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will protect the Authority's open and accountable processes which are admired around the world. The Authority will still be required to assess applications within the 12 month time limit provided that, for applications outside the work program, the prescribed charge is paid. Any person or body will still be able to apply to the Authority for a variation or addition to the Food Standards Code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will enable the Authority to develop, establish and manage a quality Food Standards Code for Australia and New Zealand which will protect public health and safety and strengthen our food industry.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AIDC SALE BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will put in place the necessary framework to give effect to the government's decision to sell AIDC Limited and wind up the Australian Industry Development Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIDC's origins were in 1970 when the Australian Industry Development Corporation was established as a statutory corporation by the Commonwealth. It was formed to facilitate and encourage the estab 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2008"> lishment, development and advancement of Australian industries. Commercial operations commenced in 1971. The Corporation established a reputation as a prominent development finance company in Australia, lending to and investing in a wide spectrum of Australian industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Milestone transactions in its development in the 1980s included leading roles in the North West Shelf gas project financing for Woodside Petroleum Limited and the Eraring Power Station project financing. More recent significant transactions include establishing a consortium of institutional investors to take a 10% equity interest in Optus Communications Pty Limited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The business activities of the Australian Industry Development Corporation were one of the first Commonwealth Government activities identified for privatisation. This led to the decision by the previous government to establish AIDC Limited to undertake the business activities of the Corporation and enable an initial offering of 18.5% of the shares to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although this approach provided for public participation in the ownership of the business, it did not provide a practical means through which the government was able to divest itself of the remainder of the company. As a consequence it was necessary for the Corporation to make a takeover offer for those shares in AIDC Limited not owned by the Corporation, (ie Commonwealth Government owned shares), to facilitate the full disposal of the activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The takeover offer was successfully completed in January 1996 and the shares in AIDC Limited delisted from the Australian Stock Exchange in February 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since its establishment as a company AIDC has been changing the direction of the business activity of the Company.While still focussing on the development or advancement of the infrastructure and resource sectors of the economy, it is pursuing to a far greater extent fee&hyphen;based merchant banking business. This government is firmly of the view that such business activities have no place continuing in the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to moving the company from government ownership, the sale for which this bill provides the framework will further contribute to the government's competitive neutrality objectives. Through arrangements between the Corporation and AIDC Limited, AIDC was provided with access to funding at competitively attractive rates through the Commonwealth government guarantee. The termination of access to this facility will place the AIDC business on the same competitive footing as the rest of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's decision to sell AIDC Limited is consistent with the recommendations of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> National Commission of Audit which considered that government business activities whose objectives are to provide goods and services on a commercial basis should only be retained in public ownership if there is a clear public interest case to do so. With the emergence and development of financial markets in Australia any public interest case to retain AIDC in public ownership has disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reaching its decision the government consulted with the Board of the Australian Industry Development Corporation and AIDC Limited. The directors and management of AIDC are fully supportive of the government's policy of privatising AIDC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the AIDC Sale Bill provides the necessary framework to give effect to the decision to sell AIDC Limited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for a flexible disposal strategy in recognition of the complexity of the legal and commercial arrangements that exist in AIDC Limited and the need to take the appropriate measures in the sale process recognising the Commonwealth's position as guarantor of the Corporation's borrowings. It enables the transfer, under ministerial direction, of assets of the Corporation or any wholly owned entity of the Corporation to the Commonwealth or any other body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision is made for the winding up of the Australian Industry Development Corporation by proclamation, the timing of which is subject to written certification by the minister that he is satisfied that the Corporation has no assets or liabilities. It is necessary to make this arrangement as the Corporation will continue in existence after the sale AIDC Limited to satisfy the Commonwealth's guarantee obligations arising from the Corporation's borrowing program. The Corporation's 1996 Annual Report indicates that $946 million of the borrowings are due in five or more years, long after the sale of AIDC Limited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Schedule 1 to the Bill provides for a range of amendments to the Australian Industry Corporation Act 1970 to give effect to a restriction of the functions of the Corporation to the core functions. These include the facilitation and encouragement of the establishment, development and advancement of Australian industries through the provision of financial resources and securing participation by Australian residents in the ownership and control of businesses. While it is the government's view that such objectives should be carried on in future by private entities, it is important to maintain these core functions of the Corporation in relation to the existing obligations. Further changes are included to provide for the minister to give directions to the Board of the Corporation. Through this power the minister can require the Corporation to manage the wind down of its liabilities, consistent with the government's decision to sell the business activities 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2009"> of the Corporation and the ultimate objective of abolishing the Corporation when it no longer has any assets or liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A range of amendments to the act are proposed to provide for the variation to the composition of the Corporation's Board. It removes the requirement for the ex&hyphen;officio appointment of Secretaries of Departments as this is no longer appropriate given the ongoing functions of the Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the sale of AIDC Limited, as provided for by this bill, the close linkage between AIDC Limited and the Australian Industry Development Corporation will no longer exist and as a consequence it is necessary to amend the existing legislation to ensure that the restrictions on the delegation of powers by the Corporation to an officer or employee who remains in the Corporation or to a fully&hyphen;owned subsidiary of the Corporation remain applicable in the context of the other changes proposed for the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 24A of the existing act is repealed and replaced by a provision that permits the minister to give the Corporation written direction to pay specified amounts to the Commonwealth at specified times. Under the existing provisions, payments to the Commonwealth were precluded from exceeding the Corporation's profit in that year. Within the sale environment and the wind down in the Corporation it is important for the Commonwealth as the beneficial owner to capture the proceeds at its determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new Part VI is inserted into the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act 1970 to provide the flexible framework that will enable the sale to take place. The framework includes the regularisation of the ownership of AIDC Limited, the introduction of the government's ability to transfer assets and liabilities between different elements of AIDC or to the Commonwealth, the ability of the Commonwealth to direct to it the payment of the proceeds of the sale or sales and the abolition of any residual franking credits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes provisions relating to transfer of minority interests in AIDC Limited. Although there was a successful takeover offer by the Corporation for those AIDC Limited shares not owned by the Corporation, two parcels of shares in the company remain outside the Corporations ownership. This gives rise to the situation where, despite the Corporation, and through it the Commonwealth, having beneficial ownership of 99.98% of the company, it can be frustrated in its intentions to pursue the sale of the company. Obligations are generated under the Corporations Law for directors of the company to protect the interests of those minority shareholders. While this bill makes specific arrangements for the compulsory acquisition of minority interests, the threshold at which it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> can operate reflects provisions in Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the minister for Finance to declare that at a specified date, which must be before 1 July 1998, that the legal and beneficial interests in those shares vest in the Corporation. The shareholders involved are protected in the bill by a requirement on the Corporation that reasonable compensation be paid for the shares, with recourse being provided to the Federal Court if agreement cannot be reached on the amount of compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of its business activities AIDC Limited has built up a range of significant investment holdings. Important amongst these is the 48.5% holding in the Australian Submarine Corporation. This holding was able to be managed in a way that contributed not only to the development of Australian industry, but also to the development of Australian resources necessary for our defence. With the sale of AIDC Limited the government is concerned to ensure that this significant ownership stake in ASC continues to be held in a way that contributes to Australia's defence industry objectives. As a result this asset will be quarantined from sale, unless there is a compelling argument brought forward from the Department of Defence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this reason the bill makes provision for the minister for Finance to direct the transfer of the assets in a way that allows for the transfer of particular assets, such as the interest in ASC, and assists in achieving the government's objective of a sale of the business of AIDC Limited. Associated with the power to transfer assets, authority is also provided for the transfer of contractual rights and obligations and liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the liabilities of AIDC and its subsidiaries involve liabilities taken on by the Australian Industry Development Corporation and therefore include a guarantee of the payment by the Commonwealth of Australia. Provision is made in the bill for the continuation of that guarantee of payment when the liability is transferred to another person. Following the declaration of a sale day, AIDC Limited and its subsidiaries will have no further recourse to raising new funds which are guaranteed by the Commonwealth. These changes will not permit the purchaser of AIDC assets, rights, obligations or liabilities to in any way change the nature of the existing obligations and retain the benefit of the Commonwealth guarantee. The guarantee will only continue to apply while the liability remains in exactly the same form as existed at the time of sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision is made for the Minister for Finance to direct that the proceeds from the sale or transfer of assets of AIDC bodies must be paid to the Commonwealth. This is to ensure that the Commonwealth obtains the full benefit of the sale of AIDC or any subsidiary bodies at the time of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2010"> sale rather than leaving it to the discretion of the Corporation or an AIDC company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill sets out the stamp duty liabilities applying in the sale, specifying that it is not payable in relation to those transfers of assets or liabilities between AIDC bodies or between AIDC Limited and the Commonwealth, which arise as a result of ministerial direction; such directions being provided for in this legislation. It also provides that stamp duty will not be payable in relation to the sale itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides in Division 7 for the cancellation of AIDC's franking credits as their inclusion in the sale process could result in the Commonwealth achieving only partial return for the credits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New sections are introduced to provide that AIDC companies must provide information or other assistance as may be requested in writing by the minister to pursue the sale process. In providing this power protection is provided to those giving information or assistance to ensure that such actions do not result in a contravention of the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly the bill provides for the preservation or other recognition of entitlements of AIDC staff. It preserves accrued long service leave entitlements and ensures that the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act continues to apply in relation to injury or loss incurred before sale day. In these respects the bill reflects the past practice of government in protecting accrued rights of employees in asset sale situations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes consequential amendments to a number of other Commonwealth acts which will take effect on the winding up of the Australian Industry Development Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, this bill will provide a framework for the sale of AIDC Limited and the subsequent winding up of the Australian Industry Development Corporation, in the most flexible and expeditious way in response to commercial interest that is expressed in the sale process. It will also protect the interests of AIDC employees and enable the effective disposition of assets, liabilities, rights and obligations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the interruption of the debate at 12.45, I was speaking to a number of aspects of the opposition's amendments on price discrimination. I will not repeat the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2011"> things I have already said. I was also responding to the remarks of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) in defence of his proposition on price discrimination, that it be done on an averaging basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now want to turn to the question of how the minister is going to prepare his proposal for price and I want to try to get from the minister more details of this price averaging arrangement which he says will deliver bigger cuts in telecommunication local call rates in non-metropolitan areas. First of all, this is not being done by legislation. It will be done by a disallowable instrument as part of the Telstra act and it will only relate to Telstra. We believe that is a deficiency in that we do not believe Telstra should be picked on. All carriers ought to be accepting the same obligations, in our model, to provide the same rates reductions into rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am particularly concerned about is that the minister has not yet given us the details with which to make the comparison between his proposal and my proposal, of which I have spoken to him, which is in an amendment form. Because we will not see that here in the chamber, because it is a disallowable instrument, I think there is an obligation on the minister to explain to the committee how it will work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, we need to get a clear definitional understanding of which markets are going to be in the averaging arrangement. Will it be the major metropolitan markets? Will it be a market definition that the minister himself will determine and put into the disallowable instrument and be able to change from time to time if he chooses? Of course, it is up to the House of Representatives to disallow it, but the debate on disallowance will always be in this place rather than in the House of Representatives, where the government has a majority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next issue I want to try and work out from the minister is: how is it averaged? Is it a running average? Is it a fixed average for a set period of time? For example, is the average immediately readjusted every time a phone call rate changes in one of your defined markets by 1c or 2c? And then is there a change in all of those averages? Or will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you, once you have set the figure in the disallowable instrument,  specify that the average sit for three months? Six months? Twleve months? When will it be reviewed? Will it be until there is a change in the pricing structure?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These details are not available to the chamber at the moment, in the committee stage. I believe there is a real deficiency in the ability of the Senate to make up its mind about which is the superior structure: ours, which is actually in legislation and, as the minister would use it, represents black letter law arrangements; or his, a disallowable instrument yet to be determined and yet to be explained to us. We would certainly like to know how you work out your averages. Is it a running average? Is it a permanent average? What is the period of time for it? I think those are reasonable questions that we hope you could answer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing that I want to raise and have clarified is this: in the major metropolitan markets&mdash;and I presume that there are going to be only the metropolitan markets&mdash;which ones will you determine will be where there is potential for competition? Are we just looking at the Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, and Brisbane markets? Are we putting Hobart in that market as a metropolitan capital city? Which of those markets are in the average? Is there any chance for some of the regional areas, such as the Illawarra, or Wollongong, to be in the market? You can absolutely fix this average according to who you put in the calculation. If there is no competition in a major market like Wollongong or Newcastle&mdash;markets that have 500,000 people and, in some cases, are bigger than Tasmania&mdash;you will jack the average up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a serious concern because we are not comparing apples with apples. You are asking us to take this on trust. You will tell us that it is a disallowable instrument&mdash;and though we can disallow it, if there is a Senate majority, we cannot amend it&mdash;and you will then come back with a variation. We all know that you will say to us, `If you disallow it and there is no instrument at all, there are no price cuts at all.' The advantage is always with the government on a disallowable instrument 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2012"> procedure in this case. We want some information about what you would expect to be the market in your averaging arrangement. What we are particularly concerned about is who would make the judgment from time to time on which markets are going to be used for the average.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another issue. We know, for example, that there is competition&mdash;or supposed competition&mdash;in, say, Sydney because Optus has offered the 20c call, once they get their telephony to work, and Telstra may match it. If Telstra goes down to 20c in Sydney but there is no competition, effectively, in Brisbane and they stay at 25c there, when you average it all out, the average price might be 23c or 22c across these markets. Even though Brisbane is defined for the purposes of averaging in the marketplace as a competitive market, will it automatically have its price reduced to the average for Telstra, irrespective of whether there is no competition?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is something that is still very unclear in the government's model as explained on the record. I have to say, Minister, I have appreciated the consultation and discussion with your officers on this and I think, as a result, I may have a better grasp of what your model is than other senators, particularly those from the minor parties. It seems to me that whatever claim you may make that we will not deliver the bigger reductions that equate with your model for the regional area, at least our model is in the legislation. At least it is transparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again I emphasise those examples of a regional specific nature that you raised and which I have called `the Ballarat example'. If the carrier&mdash;Telstra or Optus, or any other carrier&mdash;feels that that is not comparing apples with apples, that carrier can seek under regulation exemption to have that considered as a local call zone figure and that would have to be accepted as a local call zone figure for all other areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to emphasise again, Minister&mdash;although in some of your remarks you criticised me and the opposition for this&mdash;that we were not certain because, in 21(5)(b) of our amendment, we had established a review 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> process. On a number of occasions across the table over the last three days both of us have agreed that it is only reasonable to have reviews in a number of areas&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="ALSTON" NAMEID="LD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator Alston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is ongoing.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. It is ongoing. We have accepted that. It would be crazy not to in a deregulated market where we are not sure how it is going to work out. I accept that price discrimination is a major&mdash;if not the major&mdash;issue in the economics of this whole package. Even if I accepted your model I would still insist and argue for a review to be conducted in the year 2000. Even with your model of averaging, I am not sure whether&mdash;even if that got up&mdash;that it would deliver and whether it would not have some unintended consequences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is about openness and transparency for both the industry and the Australian consumer. In this deregulated model where competition is encouraged, we want to know and want to keep it under review&mdash;and it will be a function of a deregulated regime that there will be ongoing reviews. That is why the ACA, the ACCC and all of these areas in your own department are being established. We will probably have more ongoing reviews in this industry than we have had bad dinners together&mdash;or bad dinners separately, I should say. I do not think that we have had too many dinners together&mdash;or bad dinners together. If I said `good dinners together' that would be a very small number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You know as well as I do that a feature of this regime post&hyphen;July will be the endless reviews, and that is only appropriate. If there were not reviews&mdash;if there were not consideration after a period of time&mdash;we would be derelict as a parliament and you would be derelict as a minister in making sure that the system was working effectively, openly, and in a seamless and transparent way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, Minister, I again emphasise: I would like some information from you about how your model is going to work because we do not have that in detail before us. I would like to know how this process of averaging is going to work, and what the process will be for determining the markets that are going to be in the averaging arrangements, and wheth 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2013"> er the averaging will be a rolling average. Will it be for a set period that will be readjusted? All of these lead me to the view that you are less likely to deliver the substantial reductions that country people should get when there is proper competition in the city and therefore, again, I commend my amendment to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht has pointed out our concerns on this issue in quite a specific sense. I would like to make a brief comment in a more general sense. I put to you, Minister, that in the shape of the USOs provided for in this legislation, we all know that a significant proportion of Australia is cross&hyphen;subsidised under that universal service obligation. By virtue of the fact of this question of averages and how they are calculated affecting the pricing in country regions, surely this issue takes us to the heart of the integrity of how the USO applies in a truly competitive market. This amendment creates a situation where those advantages are spent right across Australia. If this amendment is not put in place, how does that reconcile with the fact that the USO actually provides for a spreading of the cost burden of providing services to these remote and rural areas? Obviously the specific regions we are talking about have been identified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To take that a step further, can you explain to the Senate precisely how you apply a competition policy that has its pricing and cost structures spread across the universal service obligation in a competitive environment to those areas where there is cross&hyphen;subsidisation under the USO? Surely by the nature of this legislation in applying a truly competitive environment you need to ensure that the carriers themselves cannot exploit the distinction between an area subject to a greater cross&hyphen;subsidisation and an area that is actually profit generating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, Senator Schacht has made some specific comments. I know mine are more general, but perhaps you can explain to the committee this overlaying of responsibility of the carriers and how the USO cross&hyphen;subsidisation, and hence those average costs, play back out into what we are trying to achieve, which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is genuine competition in all areas of telecommunications pricing in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was one other point that was not covered by the debate earlier today, and it relates to price reductions being primarily from technological developments. I just want to make that point, which I in fact suggested during my speech at the second reading stage. We know that price reductions are primarily due to changes in technology, and that is clearly evidenced in the history of telecommunications in this country so far. STD prices fell very dramatically right through the 1980s when there was no competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These gains in technology development are at risk from the proposals the government has made. We know that, in an ongoing sense, the carriers will be more and more able to deliver those lower prices due to their cost reductions. But what is likely to happen in the name of competition is that those savings will be passed on to a select group of people who live where the densities are in cities&mdash;we have already identified those people&mdash;and country people will again miss out. I just wanted to make that point before we finished.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Schacht and others have clearly demonstrated that we are not talking here about the death of competition&mdash;as the minister likes to suggest there will be as a result of these amendments. I think that it is probably time to wind up this debate, because it seems to me that most of the issues have now been adequately dealt with.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will elaborate on the way in which the model would work. An instrument would be made under the price cap arrangements in the Telstra Corporation Act to provide for equity in local call prices nationally by requiring price reductions in capital cities&mdash;I would envisage all capital cities being included, and possibly some other regional areas&mdash;where local competition is the most likely to occur, and for that to be reflected&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SCHACHT" NAMEID="4J4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator Schacht</NAME></TALKER>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2014"></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, where it is most likely to occur. You would include capital cities as a matter of course because they are the places where competition is most likely to  occur. There is no competition anywhere, as yet, on local calls. That would be reflected in the maximum untimed local call prices that Telstra could charge nationally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of actual price control arrangements, the following is proposed: in year one&mdash;that is, 1997&hyphen;98&mdash;Telstra's local call prices would be subject to an initial price ceiling&mdash;for example, 25c. Every 12 months, the revenue&hyphen;weighted average price of a Telstra untimed local call would be calculated where competition was occurring or likely to occur in the provision of local calls. This would reflect any reduction in local call prices across these areas. Every 12 months, the national local call price ceiling for Telstra would be replaced by the new revenue&hyphen;weighted average. Telstra would then have a short period, probably three months, to reduce local call prices in all areas where they would exceed the new cap to that level. Price control instruments are disallowable by parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is proposed that the competitive revenue&hyphen;weighted average would initially be calculated using data from all or specific mainland capital cities, including those areas where broadband cabling is being laid and where local call competition is most likely to develop in the short term. The geographic areas for the purposes of calculating the competitive revenue&hyphen;weighted average would need to be reviewed regularly, probably every two years, to ensure that competitive developments continued to be taken into account. The government would retain the power to reduce the national cap on the maximum price for an untimed local call below the revenue&hyphen;weighted average should this be considered appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where there was a universal service provider other than Telstra, the government would tie the maximum price it could charge for an untimed local call to the adjustments to Telstra's national cap. These pricing arrangements only need to apply to Telstra&mdash;or the universal service provider, should Telstra not have that obligation for an area&mdash;not other 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> local call service providers because Telstra's dominance in the market means that it is the price setter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of prohibiting price discrimination would be to severely chill competition by inhibiting Telstra's responding to vigorous competition in particular localised markets because of the revenue effects of having to drop prices across the board. As an example of how this would work, at the present time, as we know, 25c applies across the board. At the end of year one, if you had prices in Sydney of 22c, Melbourne 21c, Brisbane 23c and Adelaide 18c, the revenue&hyphen;weighted average calculated by dividing total revenue by the number of calls would fall to 21.4c. A new maximum applicable across the country for local calls of 21.4c would then be determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra would have three months to reduce all higher untimed local call prices to this level. Prices below the new maximum cap could stay below. Under the approach, Telstra is able to respond to competitive imperatives on a market&hyphen;by&hyphen;market basis. It is not deterred from offering 18c in Adelaide, because it does not face the cost&mdash;that is, loss in revenue&mdash;of having to offer 18c nationally. All consumers benefit however from competition forcing prices below the maximum cap as price competition is reflected in each successive new revenue weighted average. The lower prices go in competitive markets, the greater will be the reduction for all consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just add a few more things. The fact is that, ever since 1991, section 185(a)(ii) of the Telecommunications Act has provided for cost justified price differential. So do not be under any illusion that we are suddenly proposing that prices can vary both within Australia and within markets. They can, and it is provided for under the current legislation, and that is a reflection of precisely what we say is important now. You are wanting to regress, in effect, back to&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think you know that, if you hope to get anything out of competition, even under your model, you would expect local call prices to fall. Senator Allison seems to think that the only reason that prices fall is because of improvements in technology. Quite clearly they fall for productivity reasons&mdash;because of better work practices&mdash;and the key, of course, that competition delivers is to ensure that you do not simply have monopoly rents that are creamed off and not distributed to consumers. The purpose of having a price cap is to ensure that those benefits are passed on and distributed across the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you continue to have a maximum price cap there to protect consumers; you reserve the right to bring that down at any time. What you are trying to do here is, on the one hand, promote maximum competition, and then ensure that the benefits are distributed on a nationwide basis. But, if you do it on an across&hyphen;the&hyphen;board basis, that is absolutely the opposite of competition. That is not allowing any competition to occur, because the moment that you contemplate offering a reduced price to meet a local product, you have to offer it on a nationwide basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lundy is not here now, but she did ask how the USO could sit alongside the competitive model. The USO simply guarantees the standard telephone service, and that is not a function of competition. That is a function of a minimum standard being set by the parliament to ensure that everyone around Australia has access to a standard telephone&mdash;in other words, a handset that delivers the normal voice call. That has nothing to do with the level of prices. No&hyphen;one has ever pretended that this is a perfectly free market where players are able to do what they like. There is always a social overlay; that is why you have community service obligations and that is why we want a weighted average model to ensure that the real benefits of competition are distributed. There is a very big `if' there. You 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will not have those real benefits in the first instance, if you have this stultifying single standard across the board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although I agree with Senator Schacht that openness and transparency are important, it does not follow that because you have got a model that is readily understood, it is in any shape or form in the interests of consumers. It is just a logical inconsistency. It may be a great virtue to have a transparent model. It does not follow that it is in anyone's best interests. I am simply saying that you cannot claim that that therefore justifies you in taking an approach which is quite inimical to competitive price reductions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing else I wanted to say except to stress once again that, in the government's view, this is the single most important initiative contained in this package of bills. It is a very important process that we are embarking on. We are setting the environment post&hyphen;1997 against which we hope there will be a lot of new players coming into the marketplace. We want to provide them with every opportunity to compete, drive down prices and maintain quality of service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we can all be confident, on the basis of what has happened not only in this country but everywhere else, that you are very likely to see those sorts of benefits. But, once you start to put blockers into the system that fundamentally restrict the ability of players to offer deep discounts, because you want to regard them as national players by definition, you are tearing the heart out of the competitive model.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are proposing is not something the carriers want. It is very much something that they are opposed to, but it is a recognition of the social desirability of ensuring that benefits flow to non&hyphen;metropolitan areas. You can have the best of both worlds by going down this path, because you can ensure real benefits, ensure deep discounts and ensure that the bush gets the benefit. Under your model, you will get marginal incremental reductions across the board and that is not in anyone's best interests.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer is that a weighted average gives you a much truer reflection of what is actually happening in the marketplace. In other words, if you included Cairns, which has 5,000 subscribers, and you have a 10c call, it is pretty painless to offer that, but it does not really tell you much about the overall cost benefit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The concept of weighted average is to give a true reflection of the total picture. In the big markets the rewards are potentially greater and, therefore, the prospect of competition is greater and, therefore, the price reductions are likely to be higher. You can see that from Optus's offer of 20c calls I think only in Melbourne or Sydney, because that is where the real markets lie. It would distort it quite unfairly if somehow you found that you had a much lower figure in a small country town, say, Ballarat, where it is zero, or it may be zero for other reasons if you have bundling.</PARA></TALK.START>

Let us say that Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane are all 20c and Ballarat, which happens to be in your group, is 5c. The average of that&mdash;64 by four&mdash;is 16.

If you oblige them to pass on a very significant price reduction, which happens to be in a relatively small area because you have a straight line average, there is no reason to assume that they could afford to do that at all, because it might be much more expensive than a weighted average model would demonstrate. </PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been listening to these discussions very carefully. I originally thought that I may be supporting the opposition's amendment. I have been listening to the responses and the questions. Firstly, the bed of competition has been made, and I suppose that both the opposition and the government have to lie in it. If you take that as a starting point, the government's amendment fits within that particular schema better than the opposition's amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to take up that last point that Senator Schacht raised in regard to what are the factors that are going to be placed in the weighted average scales. That is something that I would certainly like to hear more about. If I cannot hear more about it, then they should be in some sort of amendable instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly&mdash;I do not know who raised it: I think it was Senator Allison or Senator Margetts; it might even have been Senator Schacht&mdash;if this particular amendment by the government is carried, the least that should be done is a review to see how it is going. After a period of couple of years, you must see how it is going. If this whole concept is one of the major planks of your legislation, Minister, then surely we really do need to see how that is operating, particularly how it is going to affect those who are not going to be able to share in the benefits of competition in other ways. You know who I mean. Everybody knows that is the bush&mdash;regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, what the minister is saying is that in local calls there are not going to be benefits shared by regional Australian USOs unless, at the very least, his amendment is adopted. Under those circumstances, when 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2018"> is the proof going to be in the eating of the pudding&mdash;if a pudding is going to be cooked&mdash;and when are we going to know?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I am inclined in the best of bad worlds to vote for the government's amendment, but I do feel that there are legitimate concerns in respect of what factors are going to be put into the scale for the weighted average and that these ought to be in legislation or in an amendable instrument.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the first thing to be said is that we are not trying to prejudge the extent to which there will be competition in the bush. It is very difficult to anticipate these things, and I suppose the reason we keep talking about Ballarat is that I happened to go there last week and launch this new product. In many ways it is a typical example of how, all of a sudden, Ballarat seems to be the testbed for regional Australia, when maybe six months ago you would have said, `Well, the bush is going to be left behind.' All of a sudden they are going to be the only people in Australia who will have free local calls to Northgate customers, and suddenly there is the prospect of untimed local calls between Ballarat and Melbourne, which is about 130 kilometres. So I would hope there will be a lot more pleasant surprises in terms of competition in the bush.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there are very encouraging signs in the US. Northgate, for example, together with Austar is talking about a billion dollar investment in Australia in the next couple of years. All of the signs in the US are that there is ferocious competition in regional areas. Indeed, Northgate's big claim is that they concentrate on regional areas. They are not interested in the capital cities. In the same way that there are companies out here now targeting rural areas for cable television, we are now starting to see companies that are targeting the rural areas for telephony.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What Northgate say, for example, is that they would anticipate at the present time that 50 per cent of their business would come from voice calls, 25 per cent of their business would come from cable television and 25 per cent of their business would come from data. Within five years they think it will be 50 per 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cent from data and only 25 per cent from voice calls. So you continue to see these sorts of revolutions. It is really only in those areas where you do not actually find competition emerging in the short term that they would then have to get the benefit of this weighted average model.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are particularly concerned to do is to ensure that it is passed on but that, in the first place, you get those significant reductions to pass on. I think what we are talking about here is a series of opposition amendments. Our model is already on the table, although it is in another act. The current legislative framework allows only for disallowable instruments. I think probably in the first instance we would take the view that this is such a major area of concern that you could not conceive of a situation where someone would disallow that and it would then be a vacuum. So in a practical sense I think there would have to be negotiations about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite clearly, as we said in the earlier exchange about reviews, I take the view that these things ought to be constantly under review. They should not be artificially under review in two years or four years&mdash;with people keeping their eyes closed until then and saying, `Who cares?' in the meantime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would be particularly sensitive about making sure that the benefits are passed on to the bush&mdash;and not just because of the National Party. We certainly have made quite a deal of noise about the importance of rural Australia because, after all, we have more seats in rural Australia than our National Party colleagues. I think everyone in this chamber is very determined to ensure that the bush does not get left behind. That is why we have already made a number of major announcements, such as the ISDN commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I will simply leave it on that basis but be conscious of what Senator Harradine said about the need to ensure that the parliament does have an opportunity to dissect the way in which this model is constructed and that we should all be prepared to revise our thinking on a regular basis. I am confident that will occur.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The purpose of this amendment is to enable Austel to develop performance standards without having to await ministerial direction. We think this is important because it can prevent a situation arising whereby the regulator can be arbitrarily constrained. This may well be the case at present. The Australian Democrats moved the same amendment during the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill, where it was opposed and defeated by the government. The government has argued that Austel should be prevented from making a standard unless directed to do so by the minister. This is because it may not be appropriate for all telecommunications services, such as services used by only large corporate customers, to be subject to performance standards. The government has thus proposed that the minister have the power to direct Austel to impose standards in relation to services where regulatory attention is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We agree that the minister should have the power to direct Austel in this manner. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2022"> also agree that it may not be appropriate for all telecommunications services to be subject to performance standards. We also pointed out, however, that we do not believe that this is best achieved by preventing Austel from acting without ministerial direction. There are other ways of ensuring inappropriate services are not regulated without unnecessarily constraining the regulator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with the government's proposal is that it may unnecessarily constrain the regulator from being proactive and acting in the best interests of customers in cases where the minister, for whatever reason, fails or chooses not to do so. The regulator will often be better placed than the minister to determine which services require regulatory attention. For this reason we see no reason for preventing the regulator from being proactive and from developing appropriate performance standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having to wait for ministerial direction could be problematic if the minister is, for whatever reason, disinterested or uninformed. It is my understanding that the minister has neither issued a direction to Austel to develop performance standards nor written to the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman to ask whether he will accept the power to issue evidentiary certificates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was way back on 19 December 1996, almost three months to the day, that the Telstra sale bill received royal assent, and the minister has still not acted to implement the CSG. This is the case even though the introduction of the CSG was one of the government's primary consumer protection measures and one which the minister praised so highly. If we cannot have the confidence in the minister to issue directions, then the regulator must be allowed to determine performance standards for the CSG without having to await ministerial direction.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am persuaded partly by the arguments of Senator Allison. I just want to find out from the minister why there is a hook, if there is one, in letting the ACA be proactive in the process of drawing up a standard. I cannot see what the hook would be to their making up a standard unless 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> directed by the minister, which is what part (3) of clause 224 is. Maybe this could be drafted in a way whereby the ACA can be directed by the minister to make up a standard but it says `must not make up a standard'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot see the reason for precluding them beginning the work and being proactive about it. I wondered if there is a particular reason or hook somewhere that I have missed. It does seem to be a very blanket objection to performance standards, which will be an issue around the place. I was just wondering whether the minister has a view about that.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the government's view is that there is no virtue in itself in being proactive. All parties need to be looking to improve the system but at the same time having regard to the cost implications. It is generally the responsibility of government to identify the priorities and the costs of a proposal. Certainly it can ultimately be disallowed by the parliament. I think in many respects you run the risk of the ACA embarking on an exercise which could be quite time consuming and, in terms of priorities, may not be the priority of government, or indeed the opposition for that matter, which then comes to nothing because it is disallowed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it seems to us that when there are significant cost implications, as there clearly are when you are imposing performance standards to help all consumers and therefore potentially imposing very significant cost burdens on the telecommunications carriers, that ought to be in accordance with policy rather than the regulator being off on a frolic of their own.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">We oppose this clause, which allows Austel to make provision for customers of carriers to waive in part or in whole their protection and rights under the customer service guarantee. This is the same amendment we moved during the debate on the Telstra (Dilution of Public Ownership) Bill when the customer service guarantee was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is ironic to be moving an amendment to remove the right of waiving the guarantee because the guarantee is not actually in operation. This is because the government is yet to undertake the necessary measures to implement it. This is the case even though the guarantee was legally approved some three months ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has argued that the waiver power is intended to provide customers with more choice. This supposedly enables carriers to offer cheaper prices for a service where a customer is prepared to waive some or all of their rights under this division. However, given the unequal bargaining power between carriers and customers, providing such a choice is questionable as we think it may lead to pressure being exerted on customers to forgo their rights. It is also uncertain whether the reference to a carrier offering cheaper prices for a service might not, in the case of Telstra, involve a breach of its obligation to provide services without discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the fact that the bill provides carriers with the flexibility to negotiate with customers the manner in which they discharge their liability when breaching performance standards should make the need for the right 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of waiver completely unnecessary. This in itself should go a long way to reducing unnecessary costs for carriers and providing customers with sufficient choice.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that the government is opposed to this amendment. I hear Senator Allison's empty rhetoric about unequal bargaining power and pressure to forgo rights. She does not give any examples of that. I would be absolutely amazed if she could point to examples of where consumers have effectively been forced under duress to forgo rights that were discretionary. What the Democrats are really saying is that they do not consider that Australian consumers are capable of making an informed judgment regarding customer service guarantees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They will be there as a matter of course. Every customer will be automatically entitled to access those rights to have the benefits of the customer service guarantee unless they consciously choose to do otherwise. The only reason they will do otherwise is, presumably, if they are offered a deal that they think is in their best interests. It is not difficult to imagine those sorts of offers forthcoming. If you are in any doubt, you do not accept them. I never hear it said that carriers are somehow going around twisting people's arms. I have not heard anyone complain that they were forced to subscribe to one carrier rather than another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happens is that they are exposed to such ferocious competition that, the minute they say they do not want to stay with a particular carrier, they are inundated with phone calls trying to induce them back.

It is not in any form intimidation or the exercise of pressure to forgo rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is sloganeering from another age. If you are not prepared to allow people to make that choice, you are essentially back in the bad old days of saying, `We don't care what you want to do.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendment 51 deals with deferring the AMPS phase-out. The government has given some, albeit minimal, recognition to the impact the phase-out of AMPS would have on those rural and remote users of the system who presently do not have GSM coverage. Without some concession, these people will be left without access to mobile telephony services until such time as digital coverage is provided. However, without any genuine incentive to provide mobile digital telephony services, such customers could well be left behind for a considerable period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Allowing for the possibility of AMPS to remain open for such persons provides a strong incentive to carriers to extend their digital coverage. However, the concessions provided by the government are, we think, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2031"> unnecessarily weak. Firstly, they require excessive hoops before any of the AMPS spectrum is retained. The Democrats believe this should be a much stronger requirement, and for this reason we have proposed that the AMPS spectrum remain open until such time as coverage of GSM is at least equal to that of the present AMPS system. This will ensure that GSM coverage in the bush occurs far more rapidly than it otherwise would because carriers who want the AMPS network phased out would undertake the necessary investment required for this to occur. Secondly, it will mean that at no stage will rural and remote Australians be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other concern we have is that, while the government has at least acknowledged the difficulties which the AMPS phase&hyphen;out will have for those rural dwellers who do not have access to digital, the same level of concern has not been afforded to disabled persons. For example, the Deafness Forum pointed out at the Senate committee which examined this legislation that at present most persons with hearing aid implants cannot use digital phones due to electromagnetic interference from them. Similar problems apply to persons with pacemakers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for this reason we do not believe the AMPS phase&hyphen;out should be finalised until problems of interference, particularly with medical equipment such as hearing aids and pacemakers, have been resolved. In this way those customers will continue to have access to mobile telephone services. This can reasonably be achieved by retaining at least a portion of the AMPS spectrum open across the board, at least for the specific use of such customers. This approach would also ensure that rural persons who do not have digital access in their place of residence can continue to use their phone while they travel, whereas under the government's proposal they would only be able to use it at specific locations where stations are still retained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other advantage is that it would create an incentive to ensure carriers and component manufacturers continue to voluntarily invest in research and development to overcome these interference problems.</PARA>

No doubt they would have been aware of that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have given all the reasons why we are opposed to the amendment. I did not hear Senator Allison respond to any of those, so presumably there is no need for me to go over them again. As far as any problems for the handicapped are concerned, I heard Senator Allison say, and I wrote it down, that the Deafness Forum told the Senate committee that those with hearing aid implants cannot use mobile phones and the same applies to those with pacemakers. If that is the case, what is the difference whether you have got analog or digital? It has got nothing to do with maintaining the analog service.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, she did not say it, if that is what she meant. Assuming that she is talking about digital, retention of the AMPS network is not expected to provide any benefits to hearing aid or pacemaker wearers as solutions to interference problems experienced when the digital phone technology was introduced have been found and are being implemented. Hearing aids that comply with Australian standard 1088.9 enable the use of a digital mobile phone to within one metre of the aid. Aids that comply with AS1088.9 are already available on the Australian market. Any person requiring the greater immunity this aid offers from all electronic and electrical interference, not just digital mobile phones, could upgrade now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2032">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Spectrum Management Agency is writing to the Therapeutic Goods Administration asking them to consider mandating the standard. Mandatory requirements would be phased in over a two&hyphen; to three&hyphen;year period to ensure that aids that do not comply with the standard are not made obsolete overnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The future development of AS1088.9.C.2 will allow a hearing aid wearer to use a digital mobile phone, placing the phone against the ear, not using the hands&hyphen;free attachments that are currently available for some models of phones. Aids that meet these specifications are now being developed. Pacemakers used in Australia, if subjected to electromagnetic interference, will revert to backup, that is, the pacemaker's baseline program. The pacemaker will not stop working. Once the interference goes away, the pacemaker will revert to its normal program. Pacemakers that offer higher immunity from electromagnetic interference from digital mobile phones and other radiocommunication transmitters have been developed and show marked improvement in immunity levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons, we are opposed to this amendment. I stress, which I do not think Senator Allison did, that she is saying that, if you do not have coverage from 1 July, which is only a few months away, AMPS ought to be able to continue. It is simply a backdoor way of doing what the earlier amendment was designed to do but probably it would cause more chaos in the process.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to make some comments on the government's proposals that come some way to sorting out some of the problems with this phase&hyphen;out. The process we have is a very elaborate one. It allows potentially for some rural and remote customers to continue to have access to AMPS, but only at very limited sites. It also requires fairly elaborate consultation procedures, and I might say these are with the AMPS carriers but not with the non&hyphen;AMPS carriers. It would be interesting to know why it was that they were not to be consulted. I think our amendment provides for a much stronger guarantee for rural users and it covers the needs of those people with hearing disabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister also likes to say that the phase&hyphen;out of analog would cost hundreds of millions. Last year there was an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> which challenged this. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government is saying if it does not phase out analog mobile phones it will face huge compensation payouts to digital operators.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It also reports an Optus spokesperson as saying that the company regards the contract as binding. The journalist in this case said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Optus did not pay $800 million for its digital cellular licence at the time it received the second wire&hyphen;line carrier licence. Digital was just on the drawing board. That $800 million licence fee was not for a mobile network, let alone a digital one. Optus bought the rights to duplicate Telstra's cable network, and to soften the blow the government added the existing domestic satellite service Aussat debt free as a sweetener. The satellites alone were worth $800 million. Optus also has the right to build the second analog cellular phone network in competition with Telstra. But for complex reasons which the writer has gone into in the past, Telstra and Optus then worked out a deal to share the analog MobileNet service with the proviso that Optus could later build its own digital network. Optus still earns hundreds of millions of dollars each year from the analog network.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition does not support the amendments moved by the Democrats. I do note the interest taken by Senator Stott Despoja. I think that probably has a personal consideration about it which I think is quite reasonable to raise. The evidence we received at the committee about this interference for people with hearing aids, which has already been covered, is something which cannot be walked away from and cannot be ignored. However, I do not think we can move to leave an analog system going across Australia. We should be directed at making sure the industry gets the standards right, the technical side right, in GSM. If you do not do that, in various areas&mdash;maybe not necessarily in this area, but I suspect it probably would be&mdash;people with disability will end up with a

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, we support the amendments. They are in line with the committee's recommendation and deal with an issue that came up in evidence about the role of Standards Australia. There has always been some criticism around about the role of Standards Australia, which is not a government statutory authority or anything like it. It is actually a private commercial operation that brings together under its arrangements industry players to draw up standards. There have often been complaints that there is a bit of in&hyphen;club on the standards process, whereas with the 60 days, there are plenty of opportunities for people who believe they are outside the in-house club to have a chance to put their view. I think it is an excellent process. We support the amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, I accept the expansion of the wording. I trust that you are able to use that expansion to convince the Treasurer to increase the appropriation in the budget. We wish you well in the ERC on that. You have good support from your officers from the department about the several million dollars that will be needed in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a view that was raised and discussed by some of the consumer organisations; that is, that this money should be raised as a condition of a licence or a levy on the licence, so that the carriers fund it. As I understand it, there are some constitutionality problems in doing it that way. I still believe carriers ought to make a contribution. I think it is in their own interest to be involved in this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I would put it to you that, as far as the opposition is concerned, we do not see it as unreasonable to say that, if you may not be able to put a direct levy on it, you may be able to hypothecate an equivalent increase in the licence fee of carriers and make that money available for the purposes outlined in the actual amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the issues is really important here. While Telstra was a monopoly and even the dominant carrier, they accepted the need&mdash;maybe reluctantly, but they did it accept it&mdash;and provided money to consumer organisations for research, for a consumer voice to be appropriately heard. Quite rightly, they say that now in a competitive environment with other carriers they should not be expected to carry the load to fund&mdash;even though they are still the dominant carrier&mdash;the social research and the consumer research of those organisations for other carriers. I think they have a perfectly valid point on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also believe that it is not unreasonable, and certainly you have our support, Minister, if over a period of time you want to hypothecate an increase in the carriers' levy. It would not be a substantial amount compared with the revenues of the carriers. The carrier with a revenue of $15 billion, Telstra, has profits of nearly $3 billion. I think a small contribution of only a few million dollars from Telstra&mdash;maybe less than $5 million per 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2039"> annum&mdash;and from Optus, which is rapidly getting revenues of a couple of billion dollars, a proportionate hypothecation of their licence fees would be easier for you to argue in the ERC with the Treasurer than a straight appropriation from the government's revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I accept the minister's expansion of the second dot point. I hope that it does not mean that there is such a call on these moneys that everyone ends up with so little that it makes it ineffective. This really was about consumer representation&mdash;consumer bodies being able to be in a position to vigorously protect consumer interests in a deregulated market. We accept the government's amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats strongly welcome these amendments by the government and will be supporting them. Although they are not as strong as they potentially could be, they are a very important step forward because they recognise that the industry development plans, as initially proposed, needlessly limited their effectiveness as a tool of industry policy and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> weakened the government's ability to extract desired outcomes for industrial development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was pointed out in the Democrats' minority report, which recommended that, where possible, enforcement of the plans was essential as, otherwise, preparation and monitoring of the plans would be futile. These amendments ensure that matters to be included in the carrier industry development plans are set out in more detail and, in particular, that they include matters in relation to meeting the needs of people with disabilities. Moreover, these amendments allow the industry minister to impose requirements in relation to research and development activities that must be complied within the carrier industry development plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the government for having the courage to take this, albeit small, step in encouraging more and more foreign firms&mdash;which Telstra's competitors invariably are, and will continue to be&mdash;to come to Australia. However, this will do very little to boost our image as a regional centre for innovation and for research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, a high level of foreign ownership actually contributes to low business expenditure on R&amp;D because subsidiaries of multinational corporations are able to source their technology requirements from their parent companies. Given that they usually have large R&amp;D facilities located at their home base, they have little incentive to undertake operations of much significance in their subsidiaries. If giant, foreign based firms dominate the market in an R&amp;D intensive industry such as telecommunications, and are allowed to operate as they please, massive opportunities for the Australian community will be forfeited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government must continue to encourage and, wherever possible, exert pressure on such multinationals to undertake core business activities in Australia. This is something we should demand in return for giving them a carrier licence. The Democrats recommended that compliance with an industry development plan should be expected in all ways, other than any rendered ineligible under the WTO. Instead, the government amendments solely focus on R&amp;D.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, then a penalty applies. I am not going to try and forejudge whether a particular part of the plan is inconsistent. First of all, there has to be agreement between the industry minister and carrier as to what the plan is. The carrier may say it is too onerous, even though these are guidelines laid down covering a whole range of things. The industry minister may well agree. The things which you have accepted in the description are not all mandatory. We are told:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plan must include any relevant particulars of the carrier's strategic commercial relationship including (but not limited to) . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plan must include any relevant particulars of the carrier's activities in relation to research and development, including (but not limited to) matters in connection with . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not find that giving absolute detail because no one would expect them to guarantee an arrangement. They could discuss it with the industry minister. The industry minister may say, `I see what you are doing in that area. You have put forward a plan about arrangements relating to a technology transfer to Australian industry. That is not relevant in this plan. Therefore, it is not binding.' But when they agree what the plan 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is and, in accordance with this list of criteria, there is agreement, then the carrier is bound to comply with them. The minister might say, quite rightly, `I think there should be some things in this area of your plan to give them a bit of stick as well as a bit of carrot, to get an industry development program going that is expansive, that delivers the jobs to Australians and economic wealth to Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have tried to avoid criticism in respect of breaking WTO arrangements. Secondly, paragraph (1) my amendment 11A does not try to be specific, and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If an industry development plan of a carrier is current, the carrier must comply with . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But the plan has to be agreed to by the minister. If the minister for industry says, `This first draft of the plan you have put forward is not acceptable,' then both sides will have to negotiate an extension or improvement of an agreement. The real issue is that the plan has to be agreed to. Those of us who have been involved in the past in these areas know that some parts of plans have not been forthcoming and have not been carried through. Carriers&mdash;and one in particular&mdash;have been able to ignore what they previously promised.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem is that industry plans are meant to be a basis for carriers giving an indication of their general intentions in a whole range of areas that would affect industry development. Once you start to make those plans across the board&mdash;not just R&amp;D but virtually everything that breathes in the running of a business in this country&mdash;subject to potentially very severe penalties, there will be a very significant inhibition placed on a carrier in volunteering things into an industry plan. They do not really know whether it is consistent or inconsistent with WTO until after the event. But assuming they are held to be consistent with, there is a very significant risk on their part that they will unintentionally infringe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could go through a very complicated process in determining the extent to which they have complied with each element of an industry plan that is as broad and varied as the one we have described. If all of those 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2044"> activities are to be potentially subject to serious financial penalty, it seems to us to mean that you will simply create an environment of uncertainty which will distort the content of the carrier's industry plans. Rather than having them come forward with their best endeavours, what you will get is simply a low level indication of their true plans because they will be afraid that they might otherwise be penalised.</PARA></SPEECH>

I have to acknowledge that the government has made a major shift from its original position, and that has been an important step for industry development.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats share the concern of the Australian Telecommunications Industry Association that there is a lack of criteria against which the industry minister may decide to give an exemption from the industry development obligation. The majority committee report expressed the view that legislative entrenchment of such criteria may not be appropriate. Under these circumstances, the Democrats are of the view that ad hoc arrangements under which certain carriers would be able to circumvent industry development requirements should not be permitted. This can only lead to inequitable treatment of carriers on an ad hoc basis and it opens up scope for political patronage, favouritism and corruption in our view.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, unless it is covered somewhere else, this cannot be a controversial amendment, because what it is requiring is that the ACA must not grant a licence unless the applicant has given a current industry development plan to the industry minister and the industry minister has approved the plan. This is making sure that when they put the licence in&mdash;whether it is existing post 1 July&mdash;we are almost charging them a nominal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2046"> fee, a peppercorn fee, to be a licensed carrier. I think it is a very small fee indeed. But the one thing the licence application does do is that before it is granted the industry minister must approve it. Because once he grants the licence your ability to get an industry plan is going to be compromised, because they will then be operating and it is going to be impossible to say, `We are going to take the licence from you after you start operating and providing services to consumers.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, it seems to me, Minister, that this is not an unreasonable proposition to make sure that all carriers do provide a plan and get approval for it from the industry minister. If you can tell me that it is covered somewhere else, then fine. But if it is not, I cannot see how you can object, and we certainly would support the amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem with amendment 54 is that it would essentially require an industry plan to be provided as a condition precedent to the granting of a licence, irrespective of whether or not the carrier was in the business of being engaged in industry and therefore requiring an industry development plan. If it simply owned a small amount of technology, then it would be a carrier but it would not necessarily be in the building business or the expansion business. To be a carrier, all you need to do is own a bit of piping more than five kilometres long. You do not have to be in the business of building, expanding an industry, or employing people, for that matter. You can simply be the owner and therefore a passive investor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There would be no need for you in those circumstances to provide an industry plan. This would become a significant barrier to entry. It might also undermine Australia's position with its trading partners. Our amendment No. 207 allows the industry minister to impose requirements that relate to the R&amp;D activities of carriers and we have just dealt with that. The industry minister is the one who is best placed to make judgments about whether there is a need for a plan and whether to grant exemptions. What the Democrats want to do is to remove any discretion to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> grant exemptions and they want everyone to put in an industry plan, irrespective of whether they are in the business. It just seems to us to be mindlessly bureaucratic.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have thought that a carrier has an important role. You are giving a carrier a licence and carriers get certain advantages once they get a licence in Australia, even under the deregulated regime. They are not service providers. They get certain advantages as a carrier. Even if they are a small carrier, it is not unreasonable that they submit something with their licence at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the minister implies that the so&hyphen;called small carriers are going to be exempt from a policy, then I suspect that we, as opposition, will be in here making a lot of disallowances because we believe that the quid pro quo for having a deregulated competitive market&mdash;which has a lot of advantages to a carrier&mdash;is the development of an Australian telecommunications industry so that jobs are created in Australia. Then we create critical mass, so that some of these carriers, whether they are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2047"> Australian or not, actually start exporting, as well. I do not think that it is unreasonable to say that no matter how big or small you are, at the time you lodge your application to be a carrier, you have to give some indication of what your industry plan is and have that approved by the minister for industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not opposed to the industry minister having a power of exemption&mdash;which is section 5&mdash;but I am very concerned that, firstly, carriers might not have to lodge any plan at all until 90 days afterwards. Once they get a licence, it is much harder to say what the plan is. It really is shutting the stable door after the horse is more than well out. We all know that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not an amendment I brought forward, but I have to say that the Democrats amendment replacing 4 with theirs is not unreasonable. You still have the exemption in 5&mdash;a disallowable instrument&mdash;and the Senate can determine whether it is a fair exemption being given and it can debate that. But we let every carrier know, no matter how big or small, that the Australian telecommunications industry is one that we want to create jobs in. We have a commitment to develop Australia in this area for jobs, and to get into exports, so that the growth in this industry will not continue to be an extraordinary drain or a deficit on the current account figures that come out every month. Over a year for telecommunications that runs into billions of dollars.</PARA>

Beyond that, I am sure the ACA would have a reasonable view of the world; it would simply say that you need records that are sufficient to provide information about the kinds and location of telecommunications transmission towers. Whether they do that by going out and taking films, whether by cartoons and sketches or by descriptive essays is all a matter for the ACA.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendment 56 deals with the definition of overhead line. The purpose of our amendment is to ensure that immunity from state and territory environment and planning laws is not extended to telecommunication lines under 13 millimetres in diameter and that local government approval is required for such installations. The government has argued that a size based definition is preferable to a service based definition if the source of concern is visual impact. This may or may not be true. But it is no reason why cables of less than 13 millimetres in diameter should not be the cause of concern, I would suggest. Nor is it clear if there is anything which would prevent multiple carriers from rolling out multiple cables of less than 13 millimetres in diameter. I do not think there is. I think this is a very legitimate source of community concern.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Local Government Association has warned that it is unclear how a court may, for instance, interpret the definition&mdash;that is, whether the 13 millimetres applies to just a single cable or to a bundle of cables plus any supporting wires or to the cables within a bundle. The ALGA has also raised concern that, contrary to the conventional view, the aerial broadband cable that is currently rolled out may be smaller than 17 millimetres in diameter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALGA has discussed this issue with all of the major cable manufacturers in Australia, as I understand, and it has found that there is in fact a great variety of cables with different diameters which are currently being used. It is the ALGA's understanding that a variety of cables all under 13 millimetres are currently being rolled out. This being the case, we do not believe that a size based definition should be utilised. Perhaps the minister can indicate the purpose behind stipulating 13 millimetres and also address some of the matters I have raised. Is there an arbitrary figure or does this relate to some other cables?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Optus broadband cable is generally 17 millimetres in dimension. The Telstra broadband cable is generally 14 millimetres in cross-section. The standard telephone service line is generally significantly less than 13 millimetres, normally around 10 millimetres. It is therefore a point designed to differentiate between ordinary telephone lines, which are in themselves I would have thought very difficult to identify or single out as having any significant impact on the environment, and the ordinary hybrid fibre coaxial overhead cabling embracing both broadband cable and telephony wiring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consistent with the approach that the Democrats have taken to all of this, they simply do not want to see, in any shape or form, anything overhead when it comes to telecommunications. But of course you continue to have electric power lines up there. So, quite clearly, you will continue to have visual detriment even if your view of the world prevailed overnight. What this is designed to do is to try to strike a balance 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2060"> between normal telephony cabling and new technology cabling which is being rolled out at the present time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To accede to your approach, which of course does not even pretend to draw a line&mdash;it simply produces the dimension to zero and it does it immediately because it inserts it in the designated overhead line definition, so in one fell swoop you also remove the transitional provisions&mdash;you are essentially just going down the same old path saying, `By hook or by crook we are not going to allow anything to go overhead.' I think there are some much greater implications for that proposal than you are prepared to concede.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has significant economic implications not just for the carriers and those who might invest in them but for all those citizens who do make a conscious choice that they would prefer to have overhead cabling and all that goes with it in terms of access to competitive technologies, new local call services, cable television, the Internet and the like. There are a number of people around Australia, a number of councils around Australia, who have made that decision. But what you would do is simply say, again, `Irrespective of what your preference or your choice is, we are going to tell you what we want to do. We are not concerned that the carriers might have committed themselves to multibillion dollar roll-outs. We are not prepared to allow any transitional arrangements.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports this amendment from the Democrats. In the next part of the debate we are going to get into the bedevilling issue of immunities powers because of the issue of overhead cables. In the Senate committee hearings it was quite clear that the definition&mdash;that is, the reason for the 13 millimetres&mdash;was quite arbitrary: this is the thickness, as we know technology at the moment, of broadband cable for on-line services. For a mixture of on-line services Telstra's is 14 millimetres&mdash;the minister has said that&mdash;and Optus's is 17 millimetres. The minister has also said that for the standard telephony cable the copper wire is under 10 millimetres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been made quite clear that any existing cable less than 13 millimetres hanging anywhere in Australia continues to hang there because that is exempt under the provisions of the various parts of this bill. That is existing infrastructure, like existing overhead broadband cables. They stay. That is what the bill says. So we are not talking about ripping down any cable that has already been laid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not have a scare campaign that carriers will have to go out and pull down existing even thin telephony cable or copper wire which is less than 10 millimetres. It has to be quite clearly stated that we are not ripping anything down and that no carrier will be forced to. What we are saying is that from now on&mdash;from 1 July or, if the minister wins his amendment, 30 September&mdash;you will not be able to put up new thin cable less than 13 millimetres for any purpose unless you get agreement through the planning processes that this bill also is yet to consider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Telstra, the major carrier, over many years now has progressively, particularly in rural areas and in most cities, undergrounded its telephony thin cable. I grew up in the bush in Gippsland in the 1950s when down every road opposite the electricity wires was a telephone system with dozens of copper pairs running on them for the local telephone 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2061"> system. Over the years Telstra of its own volition, because it is economically more feasible to do it and for the purposes of maintenance, has put all those cables underground in rural Australia. In most city areas they have done the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my street, which was built in the 1960s, the copper wire for my telephone comes underground to the front of my house, goes up an electricity pole and then hangs as a thin wire coming into the house. If this amendment by the Democrats is carried, Telstra does not have to come round and pull that cable down, because it is already there. But if in future they want to go into a suburb and say, `We're going to hang thin telephony cable around,' for any reason, less than 13 millimetres, they have got to get planning approval. So it should be. There should be no exemption on this. Whatever the level of angst&mdash;some people say it is very strong to modest to very mild&mdash;the community is overwhelmingly fed up with the argument about cables.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was Bob Hawke's policy speech day. You might say that was also Ash Wednesday for the Liberal Party. Nevertheless, what was interesting was that, throughout the extraordinary devastation that took place in rural South Australia, the telephone system still worked. Why? All the wire was underground. It was electricity that fell over. Electricity actually started the bushfires in many cases when live wires in the wind crossed each other, created sparks and started the bushfire. Telephony still existed. You could ring almost anywhere around South Australia because the wires were already 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> underground in rural areas, in the main trunk lines between towns and so on. Telstra have done that of their own volition for the past 40 years because it is economic for them to do so and the best way for them to achieve a service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are saying is that, even in the few areas where they have thin telephony wires less than 13 millimetres hanging, this bill does not make them put them underground. Later on, from 1 July or 30 September&mdash;we will debate that later&mdash;if they want to put an overhead wire up for whatever reason, whether it be telephony or broadband services, it has to go through the normal planning services, whether it is the minister's plan or the opposition's plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot see any reason why we cannot make the change the Democrats have proposed. The 13 millimetres is arbitrary as between broadband and telephony. Of course, with technology development, digital compression and whatever else, it may be at some stage within the next two or three years quite possible to run a broadband service on a cable of less than 13 millimetres. It might be a new style cable. It might actually be a pure fibre cable, optic fibre cable, which is very thin, even with its insulation. Under this provision, that could be strung out across Australia without any planning because it is exempt. I do not think the community would put up with it.

It does not matter whether it is a broadband cable, a thin cable&mdash;whichever style and size of cable it is, it has to get the approval of the local council. Minister, you have banned it in your own legislation. For broadband cables, it says that unless the councils agree, you are dead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2062">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that it ought to be the same for thin cable because within three or four years thin cable may well be a broadband service. Therefore the same conditions ought to apply. The problem we have now is that, basically, no council trusts the carriers because of what has gone on in the last three years with this overhead cable. That has been a terrible happening in that the community is taking out its antagonism against telecommunications generally because of the way in which the overhead cables have been used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that this is quite a reasonable amendment. It does not mean any existing cable has to be pulled down. It just means that any new cable that goes up after, I hope, 1 July under our amendment, has to get council approval. If they can convince the council, whether rural or city, that a thin cable is okay&mdash;less than 13 millimetres or any size&mdash;that is their decision. But by having this in here, it means that 13 millimetres is exempt and that a carrier can put it up without any consideration for local community feeling or local council planning arrangements.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of days ago, while I was sitting here hearing the debate, I did a little picture of a tree with a Dagwood Bumstead haircut. We have all seen them. I have got them around a side street at home: trees with lines going through them because, if it has escaped the minister's attention, communication lines do not sit there and float in thin air. They have got poles. They have to be free from the trees. All this means that those leafy suburbs that exist now make other suburbs look as if they are going to be condemned never to be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> able to have a streetscape in the front of their yards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not a small thing. It is an important thing. Amenity&mdash;the way people feel about their suburbs and the way people feel about their community&mdash;is actually affected by the way the streetscape develops. People are putting a lot of effort into changing streetscapes so they work better for communities. I think it is a dreadful thing to condemn all communities, from now until it is changed, if ever, to not being able to enjoy that amenity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know the situation where, even if it was just a matter of the width of the band, you can create several ply by putting several 10 millimetre cables together, making one big rope and saying, `Look, that's all right. We have got 10 millimetre cables but they are just twisted.' So there are issues here about the misuse of regulations and also ones about the community choosing. In case it has escaped the minister's attention, local government associations actually do end up covering the whole of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in the community are choosing at the moment. They are saying, `We would choose to have regulations so that we do get to be asked.' If the communities want it, they will still say yes. You are trusting them to make that decision with regard to thicker cables. If the thinner cables go to communities for decision, some communities will say, `That's okay.' But why should they be exempt?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why don't you also trust the communities to be able to decide, as they do with the thicker cables? Why don't you say, yes, there is a reasonable case for allowing communities to make their own decisions about their streetscapes in the future, and for them to be able to say, `Okay, from now on we will act responsibly and will allow community amenity to be developed and trees to be developed in the future.'?

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2063"> sceptical of the notion that overhead TV cabling will never be less than 13 millimetres.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all realised the minute we saw this legislation that there would probably be no problem for the carriers at all to continue to roll out their aerial cables as they have in the past. Once again, you have removed the ability of councils and communities to do or say anything about that.

In your opening remarks you launched into your normal tirade of abuse by suggesting that the Democrats were going to cause havoc with this amendment by requiring all overhead cabling to be put underground.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 (the Tariff Act) to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages which contain distilled alcohol, including spirits, regardless of their alcohol content. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under item 2 of the Schedule to the Tariff Act, "spirituous beverages" are subject to duties of excise, which are calculated at a dollar amount per litre of alcohol in each beverage. The term was introduced into the Tariff Act in 1985 with the intention of making excisable any beverage that contained a spirit. Since that time, all such beverages have been treated as excisable regardless of their alcohol content, including beverages whose alcohol content ranges from 5% to 9% (for example the rum and cola mixer drinks).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In November 1994, Carlton and United Breweries (CUB) commenced the manufacture of the product known as "Subzero Alcoholic Soda" which had an alcohol content of approximately 5.5%. The Australian Customs Service (the ACS) considered "Subzero" excisable under sub&hyphen;item 2(H) of the Schedule to the Tariff Act as a spirituous beverage. CUB appealed the decision of the ACS to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 7 June 1996, the AAT determined that the production of "Subzero", with such a low alcohol content by volume, could not be described as spirituous and was therefore not excisable under sub&hyphen;item 2(H). The decision was based on what the AAT considered is commonly regarded as the definition of "spirit" in the community, which is a strong alcoholic liquor usually containing not less than 37% alcohol by volume. The ACS is appealing this decision to the Federal Court</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the AAT decision, CUB has ceased manufacturing "Subzero" using alcohol derived by distillation. However, there are several other companies (UDA, Remy Australia, Swift &amp; Moore and Angove) who manufacture beverages of low alcohol content which are based on, for example, brandy or whisky. The ACS has continued to impose excise duty under sub&hyphen;item 2(H) on these beverages as they are considered by the ACS to be spirituous beverages. The payments of excise duty by these other manufacturers are being made under deposit in accordance with section 154 of the Excise Act 1901 on the basis that, since the AAT "Subzero" decision, these manufacturers allege that these beverages are no longer excisable. Prior to this decision, all producers of beverages containing distilled alcohol had been paying duty on the alcohol content of the beverage. There was no dispute with manufacturers of the low alcohol beverages using distilled alcohol as to their excisability or their proper classification to sub&hyphen;item 2(H) of the Schedule to the Tariff Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to ensure the continuing excisability of all beverages containing distilled alcohol, it is proposed to amend the Tariff Act to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) delete all references to "spirituous beverages" in the Schedule and item 2 (item 1 of Schedule 1 refers); and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2065">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) clarify that excise liability is imposed upon all beverages which contain distilled alcohol (new sub&hyphen;item 2(H), item 2 of Schedule 1 refers).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The combination of these amendments will remove any connotation that there is a minimum strength that an alcoholic beverage must be before it will be excisable. All such beverages will continue to be excisable regardless of their alcohol content and the excise duty will be calculated according to the alcohol content of the beverages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also proposed that the amendments will take effect on and from 3 February 1996. The effect of the retrospective commencement date of the amendments will be to extinguish all rights of appeal to the AAT in relation to the excisability of low alcohol beverages and all rights to refunds of excise duty in respect of such beverages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commencement of the amendments on this date is considered justifiable on the following grounds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) The intention of the term "spirituous beverages" was to make excisable any beverage that contained a spirit and there had never been any dispute as to this intention prior to the "Subzero" case. It is considered that the amendments are not altering the law with respect to alcoholic beverages as it stood at the time of the "Subzero" decision. They are merely clarifying what was the status quo. It is, therefore, considered appropriate that the amendments commence on 3 February 1996 to remove the technical loophole which was uncovered in the Tariff Act by that decision and which this amending legislation is now removing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The commencement of the amendments on 3 February 1996 will not require the retrospective recovery of any excise duty from the manufacturers of the alcoholic beverages. The excise duty has continued to be paid by the manufacturers, under deposit, and the 3 February 1996 commencement will protect the government against all claims for recovery of this duty. If the amendments do not commence on 3 February 1996, however, the government might be liable to pay $12.6 million in refunds of excise duty if the Federal Court confirms the AAT decision in favour of CUB. Given that the products manufactured by these companies have been sold duty paid, such a favourable decision to the companies would represent a windfall gain to them, with little chance that it would be returned to the consumers of the product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments, including their financial impact, are outlined in greater detail in the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned until the first day of sitting in the winter sittings 1997, in accordance with standing order 111.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 6 March 1997, the Senate referred the two Bills to the Committee for inquiry and report by the last sitting day of this week. Following approaches to businesses and other organisations with a known interest in the EMDG 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Scheme, the Committee received 48 written submissions commenting on a number of provisions of the EMDG Bill. Further evidence was received at public hearings conducted in Canberra on 17 March.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The EMDG Bills repeal the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 and replace the Act with new simplified legislation for a revised EMDG Scheme. In media releases on 20 August and 16 December 1996 and in his Second Reading Speech in the House of Representatives, the Minister for Trade, the</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hon Tim Fischer MP, said that the Bill increases the focus on assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises. Funding for the revised scheme will also be capped at $ 150 million whereas the current scheme is open access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Witnesses generally welcomed the simplification of the EMDG Scheme as laid out in the EMDG Bill compared to the current legislation which has been much amended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, a number of areas of concern in the EMDG Bill were expressed in submissions and in evidence at the public hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee received considerable criticism of clause 54 of the EMDG Bill, which provides that trusts are no longer eligible to apply for grants under the EMDG Scheme. This provision was criticised on two grounds:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> discrimination against businesses which used a trust as their legal business structure; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the retrospectivity of the provision as it applies to business expenses incurred from 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was pointed out that trusts are a legitimate business structure and that many small businesses adopt the trust structure on professional accounting and legal advice. A number of witnesses told the Committee that, because of the exclusion of trusts in the EMDG Bill, they had already cut expenditure or were proposing to do so, which would have the effect of reducing export marketing and hence the level of future exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee understands that the inclusion of trusts in the EMDG Bill would add some further complexity to the Bill but believes that any consequential loss in simplicity is overridden by the benefits accruing to SMEs, the main target group identified by the Government for this revised scheme. Trusts are used by small and medium-sized businesses and so the exclusion of trusts would hurt the Government's main target group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The retrospective nature of the exclusion of trusts from the revised EMDG Scheme drew strong criticism in written submissions and from witnesses at the public hearings. When the Government first 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2067"> announced in August 1996 its proposed revision of the EMDG legislation, it foreshadowed many of the proposed changes to the scheme. However, no mention was made of the proposed exclusion of trusts. It was not until 16 December 1996, when the Government released the draft bill for public comment that businesses became aware that trusts would be excluded. By that time, it was almost half way through the financial year and trusts which would reasonably have expected to receive an EMDG grant for expenses already incurred then faced the prospect of having to find additional funds to cover those expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government encouraged trusts to incorporate so that they might become eligible for an EMDG grant. The Committee received evidence that some trusts have established a corporate structure but this is not necessarily an easy or cheap option for trusts. Austrade has also confirmed that trusts which incorporate during this financial year are precluded by the legislation to claim expenses for the part of the year prior to their incorporation. The Committee recommended that the Bill be amended to enable trusts which incorporate this year to be able to claim eligible expenses in respect of the whole year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the Government's emphasis on the refocusing of the EMDG Scheme to help small and medium-sized enterprises, the Committee believes that the government should reconsider reinstating trusts to the revised scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under clause 34 of the EMDG Bill, expenses of air fares associated with international marketing visits are now ineligible after a second grant. This two year limit on air fare expenses was strongly criticised in the evidence because international travel was regarded as essential for developing and expanding export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry associations which made submissions and gave evidence to the Committee sought special dispensation for approved organisations, should air fares remain excluded when the bill is enacted, to remove the two-year limit for their promotional activities on behalf of small businesses which cannot attend major trade fairs and other promotional meetings overseas. These associations said that they did not have the financial resources to maintain such promotional activities if they were ineligible to claim air fare expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is clear to the Committee that two-grant limitations on air fare expenses may have an adverse effect on the ability of SMEs to develop export markets. It can take a long time for Australian exporters to break into some overseas markets, including some in our region. Personal contact is essential in all markets but particularly in Asian countries. Evidence given the Committee indicates that inclusion of the two-year limitation would retard efforts to expand our export drive and even 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> put at risk existing export arrangements. As with many of the restrictions placed on the scheme in the EMDG Bill, the Government's main target group, SMEs, would be affected by the exclusion of air fare expenses after two EMDG grants. Given that the EMDG Scheme will be capped, there is no financial penalty for the Government in removing this limitation. The Committee recommends that clause 34 of the EMDG Bill be amended to permit the claiming of air fares after a second grant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of other submissions and witnesses, both small and medium enterprises as well as national organisations, supported the continued eligibility of expenditure on patent registration and trade marks. This is another area of the EMDG Bill which affects SMEs in their efforts to break into new markets and develop existing markets overseas, which is contrary to the spirit of the legislation as articulated by the Minister for Trade on a number of occasions. The fact that the scheme is capped means that allowing patent costs as an eligible expense in the Bill would not increase Government expenditure and enhance opportunities for export of unique Australian products rather than restrict exports of those products or force their producers to move offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many submissions expressed concern about areas of the Bill which gave Austrade discretionary powers which are not contained in current legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having listened to the explanations provided by Austrade, the Committee is satisfied that Austrade's discretionary powers in the Bill should not act as a disincentive to potential exporters, particularly as Austrade provides an advisory service to assist exporters with eligibility questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the Committee appreciated the concerns of some witnesses about the administrative cost of the scheme, the Committee considers that a five per cent ceiling on administrative costs is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that while the Government has met its objective of simplifying the Bill compared to the existing EMDG legislation, the exclusion of a number of eligible items will have an impact on the ability of SMEs to export. In fact, a number of exclusions, especially trusts, air fare expenses after the second grant, and, to a lesser extent, the cost of patents for intellectual property affect SMEs. As the revised EMDG Scheme will be capped, the reinstatement of these items would not impose an extra financial burden on the Government. Any reintroduction of categories of expenditure would clearly reduce certainty for those who claim amounts over $50 000 as to the grant amount they would receive. Recognising this constraint, the Committee believes that it would be far preferable to assist and encourage small businesses to export by reducing the size of claims of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2068"> larger enterprises, which are in a better position to absorb reductions in grants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, the Committee recommends that the Government consider the Committee's comments about the reinstatement of some exclusions to assist small and medium size businesses in developing export markets in line with the stated objective of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also recommends that the Bills be enacted, subject to the Committee's recommendations in this Report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to Senator Bob Collins for allowing me to precede him in this debate. I think this is one of the most significant issues to come before the chamber, certainly in my 10 or 11 years in this place. There are very few opportunities to address issues that have such significant moral connotations as this bill does. I do not regard it as a state rights issue. Indeed, a territory is not a state, so by definition that is an irrelevant consideration. I think what is much more significant is that this is a bill which essentially seeks to interfere in the natural processes of life, which I regard as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sacred and which I think should be seen by all those who have a similar perspective as being well beyond the right of ordinary citizens&mdash;and indeed parliaments&mdash;to prematurely interfere with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly understand the concerns that people express about putting people out of their misery, so&hyphen;called, or allowing themselves to be put out of their misery. During the some 5&half; years during which my father was in a nursing home&mdash;and for most of that time was non compos mentis&mdash;it never for a moment occurred to me that it was in his best interests or indeed in anyone's best interests to have him put down. I think in many ways, to the extent that he was able to be aware, he would have realised that the suffering that he was going through did have a higher purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very difficult for many of us to acknowledge that when we are in that particular situation, but I do not personally regard the purpose of human existence as being to simply satisfy ordinary wants and desires or to achieve happiness irrespective of the moral consequences. It might be a natural&mdash;and indeed laudable&mdash;human aspiration in many circumstances to wish to be out of pain and to wish to avoid suffering, but this is a world in which these things are uncertain and where I think we all take our chances. I do not think we have the right to say that, because we would feel better or those around us would feel better, they have the right to simply interfere with the process for those purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is impossible to divorce the longer term consequences from that situation. Unless you believe in a life after death, it is perhaps difficult to comprehend why you need to go through that period of suffering. But if you do believe in a life after death and you do believe that your purpose on earth is not simply to enjoy yourself, I think you start to have an understanding of the enormity of what is being sought by those who argue that people ought to be allowed in certain circumstances to determine the extent of their life span.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It can obviously be very difficult when you have serious and protracted illnesses which involve a great deal of pain and suffering. I think we have all been exposed to those 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2069"> illnesses either directly or indirectly. That does not persuade me for a moment that we are therefore justified in suiting the convenience of those who might like to be put out of their misery. Inasmuch as it might seem harsh in a superficial sense, if you are fully cognisant of the meaning of life, you appreciate that there is a much greater dimension than the human.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are the reasons that will motivate me to support the Andrews bill. I do not wish to speak at any greater length but simply to say that it is an issue on which I do feel strongly, almost viscerally in a sense, because the bill goes against all that I have ever believed in and been brought up to believe in. Nothing that I have experienced in my lifetime persuades me that I should diverge from those beliefs.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight conscious that many of my constituents are listening to this broadcast and, indeed, to the interjections of Senator Harradine, on the parliamentary news network. It is a service that the vast majority of Australians have had available to them, and many, of course, would take it for granted. It is a service that the territorians are hearing for the first time this week and only because of the extraordinary measures that were taken to connect the service to broadcast this debate. I can assure all senators that many in the territory are following this debate with intense interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you have lived in remote Australia for as long as I have and many of those listening in the territory have, you take nothing for granted in the way of new or improved services. Unfortunately and ironically, this new experience of being able to sit at home in the territory and listen to debate in the national parliament is being tainted for many territorians by the feeling that they are doing so as third&hyphen;class citizens. The reason is simple. These broadcasts are carrying debate on a bill which strikes at the very heart of self-government in our territory. It seeks to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2070"> remove the right of our parliament to make its own laws for better or worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that this is not, in essence, an anti&hyphen;euthanasia bill. It is not a bill which seeks to outlaw euthanasia throughout Australia. It is an anti-territories bill. It seeks to give us as territorians fewer rights than our friends and relatives in every other state of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am opposed to euthanasia but, as I said, being completely honest about it, if I were suffering from a terminal illness&mdash;I might add, an extreme terminal illness; I am not talking about the grey areas&mdash;that imposes real and enduring distress and pain, I would like to think that I would be true to my beliefs that society is diminished by this legislation and not resort to euthanasia if it was available myself. But I would not absolutely bet on that, and that is the honest truth. I envy people who are so certain on these issues of life and death. I confess that I am not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am opposed to euthanasia, but I am also opposed to this legislation. The reason is simple. It seeks to strike down a legitimate law of the Northern Territory parliament&mdash;a law which I oppose but, nonetheless, a legitimate law. The legislation which this bill seeks to strike down was passed into law under the constitution conferred on the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly by the federal parliament's Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978. The self-government act gave to the Northern Territory legal, judicial, administrative and executive responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory administration has exercised those rights for 18 years&mdash;free of any threat of federal intervention. I have no doubt that it has passed bad laws during that time, as have all parliaments in Australia. The Rights of the Terminally Ill Act is, in the view of many, one of the worst, but I vehemently defend the right of the democratically elected Northern Territory parliament to pass that law. That law is properly within the heads of power conferred on the Northern Territory parliament by this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I freely acknowledge that the Commonwealth has the capacity under section 9 of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act, through the Governor-General, to disallow the proposed law or part of the proposed law of the Northern Territory. But this must be done within six months after the Territory administrators assent to such a proposed law. The time for that type of action in relation to the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act has well and truly expired. In any case, section 9 was a transitional provision on the grant of self-government to the Northern Territory 18 years ago. It has never been used; it is anachronistic; it should be repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a steady progression of constitutional development in the Territory. There are a number of further important constitutional advancements that can be made ahead of the grant of full statehood. The repeal of this transitional power under section 9 is one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to remember the former federal Labor government made no attempt to invoke these reserve powers between the passage of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act in the Territory parliament and the last federal election. Indeed, the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, was asked to intervene and overturn the Territory law. He refused. He said that it was a matter properly left with the states and territories. Unfortunately, the current Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has not adopted a similar view. Had he done so, we would not be debating this bill tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators may recall that Mr Howard was asked in this parliament on 29 June last year by the member for Menzies, Kevin Andrews, if the Commonwealth would be arguing for or against the validity of the Territory legislation proceedings, which were due to commence within days in the Northern Territory Supreme Court. The government, Mr Howard said, had decided that steps should be taken to have the Commonwealth removed as a defendant in the challenge to the Territory legislation by a number of parties, including the Australian Medical Association. Mr Howard said the government was seeking to be removed as a named defendant in the legal challenge&mdash;and I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the parliament&mdash;`as it is clearly legislation at the instance of the Northern Territory parliament'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2071">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a great pity that the Prime Minister did not leave it there. The Prime Minister went on to suggest that it was open to any member of this parliament to introduce a private member's bill if he or she felt strongly about the issue. It would not be the desire of the government, he added, to hamper the consideration of the issue. In fact, the Prime Minister has given a priority to this private member's bill that has not been accorded to a great deal of his own government's business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As senators would recall, Mr Andrews gave notice of this private member's bill on 20 August last year. He introduced his bill on 9 September last year. I would remind honourable senators the Territory legislation was introduced in February 1995. It was assented to in June of that year, and no-one can deny that it was both a controversial and highly public debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Vanstone, to her credit, pointed out earlier in this debate, it could easily have been made an issue at the March election last year. It was not. Why, I ask, did Mr Andrews or Mr Howard not seek to make it an issue then? The public record clearly shows that neither of them did so. Why has the Prime Minister left it to a backbencher to raise it in this parliament and then given that backbencher priority over a great deal of government business? I ask that question on behalf of my constituents because Mr Howard, of course, voted in the other place to overturn the rights of the Territory parliament to make its own laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister has also led the charge in attempting to stifle the threshold constitutional issues raised by this bill. I have here an article which appeared in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 24 January this year. It is headed `PM keen for Senate veto on euthanasia'. Mr Howard is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't think it's got anything to do with state or territory rights. I think that's one of the weakest arguments I have ever heard.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This shows a profound ignorance about the terms of the Andrews bill. It is not about states' rights. If it were, I would have no hesitation in supporting it because it would then be a true anti-euthanasia bill. It does 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not&mdash;I repeat, it does not&mdash;seek to outlaw euthanasia in any part of this country, except the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island. Of course, in real terms it discriminates only against the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, Mr Andrews has said publicly that he would probably not have sought to introduce this legislation had it concerned a law of a state and not of a territory. It is not about states' rights because it does not affect a state. That is the central problem with this bill. If we are fair about making this a true debate on whether all Australians have a right to exercise a choice on this matter, we should be debating a bill which seeks to outlaw euthanasia in all states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have moved my amendment to achieve that end. It seeks to have this bill withdrawn. It then calls on the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, Daryl Williams, to have an alternative bill prepared and presented to the Senate. It should be drafted in a form which does not discriminate against the people of any part of Australia and which would enable senators to vote according to their views on euthanasia on the basis of a possible uniform national approach to the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The motion is in the same terms as that moved by the member for New England, Ian Sinclair, during debate in the other place. I am happy to say that Mr Sinclair has precisely the same position as I have on this matter: he is also opposed to euthanasia and he is opposed to this bill. I commend his contribution in this debate to all members and to all territorians. It makes an interesting comparison with that of the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill can be withdrawn and redrafted in the manner I suggest. We know from evidence given to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee that this is, at least, an arguable case. The senior lecturer in constitutional law at the Australian National University, George Williams, told the committee that this bill removes the powers of the territories to pass laws permitting euthanasia but leaves the state powers intact. However, other similar laws that have impacted upon the legislative ability of the state or territory 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2072"> parliaments have been expressed to operate Australia wide. The most significant recent example, of course, is the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act 1994, which was introduced to override Tasmania's anti&hyphen;homosexual laws. Section 4(1) of that act states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sexual conduct involving only consenting adults acting in private is not to be subject, by or under any law of the Commonwealth, a state or a territory, to any arbitrary interference with privacy within the meaning of article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This section clearly operates to affect the rights of all Australians. Nowhere is Tasmania specifically named or singled out. The legislation we are debating here tonight only operates to limit the ability of territories to choose to legislate with respect to euthanasia, specifically, of course, the Northern Territory. This unacceptably erodes territorians' control over their political future compared to other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a Commonwealth response to euthanasia is needed, the Commonwealth should at least attempt to pass a national law&mdash;a law that equally affects all Australians. As Mr Williams points out in an article published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 27 October last year headed ` A clumsy attack on territories', the Commonwealth may well have the power to do so. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth might argue that it lacks the power to extend the Andrews bill to the states. This is not a convincing argument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1994, the federal parliament passed the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act, which overrides Tasmania's anti-homosexual laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act relied upon the Commonwealth's external affairs powers to implement the right to privacy in Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems the Commonwealth could similarly rely on articles of the covenant and use the external affairs power to enact a national euthanasia law.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to make this abundantly clear. If this legislation was drafted in precisely the same way as the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Act, which relied for its authority on international conventions to provide a consistent national law from this federal parliament on euthanasia, I would be supporting it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My consideration of this bill boils down to one central question: is the Northern Territory self-governing or not? If the Andrews bill is endorsed by this Senate, then clearly it is not and the constitutional clock is turned back to 1978. There are those who have claimed in this debate that the issue of territory rights is a cloak of convenience being used to avoid debate on the central question of euthanasia. This does not stand up to one minute's scrutiny. As I said earlier, the territory legislation was introduced in February 1995. Need I remind senators that it has been the subject ever since of the most vigorous debate. It has virtually consumed public debate in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should never be forgotten that the legislation was immediately referred to a select committee of the territory parliament, which received more than 1,000 submissions. Fifty amendments were introduced during the committee stages of the bill before the Legislative Assembly passed it by a vote of 15 to 10. The act has survived a number of attempts at repeal&mdash;supported, I might add, by many MPs sitting on the Treasury benches in the Northern Territory and by people such as me. It has been the subject, as I mentioned earlier, of a challenge before the full court of the territory's supreme court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The full court was asked in essence to determine just how self-governing the territory is. It found the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act were within the powers of the territory parliament, as confirmed by the Commonwealth more than a decade and a half ago. An application for special leave to appeal to the High Court against the decision has been lodged. These events must be granted recognition in this debate. It is in fact vigorous democracy at work&mdash;territorians freely exercising our democratic rights under the powers conferred by the self-government act of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last 170 years or so, when the sovereign in England was granting increasing powers to the colonies such as New South Wales and Victoria, once power was transferred it was never taken back, except in exceptional circumstances such as war and rebellion. The Andrews bill seeks to wind 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2073"> those territory rights back. Forget the so-called cloak of convenience arguments. If you are still in any doubt about this, I would commend a reading of the Senate Scrutiny of Bills <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alert Digest No. 7 of 1996</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The all-party committee expressed profound doubts about the constitutional validity of the Andrews bill. It found the Commonwealth parliament, having given the legislative assemblies of both territories and Norfolk Island the power to `make laws for the peace, order and good government' would, by this bill, negate the valid exercise of that legislative power by one of them. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth parliament, by this bill, proposes to intrude on the law making function of the territories not in accordance with a general principle but on an ad hoc basis. This threatens the certainty which ought to exist for its citizens when any one or more of the territories passes a valid law.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Precisely. In essence, the Senate committee found that this bill would trespass unduly on the personal rights and liberties of territorians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are only two courses of action which I believe can be reasonably followed in this matter. The first is the repeal of the legislation in the territory's own parliament, which I will continue to work for, as far as I am able, as a territorian. The other is a matter for this parliament. It is the course that I propose in this foreshadowed amendment. It would ensure a national uniform approach to what I think everyone would agree is one of the toughest issues the Australian community has been asked to come to terms with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unthinkable for me that, once the powers of self-government have been conferred on our territory, they should be then taken away. I remind honourable senators of what the then Minister for the Northern Territory, Mr Adermann&mdash;of course a conservative colleague of the current government&mdash;told this parliament in his second reading speech on the introduction of the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978&mdash;our constitution. When he introduced the bill into the House he said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure that honourable members will support the philosophy behind the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The people of the Northern Territory, in common with other citizens of our federal Commonwealth, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have the right&mdash;indeed the duty&mdash;to control their own affairs through a democratically elected legislature.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">All I can say is hear, hear! It is a pity that his conservative colleagues now do not take a trip back through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  and read what was said then. Mr Adermann went on to point out that at Federation the citizens of the Northern Territory, as residents of the state of South Australia, enjoyed the same political rights as other Commonwealth citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of the requirements of the constitution, those political rights were removed in 1910 when the territory was transferred from South Australia and accorded the status of a Commonwealth territory. In a very real sense, the constitutional history of the Northern Territory since that date reflects the endeavours of the people of the territory to regain the rights they lost in 1910. That objective will not be achieved until the territory is accorded statehood&mdash;a goal which has been supported in principle by all heads of government in Australia, including the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a reasonable expectation in the Northern Territory that we will have full statehood at or around the turn of the century. Need I remind anyone in this Senate that that is only a few years from now, at which time the effect of this bill, if passed, would lapse in any case. I would ask all senators not to turn the clock back in this vote and to support the continuing progress of constitutional development for the Northern Territory. I commend the amendment to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to begin by saying that I have, since I can remember, firmly supported the notion that an individual should have the right to die at a time and by a means of their own choosing. I hope that that choice will be available to me and to others should we want to make it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people are fortunate enough to die a natural, quick, quiet and peaceful death. My own grandmother used to say, `What a blessing it would be to die in one's sleep.' Twenty years ago, I watched my grandmother die in agony over a prolonged period. My memory of her almost always brings back that last 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2074"> night of horror when I so vividly recall it in all its detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps these days she would have died a little sooner and died from an overdose of morphine. In that case she may or may not have been party to the decision which would determine the end of her life. My family would have been greatly relieved to think her suffering had been minimised but, on the whole, the intervention in her death would be a matter which may have been understood but not discussed. It would have been a decision made by her physician.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt we have made significant progress in palliative care in the last few decades, at least in some parts of Australia and for some, but not enough, people. As I understand the philosophy of palliative care, it is not just a method by which pain can be controlled but it is an approach which allows the dying and their families to make informed decisions about their treatment. In this debate I want to argue that we should concern ourselves with the much broader end of life issues and that we should see voluntary euthanasia not as some freakish and shocking event which threatens our whole society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say that voluntary euthanasia is and should be regarded as one small part of the whole of the treatment of those who are terminally ill. Whether or not Kevin Andrews's bill changes the legality of euthanasia in the Northern Territory, except for some rare cases, end of life decisions will continue as before. The decision not to proceed with surgery or resuscitation, the withdrawal of life support systems, the denial of certain drugs on the basis of cost, the administration of drugs which relieve pain but which will certainly and eventually cause death are, in my view, just parts of a continuum. It seems to me that the only difference between these medical decisions and voluntary euthanasia is that the former may or may not have been requested by those most affected by the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A member of my family is a nursing sister who has had extensive experience in palliative care, and I acknowledge her contribution to this debate and to my views. I might add that she believes that legalised euthanasia will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have very little impact on ensuring peaceful deaths and reduced suffering and she is not one of the health professionals who would assist patients to die. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have no ethical problems with the morality of euthanasia provided the person choosing this is a competent, terminally ill person who rationally makes a well-informed decision, in consultation with a humane doctor regarding ending their life. However, as a health professional, I would find assisting in the administration of a lethal injection to a patient I was caring for a very difficult procedure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It has been easy for me to speak as an individual in support of euthanasia and I do not step aside from that position. I do want to make a plea, however, for those physicians and nurses who deal with these decisions on a daily basis. The reason we are so polarised in this debate on euthanasia is that we as a society are still uncomfortable with dealing with death. I do not necessarily mean that as individuals we are afraid to die. Rather, I think we are reluctant participants in the process of dying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why so much of our effort is in trying to prevent death. Doctors are trained to cure and very often they try every last&hyphen;ditch effort to prevent death, often to the detriment of their patients. My 87&hyphen;year&hyphen;old neighbour, after resuscitation from his third massive heart attack, said, `I just hope the next one takes me off. I cannot bear to go through it all again.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Medical Treatment Act in Victoria is meant to prevent treatment beyond what people feel they can tolerate. My sister-in-law says this act is rarely used. Does intravenous antibiotics for a ninety&hyphen;year&hyphen;old with pneumonia constitute too aggressive a treatment? For some the answer is yes, for others no, depending on their physical and mental condition and the possible complications which can ensue. But decisions are not always made using this rationale and people are often overtreated with sophisticated drugs and the most expensive intensive care. They have numerous tests and CAT scans to prove they have in fact an age related illness. Dying patients are often tossed from one specialist to another. They can be given four different opinions and end up with a very confused 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2075"> idea of their condition, their prognosis, the most appropriate treatment and, especially, how on earth they will cope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their GP is rarely involved in the acute treatment but will have to pick up the pieces following this phase. It is often not until physical care is required or pain control is needed that referral to a palliative care service is made. By then there is often a feeling of despair and loss of control. All of this has the effect of increasing the suffering of the patient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We spend most of our health dollars on people in their last few months of life. Very often we stop them from dying from natural causes and send them for the last months and sometimes years of their lives to a nursing home or a special accommodation house. I think that Kevin Andrews's bill has given us an opportunity to begin the discussion about where our health efforts should be directed. How much more beneficial would it be for all of us to concentrate on disease prevention? What are we doing to address the problems of high mortality rates in Aboriginal babies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The quality of life for many in this country is limited by curable and preventable diseases. We have scrapped, for example, an important dental health program which costs the government annually a fraction of what its loss will cause further down the health road. Mental health services for adolescents meet a small proportion of the needs. In Victoria, maternal and child health services are being wound back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need informed public debate and we need leadership in determining which end of the life cycle should attract our greatest effort and how far we should go to save a life close to the end of that cycle. We must speak about this issue freely and openly. Doctors are not the font of all wisdom and it should not be up to them alone to decide. We need education and perhaps guidelines under which our doctors and nurses can operate. We do need better palliative care services and we do need more hospice beds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I realise that these will be highly contentious matters to raise in the middle of this debate and there will be some who will interpret my remarks as endorsing involuntary 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> euthanasia&mdash;which of course I do not&mdash;but I will take that risk. I do favour euthanasia as a choice which should be freely made by those who wish to die and those who are willing to assist them. I do not seek to impose this on anyone who does not make this choice for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many correspondents to my office, including organisations such as the Motor Neurone Disease Group and the woman in the Northern Territory who has a rare cancer of the gut, point out that deaths from such diseases are not simply painful and are only partly helped by palliative care. I cannot imagine what it must mean to know that you will face a certain death by gradual asphyxiation&mdash;the loss of control of bodily functions, the indignity and the discomfort. In March 1995, seven Melbourne doctors published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> an open letter to the Victorian Premier. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the sake of all of those who may be unfortunate enough to be trapped in suffering and anguish, we ask you to put an end to the uneasy hypocrisy of our law and to allow us to work without fear of prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each of us who has signed this letter has personal experience of treating terminally ill people whose condition has moved them to ask for assistance in suicide and each of us has, on occasion, after deep thought and lengthy discussion, helped such a patient to die.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We declare this now in public, knowing that this declaration may be construed in the State of Victoria as an admission of a criminal offence. We do this because we believe passionately that this state's law on the assistance of suicide is wrong, and because those who continue to support the law have failed to recognise the reality of our work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have assisted patients to end their lives and we know others who have. We believe that we have acted in the best tradition of medical ethics, offering our patients relief from pain and suffering in circumstances where it would have been an act of cruelty to deny them. We respect life. All of our professional training and work deepens that respect. However, the reality is that there are some patients who are beset by physical and mental suffering which is beyond the reach of even our most sophisticated efforts at control. When such patients clearly and repeatedly express a rational plea for help, it is out of respect for them that we have felt compelled to act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many who cry out for help and who are denied it by doctors who may sympathise with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2076"> their plight but who are unwilling to break the law. There are some who attempt to end their lives unaided and who botch the attempt and survive with their misery redoubled. There are others who may be helped by a doctor but who, for fear of incriminating their friends and family, must choose to die alone without the chance to say farewell.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These doctors were of course not prosecuted. I sincerely hope that this debate can move beyond the questions of sanctity of life, with which we all agree, beyond the slippery slope arguments and the individual religious and high moral ground and get down to some of the real issues about dying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Passing this bill would be an indication that this parliament is prepared to intervene in the laws made by another government in order to deny a human right. I hope, too, that those who hold on to the sanctity of life arguments in euthanasia are also the first to be counted in relation to human rights abuses in this country and elsewhere. In Indonesia more than a million people were killed when Suharto came to power. This regime is responsible for killing more than 300,000 East Timorese. My colleague Senator Meg Lees said last night much of what I would have said on this broader understanding of the sanctity of life. In this parliament there was much we could have done and there is much that we can do to prevent involuntary death.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should firstly say that I will be supporting the Euthanasia Laws Bill. My attitude in opposing euthanasia was a view that I arrived at many years ago. Whilst I have considered much of the recent discussion on this matter, I have been little influenced by it because of the conclusions I reached in respect of the sanctity of life and having a passionate opposition to euthanasia, as I said, having reached that conclusion a long time in the past. I, in being elected to parliament 6&half; years ago, never dreamt that we would be considering in this country a piece of legislation that allowed the state or gave the state the right or imprimatur to end human life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I go into my further contributions on this, I would just like to talk very briefly about some of the basic principles that I adhere to. I am a passionate student of his 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tory. To me, much of the central tenets of Christianity, which have played a very important role in the set of ethics that we as a Western society observe, are particularly important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say and emphasise that I am not a practising Christian in the sense that I attend church. But I do believe very strongly that many of the tenets laid out by Christ which have been so important in issues such as not taking human life and in a range of other areas&mdash;respect for the individual and some community understanding and support for individuals in a range of circumstances&mdash;are very important and I hold them particularly strongly. The sanctity of life&mdash;that you will not take life, that the state does not sanction the taking of life&mdash;is particularly important and is the overriding principle that I have followed in respect of my decision to oppose very passionately euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I am not a practising Christian in the sense that I attend church regularly. I am not approaching this from the perspective of an argument relating to church and state and I do not see it as an issue of separating church and state, as some have advanced. I do not approach it from the religious point of view in the sense that I adhere to a particular Christian denomination. But I still think that in our Western society these Judeo-Christian principles are very important and should be preserved. A range of issues are emerging in our society today. Euthanasia is one of them. Clearly abortion is another. The death penalty is an issue that has been around for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue is genetic engineering. Genetic engineering, similar to euthanasia, causes me very great concerns about what type of society will develop and emerge in the next 10, 50, 100 years. I believe that the issue of genetic engineering, or manipulation in many cases, will become one of the major political issues in the decades ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already made reference to the fact that I am a keen student of history. One of the approaches I have taken to this legislation is that I do sincerely believe we have to look at the consequences of the decisions we as legislators take today and what the effect will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2077"> be in 10, 20, 50, 100 years time. From my modest study of history, it is apparent to me that what were relatively minor changes in the past could have a dramatic effect on the future of our societies on this planet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, I never believed that we as legislators would be considering legislation to overturn the legalisation of euthanasia. I never dreamed that it would be us in Australia having to consider this issue. This is the first national parliament in the world to have to consider this issue and make very important decisions about it&mdash;decisions, as I have said, that will impact on the type of society that we in Australia and the rest of the world have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very difficult issue. I understand the deeply held commitment, passion and concern people have for the terminally ill and the difficulties we have in dealing with a person who has great suffering and pain and the medical prognosis predicts that that person will die. That is a major and deep consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of states rights, or in this case territory rights, has been raised. My preference, frankly, would be to have a piece of legislation before us that outlaws euthanasia Australia wide, but that is not the reality of the situation we are confronted with. I have some sympathy for Senator Bob Collins's argument about this legislation overriding the Northern Territory legislation and not, in his argument, imposing a view across the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we had legislation before us that sought to outlaw euthanasia around this country, I would support it. But we are confronted with a situation where the Northern Territory parliament has passed a piece of legislation that clashes fundamentally with the principles that I adhere to. Being faced with that situation, the principles that I hold passionately have to be the overriding consideration. It is not a matter of territory rights or states rights. If the Tasmanian parliament had passed legislation with respect to the legalisation of euthanasia, I would be here supporting legislation to override the Tasmanian parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a dissimilar situation from that with respect to the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill&mdash;that is, whether to override a state law, in that case a Tasmanian law, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because the critical principle at stake was more important than what is another important issue: the role of state legislatures and territory legislatures. They certainly do have a major role in our federation. But, as I say, it clashes with the central principle that I hold very importantly: you shall not take life and the states should not sanction the taking of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Abortion causes me a particular problem with this issue. It is not the issue of debate tonight, so I do not intend to make comment in that area. But, as I have said, over the coming years we in this federal parliament will inevitably be faced with decisions in other areas, for example with respect to the death penalty and genetic engineering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Politicians are often accused of not taking a longer term view. On this issue I plead with my colleagues to think about the type of society that could emerge through the state sanctioning of the taking of life&mdash;that is, what could occur in the next 10, 20, 30 years. It has been referred to as the slippery slope argument. It is not a term that I like. After the initial sanctioning of the taking of life, what next steps will occur? I believe that that law will inevitably be broadened. It is not inconceivable to conclude that perhaps in 100 years' time we will, because of various economic pressures, because of the demographic changes that are occurring, increasingly marginalise people in our society, particularly the elderly and those with extreme ill health, for whom the easiest solution would be to end their life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some may consider this to be an absurd analogy but there is a particularly good science fiction book, made into a film, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Logan's Run</EMPHASIS>, where in 200 or 300 years into the future everybody's life is terminated at the age of 30. I believe that, if we have sufficient vision and give sufficient consideration and thought to this issue, we can see that that is not an impossible scenario for 100 or 200 years hence. Albeit we can all be horrified by that concept today, I would hate to think that the first place on this planet that that process may begin is the Northern Territory in this country called Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2078">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is argued that there are extensive safeguards to this legislation, and I have looked at those safeguards. But, regrettably, any sort of safeguards on the taking of a human life can be abused. Albeit that that abuse may be small&mdash;very, very small&mdash;I just cannot accept there being any possibility that in some way those safeguards, no matter how firmly in place, may be manipulated or bent. And I think that will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, I fear very greatly for the marginalisation of people who have significant ill health, and particularly the elderly in our society. Our approach as a society must be to ensure that as a community we are always committed to the support of people in those circumstances, to ensure that sufficient resources are devoted to assist and protect to the maximum extent possible those people in our society with extreme ill-health and who are elderly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the sanctioning of euthanasia, I believe, will lessen the pressure in our society to devote the maximum resources to seek the solutions, to minimise the pain and the suffering and to ensure that as a society we devote more of our resources to palliative care and hospice beds. There is no doubt that in coming years it will become more and more of an issue and will require greater and greater effort in terms of our budget commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do have a few words about the attitude of the wider community as reflected by opinion polls. I am well aware that opinion polls do indicate that 70 to 80 per cent of the community supports euthanasia. But I do not regard my role as an elected politician simply to reflect what the latest opinion poll tells me that I should do in this case when I have the opportunity to exercise a conscience vote; it is a very rare occasion. I have no doubt that, certainly at the moment, those polls are accurate in terms of the community discussions, feedback and comments I have had on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But as elected representatives we are not simply here to do as the polls would indicate on all issues. At times it is a difficult judgment to make. We are elected representatives of the community&mdash;and in my case, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community of Tasmania. I am well aware that an overwhelming majority of people at the moment support euthanasia, although if there were a referendum&mdash;and I do not support that process&mdash;I think the arguments would be much more publicly debated than has occurred already and I think that that sentiment would change significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do ask people in the broader community who are looking at the way I vote on this issue&mdash;and, as I said, I am supporting the legislation&mdash;to respect my conscience and my decision as an individual, because my party have allowed me the opportunity on this occasion to make an individual judgment and to cast my individual vote. It is not easy at times where my view does not match the opinion of the community to say, `I am not going to accept what you say'; it is not easy to do that. But we as legislators are not here simply to reflect on every occasion what the community would demand of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ultimate judgment of my views on this issue will be made through my party preselection process and, to some extent at least, in Tasmania where personal votes are certainly cast to a more significant degree than with other states. The ultimate judgment will be made and cast on my vote tonight in reflecting on my broader performance as a politician at the ballot box in five years' time. I do ask the people in Tasmania who on this issue have continued to push very strongly the argument of community sentiment to understand and respect my decision in supporting this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do have some sympathy for the position Senator Collins is in. I do have some sympathy for the amendment that he has moved. But that is not the reality of the issue that we are faced with here and now. By all means, if Senator Collins wants to write and sponsor legislation that applies to the whole of the country, I would be more than pleased to support it. But at the moment we have a situation where the taking of life is occurring in the Northern Territory, and that situation must end&mdash;and it must end as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose one of the strongest arguments in favour of euthanasia is that it happens any 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2079"> way. It does happen. I acknowledge that it is occurring to some extent, albeit illegally, and that is a difficult issue to have to answer. But I do not see full legalisation as being the solution to dealing with a problem that obviously does exist in our society today. I believe that in weighing up the arguments, where euthanasia is occurring illegally, the solution is not to legalise the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly do have very great sympathy with people who have been involved in that decision making process and who have been involved in the termination of a life illegally. I concede that, if a prosecution were occurring and I were on a jury in those circumstances, I would certainly be weighing up and considering the circumstances of each individual case. I think human nature and our legal system is sufficiently flexible to deal with those very difficult cases that come to trial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In concluding my contribution, as I have said earlier, I regard Judeo&hyphen;Christian values very important to western society and to Australian society. They have contributed and do contribute a series of very basic principles that I support very strongly. One of those is the sanctity of life, the respect for human life. With my respect for life, the sanctity of life, and having considered the issues deeply, I came to the conclusion with a clear conscience that I will be supporting this legislation to ensure that the taking of life in the Northern Territory and euthanasia is ended as soon as possible.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. In 1978 this Commonwealth parliament gave self-government to the Northern Territory. In 1979 the same was extended to Norfolk Island. In 1988 it gave self-government to the Australian Capital Territory. The people of those territories had a right to expect that when they voted for their governments the people they subsequently elected would serve their interests to the very best of their abilities. When self-government decisions were made, the residents of those territories had no real cause to believe that there was an overrider, that they have self-government only as long as the Commonwealth agrees with them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, in strict constitutional terms, one must recognise that there is a question mark about the constitutional provision to overturn the legislation of the territories. I recognise that the Commonwealth has the power to remove a legislative power granted to a territory. Clearly, this bill seeks to overturn legislation of the Northern Territory parliament but is not doing so within the legislated six months stipulated in the Northern Territory (Self-Government Act) 1978. Additionally, I recognise that such a power has never been used. It is correct therefore to say that this issue is not equivalent to that of states rights. It does certainly, however, raise the issue of the right of self-government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, this debate has been derailed somewhat and presented as a bill either for or against euthanasia. It is actually a bill about overturning the decision of the Northern Territory parliament and I believe one must remember that fact. If the question was restricted to a debate purely about euthanasia then that would and should be an entirely different debate from that which we are having at present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of us have our opinions formed by events in our lives. Those events can be ones experienced personally or by association with those who primarily we love and care for. My life has been typical of that course and I do not need to go into the specific events that have formed those lasting judgments. That would and should be a debate about the provision and extent of palliative care, it would and should be about various medical practices and also about those people whose needs do not fit into any given category.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do believe, however, that there have been superb improvements in palliative care over the last decade or two and that those improvements will continue. The dedication of the health professionals who care for those in palliative care is something I admire greatly. Unlike some even in the medical profession who have sought to undermine the ethics, the motive and the simple question of morality of their colleagues, I have to say that I have trust in health professionals and the judgments they make in the best interests of their patients and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2080"> acting as caring human beings with all the foibles that are attached to that mere fact.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality for me is that, as I have already said, this debate and vote should be about the merit or otherwise of the federal parliament striking down legislation in another jurisdiction. I have been an avid supporter of a federal system of government because I do believe in the role of the  states and the general ability of state parliaments to make sound decisions based on local input and activity. That was one of the main reasons that I joined the Liberal Party of Australia, because of its commitment to federalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not long after the introduction of this legislation last year a state colleague said that he sincerely hoped that I would be supporting it. My response to him was, `How would you feel if, after giving all due scrutiny and consideration to a piece of legislation, I then marched into your office and said, "Hey, listen pal, I am smarter than you. I know better than you. I am going to vote your legislation down."' His response was to purse his lips, suck in the air and say no more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The six states can legislate for such a thing as euthanasia but this bill will prevent the three territories from doing so. I remind honourable senators again that those territories have been granted self-government by this very parliament. One can only presume from such action that none of the territories will be safe from future federal intervention if any one senator or member disagrees with a course of action taken by that territory parliament. The question really does need to be asked as to why territorians were given self-government in the first place if a democratically  elected parliament can be usurped as easily as this bill proposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can fully understand why all the premiers and chief ministers of both political persuasions were unanimous in their opposition to this bill last September. I believe it is a dangerous path to tread, especially on an emotive issue as euthanasia, because the next time it will be an issue that is felt equally passionately about by the same or other groups of people even though they could still be a minority.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My agonising over this bill has in the end revolved around its intent. That intent is somehow to make territorians different to all other Australians. The intent is to say that those democratically elected governments do not have the maturity to make difficult decisions. The intent is to say that for some reason the legislators of the federal parliament have better and clearer judgments and greater wisdom than those of a territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I find it difficult to accept that I or, with respect, any one of us have a right to suggest or believe that we are superior legislators to those of the territories and that, as a consequence, our views should be pre-eminent. I, like all of my colleagues, have had considerable numbers of representations seeking to influence my vote. Most have been exceedingly reasonable and polite. Some have not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it sad to note that, in the main, senators' speeches have simply been reported as either for or against euthanasia without due consideration that some are not voting on that basis at all. Some senators are voting on a basis, such as mine, that is linked to a long&hyphen;held conviction associated with federalism. I do not believe the argument that has been put that this does not apply. To me, it is the thin edge of the wedge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I only hope that my view on this bill will be tolerated in the same way in which I have accepted and tolerated all the views that have been presented to me. I cannot and will not jettison my long&hyphen;held views on federalism, nor cloud them with an emotive issue and vote for federal intervention. It is for those reasons that I will not be supporting the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter the debate on the Euthanasia Laws Bill with a commitment to the principle of an individual's right to choose to die in a way that is dignified and humane. However, I do recognise, as most honourable senators have done during this debate, that it is a particularly complex one. I have actually listened with interest to contributions from all senators&mdash;those with a genuine concern about euthanasia, those who have told heartfelt personal stories and even those who have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2081"> questioned the right of a parliament to overturn a territory's law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a younger Australian, I am also keen to play a role in this debate. I hope that many people in our community do not make the mistake of thinking that younger Australians do not necessarily have a role to play in this debate or of thinking that, in my case, my life experiences are perhaps not great enough in number or in depth to speak with gravitas on this issue. Senators, of course, will not think this because they know that the decisions made in this chamber and in the other place impact upon all people in our society&mdash;young and old.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been anything but a clear-cut decision for me. I have found myself having to reconcile my belief in the principle of the right to choose to die with dignity with questions that surround the territory bill and the concept of active euthanasia. I do not want to see a devaluing of life in our community as a consequence of any bill passed in this or in any other place. But nor do I wish to see people's lives devalued as a result of the suffering they endure from disease and pain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My overall commitment remains to improving our health system and the provision of appropriate palliative care in this country. In fact, I wish that our federal parliament would spend as much time and resources debating the concept of health provision and the well-being of people in this country as we have devoted to this particular extraordinary debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that palliative care is not the answer necessarily for all patients, but we should never stop seeking the solutions to health problems in our community, especially terminal diseases. I know that some do argue that the legalising of euthanasia may remove incentives for such an ardent search for solutions. Any move in such a direction, of course, should be strongly opposed by us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not see palliative care and euthanasia as mutually exclusive. I believe that the key for patients is choice&mdash;to be informed and to have access to all kinds of treatments, as well as the option of ending their lives in a legally controlled and humane fashion.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also know that we as legislators must have regard for the democratic aspects of this debate. The effect of the federal parliament passing a law that impacts only on the territories does concern me. In general, I have no hesitation about the federal parliament passing a law that affects all Australians and strikes down a state or territory law. However, when the federal parliament has restricted legislative power to strike down only territory legislation, I am disposed to challenge that law on the basis that it distinguishes between states and territories and the peoples in those states and territories. In these circumstances, I accept that denying the rights of territorians when a person in a state will have that right, is difficult to rationalise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Admittedly, not all aspects of this debate are so precise for me. A particular difficulty I have had with this issue of euthanasia is in relation to younger Australians. I do not want to see decisions made in this place or by any other decision making body that tacitly or otherwise lead to an acceptance of the unprecedented levels of youth suicide in our community, already among the worst in the western world. I am glad to hear that other senators have spoken of their concern for the effect on young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need young people to focus on life, not death. But this is not such an easy thing to do when you are jobless, without sufficient support, unable to access education, living in remote areas or when the feelings of alienation which have come to categorise many young people today are overwhelming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one argument&mdash;I acknowledge that argument&mdash;that if the example from our elders is to hasten the final exit for whatever reason, young people in dire situations will see little reason for not emulating it. I realise that we do have to weigh that up, if we are being responsible in the messages we send young Australians. By legalising euthanasia, are we giving them an example of death as a choice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We who are sheltered and privileged from the worst storms of life by education and support may find the distinctions easy to make. But a young person whose dreams are shattered, whose lot is loneliness and isolation or joblessness and repeated disappointment 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2082"> may not make that distinction so easily. They may easily see their situation as no less hopeless and painful than that of a person with a terminal disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Life is about the perceptions and we must grant that such a young person may have such a perception. But death is no stranger to people of my age. I have had friends who have died by choice and most of my contemporaries, alas, would say the same. I am haunted by the knowledge that, given another day, a week or a change in circumstance, the choice of those who left us prematurely may have been to live. I cannot bear the thought that any decision that this or any other chamber could make should make it easier for young people to make that choice by being able to infer that it is okay to end life when it seems unbearable as a result of psychic or physical pain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you can see I have grappled with this issue in this debate. I also realise that there are many aspects to the debate about youth suicide and there is a need for additional funding for youth suicide education, research and prevention programs and for real education, training and employment options for young Australians so that they do have the promise of a real and meaningful future. I do acknowledge the opinion polls that show that young people are among the strongest supporters of legal euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not only older members of our community who get terminal diseases; young people do too. I know that there are many young people in the AIDS lobby&mdash;for example, the New South Wales AIDS Council&mdash;who do support legalised euthanasia. I do appreciate the arguments that have been put forward by them and other HIV-AIDS sufferers and their representative organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the statistics of suicide among older Australians. As I understand it, more than 640 Australians aged 75 or over committed suicide between 1990 and 1994. In the case of suicides among older Australians, we must ask how many of them were as a result of voluntary euthanasia being denied them. Some do argue that decriminalising voluntary euthanasia could lead to a reduction in levels of trauma or anxiety in our society 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and it could lead to a reduction in the number of violent suicides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Death and the politics of death impact on everyone, young and old. The complexity of this issue has been recognised by the Australian Council on Ageing, who chose not to adopt a position in this debate but to distribute a discussion paper covering all the arguments and urging people to discuss this issue with their families. Perhaps the most valuable aspect of this debate has been that it has caused the topic of death and dying to be discussed not only in the houses of parliament but in houses all around this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The president of that council, June Healy, has noted that women live longer than men on average, are more likely to be caring for a husband with a debilitating disease than vice versa, are more likely to be carers and have to endure the painful prolonged process of death than men, and are more likely to die without their partners being present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women have been another concern for me in this debate. Women are traditionally the carers, the ones to ease the way in family life. I do not discount the fact that they may be vulnerable to feelings that, when terminally ill, they should show care for their families before their own wishes to live as long as possible and ease family life by making an exit before their time. This argument has caused me great deliberation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also aware now of the arguments of women such as Dr Margaret Otlowski from the Department of Law at the University of Tasmania. Hers is a convincing argument. She claims that laws such as the Northern Territory's are necessary in order to regulate and bring out into the open what is currently a hidden and unregulated practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do accept the reality that euthanasia does take place already, even with the legal prohibition in place. It takes place and laws like the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 are designed to regulate this practice, ensure that it is transparent, ensure that doctors are accountable and actually empower those patients, including those vulnerable groups that I have mentioned. Dr Otlowski argues:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2083">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current legal situation is totally unsatisfactory in that it creates very real dangers for both doctors and patients: doctors are at risk of criminal liability for murder (or assisted suicide) if their conduct is exposed; the rights and interests of the patients are vulnerable, particularly in light of recent evidence indicating a relatively high incidence in Australia of killing of patients occurring other than at the patients request.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is estimated that 30 per cent of Australian deaths are preceded by medical decision explicitly intended to hasten a patient's death. Of these deaths, 3.5 per cent or around 4,400 involve a decision to end the patient's life without the patient's concurrent explicit request and 1.8 per cent of the deaths are the result of doctors administering or prescribing drugs with the intention of ending the patient's life at the patient's request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there currently exists no appropriate structure and no regulatory framework. Already there exists a balance of power of the well over the sick and of the professional over the patient. I do not seek to entrench such a power imbalance or to increase the power of doctors over patients but to empower those terminally ill patients so that they can determine how their lives end and when that takes place and so that they can do so in a safe fashion, humanely and with dignity. It is a right I would wish for myself. It is a decision that I would wish to exercise safely and legally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend those Australians on all sides of this debate who have contacted my office or who have written often quite well researched or heartbreaking letters. I also thank those people who appeared before the committee. My thanks to Shirley for agreeing to disagree.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there has been an impressive quality of debate on this Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. The sincerity of senators who have described their own personal experiences of loved ones dying is touching. I do not doubt the goodwill of all senators on either side of the argument genuinely searching for the best outcomes based on their beliefs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe a person has the right to demand release from hopeless and helpless pain. I believe that forcing a person to die slowly and painfully rather than allowing them to die 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quickly and painlessly if they so choose is cruel and beyond the proper role of government. I feel bound to point out some of the contradictions in the arguments put by the supporters of the Andrews's bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first contradiction is between our role as representatives and this move to overturn the clear will of the people. As parliamentary representatives, we seek sometimes to reflect the will of the people and sometimes to lead public opinion. We are professional decision makers and at each election we ask the populace to trust us and allow us to make decisions on their behalf. In most cases, the decisions we make are removed from the average person's everyday experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Complex legislation changes are delegated by the people to their parliamentary representatives, yet we have a situation in the case of voluntary euthanasia where almost every person in the community has an opinion based on intimate knowledge of someone close to them dying. They have had the experience, they are informed. We here in the chamber are no different. Many senators have spoken very movingly about their intimate experiences of loved ones dying, but they are only reflecting a community experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The consistent message from the community is that there is overall support for voluntary euthanasia, although a vocal, well organised minority has bombarded parliamentarians with anti&hyphen;euthanasia messages. Community polling usually shows support for voluntary euthanasia in excess of 70 per cent. The contradiction in this instance is that despite clear support for the Northern Territory's voluntary euthanasia legislation, the same parliamentarians who pore over opinion polls and take notice of them refuse to listen to a clear message from the people. Do those parliamentarians who support the private member's bill believe that the will of the people on this matter is irrelevant or do they believe the majority who support a right to voluntary euthanasia just do not know what is good for them? To imply that community support for euthanasia is uninformed is elitist. Unfortunately, some senators have conveyed that impression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second contradiction in this debate has been covered extensively in the media and by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2084"> others, including by Senator Collins tonight: that is the contradiction between those people who consistently argue for states' rights and yet in this instance are willing to overturn a measure that has bipartisan support in the Northern Territory. The majority of people in the Northern Territory have been quite clear in expressing their support for voluntary euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I see another reason for leaving the Northern Territory legislation as it stands. Isn't it possible to look at the legislation for voluntary euthanasia in one territory as an opportunity to gauge the success and effectiveness of this option? Legislation of voluntary euthanasia in the Northern Territory would give the Australian community a chance to gauge what voluntary euthanasia would mean in an Australian context; it would give us a case study in an Australian context. If the legislation proved in any way problematic it could be overturned later, instead of the indecent haste of this bill. Why shouldn't we give this a fair go? Some would argue that any delays mean lives lost, yet the people to make use of the Northern Territory legislation to date have all unequivocally wanted release from suffering; they had been in the final stages of terminal illness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A third contradiction appears in the selective application of the sixth commandant&mdash;`Thou shalt not do murder'. Some opponents arguing for the sanctity of life say that, no matter what the quality of life, a person has no right to end it. The underlying assumption is that God gave life and only God can take it away. Yet in my lifetime I have seen that as soon as the flag is raised and patriotic fervour is whipped up, respect for the sanctity of life goes out the window. Many of the same people who raise their voices against voluntary euthanasia are prepared to stand by while governments send young men off to be killed in war. Granville Williams, an eminent jurist from the United Kingdom, made the point almost 30 years ago in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Sanctity of Human Life and the Criminal Law</EMPHASIS>. He said that the sixth commandant is not `Thou shalt not kill', but `Thou shalt not do murder'. He said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . and it is only by a stretch of words that a killing with the patient's consent, to relieve him of inexpressible suffering, can be morally described as murder.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If wholesale killing in war and the punitive killing of criminals are not "murder" surely a killing done with the patient's consent, and for his benefit as an act of mercy can claim to be excluded from this ugly word.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If euthanasia is condemned only for religious reasons, then the fact that we live in a secular state should be enough reason to exclude voluntary euthanasia from the criminal code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth contradiction lies in the concern that some groups, especially some of the church groups, have expressed for Aboriginal people and how they will be affected by voluntary euthanasia. This is in stark contrast to the poor record of churches and the state in protecting Aboriginal families. They have ignored the disastrous effects of stealing children from their families, they have ignored the suicides and high rates of incarceration, deaths in custody and substance abuse, and they have denied the role of paternalistic white institutions, especially churches, in this destruction. In my state of New South Wales one in three Aboriginal people now living were stolen from their family as children. It has taken some people until now to discover concern for the plight of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to hear a debate like the one we are having, in which two&hyphen;thirds of senators speak, about our consistent failure to improve conditions in Aboriginal communities: about 200 years of neglect at best and, more often than not, state&hyphen;sanctioned brutality. I would like to see the amount of time and energy that we have spent on overturning the Northern Territory's legislation directed to improving the living conditions of Aboriginal people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many speakers have referred to the need to prevent voluntary euthanasia being legalised in the Northern Territory because it is the `thin end of the wedge' or the `beginning of the slippery slide'. The thin edge of the wedge argument also supposes that, while euthanasia may be morally defensible in an individual case, the wellbeing of the community as a whole is diminished by its acceptance. Joseph Sullivan defined the wedge principle in the 1940s when he wrote:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2085">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wedge principle means that an act which, if raised to a general line of conduct would injure humanity, is wrong even in an individual case.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Sullivan supposes, for the sake of argument, that the merciful extinction of human life in a suffering patient is not in itself immoral. Still it is immoral because, if it were permitted, this would admit `a most dangerous wedge that might put all life in a precarious condition'. This argument could be applied to almost any act whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should also remind other senators that not so long ago the use of anaesthetic during surgery or childbirth was considered the `thin end of the wedge'. Many Christians considered that the pain of childbirth was woman's punishment for Eve's sin and was given by God as a reminder of this. Although many women still choose not to accept anaesthetic during childbirth, the concept of denying a woman pain relief because it is God's will that she should suffer seems barbaric to us now. I believe that it is inevitable that, as a society, we will eventually come to feel similarly about voluntary euthanasia&mdash;that it is barbaric to expect a person to live on in pain when they are wholeheartedly wishing for release.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A fifth contradiction arises when palliative care is considered. I wholeheartedly support the provision of the best quality of palliative care. My feeling is that the vast majority of terminally ill people, as long as their pain is manageable, will choose to wait for a natural death. In a majority of cases, pain can be managed. However, we have a coalition government that is cutting spending on health care and palliative care, with many government members arguing that palliative care should be the only option available to terminally ill people irrespective of the pain they may be suffering. Senator Crowley yesterday pointed out the contradiction of drugging people until they are insensate, as often happens in the final stages of palliative care, yet not allowing those same people to make a choice to end their own lives while they are still able to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have received, like everybody else, many pieces of correspondence from all sorts of people. One organisation that has been very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> impressive in the material that it sent to me is the Motor Neurone Disease Association of Australia. I will read only one letter that refers to this condition because it highlights one of the groups that I think has a very powerful case. So many people already have referred to people who are dying with cancer. The letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Motor neurone disease is a terminal disease that brings about death through a progressive disabling process. MND does not affect the intellect or the senses. As the disease progresses, the sufferer is increasingly unable to impact on their surroundings. They are aware of what is happening to them, but they are unable to do anything about it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What cannot be treated is the mental pain and anguish of MND&mdash;the torture of knowing what is happening around you, what is happening to your body and not being able to do anything about it. Providing support for people with MND is about providing options. Currently, with the exception of the Northern Territory, these options are about living with the disease. However, the Northern Territory legislation provides an additional option&mdash;the right to voluntarily terminate life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Suicide is legal in all states of Australia. With MND, however, the progressive nature of the disease results in an inability for a person suffering from the disease to take their life. This is particularly true at the end stages of the disease where a person has little or no mobility, and cannot effect an end to their own life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They do not have the option of suicide to consider. Palliative care can meet many of the needs of people living with MND. But not all needs. Palliative care is an option this association recommends, wholeheartedly supports, and has invested significant resources to establish cooperative relationships and strategic alliances to ensure that people living with MND are able to access services that meet their needs. The association is of the view that patients should have a range of choices regarding living with their disease, including the right to make a choice not to continue living with MND.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That particular association, I think, sums up the sort of illness that would be considered under the Northern Territory legislation. As I said at the commencement, if you are frightened&mdash;I know some senators genuinely believe some of the horrendous stories of slippery slopes and thin ends of the wedges&mdash;then surely the fair way is to give it a fair go in the Northern Territory, wait a year or two, and come back with all the horrific cases, if you think they are there, and present the case 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2086"> again. Not to do that at this moment is to allow your own predetermined views to override the declared view, the declared attitude, of 80 per cent of the Australian people and particularly the people in the Northern Territory.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remember a story once about a 70&hyphen;year&hyphen;old woman who went to a doctor because her knee was giving her pain. The doctor said `Well, the trouble is you are getting old.' She said, `Doctor, my other knee is just as old and it doesn't hurt. Fix it.' I say that because of the way our system is at the moment. We have heard a number of people talk about how euthanasia occurs within the system that exists now. We have heard of cases where people suffering from cancer have died&mdash;and that example is used a lot in this argument. We have heard that, in this system&mdash;and it is usually important to ask not only nurses but also doctors what happens in this system&mdash;there are many cases where people are helped along their way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, we generally do not hear about the thousands of people who die in our hospital systems annually as a result of neglect. It is not because people are not nice people, but when you cut and cut out of a system which is labour intensive, you concentrate on illness rather than community health, you cut from the unpointy end and you leave to crisis care, bit by bit the conscience and the efforts of the people in the system have to be blunted. There are whole wards of people, especially in the public hospital systems, who for mental reasons can be called various names. I remember there was a ward in Royal Perth Hospital which somebody referred to as a self-inflicted ward. It was a ward full of older people who had suffered strokes and so on. Somehow you could justify the lack of attention that some of the people in those wards got on the basis that `they probably drank too much or they probably smoked too much or they probably brought it on in some way through their lifestyle'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think they are some of the ways in which nurses had to cope with the reality of what the hospital system was becoming. If the patient was younger, if the patient was co 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> operative and so on, they would get the assistance that the hospital system could give them. If they were older, especially if they were a bit cranky and difficult, and if some patients were not keen on eating if they were ill, it was a different story. In the case of my father, I know that if he did not want to eat and felt revolting every time he had to be sat up to eat, he would say, `Go away.' Somebody actually had to sit there and talk him into eating. They virtually forced him to eat. The system would have just put a pump in his stomach and he probably would have pulled it out. I know that my grandfather probably died from some form of malnutrition in the end because he had a throat cancer whilst he was suffering from other problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a line that is drawn within our hospital system that says, `Above this age, we have so many resources. Let's put them into the areas where we are most likely to get a result&mdash;the younger people, the relatively healthy people and so on, the people who we can get better.' I can understand the people in that system having to make those decisions. I do not envy their position. I cannot understand those people who sit back and continue to close their eyes to the effect of what we are doing to our system and then say, `It has nothing to do with me.' Do you not think that they would say that people ought to be able to make the choice to live through this system?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am the last person who thinks that the system of economic fundamentalism or rationalism ought to be pushing this debate in any way in relation to euthanasia. I find it extraordinary that people can close their eyes to what we are doing to people who manage to find themselves at the hands of the health system if they do not have families who are watching their welfare closely. What happens to those people? It is not because of anyone's wickedness but because of neglect, because of the resources we do not give to the system and because of the triage system where we have to work out which people are likely to benefit from the scarce and diminishing health resources compared to the people who seem to require those resources.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2087">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To me one of the great hypocrisies of many people who stand on the right to life in itself and the sanctity of life is that, whilst for economic gain they promote Australia's arms sales and what they might do to other countries, they would think, `There's nothing wrong with that; that's the market.' They would condone Australia's contribution to weapons of mass destruction. They would say, `That's the market; let's sell uranium.' So we can do things which might in the end poison or kill many thousands of people but sanctity of life does not come into that!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I do not think that this situation that we are faced with tonight is simply a matter of choice. It is not as simple as saying, `It is a matter of what I do with my life or what I do not do with my life.' I think it is broader than that. Most of the people who have been asked to make a decision realise that. There is a concern. I know that my parents felt that concern in relation to the potential brave new world. I know that there is deep concern within the Aboriginal community based on what they see from the hospital system and the health care system already and that institutionalised neglect and disadvantage&mdash;what they see already and what they may see as their relative power position within the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think we should use economic rationalism as an excuse for allowing their fears to come to fruition. We all have an obligation after tonight's debate to make sure that we do not continue to neglect categories of people within our health system, we do not continue to allow the suffering of those people who we know are dying within a short time, we do not care just for those people who we know are dying of cancer and we do not continue to let people suffer in very long, drawn out ways from all sorts of diseases. They include the people within our hospital system for whom we do not supply enough orderlies&mdash;for instance, the people who need to be sat up once or twice a day for their condition, the people who get left out for two hours because there are not enough orderlies to put them back into bed and who suffer from being left out and the people who cannot bathe themselves and whose relatives 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> might not even come into the hospital. They are being left uncomfortable because they cannot speak out for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many people suffering within our hospital system. I refuse to let economic rationalism overrule those people's wishes as well. That is a large reason why I foreshadow a second reading amendment to add to the motion, which reads:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot, as a society, refuse to accept responsibility for what we are doing to people who find themselves in our hospital system. We cannot cease to be a caring society. At the same time, if we do have a situation as has occurred in the Northern Territory&mdash;where the legislature has chosen to take the step, which they have, of allowing voluntary euthanasia&mdash;then we cannot not provide the support that is necessary to make sure people have the maximum choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with those people who say that palliative care is not the answer to euthanasia. My challenge is to both sides of this argument. If you are very much against voluntary euthanasia and say that people must value their last moments, even if they are in great 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2088"> agony, then you must be prepared to allow appropriation to make sure that quality palliative care is a right of those people who are dying, whether they are dying quickly or dying slowly. That includes those people who are under the dotted line who are currently being neglected in our system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you believe in the right to choose, then there must in fact be a choice. For many people in Australia we know the choices are not as good as they should be. We know that there are many places in Australia, there are many parts within Australia, there are many parts within cities, and there are many people whose funds do not allow them to find the care they need to be able to make the best choices and to be able to choose the time which is best for them, if they so choose to end their lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst federal governments might say states make the decision on health care, I think that is a cop&hyphen;out. There are many ways in which the federal government is currently telling the states what to do on many issues, and that includes education. We are going to have compulsory tests on literacy for young children in our schools, and we are going to get the states to pay for it. If we are going to do that&mdash;if we are going to make prescriptive comments about vaccinations, if we are going to make prescriptive comments about literacy tests&mdash;then we can say that the federal government will provide them with funding, and that appropriation will be made to make sure that there is a choice. For all of the people who feel strongly about this issue in this Senate, there is a choice, and we all have an obligation to make sure that that choice is a real one.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As there is a number of senators still to follow me, I will be reasonably brief in my comments. I have read all of the contributions to the debate in the House of Representatives, and I have listened to almost all of the contributions here in the Senate. If I have not listened to them, I have read them. I have followed those closely and I know that most of the arguments, if not all of them, have been canvassed over and over. So I will not go over them all. I hope that the brevity of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> my contribution will not be taken as an indication of the thought I have put into it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like many of my colleagues in both this place and the House of Representatives, I have not found the task of considering the Euthanasia Laws Bill an easy one. I have tried to approach it with an open mind. I have invited people to come and see me and have sought people out who I thought would have different opinions from mine and also different opinions from each other. I did that in order to examine the issue as widely as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to admit that I have wavered in my decision. One reason for this is that the question before us is not a straightforward one. It is not a straightforward one which has to be made by any of us. It is not only about being pro-voluntary euthanasia or anti-voluntary euthanasia. It also involves a decision about overturning legislation made under another jurisdiction. I am not a constitutional lawyer, but the weight of evidence has convinced me that the Commonwealth does have the constitutional power, under section 122 of the constitution, to overturn the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overturning by the Commonwealth of legislation enacted by the Territory should, however, only be undertaken in exceptional circumstances. The question then is: does this constitute an exceptional circumstance which would warrant the activation of the constitutional provision?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory legislation, as it stands, is not restricted to Northern Territory residents alone. It potentially affects all Australians. Already two of the four people who have chosen assisted suicide have not been residents of the territory. The issue has been brought before the federal parliament by means of this bill. It is incumbent on me to do my best to evaluate the arguments, to form an opinion and to vote on the bill. Barry Jones said in his contribution in the lower house:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have a moral obligation to vote . . . indeed, not to choose is to choose.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I agree with him on that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2089">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many in the debate who have been opposed to the Andrews bill have argued that it should be a matter of choice on the part of the individual, that no-one else should be able to deny another the opportunity to make a decision to end their life. It is a compelling argument and, many would argue, a compassionate one. But what may be seen as the most compassionate option may not be in the interests of the common good in the long run, nor is the view that to allow people to choose euthanasia the province of the compassionate alone. In 1939, Hitler said, `Incurably sick persons should be granted mercy death.' I think no-one here could defend him as a compassionate person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must admit that during my contemplation on my response to this bill, I identified with Keats when he said in his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ode to a Nightingale</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Darkling I listen; and, for many a time</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been half in love with an easeful Death . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In fact most of us, if not all of us, despite our beliefs or religious convictions, if we were absolutely truthful, could say with Keats that, if we were suffering an incurable illness, we might be tempted to be `half in love with an easeful death'. Even the most resolute in their abhorrence of euthanasia may be tempted, as Bob Collins admitted tonight, to choose euthanasia as an option. I believe I am no less mortal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one were merely to respond on the basis of the plethora of the polls and surveys, one would be tempted to oppose the Andrews bill. Poll and survey after survey indicates general community support for euthanasia. But the closer one looks at these polls, the less certain one must surely be of basing a decision on them. An opinion piece in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS> by Daniel Yankelovich, chairman of a US public opinion and social trends research organisation, cautions us. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is an important lesson here about the strengths and limits of opinion polls. Most of them do accurately measure what people say. But only the most sophisticated measure what people really mean. Market researchers learned the lesson years ago; politicians and most of the media have not.</PARA>

As public debate progresses and people have the opportunity to consider alternatives and trade-offs, the compartments break down and people's views become more integrated and thoughtful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the right kind of public debate, raw opinion evolves into responsible public judgment. The disparity between what people say and what they mean disappears. Only then can the answers to opinion poll questions be taken literally.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have made it my business since this bill was first introduced to ask people about their views on euthanasia. I have terrorised Comcar drivers, who look a little stunned first thing in the morning when they pick me up and I ask, `What do you think about it?'

The overwhelming majority, other than the health professionals, have said emphatically that they believe in voluntary euthanasia. However, their resolve has dissolved the more we have discussed the pros and cons. Maybe it is a case of their being half in love with an easeful death or the concept of an easeful death. Maybe, as the pollster has explained, they had not thought through all the consequences of their opinions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of us in this debate have not been in a situation of having been closely involved with someone who is terminally ill. Others have and have chosen not to talk about it and others, as I have said, have not experienced it. I have had the privilege&mdash;I count it a privilege&mdash;of having been very closely associated, in fact sharing the last days of life, with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2090"> two young friends, both of whom died: one from melanoma and the other from a chondro sarcoma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was therefore no stranger to death when I was confronted with my mother's diagnosis of terminal cancer two years ago. I will admit that I was devastated and, like Senator Newman, was fearful of what lay ahead for someone for whom I cared so much. Had voluntary euthanasia been an option, and had my mother chosen voluntary euthanasia, I am sure she would have discussed it with me. What I am not so sure of is what my response would have been. I will admit the anticipatory fear of what lay ahead was almost more than I could bear. Being my mother, she no doubt knew my fear as intimately as she knew her own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who is to say that, motivated by a perverse sort of altruism, she would not have chosen euthanasia? Or that I, in agreeing with her decision, would have been motivated as much by my own fears as by supporting her decision to end her pain. Terminal illness leaves both the sufferer and their families uniquely vulnerable. Relationships of trust and dependence are magnified so powerfully by uncertainty and fear of what lies ahead. In such a situation, stressed by the certainty of impending grief, loved ones, however well intended, may agree with a dying person's half-meant request for euthanasia as a means of assuaging their own fear. The dying, hearing their loved one's agreement, may form a real intent not present before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My mother's death was not an easy one. In fact, it most probably would have been described by Senator Eggleston as a hard one&mdash;at home in a country town and with me, a fairly inadequate nurse, which she identified at one point and said, `I'm glad you didn't do nursing.' I asked her why and she said, `You're rather bad at it. But I wouldn't change you for the world.' As I said, it was a bumpy ride, mixed with sorrow and joy. The community nurses and her doctor, himself terminally ill, relieved her suffering to the best of their ability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the grief of my loss, I did not have to ponder the particular concern or guilt of my mother having made a decision based more on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> my needs than her own. The complex and tangled nature of love can lead just as surely to someone choosing voluntary euthanasia as a decision influenced by the motives of greed and personal benefit of those associated with a dying person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another concern I have is the pressure of a doctor suggesting euthanasia to a patient as an option. How many fearful patients may read into the doctor's suggestion that he or she anticipates that their dying will be insufferable or that the doctor has given up hope on them? Nor am I convinced that the interaction between the dying patient would not be influenced by the doctor's own difficulty with supporting and caring for a patient who is terminally ill. Doubts are also cast upon the ability of doctors&mdash;even three of them in the Northern Territory case&mdash;to decide if someone, especially a patient with whom they have had very little, if any, contact, is depressed. Nor are medical practitioners infallible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us most probably have examples of people in the last stages of their life&mdash;in fact even some with whom I have spoken&mdash;who have been in palliative care, people whom we would assume, and the doctors have assumed, are dying. They then, for sometimes inexplicable reasons, apparently defy their prognosis and, through spontaneous remission or through intervention of a new and untried therapy, live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have other concerns with the Northern Territory legislation but time does not permit me to address them all. In a perfect world, one may be able to devise a law that is free of the possibility of abuse. If that were the case, even if one were personally opposed to the law on moral or religious grounds, I believe it would be difficult to argue that others should not be free to choose to die when they believed that the pain and suffering of their terminal illness was unbearable. But we do not live in a perfect world, given the emotions of the dying person and the emotions and motives of those closely associated with them. Some, and maybe many, may not be in a position to make a free and competent decision that is not the subject of overt or covert pressures.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2091">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Individual rights do not exist in a vacuum. The integrity of individual rights is wholly dependent upon the nature of the society that begets them. The nation which would allow the vulnerable to be placed at risk for the pursuit of self&hyphen;determination by others is not a society, I believe, which can call itself a `free society'. A free society curtails individual rights for the common good. It pursues the greatest possible freedom for the greatest possible number of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right to self&hyphen;determination, presupposed by the concept of voluntary euthanasia or assisted suicide, must be balanced against the right of the sick and vulnerable to receive the protection of a just society. If we sacrifice the former, people will continue to suffer, and I acknowledge that with great sorrow. But if we sacrifice the latter, some&mdash;more likely the weak and vulnerable&mdash;may die against their will. Therefore I will be voting to support the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In determining how I will vote on this most important issue, I have endeavoured to read and contemplate all of the arguments advanced for and against euthanasia. I have tried to read widely and as much literature that I could get hold of on the subject. I have thought long and hard about the issue. I have tried to understand the depth of feeling of the people who support or oppose euthanasia. Like all senators, I have received hundreds of letters and many phone calls. I thank the people who have taken the time and trouble to put their point of view to me. I have considered my personal feelings and my conscience, but I have also tried to step back to make an objective analysis of all the arguments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have come to the conclusion that I cannot, in conscience, support a law which legalises and promotes the deliberate and intentional taking of human life. Accordingly, I cannot support the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. I will therefore support the Euthanasia Laws Bill. In explaining my reasons, I take as the starting point the question that I have posed to myself and sought the answer to throughout this entire debate. I asked the question: what is our primary 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> responsibility as law makers? In answering the question that I pose, I believe that our primary responsibility as law makers is to protect and advance the rights, freedom and welfare of our citizens. That is ultimately why we are here. The greatest of those rights, recognised in our system of law and also in any system of human or social values, is the right to life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without life, there is no humanity. The greatest individual right to be protected under the law is life itself. Correspondingly, the greatest crime that can be committed against humanity&mdash;against the law&mdash;is the deliberate and intentional taking of human life without just cause. This right to life is recognised in international covenants and in jurisprudence. This is not just a religious principle or belief. What is often called the `sanctity of life' extends beyond religious faith and belief in a god. It is fundamental, I believe, to human existence, whether one follows a religious faith or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The right to life is explicitly recognised in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 6(1) states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No&hyphen;one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I speak of rights&mdash;the recognition and the protection of rights&mdash;because that is central to the views of many who have participated in this debate. Indeed, the title of the Northern Territory legislation is the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of those who have spoken in this debate and have supported euthanasia, and people who have supported euthanasia in the debate in the wider community, have based their arguments on the principle of the right of the individual, on the freedom of the individual. It is passionately argued that individuals have the right to choose whether they wish to die or not at the time of their choosing and that other individuals and the legislature&mdash;the state&mdash;should not deny them that right. However, I believe that this argument, as passionately held as it is, is both illogical and contrary to the entire basis of our legal system.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2092">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, the right to life is recognised in that international covenant, but it extends much further and permeates our entire legal and social system. We have many laws which reflect the principle that human life is to be protected and advanced. For instance, we have a social welfare system and a health system underpinned by legislation that is intended to protect peoples lives and livelihood. We grant humanitarian aid so that people will not starve to death. We spend millions of dollars on rescuing people from otherwise certain death in far&hyphen;flung oceans. In more recent years, we have come to give specific and greater recognition to the rights of the disabled and the mentally ill under the law. We regard their lives as having worth and having meaning and we have enacted legislation specifically to promote that recognition. It was not always so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the light of this fundamental principle of the sanctity and worth of human life&mdash;of all individuals&mdash;which underpins our legislative and democratic system, I cannot accept the argument advanced by the supporters of euthanasia that there is a corresponding individual right to die and that it should be enshrined in law, contrary to the rest of the criminal justice system. The two concepts, to my mind, are mutually exclusive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, if, as the supporters of the Northern Territory law argue, such a right to die exists and if, as they argue, it is an inalienable right of all individuals and none should seek to interfere, then the Northern Territory law itself, which is based upon this principle, is both discriminatory and inconsistent. The Northern Territory law recognises a right only for the terminally ill who are of sound mind, are suffering pain or distress and can obtain the necessary authorisation. What is claimed to be an inalienable right of all individuals is confined by that very legislation to a very select group of people, namely the terminally ill. Further, the law provides that the only exemption from criminal prosecution under the law is restricted to a select group of people, namely doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this so-called right or freedom of choice, this individual right, exists, then why is it not available for all other individuals in society? 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It is a rhetorical question, I know, but it goes to what I believe is a fundamental issue in the matter. I do not seek to argue that the right should be extended, because I do not accept the principle that is argued for in the first place. But it is illogical to support individual rights and freedom of choice on the one hand as the basis for the Northern Territory legislation and yet support that same legislation which grants that right to only a very select few in strictly defined circumstances on the other hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Euthanasia is often referred to as assisted suicide. While suicide is no longer a criminal offence in most jurisdictions, the law nevertheless enables the state to intervene&mdash;forcefully, if necessary&mdash;to prevent a person from taking his or her own life. We believe that suicide is contrary to the interests of individuals and of society. We are rightly concerned and disturbed at the high incidence of youth suicide and the deaths in custody particularly of our indigenous people. These are recognised as major problems that society and governments must endeavour to prevent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that many of us know someone who has suicided or attempted to do so. I have known such a person. A close friend of mine from school and university suicided many years ago. I have often thought and wished, `If only I'd seen the signs at the time. If only I or other friends had had a chance to talk him out of it. If only we'd been with him and stopped him from jumping.' That is what society would have us do&mdash;take steps to prevent that suicide. That is what the law and our social and health systems would expect us to do. And we would have been right to do it, given the chance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that was obviously not what he wanted. His pain and his anguish was just as real and just as severe as that of the person with a terminal physical illness. His desire for release was just as real. But society does not condone and never has condoned that such suicide should be a right&mdash;to be assisted by other people and recognised at law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many instances of where people who are not necessarily terminally ill nevertheless suffer extreme pain and suffering and distress and may wish to end their life and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2093"> would like someone to assist them to do so. This very issue was raised during the Senate committee hearings and it was commented upon by the architect of the Northern Territory legislation, Marshall Perron, when he gave evidence to the committee on Friday, 24 January this year. I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Marshall Perron was asked by Senator McGauran:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Would you think that once this legislation, if kept in place, reached a maturity&mdash;whenever that would be, but several years down the track&mdash;you could look at changing it to accommodate others, as many of its advocates are already pushing, one being Professor Baume? For example, he already believes that people with disabilities should also have access to euthanasia. It is a similar point to the one Senator Abetz was making with you. Do you think that in time, with the maturity of this legislation, it should be amended so that other than the terminally ill can access it?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Perron replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it is too early to make that judgment. Quite clearly, no-one can predict what a democratically elected group of people might do in years to come.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator McGauran further asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You personally.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Perron replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe there is a case to expand the legislation to other categories. But, quite clearly, the proposals as put forward in the Northern Territory were limited to a specific group. That leaves unanswered the misery and suffering which we see and that I object to in groups other than the competent terminally ill adult. The first group that comes to mind perhaps is the non&hyphen;terminally ill competent adult, the quadriplegic, who might live for 20 or 30 years but be begging their carers&mdash;I believe many of them do&mdash;daily for release.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is clear that Marshall Perron, the architect of this legislation in the Northern Territory, does not see the concept of euthanasia and the right to die or the operation of choice as necessarily being limited to only the terminally ill, however that may be defined. Marshall Perron's view was also supported before the committee by a representative of the Northern Territory Voluntary Euthanasia Society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand and appreciate that a person with an incurable illness and only hours or days to live may wish that their life was ended. They may wish that someone would help them end the pain and the dis 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tress. But I can also understand that a quadriplegic confined to a wheelchair sees years and years of frustration, anguish and mental torture ahead and has that same desire for release. Unless Marshall Perron's wish to expand the legislation comes true&mdash;and, if it does, then we really are down the slippery slope&mdash;society and the law currently says and will continue to say that such a person has to accept the pain and suffering, notwithstanding his or her individual wishes or supposed rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Northern Territory law is, as it says in the preamble, about confirming the rights of the terminally ill, then why is it not also acceptable to those who argue for it that a person who is suffering from a terminal illness but is also diagnosed as suffering from depression to have access to euthanasia or assisted suicide? Why are they excluded if they also have rights? Under the Northern Territory law these persons are excluded. Under the Northern Territory law their inalienable right is not recognised. They have no equivalent freedom of choice to exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has also been noted that, whilst the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act protects doctors, it does not extend the same privilege to members of the family who may be involved in mercy killing or assisting a person to die. Equally, it does not extend to other health or medical personnel who may assist a person to die.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, the situation that applied prior to the Northern Territory legislation and which continues to apply in every other state and territory in this country, and indeed in just about every other country, is preferable to the position that applies under the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. The Northern Territory act is, in my view, contrary to the principle of the protection of the right to life under the law. Further, it is inconsistent, ambiguous and discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the debates both in this parliament and in the community a number of other issues have been raised. I cannot, in the time available, deal with them all but I would like to make some comments about some of the more important aspects of this debate. Firstly, it has been argued that the Commonwealth 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2094"> should not override a law of the Northern Territory. I cannot accept this argument. I reject it because this parliament has, particularly in recent years, taken the opportunity on a number of occasions to override the laws of the states. We have protected trees and forests; we have protected lakes and national parks; we have protected the rights of individuals to sexual privacy. I cannot see how we cannot take steps to protect the right to life under the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also point out that this Northern Territory law does impact on the citizens of other parts of Australia as people have travelled to the Northern Territory to have their lives terminated. Further, some proponents of euthanasia clearly wish to see the Northern Territory legislation as the springboard to extend legalised euthanasia to the rest of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, many have argued that the public supports euthanasia and therefore we should also support it and respect their wishes. The evidence for this is based upon opinion polling. However, on fundamental issues we do not necessarily accept opinion polls as indicative or as a basis for the making of sound law. If that were the case, then we would legislate to reintroduce capital punishment&mdash;something that I equally totally oppose. Yet I note that some who strenuously support euthanasia also vehemently oppose capital punishment on the grounds of adherence to the principle of the right to life under the law. I well recall the farcical and degrading debate in the United States in 1977 when Gary Gilmore, a convicted murderer, demanded his so&hyphen;called right to be executed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also note that, prior to the introduction of Marshall Perron's legislation, there was no public clamouring for euthanasia legislation around Australia or even in the territory. This is a situation where the Northern Territory Chief Minister used his position to propose a law that he personally wished to have implemented. The initial legislation which fundamentally altered the application of the criminal law in the Northern Territory was carried by a narrow margin. Also, there was no public campaign by the medical profession to implement the Northern Territory law. Rather, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> its operation has been opposed by the bulk of the medical profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, I believe there is significant confusion and uncertainty on the question of what is meant by a terminal illness. I have personally spoken to doctors who support the Northern Territory act, and I get different definitions. Some define it as when death is imminent&mdash;only a matter of days away. Others are prepared to accept a more lengthy period running to months or even years. The Northern Territory act does not define terminal illness with any degree of certainty. It does not specify a period of time within which death would be likely to occur for an illness to be terminal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These questions are ultimately a matter of the doctor's opinion; of their diagnosis. This is something which is clearly subject to error and wide differences of opinion, both between doctors and potentially between doctors and their patients. What, for instance, happens in a situation where the patient wants to die but the doctor says no, he does not believe the illness is terminal? We should not allow any law, let alone a law as important and as fundamental as the Northern Territory act, to be left in such a state of uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I believe that there is a substantial difference between a situation where death may be hastened by an ongoing process of treatment such as increasing doses of drugs for pain relief, called the double effect, and a situation where a patient is deliberately injected with a lethal drug with the specific and sole intention of causing death. Pain, suffering, illness, distress, anguish will always be with us. They are an inherent part of life. Some will suffer more than others. Many will suffer great pain and distress, physical or mental, during their lives. Some will suffer it greatly in their final days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must devote our efforts to alleviating that pain and suffering and distress as much as possible. That is where the focus of our policies and laws should be directed. It should be directed at improving the quality of life for all, including the terminally ill, through palliative care rather than directed towards finding ways of intentionally depriving people 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2095"> of their life. Our duty is to protect life under the law, not end it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Legislation normally appears in this chamber as government legislation. While provision exists for private senators and members to introduce legislation, a practice which is common in the Unites States Senate, it is a very rare event in Australia. The practice here is for the private bill to be introduced, first reading made and second reading incorporated, and then it never surfaces and it never comes into law. That is one of the characteristics of the system of government that we have when so much power resides with the executive government. So we as legislators become habituated to dealing with government legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a legislator, when a bill appears in this chamber, I have two concerns in examining it. The first is: what is the aim of the bill; it is a worthy and necessary aim? The second is the drafting of the bill; does the bill provide the definition of the means to achieve the aim simply, accurately and unambiguously?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we are dealing with the rare event of private legislation there is a second, and really a prior, consideration. That is: are we properly exercising our powers in debating that legislation? In a legal sense, the answer in relation to this particular bill is: yes, the Commonwealth is empowered to override the legislation of the Northern Territory in this instance. But the real question is: can we responsibly and honestly exercise that power? That must be the first question resolved before we debate the content of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is a federation. This house, the Senate, is the very embodiment of the federal system. When the founders came together to draw up the constitution of Australia, they had three dominant factors. First of all, this is a vast country. The second factor they had to deal with in a democratic system was the fact that the majority of the population lived in Melbourne and Sydney, just as they do today. The third factor was that there that there were six colonies, all independent, all proud of their achievement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The negotiations that led to the setting up of the federation of the Commonwealth of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia were protracted. They were not carried out by academic people. They were not carried out by well&hyphen;wishers. They were carried out by hard&hyphen;headed, practical politicians. And they gave us the constitution that we have today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were two key essentials they had to deal with. The first was that four states&mdash;the four smaller states&mdash;were not going to join with the two populous states and be overrun numerically. The second point they had to deal with was that, in recognition of the vast size of this country, Australia could not be run from either a national capital or from a series of state capitals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That determined the system that we have today, which is a federal system. It is a system which I have to say is almost totally misunderstood in Australia. And, sadly, a large number of people in this parliament simply do not understand the basis of the federal system under which we are governed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We hear a lot of comment about the difficulties of the present system of government in Australia&mdash;and, undeniably, it is difficult. A federal system is the most complex of all systems of government to operate. We are going to see that tonight at the Premiers' meeting at the Lodge and we will see it tomorrow at the Premiers conference, and that is only one example of the difficulties of running a federation. But it is the best system for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the concepts behind it was that the states wanted to join as free and equal partners. They wanted to put the colonies behind them and become part of the nation of Australia. So we got this federal system, a bicameral system, which consists of two chambers&mdash;two chambers with equal powers: the House of Representatives, with equivalent electorate populations; and a Senate, with equivalent representation numerically for each state. That balanced out the fact that we have 50 members in the House of Representatives from New South Wales versus five from Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept behind the federation was that, on matters of legislation, there would be a majority of voters supporting that legislation coming from a majority of the states. That, of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2096"> course, is tied up in the provisions of the constitution which relate to constitutional change. Implicit in the spirit of federation and the constitution of Australia is the equality of the individual before the law, and the equality of states. I would like to read clause 99 of the constitution because it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What the Andrews bill sets out to do is to take a sectional view with respect to a legislative provision. It applies a certain set of conditions to the territory known as the Northern Territory. To me, that is totally unacceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous speaker in this debate said that the Commonwealth often overrode state legislation and, therefore, it was immaterial to have these concerns in relation to this legislation. Section 109 of the constitution provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When a law of a State is inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealth, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The interpretation of that is that the Commonwealth legislation certainly overrides state legislation if it is in conflict. But the implication is that the Commonwealth legislation applies equally to all the states; it does not apply sectionally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The correct procedure is for Mr Andrews to withdraw his bill and draft a bill which legislates for the whole of the Commonwealth of Australia. Only then can we properly and responsibly discuss the contents of the bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that no bill has been so agonised over as this bill. I think it has made everyone really sit up or stand up and take a lot of notice of what is going on. The bill has been argued, and the debate has been on many levels. In assessing my views on the matter, I felt it was important to take into account the constitutional, as well as the ethical, dimensions of the bill&mdash;and I think 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator MacGibbon covered some of those things a moment ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in deliberating, I read with great interest the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee report on the bill, and I congratulate all those committee members and the secretariat involved in the process and the actual report. It is a most comprehensive document. Many things have been said about this bill. But I will not canvass all of the issues that have been canvassed, and I will try to keep my remarks reasonably brief. But I think the most important thing will be the way in which people vote on Monday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at the constitution, under section 52 the Commonwealth does have the power to intervene. So the question becomes: does it have the right? This becomes a political and constitutional argument. In considering this I looked at arguments put to the committee and elsewhere. I was mindful of comments by people such as Professor Tom Campbell from the Australian National University, who is quoted on page 14. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the intrusion of the Commonwealth Parliament into this matter is justified by the argument made by the Bill's proposer, namely that this is a matter of fundamental rights, then this introduces a novel constitutional basis for the exercise of Commonwealth power. There is nothing in our Constitution to require that fundamental rights are not equally a responsibility of States and by extension of Territories. The Northern Territory has a responsibility and right to determine for itself the implications of human rights in relation to such specific issues as euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then you ask: is this simply a question of states rights? Clearly, senators from the ACT and the Northern Territory believe so. Clearly, the governments in the ACT and the Northern Territory are adamant. They have all voted unanimously against this bill, even though on the issue of  euthanasia they are not unified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a passionate supporter and believer in states rights. If the residents of the Northern Territory do not like the law, they have a democratic process in which to express their view. That was mentioned by Anthony Macmichael in his comments to the committee, quoted at point 3.21 of the report. The alternative argument is put that this legislation is not limited to residents of the Northern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2097"> Territory. It goes further than that. It means that people from outside the territory can have use of the legislation. So, again, a determination has to be made as to whether, if the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act is not limited in its application, that negates any protection it might enjoy from federal intervention. That makes you think again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has noted in the report Senator Collins's notice of motion calling on the parliament to have an alternative bill prepared and presented, and that is discussed. There is some legal argument as to whether the external affairs powers of section 51 of the constitution give the Commonwealth power to enact a national euthanasia law. On the one hand, a senior lecturer in law at the ANU suggests it has. The Attorney-General (Mr Williams) suggests it has not. There are another couple of opinions for people to think about. So while I sought a clear signal on the legal and constitutional aspects of the bill, I found none so overwhelmingly convincing that it eliminated all the others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So then we move to the ethical issues surrounding the bill and we move to a different plane&mdash;a question of the national ethos. You talk about the preciousness of life. I know the day we are born we all prepare to die, but none of us really want to die. I think we all want to stay here as long as we can. Any doctors I have spoken to tell me that there is nobody who they know, generally, who really wants to give away their last gasp of breath. Most people want to hang on as much as they can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have examined the pro&hyphen;choice argument&mdash;the right of somebody to determine what they should do with their life, during their life or when they want to leave it. We do not have any choice when we come into the world. A human being does not have a choice; it is the people who bring that person into the world who have the choice. So should we have a choice to leave it? Obviously, then you talk about suicide and other things like that. If you look at the pro side of it, people say that we are legalising what is already happening. People are being put to sleep at the moment by an overdose of drugs. But that does not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> happen, I do not believe, as much as it may have happened in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a question of dignity and a merciful response to suffering. I thought long and hard about that. I think that is something I have to address. I looked at individual rights and autonomy&mdash;a competent individual should have the right to determine when they want to leave the earth. Professor Peter Baume, a former colleague of ours, had some things to say on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other people say that there is no moral difference between voluntary euthanasia and other medical end of life decisions. That made me think again. On the one hand, evidence was taken from many people with direct experience of nursing terminal cases. I have had many people saying that to me. I have known of people who have just recently lost loved ones who said that their spouses would have loved to have had the legislation in the Northern Territory so they could have gone to sleep.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard the very moving speeches in this place from people such as Senator Jocelyn Newman. I listened to what she said and I appreciate and understand her point of view. If nothing else has happened in this debate I think everyone has listened to everyone's point of view. I think it has been done in the right way&mdash;nobody has spat on anybody else's face. They have all listened to what everyone else has had to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those against the rights of the terminally ill to take their life talk about the sanctity of life, the slippery slope, palliative care and the erosion of medical ethics. The slippery slope and the sanctity of life arguments are ones that the committee made some points about&mdash;the duty to die. I think a point I could quote there is 6.59. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several submissions also maintained that, if euthanasia is legalised, cultural and social mores will change over time resulting in acceptance of a "duty to die" rather than a "right to die". According to these submissions, history shows that state authorised killing by the medical profession has the potential to destroy essential elements in the fabric of society and weakens protection for the sick and aged members of the community.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The slippery slope. The other day I was sent a copy of a speech given by Luke Gormally. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2098"> He was talking of containing euthanasia, the slippery slope. It was about the British House of Lords and why it rejected euthanasia. He talked about the experience of Holland and he then quoted what the House of Lords said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not think it possible to set secure limits on voluntary euthanasia. It would be impossible to frame adequate safeguards against non-voluntary euthanasia if voluntary euthanasia were to be legalised. It would be next to impossible to ensure that all acts of euthanasia were truly voluntary, and that any liberalisation of the law was not abused. Moreover to create an exception to the general prohibition of intentional killing would inevitably open the way to its further erosion, whether by design, by inadvertance, or by the human tendency to test the limits of any regulation. These dangers are such that we believe that any discriminalisation of voluntary euthanasia would give rise to more and more grave problems than those it sought to address.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the slippery slope argument and sets out what has happened overseas in the Netherlands and the concerns that people have there. Evidence provided to the committee from the Netherlands showed that the slippery slope maybe was in progress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of erosion of medical ethics, doctors have a position of respect and trust in the community. That is something that basically got to me more than anything else, as far as the inquiry was concerned. If doctors who are trained to save life then become a part of actually terminating life, that may in the future change the respect and the trust in the community. They have always been meant to heal the sick, not kill the unwell. Will the relationship of the healer and the comforter change if doctors have the power to do that? Doctors, of course, believe that would be the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have mentioned already, does the right to die become a duty to die? Is somebody lying in a bed deciding that they have come to the end of their life wanting to go to sleep or are they going to sleep because they are worried about whether the rest of the family are worried about them lying there? Or do they actually want to terminate their life for their own reasons?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the pressures applied to people within this chamber are immense. I do not believe, whatever combinations or arguments 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are applied, that a definitive, defining, persuasive argument has been put by anyone.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="2098" TIME="10.33 p.m." SPEAKER="Lundy, Sen Kate" NAMEID="7G6" ELECTORATE="ACT" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7G6">Senator LUNDY</NAME><STATE> (Australian Capital Territory)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.33 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like in the first instance to acknowledge the letters sent to me by the concerned citizens in the Australian Capital Territory and other parts of Australia. I want to thank you for taking the time and the effort to send me those letters to let me know your thoughts. I know the position I am taking on this bill will not please all those whom I represent, but after much contemplation of the widest range of arguments for and against the Andrews bill, I know that my decision to oppose the bill is sound.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The passage of Kevin Andrews anti-euthanasia bill will undermine the democratic principles upon which Australia is based and will cause great damage to the social fabric of our society. I want to talk about the messages that we will send to all Australians, and indeed the entire world, if we do not allow the Northern Territory's euthanasia law to remain in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first message we will send if we pass the Andrews bill is that Australia is not a tolerant place, that it is not a place that embraces the diversity of its peoples and of their cultural, religious, ethical and political backgrounds and beliefs. I believe that these differences deserve respect. I also believe that this parliament needs to make a lot more effort, certainly more effort than it has done in the past year, to affirm its commitment to making sure that Australia is a place where diversity and tolerance are values that are both enshrined in law and respected in practice. The federal parliament must state its commitment to this principle when it really counts, and it really counts now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate has an obligation to defeat the Andrews bill because passing it would be a statement that the views of some Australians about what gives life and death dignity and meaning are more deserving of respect than the views on these issues of other Australians. That kind of statement would be particularly offensive in this case for two reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first reason is that it would send another undesirable message that the Senate is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2099"> not willing to recognise that the church and the state should be separate. Passing the Andrews bill would mean that the Senate is more willing to uphold the values of certain religious groups in our society. In particular, it would affirm the perspective put forward on this matter by the church and its supporters, who have vehemently opposed the Northern Territory legislation and have mounted a well-resourced, strategic and highly emotive lobbying campaign in support of the Andrews bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Catholic Church and others are, of course, entitled to express their opinion on euthanasia, and the Senate should consider these views with respect. The Senate also has a responsibility, however, to realise that the group that shouts the loudest is not necessarily the voice that is representative of the Australian community as a whole. I remind the Senate that Australia is a largely secular society and many Australians who are religious are not Christian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason passing the Andrews bill would send an unacceptable message of intolerance is that the subject matter of this bill and of the Northern Territory law it seeks to override goes to the very heart of how each person makes sense of their own life as that life ends. Different people make sense of their own lives in different ways and we must not seek to impose one set of deeply personal views about life and death on people who do not share them and who may even find them repugnant. The Supreme Court of the United States of America puts it in this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the heart of liberty is the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Beliefs about these matters could not define the attributes of personhood were they formed under compulsion of the State.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Supreme Court was actually talking about abortion there, which is another issue that many people feel very strongly about. Abortion is another thing that some minority groups in Australia think the law should prohibit absolutely. But Australian law now says that women can choose abortion in a range of circumstances because it recognises that it is not appropriate for those minority views to be thrust upon people who do not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hold them. We senators should send a similar message of tolerance when we vote on the Andrews bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a second undesirable message we would send if we passed the Andrews bill. That message is that the democratically elected representatives of the Australian people refuse to listen to the people who in fact elected them. We would send the message that we really do not care what the people of Australia are saying to us about this extremely important and personal issue. We would be saying that we are wilfully blind and deaf to their pleas for death on their own terms, and we would send the message that we&mdash;the powerful people, the ones who make the laws that affect ordinary people's lives&mdash;do not care how much ordinary people suffer as they die. I cannot shut those people out for the sake of some other people's interpretation of abstract notions of the sanctity of life or the greater good. We need to develop our laws and public policy in a way that takes account of and responds to the particular cases of extreme suffering. We must not sweep them under the carpet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, Senator Abetz and many of his colleagues also claim that legalising voluntary euthanasia would undermine our campaigns against youth suicide, because it amounts to saying that it is okay for someone to be killed because life is too difficult. There is no doubt that youth suicide is a major problem in Australia. Our suicide rate for young people aged 15 to 24 is among the highest in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our young people kill themselves for a variety of reasons. They kill themselves because of the social and economic situations they find themselves in, situations they cannot cope with. We need to take steps to improve those social and economic situations. Different factors will lead different individuals to attempt suicide, but unemployment, family and other personal problems, physical abuse, sexual abuse, homelessness, a history of substance abuse and mental illness have all been identified as factors leading to youth suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But our young people do not kill themselves because we legalised suicide, which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2100"> was done as a response to the terrible plight of people who failed in their attempts to end their lives because we realised that the last thing they needed was to be branded as criminals. We legalised suicide in response to a difficult social reality. Why can't we respond with similar courage and compassion to another difficult social reality: the plight of desperately suffering people who want their doctors to be able to help them to die?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Returning to youth suicide: just as our young people do not kill themselves because we legalised suicide, nor will they kill themselves because we refuse to overturn the Northern Territory's legalisation of voluntary euthanasia for suffering, terminally ill adults. But if we do overturn the Northern Territory legislation we could be in fact contributing to making our youth suicide problem worse, not better. We would be reinforcing a message to young people that says, `We won't listen to what you have to say about what you need because we have other more important concerns and you are unimportant.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst our actions will send these messages to the community, we are also getting messages back, and I would like to turn briefly to the issue of polling of public opinion. By now we are all familiar with the fact that an overwhelming majority of Australians, at least three&hyphen;quarters of us&mdash;including the people in Kevin Andrews's own electorate&mdash;approve of legalising voluntary euthanasia in the way that the Northern Territory has done. As representatives of these people, can we ignore this strong indication? I am not advocating a poll driven decision making process, but I am making the point that, by virtue of the application of the conscience vote to this bill, the usual mechanisms that provide guidance or provide the linkages to the community, as described and practised in my party's rules and processes, do not apply. We are on our own. But to ignore completely this strong indication of the community's view is the ultimate indulgence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the 76 senators in the Australian parliament, 22 of us are women. It is interesting to note that the vast majority of these women senators have indicated so far that they will vote against the Andrews bill. We could 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> speculate about the reasons why the women in this chamber seem to be generally less willing than the men to support Kevin Andrews's attempt to dictate other Australians' decisions about their own bodies and their own lives. While you are thinking about that interesting question, we could also note that it is women&mdash;mothers, daughters, partners, nurses and friends&mdash;who actually perform most of the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day care of dying people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We could also note that Australian women on average live a lot longer than Australian men, so we women are more likely to end up in a situation where we have the kind of illness that makes us want a doctor to help us end our lives. We could also note that old, sick women are not a pathetic bunch of weak and passive victims who need protection from their subservient selves. That claim was made in a recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> article by Helen Verlander, who is a staffer in Kevin Andrews's office, although that was not acknowledged at the time. I reject this wholeheartedly, as it relies on insulting assumptions about women, insulting assumptions about older people and insulting assumptions about people with terminal illnesses. Identification with one or all of these groups does not mean an individual is less capable than the rest of us of working out what she or he really wants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refuse to tell other Australians that I will not let them make this fundamentally important personal decision themselves, and I refuse to tell them that I am better placed to make decisions about their bodies and about their lives. I would not do it on abortion, I would not do it on a range of issues and I certainly will not do it on voluntary euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a third unacceptable message that we would send if we passed the Andrews bill. That message would be that the Australian parliament is prepared to step onto a very dangerous, slippery slope. That is not the slippery slope that Senator Abetz, Senator Harradine and other supporters of the Kevin Andrews bill talk about; it is a different slippery slope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their claim is that, if we allow the Northern Territory's law to stand, we will inevitably 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2101"> slide into a situation where we tolerate killing off people without their request or, indeed, against their wishes. I do not agree with their assertion. That is all it is: an assertion that is not supported by any evidence at all. The slippery slope that I am talking about is the slide toward greater and greater interference in the human rights of Australian citizens, affected by a hidden moral agenda that seems to be influencing the federal parliament more and more. But perhaps it is not so hidden any more. It is the agenda of the Lyons Forum, the agenda of the driving forces supporting Kevin Andrews's bill. It is an agenda that is seeking to impose extremely conservative religious and moral views on Australian laws and policy regulating a range of social issues apart from voluntary euthanasia. It is an agenda that is against the interests, values and beliefs of all but a tiny handful of Australians who I can only describe as zealots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the course of the Senate committee's inquiry, Senator Abetz at one point referred disparagingly to `the warriors in the euthanasia debate' who support the Northern Territory law. I am more worried about the moral crusaders who would interpret the passage of the Andrews Bill as an encouraging sign: a sign that their political strategy was successful in this parliament, and a sign that they have a chance of implementing other parts of their agenda. If the Andrews bill is passed it would stand as a dangerous precedent. It would embolden this moral minority to try to pass legislation to remove the territories' powers to make laws permitting abortion, X&hyphen;rated videos, prostitution and any  other matter that they choose to describe as immoral or anti&hyphen;family. If you acknowledge that this possibility does exist, then you acknowledge that this slippery slope exists, hence your vote in favour of this legislation would endorse this agenda. That is the slippery slope we need to be worried about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Andrews bill shows that the territories are particularly vulnerable to the implementation of this legislative agenda of moral conservatism. I am not speaking as any senator; I am speaking as a senator on behalf of the people of the ACT. There are only four senators whose electorates will be directly affected 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by the Andrews bill. We all oppose it on the basis that it seeks to impinge upon the role and responsibility of the duly elected territory legislative assemblies. We oppose it on the basis that it unconscionably exploits a constitutional provision that technically allows the federal parliament to make laws for the territories. We oppose it on the basis that it violates  longstanding constitutional convention, that it is undemocratic and that it unacceptably discriminates between Australian citizens who live in the territories and those who live in the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These defects with the Andrews bill will make it politically unacceptable. They also leave the bill open to the possibility of a legal challenge under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights if it is passed. The individual claimant could be a terminally ill person, a carer of a terminally ill person, a territory voter or, indeed, a member of one of the territory assemblies. Many in the ACT have already declared their intention in this regard. As I said, there are only four territory senators. The other 71 may feel more inclined to support the Andrews bill simply because they feel that their support for this bill will not affect the laws in their state or the powers of their state legislatures. That is quite true&mdash;but only for the time being.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge all senators to think about the messages that passing the Andrews bill will send to all Australians, not just to Australians in the territories. They are messages of intolerance, dispassion, arrogance and powerful moral bigotry. They are messages that deserve no place in Australian law, public policy or society. I will be opposing this bill, and I urge all of you to do the same.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I rise to speak against the Bill before us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do so not only in answer to my own conscience, but on behalf of the clear majority of Australians who have expressed support for voluntary euthanasia; on behalf of the many Victorians who have contacted me with pleas to support the Rights of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2102"> the Terminally Ill Act; and on behalf of all those people who may not have thought about this issue, but who, like any of us here, may one day face the horrible possibility of a painful, protracted and miserable death.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am probably the last one in this Chamber to argue that the state has no right to interfere in the lives of its citizens. To the contrary, I believe the role of the state is to provide some form of sensible regulation which is vital for the fair and equitable running of a society. Therefore I won't say that the state has no right to tell a person when they can or cannot die, because I am aware that people are already making those decisions. What I believe the state must do is ensure that people have access to safety, proper medical advice, and as much decent care and support as can be given.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are others who also oppose the Bill before us today on the grounds that the state has no right to restrict the freedom of an individual to choose their own death, and to seek medical assistance to do that. It gives me a sense of ironic pleasure to quote John Stuart Mill, who argues that "the only justification for restricting freedom through law is to prevent harm to others." It puzzles me somewhat that so many of the freemarketeers in this Parliament, who would normally proclaim the sanctity of the individual and invoke the name of Mill, are in this instance opposing the individual's right to self determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also acknowledge that many senators support this bill on genuinely held religious grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to address some of the arguments advanced by those supporting the Bill and wishing to override the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is the sacredness of life, and the argument that no human being has the right to intentionally take away `a gift from God'. Obviously, these are religious concepts, and I respect the right of any Australian to declare or practice their religion, and to choose life over any other consideration for themselves. However, Australia is a secular nation, and as its Parliament, we have an obligation to make secular laws, not religious ones.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second argument is that euthanasia is contrary to the code of ethics and oaths undertaken by medical practitioners. Let me say that no doctor will be forced to participate in euthanasia under the Act, as there are clear safeguards against coercion of any parties involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are many doctors who believe that in some circumstances, voluntary euthanasia is the most compassionate course of action and completely in keeping with their professional duty of care to their patients. This is evidenced in the many letters I have received from doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, in a number of opinion polls conducted amongst practitioners, and in the famous 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Victorian letter from seven doctors which I will refer to later.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A third, passionate argument I have heard is that euthanasia, if legalised, would allow governments to reduce their obligations to providing quality palliative care. I think this argument is spurious. Euthanasia is not intended by any of its proponents as a substitute or alternative to palliative or other care or support. Government cutbacks to any medical or palliative services occur for other reasons, and I would urge those who have expressed their concern to be vigilant in their lobbying for the maintenance of such vital services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fourthly, it is argued that allowing voluntary euthanasia sends the wrong message to the aged, terminally ill, incapacitated and others that they are a burden on society, are not wanted, and are dispensable. Legalised voluntary euthanasia is not the same thing as advocating for people to die at whim. It enables a very limited group of people to exercise a conscious choice at a particular time of their lives. It will not be even remotely available to people who are simply elderly, financially dependent, or disabled, and any suggestion that these people are now `dispensable' is ridiculous. There are ample positive messages and practical measures we can focus on to ensure that `vulnerable' people are not made to feel marginalised, without having to deny rights to a specific group of terminally ill people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is argued that some patients are misdiagnosed, and could end their lives prematurely and unnecessarily under this legislation. There are several safeguards which I believe should counter these fears. Several medical opinions are just one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also argued that terminally ill people go through states of depression, and the decision to die could be made at a `weak' moment. The legislation provides for two cooling off periods, as well as psychiatric assessment. Voluntary euthanasia would simply not be available to those on an instant whim.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the most emotive argument I have heard is that euthanasia laws would lead to a tangled web of manipulation, abuse, and finally the creation of a fascist society, where people would be involuntarily put to death for a range of arbitrary reasons. The provisions of the Act are very specific and include serious penalties for anyone who attempts to influence or manipulate either doctor or patient in making the decision to be involved in medically assisted death. In the unregulated environment we have now, it is much more likely that abuse and questionable motives are involved in the deaths of some terminally ill patients. I would also make the point that no fascist regime that I am aware of has bothered to seek the imprimatur of an existing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2103"> democratic legal framework to undertake systemic murder of its citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those who oppose legislation which recognises and regulates the practice of euthanasia are inadvertently neglecting the vulnerable people they claim to wish to protect. In Victoria, for example, I have been told of cases where hospital staff seek the consent of relatives to end the life of an incurable patient, WITHOUT THE AGREEMENT OF THE PERSON THEMSELVES. In a state where hospital beds are in drastically short supply, I well understand the fear of many older and sick people that their lives might be measured in cost-benefit terms against the availability of scarce medical resources. This dreadful scenario is exactly what those of us who support euthanasia laws are intent on preventing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The importance of legalised euthanasia lies in stringent safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Rights of the Terminally Ill Act provides for the following safeguards:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a person must be suffering from a terminal illness before he or she can request assistance under the Act, and that illness must cause severe pain and suffering for which there is no medical measure or cure acceptable to the person.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also important to note that, under the Act</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> no doctor or other health care professional is obliged to assist any person terminate their life. (Those doctors who are strongly opposed to euthanasia will continue to their entitlement to not participate.)</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a request for assistance to terminate life can be rescinded by the patient at any time and in any manner.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the safeguards provided for by the Northern Territory legislation are well considered, carefully set out, and sufficient to make this a workable and humane law. Not one of us can guarantee 100 per cent safety against abuse of this or any other law of the state. But it is my view that a law entailing stringent safeguards will prevent more abuse of people's rights than pretending that active medically assisted deaths don't take place at all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Act is extremely narrow in scope. It is not an open door to a society where life is devalued, as some claim. It is by no means a declaration that only the fittest have the right to survive, as others have hysterically said. It is intended for use only by a very specific group of people, whose only other option is living with unbearable pain and suffering until inevitable death, and only by those who have chosen to use it. I cannot see how this law could be used to force vulnerable or unwilling people to an early death. It will, however, enable people, within the strictest criteria, to choose this option when few others are available to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And so, let me summarise the reasons why I believe voluntary euthanasia should be legally available in this country. I believe that the small minority of terminally ill people who want the right to die at a time and place of their own choosing should have that choice. If a terminally ill person is suffering the gross indignity of a slow, agonising path to an inevitable death, and requests assistance to terminate their life, then why shouldn't their dying wish be granted?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cite as an example the terminal disease call Motor Neurone Disease which brings about death through a progressive disabling process. As the disease progresses, the sufferer is increasingly unable to impact on their surroundings, and while they are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2104"> completely aware of what is happening to them, they are unable to do anything about it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many people can and do continue to live with MND with the help of quality palliative care and interaction with loved ones, and the associated pain can usually be managed with appropriate drugs. However the mental anguish of MND cannot be treated knowing what is happening to your body, and not being able to do anything about or with it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the MND Association states, providing support for people with MND is about providing options. The Northern Territory legislation provides just one additional option. The progressive nature of the disease results in the inability of a sufferer to take their own life, particularly at the end stages of the disease where there is little or no mobility whatsoever. Thus they do not even have the option of suicide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the Northern Territory legislation does is gives such people the choice of professional assistance to implement their wishes, without fear of endangering the caregiver.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me quote from a letter I received from Jenny Lang:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Choice is what dignifies individuals when they become helpless in terminal illness. The Northern Territory act gives sufferers the right to choose death when they have had what they believe to be enough suffering. It also gives them an opportunity to decline what they may well see as the inescapable miseries of palliative care: the stupefying effect of pain-relieving drugs, the loss of control, the nightmares brought on by large doses of morphine.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr. Margaret Otlowski, Senior Lecturer in Law, University of Tasmania, wrote the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"There is incontrovertible evidence that some patients do request active voluntary euthanasia or assistance in suicide and some doctors are acceding to such requests, however whilst these practices remain criminal, with the threat of serious criminal</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">liability, they are likely to remain invisible and consequently beyond scrutiny. The current legal situation is totally unsatisfactory in that it creates very real dangers for both doctors and patients: doctors are at risk of criminal liability for murder (or assessing suicide) if their conduct is exposed; the rights and interests of patients are vulnerable. . . the most effective way to protect the rights and interests of both doctors and patients is by acknowledging the existence of the practice of euthanasia and seeking to regulate it in carefully controlled circumstances. . . there is a very real risk of abuse if the practice remains covert and unregulated."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What the Northern Territory Act seeks to do is to regulate a practice that is currently already taking place in hospitals and elsewhere. You say there is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> no evidence, but you only need to open your ears and eyes to the anecdotal evidence willingly supplied by many relatives and doctors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer in particular to a letter signed by seven Melbourne doctors and sent to the Victorian Premier almost exactly two years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the letter, which was published on the front page of the Melbourne Age on March 25th 1995, the doctors declared that they had helped six terminally ill patients to die, a criminal offence in Victoria which carries a sentence of up to 14 years jail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"For the sake of all of those who may be unfortunate enough to be trapped in suffering and anguish, we ask you to put an end to the uneasy hypocrisy of our law and to allow us to work without fear of prosecution," they wrote.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The doctors included three GPS who cared for AIDS patients, a cancer specialist, a surgeon and urologist, and an anaesthetist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their declaration is explicit. "Each of us who has signed this letter has personal experience of treating terminally ill people whose condition has moved them to ask for assistance in suicide and each of us has, on occasion, after deep thought and lengthy discussion, helped such a patient to die.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"We declare this now in public, knowing that this declaration may be construed in the state of Victoria as an admission of a criminal offence. We do this because we believe passionately that this state's law on the assistance of suicide is wrong, and because those who continue to support the law have failed to recognise the reality of our work."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The assistance of suicide by doctors is already a recurrent reality in the state of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"We have assisted patients to end their lives and we know others who have. We believe that we have acted in the best tradition of medical ethics, offering our patients relief from pain and suffering in circumstances where it would have been an act of cruelty to deny them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"We respect life. All of our professional training and work deepens that respect. However, the reality is that there are some patients who are beset by physical and mental suffering which is beyond the reach of even our most sophisticated efforts at control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"When such patients clearly and repeatedly express a rational plea for help, it is out of respect for them that we have felt compelled to act."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This letter to Mr Kennett included some case studies of patients who requested and received assistance to die from these doctors. Some of these included:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A young man with incurable brain cancer told his GP that he was considering throwing himself from a high building, but that he was worried that he 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2105"> might fail to kill himself or upset those who discovered his broken body. The young man spent a day saying goodbye to this friends and surrounded by friends and family, died peacefully with his doctor's help.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A man in his early 50s, almost entirely paralysed by advanced Multiple Sclerosis, was determined to die but decided not to ask for help because he was reluctant to expose anyone to the risk of prosecution. He took an overdose and was found unconscious by a member of his family, who rushed him to hospital where he was resuscitated. The man was devastated by his failure and by the prospect of his increasing helplessness. With the assistance of a doctor, and with the support of his family, he subsequently ended his life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A young farmer suffering from AIDS was nearing the end of his life when he developed uncontrollable diarrhoea, a condition which totally dominated his final days and rendered him deeply depressed. His doctor could find no way of alleviating this suffering, and when the young man insisted that he wished to hasten his naturally looming death, the doctor agreed to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An elderly widow discovered that she had breast cancer and refused to be treated. As the cancer progressed, causing increasing pain and distress, she pressed her doctor to help her commit suicide, in a rational, well considered manner. The doctor was convinced by her resolve and agreed to assist her.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These doctors showed enormous compassion towards these people, and in many of the cases I believe made every effort to persuade their patients to take a different course of action. It was the clear understanding of their situation in each case that finally convinced the doctors that these were rational, adult people who had made a decision about their own lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately there are other cases where fear of the current law has resulted in terrible suffering. One case is described in the doctors' letter in which a man assisted the suicide of another dying of AIDS. He lacked medical knowledge and was forced to use a method which the doctors describe as "violent and hideous".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nobody can guarantee that the legal right to euthanasia for certain terminally ill people will stop such "backyard" practices from going on. And no doubt there will be those who want to die, but who do not qualify under the stringent requirements of the Euthanasia Act, who will take matters into their own hands with disastrous consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot prevent all non-medical suicide. We can and should do everything possible within the power and resources of the state to make the lives of all, terminally ill or not, worth living. But of course that is not always within the power of the state. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> And in cases such as the man with AIDS I just mentioned, the ability to go to a doctor and seek proper assistance without fear of recrimination or prosecution, could enable a small group of people to more dignified, more peaceful deaths. It may only be a small group of people, but the state has the obligation to provide that right to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Victorian doctors wrote, "It cannot be right to tolerate this totally unsatisfactory situation, where it is a matter of chance whether patients will receive the treatment which they so desperately seek and where it must be only a matter of time before some doctor is prosecuted by the state for following the dictates of his conscience."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me further quote one of the doctors, Dr Norman Roth, who said, "We go to enormous lengths to ensure that people's entrance into the world is as safe and painless as possible and yet, for difficult deaths, we provide almost nothing."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I oppose the Bill, and believe that the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act should be allowed to remain as a small, positive step for the right to a peaceful, well considered death for those individuals who so truly desire and deserve it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. First of all, I want to acknowledge the speeches I have heard and read that senators have made over the last three days. I compliment many senators on the eloquence of their speeches about this issue. Whatever one's view about euthanasia, it is an issue which has considerable dimensions in ethics, morals and the question of the nature of our society. I acknowledge that. Whatever their views about how this bill came about, senators have taken the trouble to make excellent speeches which I think have done the parliament great credit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A range of views has been expressed that I can either disagree with or agree with, but first of all I want to say that I believe this bill is an ill&hyphen;begotten bill. It is a very ill&hyphen;begotten bill because of where it has come from. The political cynicism in why it has been put forward into this parliament is part of the political agenda of a growing influential group in the present coalition government&mdash;the Lyons Forum. My colleague Senator Kate Lundy has just spoken eloquently about that influence and the political agenda of the Lyons Forum. This forum, according to public comments made by some members of it, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2106"> presently has 40 to 50 members from the coalition government. In a recent ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> program, it was claimed that eleven are ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Lyons Forum was founded in 1992. Now that they are in government and have that number of members you can see that they are trying to influence the outcome of a whole range of social issues in Australian society. This bill is a real test for them. If they win with this bill they know they are on a roll to set further conservative social issues that a vast bulk of Australians disagree with&mdash;not just on this issue of euthanasia. Other speakers have pointed out that public opinion polls range 60, 70, 80 per cent against the Andrews bill and in favour of voluntary euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This Lyons Forum is about controlling the social agenda and making a different Australia. They are, to quote Manning Clark, `the straighteners and punishers of people in Australia'. That is what they are about and I say to all Australians, `When you come to think about this present government, take note of the fact that, by their own admission, there are around 50 members of the coalition government who have a view dedicated to a conservative Australia socially&mdash;an Australia of 30 or 40 years ago.' That is what the Lyons Forum is about.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Eric Abetz, a member of the Lyons Forum, interjects. I just acknowledged that Mr Beazley and many others on both sides, once the issue of euthanasia was raised in this bill, treated it seriously and expressed their views. This is a political exercise by the Lyons Forum. There is rank hypocrisy in the Lyons Forum. Supporters of the Lyons forum consistently argue states rights. I do not know whether Senator MacGibbon is a member of the forum but, in a short five&hyphen;minute speech tonight, he better expressed the states' rights view and, in expressing that view, he said why he is voting the bill down. That is the view that you would normally expect from these advocates of states' rights&mdash;such as Senator Abetz&mdash;who spoke over the legislation concerning homosexual rights in Tasmania. Senator Abetz was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very concerned that a federal parliament or an international covenant would overrule Tasmania then. It suited his political agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This time around his view is quite different. It is hypocrisy. He is quite willing to use the federal parliament to overrule the territory parliament, democratically elected. I remind Senator Abetz that self&hyphen;government was the policy of Malcolm Fraser in the 1975 election, and he did not put any caveats on it to say that, at a later stage, the federal parliament would intervene against any Northern Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Abetz, I am not normally noted as a great states' rights advocate, and never have been. I believe in a national parliament and the national view. But I am voting against this bill, firstly, for the rank hypocrisy of those people in the coalition and the Lyons Forum who claim states' rights on every other issue except this one. Secondly, I am voting against the Andrews bill because I believe in voluntary euthanasia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Lyons Forum raise this issue that they are in favour of family values. That is the theme that comes out of it. But I have to say that, over my 10 years in this parliament, I have never seen too many members of the Lyons Forum out front, defending human rights around the world. I have never seen too many of them taking up and opposing capital punishment in the USA. These are human rights issues, which are the broad issues that are being debated here as part of the issue of euthanasia.</PARA>

The 80 per cent who support voluntary euthanasia should remember this. But it is not just on the issue of euthanasia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point out, as I have already, Senator Boswell, that Mr Beazley and others in the Labor Party conscientiously discussed and made their views known on this issue of euthanasia, and I do not dispute that. This bill is no longer a private member's bill. It is an astonishing thing that, in this last two weeks of this autumn session when there are 35 bills on the government's list, the government gives up four or five hours, four nights in a row, to debate voluntary euthanasia and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> then, today, the Leader of the Government in the Senate has the temerity to say to me, `You are delaying our program, because the debate over the Telecommunications Bill, which is a major piece of legislation, has gone on an hour or so too long.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When was the last time that a private member's bill has had this number of hours provided by special arrangement by the government? Why? Because the government itself, under the influence of the Lyons Forum, has made this, in effect, a de facto government bill. There is no other reason for the number of hours put aside in the Senate. Next week, after we vote on this, there will be an enormous pressure to compound and constrict the debate on all the government's budget legislation left over from last year. We could have dealt with all of that in these last four nights in the Senate over several hours during government business. But no; because there is a political objective going on with this government in setting this conservative agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> On this issue of states' rights, I made it clear that I have never been noted as a defender of states' rights. I believe in the national parliament and the national view across the board. I believe in constitutional reform, which I have argued for, to increase the powers of this federal parliament because I think we are all Australians first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have to say on this issue that the people who are supporting this are doing it for a different political agenda. They have just turned their nose up at their own government in the Northern Territory. They have told the Country Liberal Party government of the Northern Territory, `We don't care what you do or who you have been elected to represent in this process. Go jump. We know better than you.' Eric Abetz and these members are telling the Country Liberal Party and their coalition partners, their own Chief Minister, Mr Stone, and all his ministers, `We know better than you.' What arrogance on a democratically elected parliament!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I bet that if we argued here in the next budget that extra money should be made available for palliative care in the Northern Territory, the ACT or any of the states, the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2108"> dry economic rationalists and the Lyons Forum would be voting that down. They would be putting that straight down the gurgler. They would not be voting for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Lundy pointed out quite eloquently, it seems that the overwhelming majority of women in the Senate are voting against the Andrews bill. I think the point is right: it is overwhelmingly women who are carers in our society. I acknowledge that. But it is overwhelming us blokes who seem to think we are going to dictate what this issue is. It is typical of the arrogance of the Lyons Forum. One day I hope they publish a full list of their members and how many women members they have compared to the number of blokes and see whether the proportion&mdash;</PARA>

There will be a number of us, Senator Abetz, a member of the Lyons Forum, who will be happy to take you on on any number of issues. We are not going to let you and your narrow views dictate to the rest of the majority of Australians. That is what you are about.

The sheer arrogance of the members of the Liberal coalition in the Lyons Forum about this is breathtaking.</PARA>

Whether intended or not the act, passed by a legislature representing less than one per cent of the national population, has a direct impact on other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The point I would like to draw from this statement by Mr Andrews is this question about voluntary versus intentional. It seems to me that Mr Andrews would determine that the Territory legislation allows for the intentional killing of another person in a way that equates to murder. We know that simply is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you consider and analyse that view&mdash;indeed, that has been done in a lot of the contributions that have been made in this chamber over the last few days&mdash;that argument does not stand up. At the end of the day, the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act allows for people who meet a certain criteria, and who have made a decision, to proceed to have their life ended at a time of their choosing. Also, it has been very disappointing to hear people in this chamber, particularly a person like Senator Herron, seek to equate the Nuremberg war crimes with the people who have been involved with the use of voluntary euthanasia. I think that is a sad reflection on those people and a grossly unfair one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course we ought to have an informed debate. I share Senator Bob Collins's view that, if we are to debate whether or not there ought to be legislation for voluntary euthanasia, we ought to be doing it from a national 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2110"> perspective. I think that is the principal role of this parliament, and that is the way in which the debate ought to have been dealt with. The Andrews bill simply seeks to overturn legislation of a territory and disallow the territory from making such laws in the future. Of course, if it had come from a state, we probably would not even be having the debate. We would not even be debating it at this point in time, because the constitution would not allow us to overturn that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have in the past used certain powers of the Commonwealth. I heard earlier about how we have saved forests, but we have used particular powers of the Commonwealth that did not overturn legislation. We used powers of the Commonwealth, such as the Export Control Act, to save forests. We denied a state the right to export woodchips. It was not an issue of overturning state legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are looking at whether or not terminally ill people should have rights&mdash;and that is what we are really talking about in many respects&mdash;and whether or not they have a right to choose the time of their death and in a way of their choice. During the debate I have heard many people refer to human rights, morals, liberties and, of course, our conscience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is totally commendable for people to say they would defend the right of life and be totally opposed to the taking of life. I also share that view, but I believe those views have to be taken in the proper context when we are considering this Andrews bill. If the bill just sought to outlaw legislation that allowed for the taking of life&mdash;for example, the introduction of the death penalty in a state or territory&mdash;then I would not hesitate to support it. But that is not the case. It seeks to deny people a particular right.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the way in which people's rights have been expressed. I recall that Senator Harradine referred to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which, in part, says&mdash;and these are the first two rights&mdash;that everyone has a right to life and everyone has a right to liberty. I was curious about what that means in terms of liberty and what that means in terms of human rights.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I looked to the dictionary for a definition of human rights. They are `those rights which are held to be justifiably claimed by any individual, especially rights of the individual against the state'. The definition of right is `that which is due to anyone by just claim to give one his or her rights'. Liberty is defined as `freedom from arbitrary or despotic government; freedom from control, interference, obligation, restriction, hampering conditions, et cetera; power or right of doing, thinking, speaking, et cetera, according to choice'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a little bit confused that, in the course of the debate that we have had, those terminologies have been used to endeavour to justify support for the Andrews bill and overturn essentially the rights of territorians and other people. I have also heard people say that this has an effect on all Australians. It only has an effect on an Australian if that Australian chooses to seek that effect. It has no other effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In discussing this issue with a number of people, I accept that there is a potential for it to be misused, that it is probably impossible to legislate protection for people, not necessarily to be voluntarily euthanased but maybe involuntarily euthanased. Of course, it then comes back to this question about right of life. I am curious about the Andrews bill in that it does not preclude the withdrawal or withholding of medical or surgical measures for prolonging life; nor does it, as Mr Andrews said, apply to abortion. If the sanctity of life is so special, why does it not apply to those things? Why did not Mr Andrews include abortion in his bill?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Mr Andrews did not include abortion in his bill not for any reason that has anything to do with the value of life, but for another good reason&mdash;a political reason. I think he chose to avoid that, and that is clear in the letter that he sent to me. I think that if you are going to have a position where the sanctity of life is sacrosanct, that is, that it is the be all and end all of the argument in support for this legislation, then it should cover everything.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot on the one hand accept that a person, be it a doctor or a family member, can make a decision for the withdrawal or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2111"> withholding of life support or surgical measures that may enable that person to continue to live and say, `Well, that's okay,' but say that it is not okay for an individual to make a decision at some point in time after they have been diagnosed as being terminally ill and have met certain other requirements to end the pain and suffering that they are experiencing. You simply cannot argue that&mdash;if you do, then you have two levels of worth of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know how people can stand up in the chamber and argue that the life of an unborn child has less worth than a person who has made a free decision to end their life. In fact, I would have thought exactly the opposite. If you have a view about the sanctity of life, exactly the opposite ought to apply. I think there are very hollow arguments in favour of the Andrews bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard about the Aboriginal people's concerns, and I acknowledge them. The Northern Territory legislation does not apply to them, although somehow it seems to have been purported that it has special application to Aboriginal people. That is simply not the case. They have every right&mdash;the same right as every other Australian&mdash;not to choose to access the processes of the Northern Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had great difficulty understanding the emotional arguments about the sanctity of life which have been applied to the legislation. I do accept that there is a problem with legislating to build in protections to avoid exploitation or misuse of that type of legislation. Indeed, it may well be impossible to actually achieve that. You could refer to a whole host of other legislation but you could never be sure that it works to the full intent. At the end of the day, we have a right to make a judgment based on our conscience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, individually, have a right, along with every other Australian, including territorians, not to utilise the Northern Territory euthanasia law. But I do not believe we have a right to deny others who, of their own free will, choose to do that. Moreover, I do not think that we have the right to deny the democratic rights of territorians. For those reasons, I will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> be opposing the Andrews bill and I urge other senators to do the same.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the last speaker on this mater, I join this debate to support the Andrews private member's bill entitled Euthanasia Laws Bill 1996. It is important to state from the outset that there is a clear difference between the moral and legal right of a person to accept their fate by refusing massive amounts of medical treatment or switching off the machine and what we are debating this evening&mdash;the administration of medicines that kill, known as active euthanasia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The insidious Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, which is the first in the world, operates on new tenets for our society&mdash;tenets of hopelessness and neglect as distinct from hope and care. There is something very chilling about a health system that normalises the act of suicide for those aged 18 years and over. That is what our society will be doing if it accepts the Northern Territory euthanasia act because, once we normalise the state of hopelessness, we will accept the broader concept of suicide. After all, suicide is only ever chosen when the state of utter hopelessness is reached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While my views have been long held against euthanasia, they were confirmed beyond doubt by the Senate euthanasia committee inquiry. The evidence against the act of euthanasia brought before the committee was compelling. It is worthy to note that the committee received the greatest number of submissions of any inquiry in history. Add to this the personal submissions and lobbying to parliamentarians, the wide media debate on the issue and the overwhelming number of speakers in the House of Representatives and the Senate, and it is no exaggeration to say that this legislation is the most important, at least morally, to ever come before the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first matter the Senate report dealt with was in regard to the power of the Commonwealth to override Northern Territory legislation. The conclusions are clear cut. The federal parliament has the power under section 122 of the constitution, which reads in part: </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2112">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Parliament may make laws for the government of any territory . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You do not need any highly paid QCs to interpret the section. Its meaning is crystal clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to put the Northern Territory parliament in perspective with the federal parliament. The Northern Territory parliament has 25 members representing less than 4,000 people in each electorate. So this local-sized government should not be allowed to make such a decision that has affected all Australians and indeed the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Territory rights is not the issue; conscience is, and we cannot hide from that. The point I make here was borne out in the Darwin hearings when the Northern Territory Chief Minister and his Attorney-General came before the committee hearings. The Chief Minister and the Attorney-General both claim to be anti-euthanasia advocates yet believe that territory rights hold precedence. I refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. When the Attorney-General, Mr Burke, was asked, given that he was anti-euthanasia in conscience, surely then he would not be upset if the Andrews bill were successful. His reply was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Which part of my conscience are you appealing to?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Chief Minister, Mr Stone, when asked if the Northern Territory legislation were good or bad, simply could not answer. Senator Harradine jumped in and put so succinctly to Mr Stone:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two thousand years ago you heard the question: what is truth? Are you washing your hands of answering this question?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the question: is it good or bad legislation? So as a first argument it is hardly compelling evidence to support the Northern Territory rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, regardless of the claims by the Northern Territory government that the act incorporates the best checks and balances possible against misuse or unintended consequences, the Senate inquiry heard otherwise. It was found that the terms that lie within the act will almost certainly be taken at their broadest meaning&mdash;terms such as `suffering and/or distress', `reasonable medical judgment', `extraordinary measures' and so on. All these terms are incorporated within the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> key section of the act, section 7, which is entitled `Conditions under which medical practitioners may assist'. That is the key section of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the Darwin hearings, Dr Bowden, a young and highly professionally HIV&hyphen;AIDS specialist, gave convincing evidence of just how open the legislation is bound to become. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point is&mdash;and I stress again to you&mdash;the importance of what the act already says. The act already allows that people who may live for five, 10, 15 or 20 years&mdash;and I use HIV here because this is what we are looking at&mdash;from the day of their diagnosis, may elect euthanasia and would fulfil the criteria of the act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When that same proposition was put to the Northern Territory Solicitor-General, Mr Pauling, he was another who could not answer the question. Yet, as we all are aware, AIDS victims are probably one of the most vulnerable sectors of society to suicide, but now they have an extra&mdash;they are able to access the Northern Territory act from the point of diagnosis, which makes an absolute mockery of the image that euthanasia is only taken at the point of death and is for the aged and frail. In fact, it is open to the young and still able as long as they meet one criteria, and that is that they are distressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next argument studied by the Senate committee was the slippery slope scenario, which is based on the proposition that euthanasia is uncontrollable and cannot be contained&mdash;that is, voluntary euthanasia leads to involuntary euthanasia; euthanasia for the terminally ill would lead to euthanasia for lesser disease; and the highest respect for human life leads to the lowest respect for human life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The slippery slope proposition is central to the anti-euthanasia argument. Yet, ironically, before the committee, the proponents for euthanasia gave the best evidence in support of the slippery slope argument. It was the leading advocates of euthanasia who admitted the Northern Territory legislation was only a first instalment, that it did not go far enough. At the Darwin hearings, it was put to Marshall Perron:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2113">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you think that in time, with the maturity of this legislation, it should be amended so that other than the terminally ill can access it?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Perron's response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe there is a case to expand the legislation to other categories.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is clear from the public debate that the leading advocates of euthanasia believe that the current legislation needs to go further, including into the realms of euthanasia for the disabled and euthanasia for the mentally disturbed or emotionally disturbed. This is the dark side of the euthanasia debate that will be pursued should the Andrews bill be unsuccessful. It was the Quadriplegic Association that put this matter so succinctly: `Euthanasia&mdash;putting us out of your misery.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every member of parliament will attest that some of the strongest representations against euthanasia came from those with varying Christian beliefs. The truth is that many, me included, have reflected upon their own religious beliefs to help them come to a final decision on this matter, though I stress that Christianity is not a necessary criterion nor was a criterion for some taking a position against euthanasia. Nevertheless, the beliefs of the churches were encapsulated in the evidence given by the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we say it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">life&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is sacred and that the day of our death is something that is not to be determined by ourselves but by God.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was put by another:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . euthanasia is a revolt against God.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Equally compelling was the evidence given by a member of the Bishops Conference, Dr Margherita Nicoletti. Dr Nicoletti, who is the head of the churches' palliative care units&mdash;which, by the way, provide 70 per cent of non-government palliative care services&mdash;confirmed what every other palliative care specialist put to the committee: that is, modern palliative care is so advanced that it is acknowledged no patient is left in great agonising pain; rather, the miracle of modern medicine is such that suffering is minimised.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date drugs are not the only answer. Care and nursing is also needed. To quote Dr Nicoletti's evidence:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Physical pain is the easy thing to control. It is emotional and spiritual pain that is more difficult to control in someone who is terminally ill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">When that physical pain cannot be controlled, it is often a manifestation of something that is going on in that person's spirit . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That needs to be and can be explored, if not by the doctor or the nurse, by the counsellor or someone else on that team.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Dr Nicoletti's point of the emotional roller&hyphen;coaster was endorsed by another prominent witness, Professor Peter Ravenscroft, who testified that during treatment patients go through many emotional states, including a desire for induced death; yet in most cases, if not all cases, the doctors tell us patients endure and are able to reconcile their fears and fate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So often you hear the advocates of euthanasia say, `Why don't you open your eyes and see that it is already happening out in society?' I would say to that that it is not happening on any measurable scale and I would add, `What of the multitude of terminally ill who, in their stress, ask to die, only to be ever thankful later that their request for death was denied?'. To think most of these people would have been sent to their death under the Northern Territory law, given that the procedure can be completed within nine days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the existing health system or social system we know today, by denying the patient's very expected and emotional requests for death, we give the human spirit a chance to triumph. Under the territory law, the spirit is destroyed. It is worthy to note that, when the architect of the Northern Territory euthanasia bill and former chief minister was asked his opinion on palliative care, he replied that he had never heard of the word until after he had introduced the bill. Perhaps, if Marshall Perron had made himself aware of the option of palliative medicine, he would have had second thoughts about choosing the more expedient option of euthanasia. Nevertheless, I do accept that there are hard deaths that involve physical and emotional suffering. But this in no way justifies or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2114"> convinces me that legislating for euthanasia is correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advocates of euthanasia so often cloak the reality of assisted suicide in terms of dying with dignity. But since when is all dignity lost with a disability or a terminal illness? Since when is dignity reserved for the fit and well? A society that enshrines dignity in the terms of a proud, upright person and gives up offering care and compassion for even the seemingly most pathetic cases is a cold, soulless and ultimately self-destructive society. If the Northern Territory legislation is not overturned, get ready for every doctor, nurse, hospital and family relationship with a patient to change forever and for the worse. In the mind of every Australian suffering from a serious illness will be the questions, `Am I a burden? Ought I opt for death?' This is the perilous adventure Australia will propel itself on if it chooses to normalise suicide and accept the philosophy of death by request.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My views have also relied upon three highly credible international committees on euthanasia. The first was the House of Lords select committee, the second was the Canadian special Senate select committee and the third was the New York state task force. All rejected the concept of legalised euthanasia. Their reasons are best summarised by the House of Lords committee when it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prohibition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">on euthanasia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is the cornerstone of law and of social relationships. It protects each one of us impartially, embodying the belief that all are equal. We do not wish that protection to be diminished and we therefore recommend that there should be no change in the law . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I believe that on this particular issue it is clear that society's common good must outweigh the unfettered rights of individuals seeking euthanasia. I therefore urge the Senate to reject the practice of euthanasia and support the bill to overturn the Northern Territory Rights of the Terminally Ill Act. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address the issue of aged care in Australia. My concern is based on the concern of many constituents in my electorate, the Australian Capital Territory. Let us have a look at the message the government is sending older Australians at the moment. There will be an inequitable system of residential care for older Australians due to the fact that there will be no limit on what nursing homes will be able to charge in up-front fees. This represents a cut of three-quarters of a billion dollars to concessions for people on social security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of the Commonwealth dental program has meant that four million concession card holders no longer have access to free dental treatment. Older people with concession cards now have to pay 50c more per prescription but the government has not increased the pharmaceutical allowance to offset this additional cost. Some of these older people may even lose their concession cards altogether as the coalition `rationalises' concession cards, leaving 350,000 people without cards over the next four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another 30,000 senior health card holders will not be able to access free hearing services in another one of the cost-cutting measures of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). Despite its promises, this government will cut its contribution to the home and community care program by $88 million. This will be offset by user fees averaging approximately $6 an hour. Rent assistance is also in the line of fire for single aged pensioners in share accommodation. Older Australians claiming this entitlement could see up to one-third of their rent assistance being lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Due to cuts in funding of public hospitals to the tune of $800 million, older people will spend longer trying to access public hospitals. The move towards a user-pays society is becoming more and more entrenched in Australia under this coalition government. What this government chooses to ignore is the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2115"> inherent lack of social justice in their approach and what the long-term effects of such ignorance will be on Australia. I have to assume that this means that they do not care about older Australians or that they cannot see themselves in power after the next election. These explanations are the only things that can account for bills such as the aged care bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advice to the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) is ill-conceived and dangerous. The long-term implications on the frail and aged is sickening. Basic human rights will covertly be eroded by the introduction of legislation like the aged care bill. If this was not so serious it would seem quite ludicrous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has spent a large proportion of its time to date blaming Labor. They have painted what they know to be an incorrect picture of the situation. They have in the past compared the amount of money spent on older people with the amount of money spent on criminals and theorised endlessly about the injustice of it all but, when forced to come up with decisions about the direction of aged care services, they have pulled off a political charade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can the coalition claim to respect or understand the needs of older Australians when they are introducing these cuts that so obviously disadvantage so many older people? The Minister for Family Services has said that the aged care industry is merely looking for leadership, action and, importantly, decisions. The current government, it is true, is making lots of decisions, but these decisions and leadership are not based on respect for the needs of lower and middle income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mrs Moylan has conceded that Labor's policies were good but, instead of supporting the implementation of such policies and pursuing the path that Labor embarked upon, she has consistently condemned Labor for focusing policy on ideological grounds. Well, I contend that such a focus bases policies on a well-founded belief system that has indeed provided for all Australians. Instead, we have a Liberal government that is obviously served by some long-lost relative of Machiavelli. We 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> only need to quote Machiavelli to see how true his words are with respect to Mr Howard:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing does so much honour to a newly risen leader than the new laws and measures that he introduces.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Increasingly, older people are taking on even more and more responsibilities. With further cuts to child care and the continuing problem of unemployment, many older people are being asked to help cope with offsetting the costs of child care and care for family members who are unemployed. Inherent in the Labor approach is the principle that older people should be able to choose whether they want to take this role on. They should not be forced into a role of adhesive for a community that is falling apart under coalition policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The older community of this country also has a strong and very respected commitment to volunteer work. It is work that some older people choose to do to contribute to a community after a lifetime of contribution. But it is not something to be exploited. Again, this is something that they may choose to do. What I am seeing and hearing in my community is that volunteer organisations are being called upon to fill the coalition's funding crisis gaps. Older Australians, like all volunteers, do not and should not be exposed to patching up the social fragmentation of what is occurring in the youth, disabilities, legal, women's, health, housing and aged care sectors because of the economic rationalism of the coalition government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Constituents are saying to me that they are not confused or ill-informed, that they have tried to access information on the coalition's policies but they are too unclear. There are too many questions unanswered. The time frame for examining the aged care bill was ludicrously short. The limited information that has surfaced gives the community even more cause for concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard of a case where someone booked their partner into a nursing home but, as a result of the speculation surrounding the coalition policies, they withdrew their partner's name from the list and decided to care for them at home because they were too frightened they might lose the house they had worked so hard to own. The focus on short&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2116"> term solutions that the coalition is promising leadership and action in is quite antagonistic. Older Australians are attempting to fight these policies. But, like many other constituents I have spoken to, it is pretty difficult to fight what is not tangible or what is shrouded in mystery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A hostel for the frail aged in Canberra that I visited does an amazing job caring for socially and financially disadvantaged older people. This hostel has reported that the aged care bill will see a pensioner being $10.70 worse off a fortnight. A 17 per cent reduction may not sound like much to someone who is receiving $353.50 a fortnight. But, if the zealots in Treasury would like to subtract 17 per cent from their salary, the dimensions of this injustice may perhaps become more real. If these same bureaucrats were told that this 17 per cent was to be taken out for no reason, I feel sure I know what the response would be&mdash;they would not be happy. This type of legislation shows yet again that the coalition government has no commitment to the principles of social justice. This hostel report exemplifies how rural and remote areas will also be affected by the aged care bill alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Workers and managers in the aged care industry are consistently reiterating the fact that no additional money is being put into aged care residential services; instead, more people are being told to pay more money. Operators of hostels and nursing homes are being forced into a position of adjudicating on the relative merits of taking individuals into residential care based on how much and how soon they can pay. This is not fair and proves that this government's policies will marginalise older people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is just another example that demonstrates, I believe, the ineptitude of the research and advice the minister has received and taken. The minister has developed a penchant for attacking Labor's approach to consultation with the sector and postulating about the need for leadership, action and decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Successive Labor ministers have, however, addressed the issue of aged care, remaining committed to the concept of a fair and equitable system of quality residential care for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> older Australians. This is the ideological underpinning that the current minister has swept aside in the government's bid to economically rationalise aged care in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

Because Jenny Macklin, the shadow minister for aged care, has been going around this country spreading what are nothing short of scandalous and outrageous claims about what is going to happen as a result of that aged care bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lundy, I had to listen to you in silence because I was in the chair. I had to restrain myself. I now ask you to be so restrained&mdash;and I ask through you, Mr Acting Deputy President.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is nothing in that. It is so far from the truth. I would ask Senator Lundy to come to my office where I will go through it with her. I have to say that I can stand here and say there is no-one else in this parliament&mdash;and I cannot say this about many things&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2117"> who has taken greater interest in issues affecting older people than I have. I think I can say that without any fear of argument from anyone else. I have persistently pursued issues affecting older people since I came in here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Labor was in government, they neglected the issue of what was happening to nursing homes for years and years. They neglected a report by Professor Gregory, a report that they had commissioned, where he said that $520 million was needed to bring nursing homes up to current, acceptable standards. He identified the fact that a significant proportion of nursing homes had residents in four- and six-bed wards, sharing bathrooms with even more people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best nursing homes in Australia are better than anywhere else in the world. I can say that because I have visited nursing homes in England; I have visited nursing homes in France as a guest of the French government, where they took me to what they identified as their best; and I have visited nursing homes in America. We have nursing homes that would stand up to any of those, nursing homes that are better or as good as they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have, however, many that do not reach those standards. We have to put money into them. We have a limited pool of resources. Tonight we have heard in the debate on euthanasia of the need for more money to be spent on palliative care. There is only so much money in the bucket. There is only so much the taxpayer of Australia can tolerate. There is only so much that those who invest capital in Australia will tolerate before taking their capital offshore. So we have to do with the limited pool we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor realised that when they introduced the need to pay an `ingoing' or, what we now call, an accommodation bond to hostels. The world did not fall in when that happened, the world did not come apart. People were not discriminated against. Appropriate measures were put in place to ensure that people who had limited means or no means were able to access hostels. And we did not find the situation where those who had paid an ingoing were getting cream on their two&hyphen;fruit for dessert, and the ones who had not paid an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ingoing were not getting cream on their dessert. That did not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most bizarre thing of all was that, when you had a nursing home and a hostel in the same complex run by the same organisation, and sometimes the hostel was across the corridor from the nursing home, and a resident became so frail that they had to move across the corridor, the institution&mdash;the Anglicans or the Catholics, whoever they were&mdash;had to pay the ingoing back to the resident. I cannot understand the logic of that, nor could anybody else&mdash;why, if they had paid an ingoing to a hostel, it was not appropriate for them to pay an ingoing to a nursing home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have an ageing baby boom population. Senator Lundy and Senator Stott Despoja&mdash;Senator Stott Despoja gets up here and talks about young people all the time as if none of us have ever been young: I keep saying that I represent the old without having been old and I can also represent the young, but Senator Stott Despoja thinks she has a monopoly on the young&mdash;being young people, ought to be looking for every possible opportunity to provide facilities for older people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the next 25 years we will need about 2&half; times the number of aged care facilities in Australia that we currently have. That is given the current demand on nursing homes. I believe there will be an increase in demand for nursing homes because people who are currently in nursing homes and hostels usually have been in a monogamous married relationship for their whole life, where their children have a sense of joint responsibility for their parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But as the baby boom comes through, with the bizarre life that many of the baby boomers have lived, their children will have divided loyalties. Why on earth would many of them want to care in their own home for a parent and a step&hyphen;parent with whom they have never lived? There will be increasing demands on residential care because there will not be the same commitment to both parents by children or there will be divided loyalties. I will not go into all the permutations and combinations of families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given our current needs, we would need about 2&half; times the facilities. But my expecta 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="2118"> tion is that we will need more because we will have more women working and therefore we will not have as many carers. We will also have divided loyalties within families. We have to find a way of ensuring that not only do we upgrade nursing homes currently but we actually provide capital for the future. There was no way of providing capital under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is there a difference between hostels and nursing homes? One of the reasons there is a difference between hostels and nursing homes is that there is an ingoing required in hostels so they have the money to actually make the capital improvements. What we have tried to do is come up with a solution based on what Labor had done. If Senator Lundy really cared about older people, she would be saying, `Here is the proposition. That is what we did in government with hostels. How can we extend it to nursing homes? Let's make sure it is right.' I am not saying that there may not be some small changes that need to be made. We do not have the truth. There may be some small changes that need to be made but we have to find a way of upgrading nursing homes now and increasing the capital stock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me reiterate and remind anybody who may have been listening to Senator Lundy that nobody will be required to sell their home. They may have to rent it to find the money. What happens is that people who have adequate means, and that will be assessed on the basis of their income and assets, will not pay&mdash;I have to do this from memory&mdash;anything for the first $49 they have over and above the pension per week. Over and above that they will pay 25c up to $60 a day. What that will do will mean that we will have assets. But people could choose to do that by renting their home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they have a spouse or a long-term carer or a dependent child or a dependent carer or dependent child who is disabled they will not have to sell their home or rent their home. If they are in the nursing home for less than six months they will not have to pay an ingoing or an accommodation bond, as it is now called. If they are there for longer than six months they will be required to pay an ac

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Patterson)</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is like a two-man band, Senator Murphy.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems like we are the only acting deputy presidents left in the house. With regard to the draft aged care legislation that the government has brought forward and some of the points that Senator Lundy made&mdash;and I did not hear all the points&mdash;there is a degree of concern amongst the aged people of Australia about what is proposed in the legislation. I was interested to hear the comments&mdash;and I will be interested to hear further comments&mdash;you made in particular about people not having to sell their home.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my understanding of the proposed legislation that, if you are a full pensioner, you are seeking to enter a nursing home, you wish to retain the full pension and you have a home that you own&mdash;and I think somewhere in the order of 65 or 70 cent of Australians aged over 65 actually own their own home&mdash;you would have to sell your home to enter the nursing home, that is if you wish to retain the full pension. I think that is very clear in the draft legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What concerns me and I think a lot of aged Australians is: how do you actually determine the best time to sell your home? There is another issue relating to the home. Say you have a relative or a carer who has lived in the home with you for an extended period of time&mdash;I think five years is the minimum. The home is not then considered an asset for the purposes of assessment. I think that is also a problem. Why should five years be the minimum? </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2119">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How do you deal with people who may have suddenly, in the last two years, required assistance and may have a relative or carer who, according to the draft legislation, essentially has to be a recipient of some form of benefit. Who determines that they have minimal income? What is minimal income? I have been able to find out from the minister's office that someone considered to be on minimal income is someone who is on a benefit. I do not accept that. There would be many aged people in Australia who would prefer to live in their own homes and who may have a family member with a full-time job who assists them of a morning and evening. They may be the only times those aged people require care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is a whole host of problems associated with your draft legislation. I think there will be some significant changes required. I have a view that the legislation as it stands will force nursing homes and hostels&mdash;as far as I know, some nursing homes already do have an entry fee, but I stand to be corrected about that point; nevertheless, they will under this legislation if it is carried&mdash;to seek out people who have the financial wherewithal or have a home of a certain value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The intent of this legislation is to provide the capital funding, as you said, to enable nursing homes and/or hostels to redevelop or continue to develop and meet the requirements. I think it was Macgregor who said in the report that nursing homes needed an injection of somewhere around $520 million or $550 million of capital funding to bring a lot of them up to scratch. I found that a little bit interesting, given the government decision to provide funding to a nursing home in Launceston that did not even meet the standards in a report of the department. Your government took a decision to provide funding to that nursing home while other nursing homes in the area had to make the standards to get their funding. I think that is another issue you will have to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of organisations, including Aged Care Australia, have a different view. Aged Care Australia seek out the granny bond, which would be government underwritten. Their view of the world is that you give the money to the government and somehow the government provides funds from a pool. I am not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quite sure how it works on a state by state basis or who sits in judgment. I think that could have some political difficulties in relation to how you actually dish the money out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What about areas in regional Australia in which home prices are low? As Senator Calvert would know, in his area of Tasmania, down around Geeveston and Huonville there are a huge number of homes on the market. How would nursing homes in those areas seek out the necessary funding they might need, if you are talking about people having to sell their homes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a bit curious at the end of the day as to how you are going to raise all this capital if people do not have to sell their homes. If they keep them, they will have that assessed in terms of income for the purposes of determining how much pension they get.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the issue of daily and/or weekly fees. I was interested to note the maximum daily fee. From memory, from what I have read of it so far, if you do not do certain things in terms of providing information for the assessment of your income and your worth, you will pay the maximum fee, which is $60 a day. That is $420 a week. I imagine there would be very few people who would have the capacity to pay that sort of money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, I was very interested to look at how the government was going to change the application of paying rent assistance to pensioners. They were going to pay it directly to the nursing home. I think there was a $49 threshold. You could earn $49 as a single pensioner before you started to be assessed. They plan to somehow take $37 a week off people and give it directly to the provider. I find that an interesting situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even when people have paid an entry bond, an accommodation bond, a six&hyphen;month period must elapse before the provider can commence drawing down the money. They can draw up to a maximum of $13,000 over a five-year period and also the interest on the money, whatever the money is. If it is $100,000, they can draw down $13,000 over five years after six months plus interest. I assume that is the interest from day one. After 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2120"> five years they can take no more money, but what about the ongoing interest for people who remain in the nursing home for longer than five years? I would be curious to hear what happens to that.</PARA>
