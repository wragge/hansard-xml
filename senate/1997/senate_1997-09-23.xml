<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Why has Minister Sharp's aviation adviser written to a member of the Airservices Australia board requiring him to sign an undertaking to resign whenever the minister asks? Isn't it a fact that the Air Services Act clearly limits the circumstances in which a minister can sack board members? Which other members of statutory boards have been required to sign an unconditional resignation statement in order to be appointed or reappointed? How do you justify this unprecedented action which will nobble the independence of all statutory board members forced to sign these resignations? Do you concede that forcing board members to sign these letters will ensure that only toadies occupy positions on statutory boards appointed by this government?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All prospective board candidates who were asked to sign such a letter, stating that they would offer to resign if requested to do so, have willingly complied with such a request.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, can you indicate how many board members have refused to sign, and have they been appointed or reappointed? Secondly, now that you have told us that Mr Sharp has legal advice, will you table that advice so that all Australians can see that there is supposedly a transparent process of appointment?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not a supplementary; that is just a regurgitation of an interjection from the back row. If you had wanted to ask that question, you would have asked it. Unfortunately, you were not even listening to the answer that I actually gave you. It was a fairly short answer, but I was trying to cater for you; I was trying to be helpful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand why Senator Schacht might be distracted in this matter, as would anyone who saw that little story in the newspaper a few weeks ago about Senator Schacht being under great pressure on the domestic front. And then his spokesman said, `No, we have still got a constituency. It is basically the silent majority in the disgruntled unionists.' Fancy coming into the parliament and representing the disgruntled unionists of Australia. That is the level to which Senator Schacht has sunk. What he did not hear was this: that all prospective board candidates asked have willingly complied with such a request. So why get up and ask a question about how many people agreed to sign? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="C16">Senator HEFFERNAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill. Will the minister explain to the Senate why it is in Australia's national interests for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6710"> there to be a balanced equitable outcome on greenhouse gas emissions? Secondly, does the government's policy on greenhouse gas enjoy bipartisan support?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6710" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an important issue, and Australia is contributing to a good greenhouse outcome in the Berlin mandate process in the lead&hyphen;up to the Kyoto conference. Australia does so because it accepts that climate change is occurring and that steps must be taken to protect the environment. We believe that for there to be an effective international outcome in reducing greenhouse gases it must be fair and achievable. In other words, a successful agreement in Kyoto will be one that is fair and achievable. It follows that we are not in favour of a discriminatory approach, where the impact falls unfairly on some nations. We are not in favour of unfair sacrifices, and that is of course why we have argued the position for differentiation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth remembering to this background that Australia produces only 1.4 per cent of all world greenhouse gas emissions. Notwithstanding, therefore, that whatever happens in Australia will have very little effect upon the global outcome, we are still prepared to carry a reasonable burden but we are not prepared to sell out Australian national interests to do so. In particular, for the benefit of the Australian Democrats, we are not prepared to sell out thousands of Australian jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our position is clear and unequivocal. As we move towards Kyoto one would hope that that position would gain support across the parliamentary process. In that light, we are somewhat disturbed to see some signs that the Labor Party is now moving&mdash;in some misjudged effort, I suspect&mdash;to gain support from minorities within this country. On 25 June, Mr Beazley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would be reluctant to go down the road of committing ourselves to mandatory targets . . . We don't commit ourselves sight unseen to anything.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That seems a fair and reasonable statement. But what did he say today? He picked up on Mr Evans, who decided to take the lead. I will deal with Mr Evans first. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do see a case for targets: the consensus in the past within this country has been in favour of voluntary targets, but if the consensus internationally 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> moved towards something more binding I don't think we'd be wanting to stand out against that.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, we would not want to be standing up for Australian jobs; it is better to move towards the international consensus. Mr Beazley, not prepared to allow Mr Evans to get out in front, now says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The international consensus is moving towards mandatory targets . . . we cannot afford to be a rogue and stand outside on international consensus.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It now seems that Mr Beazley and Mr Evans are moving towards demanding that Australia sign on to legally binding targets, perhaps at the European level, that will result in the loss of thousands of jobs, without even knowing what those targets are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do I say at the European level? Because Mr Evans, the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, hinted as such on his last international tour. He got to England and talked with his friends from government in Great Britain and decided that we should be adopting a different position, not an Australian interest position. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I had an absolute earful . . . from a number of people in Europe last week, including the British Foreign Secretary who said that the Australian government was simply not credible.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, what he says is back the British position&mdash;a 15 per cent reduction that would lead to the loss of thousands of Australian jobs&mdash;rather than an outcome that is fair and achievable. Madam President, this is a vitally important matter and it is important that the Labor Party supports a reasonable outcome rather than one based on selfish interests. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not have an obsession with boosting the CPSU and ensuring that we maximise the number of public servants in the office any more than we do in doing anything other than making sure we have the best quality advice. This will lean very heavily on the private sector. We want to make sure that the legal and regulatory regimes that are in place will facilitate and not impede the growth of on&hyphen;line service and electronic commerce. It is very important that adequate resources are available but we also expect that there will be a lot of assistance provided by the private sector. If you look at the press releases that have been inundating us in recent times, you will see that overwhelmingly the private sector is wanting to be helpful and to assist the government.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I have a question for the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer. Could the Minister inform the Senate of any new resource developments in Western Australia which will benefit not only the Western Australian but also the national economy?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="6712" SPEAKER="Parer, Sen Warwick" NAMEID="KI4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Resources and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank Senator Eggleston very much for that question. I am absolutely delighted, Madam President, to advise the Senate of two major projects in Western Australia. The first of those is the Rio Tinto development at Yandicoogina in Western Australia, which will represent a $705 million investment and which is expected to come on stream in mid&hyphen;1999, less than two years away. This iron ore mine will initially commence production at five million tonnes per annum and, depending on market demand, will increase to 15 million tonnes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth pointing out that during construction of that mine&mdash;the ore treatment plant and transport infrastructure&mdash;the work force will peak at around 800 people. The permanent mine work force, direct and indirect, is expected to be in the order of 600 real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As regards the second one, the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region provides growing opportunities for partnerships in the Australian iron ore and minerals industry. China Steel recently announced its expansion of an integrated steel output and a large scale integrated steel project being progressed toward development by the Yieh Loong group. In fact, later this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> week I am to meet the president of Yieh Loong who is visiting Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are witnessing a number of new partnerships. Probably the most interesting of all is the merger of An&hyphen;Feng Kingstream&mdash;Kingstream being an Australian operation, I might say, run by Mr Ken Court. An&hyphen;Feng is the Taiwan company involved. They have created an integrated national steel producer with net assets of more than $A1 billion, paving the way for a project to develop a $1.4 billion steel mill near Geraldton in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This mill aims to produce steel slab to feed the requirements of An&hyphen;Feng's Taiwan steel rolling mills, generating exports of over $A750 million per annum by the year 2001. More importantly, the mill will provide for a massive employment generator with the work force hitting a construction peak of around 2,000 and a permanent work force of 900. This translates into indirect employment of around 3,500 real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, this project is strongly supported by the West Australian and federal governments. It has received the focused attention of Bob Mannsfield, major project facilitator in the Prime Minister's office. The department of industry has given it major project status, and the project facilitation unit in the Department of Primary Industries and Energy has given it its undivided attention. I met the chairman of An&hyphen;Feng, Madam Wu, earlier this year and again more recently on a private visit to Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, these two projects testify to the private sector's faith in the Howard government as a sound regime in which to invest.

I refer to the Prime Minister's forecast yesterday in the House of 90,000 job losses from stabilising greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels, and his citing of ABARE research which assumes that a carbon tax of $900 per tonne of carbon emitted would actually be needed. Minister, are you aware that a carbon tax of $900 a tonne is so massive that it would raise over $54 billion a year or about $600,000 for every one of these jobs you reckon is going to be lost? Are you aware that this tax is about 10 times the rate the Industry Commission found would be necessary to reduce greenhouse gases even more? Isn't it the case that the claims by ABARE being cited by the Prime Minister in his scare campaign are becoming so ludicrous and so extreme that they are likely to undermine Australia's already shaky international position?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me state again, and remind the Senate, that the government is currently repaying some of the Labor debt which was issued at 14 per cent per annum, while issuing new debt at around 6.5 per cent per annum.

The ANZ's Chief General Manager said that the new three&hyphen;year fixed rate is an extremely good way for customers to lock into a rate below seven per cent until the year 2000.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Deputy President, it does not matter how many interjections she makes because she still will not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> manage to get her point across. The reason why she cannot get her point across is that it is unsubstantiated by fact. The fact is this: nationally, 53.2 per cent of information technology employers in this country are saying that they want to increase their work force&mdash;not decrease their work force, Senator Lundy, but increase it. This is in direct contradistinction to everything we have just heard from Senator Lundy about how the information technology sector is going to shrivel up. It is not shrivelling up. In fact, it is growing, and it is growing at a faster rate than when Labor was in government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lundy would have you believe that information technology companies cannot be successful overseas unless they have a government tender. Let me give you a perfect example why that is wrong. There is a Brisbane based company which is preparing to float on the stock market. It is called Mincom. They are experts at producing software for the management of utilities. They are experts at producing software&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lundy, when there is a program that is designed for inordinate screeching, I am sure you will be an expert at it. What there is in Mincom is expertise in terms of utilities management and expertise in terms of stockpile management. This is a company that has been contracting to the private sector and is grossly, grossly successful in Asia. Of course, it is not because of what Senator Lundy says. In fact, what Senator Lundy says is totally and utterly away from the facts. The truth is that nowhere in the world do you find the information technology sector developing clusters based on government; they develop clusters based on innovative companies. That is what this government is trying to achieve. It is trying to achieve clusters of innovative companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Senator's Lundy's essential point is that they do not even want it outsourced. That is the point of view of the Labor Party. They do not even want it outsourced because they all want it done inside the department. Of course, if all of it gets done inside the department, none of that expertise can flow out to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6727"> private sector. Of course not. The only way it will flow out to the private sector is if the people leave the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lundy's speech here was not about innovation. It was not about information technology industries growing, expanding and becoming more innovative. It was about the shrivelling membership of the union movement, in particular the shrivelling membership of the Community and Public Sector Union, for whom Senator Lundy is the spokesman in this chamber. That is perfectly all right. We all understand Senator Lundy's prejudices, but it is a tragedy when the development of the information technology industry in this country becomes prostituted to the prejudices of Senator Lundy and the CPSU.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are directly opposed to the growth of the private sector. The CPSU do not want a private sector and yet Senator Lundy comes in here and says that she is interested in the growth of the information technology industry because she wants to lock it all up in the government. That is an oxymoron of the greatest proportion. That one is notable and,  of course, is symptomatic of what happens with the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They cannot see how you develop industry because they have never developed industry. All they want to do is lock themselves into some 1950s Marxist, Leninist, command-control economy where the CPSU give the shots to the union officials who are sitting in parliament and dictate the direction of the economy. Of course, it does not work. It did not work in Russia. It has not worked in China. It did not work in Albania. It has not worked in Cuba.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator O'Chee was listening to this side of the chamber and not his own during question time. I know that he has a keen interest in sport and he would have seen at least the symbolism of the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) being unable to answer a series of questions on his new responsibility. The first questions and answers, I think, were the most telling: `What sort of staff will you have, Minister?' `Don't know.' `How much money will your department have, Minister?' `Don't know.' `Where will you take the resources from, Minister?' `Don't know.' At least that was the essence of the answers that the minister gave us in response to the first question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a close look at the minister who is being championed as the saviour for the information technology industry in this country. He cannot even tell this chamber what resources he is going to have to administer this portfolio area which is going to be the saviour of the information technology industry in this country, if we are to believe the hype of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) earlier this month put out a press release entitled `The information economy'. He said that the information economy, properly managed, would deliver high economic growth, jobs and more choice for families. The Prime Minister said his government had given this sector high priority because it was the key to realising Australia's potential into the 21st century. The Prime Minister was right to place importance on this sector of the economy because information technology can offer much to future generations in the form of stronger economic growth, more jobs and a higher standard of living.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are well placed to realise this potential&mdash;or at least we were well placed under a Labor government. Under Labor, we were building a highly skilled work force. We were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6728"> building a culture of strong investment in research and development, in education and in training. We recognised the key role that government plays in this key sector. It accounts for 40 per cent of the information technology market and, therefore, has a pivotal role to play in developing the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard obviously sees this differently. His recent rhetoric is a long way from the reality of his policies. The reality is that it is almost a blind commitment to IT outsourcing. The reality is, as in other key areas of the economy and the community generally, it is an obsession with short-term financial bottom line by this government. Mr Howard cut the computer bounty. He cut tax incentives for research and development. As I said earlier, he is locked into a policy of outsourcing with contracts flowing not to Australian business but offshore to big multinationals. That is great for the industry! Senator O'Chee might have heard that if he were still in here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the Howard government has managed to match a great opportunity with no incentives, no policy framework and certainly no eye to  the future. Unfortunately, without a radical change in approach, this opportunity&mdash;the foundation for which was laid by the former Labor government&mdash;will be an opportunity lost. So let us not harp on the hollow announcements of this government creating a portfolio responsibility with a minister who apparently does not even have the clout to negotiate his staff or the financial position of this area of the department, or to know whether he is going to get more money or take money from other areas in his department. He could not answer those questions today. That is the only fair assumption on the material that is before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in the industry are hopeful that this portfolio responsibility will give some further impetus to their industry, but I think their comments have to be looked at when you look at some of the other comments of this government about savings to be made about IT outsourcing. There is an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> quoting Mr Cliff Smith of Novell, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the software developer, who is very clear in his statement when he says:</PARA>

The industry is saying that this government is not going to save money by its IT outsourcing policy. There may be some other reasons used to dress up the policy but, frankly, the policy is going to be a failure on the basis of trying to save this government money.

What he did was commission a number of reports. There was a report brought down in 1993. There was another report brought down in 1995, and then we went into the election.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> outsourcing of information technology services provided to the government and provided by the government. The steps that the government has taken are very interesting. Of course, ministers, government members and senators would have us believe that the private sector is very happy about the process which the government has embarked upon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would seem that that is not the case. It would seem that many departments and their officers and managers are not happy with the process that is taking place. The outcomes that we will achieve, particularly with regard to savings, are questionable. I will quote some statements in the media following an estimates committee hearing. Mr Andy Macdonald, the chief government information officer, and Mr Alan Nevins, First Assistant Secretary, Department of Industry, Science and Tourism, were reported as doing their damnedest to answer questions without actually saying anything. That is also the view, I think, of people within the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, it is said by the private sector that the approach taken to the letting of contracts is not going to work. There is no doubt&mdash;and I think we would all agree&mdash;that the information technology industry has a real capacity to provide jobs and significant financial benefits for this country. But it will not do that unless it is dealt with appropriately and properly. That is clearly not what is happening at this point in time with the government's approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, Mr Gosman recently appeared before the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee. In what is now a public statement, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you. We are here representing the Australian indigenous telecommunications industry. That includes companies such as Sytech, Jtec, Randata, Compucat JNA. We also represent the Information Technology and Telecommunications Security Forum, which has some 50 companies involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of our views on outsourcing, we agree with the comments of Minister Fahey in the recently released Goldsworthy report that outsourcing offers significant industry development opportunities, particularly internationally. However, we believe that such opportunities will not be grasped without a firm, explicit industry development policy. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6731"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Among the contracts that have already been released, a $30 million contract has been let to IBM by the Department of Finance, which has headed the charge of outsourcing information services within the government. The minister said on the one hand that piggybacking was wrong but then he let a contract to the same company without even going to competitive tender. Yet the minister's statement about competitive tendering and a series of exposure drafts for managers of departments all say that competitive tendering had to happen. Of course, Mr Gosman is quite correct. Unless the government does this right, we will not get the outcome that we should from this. Clearly, the government has not been doing it right. Of course, Minister Alston is not going to help matters either with this bogus ministry for information economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee last year 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reported on the crash of a Nomad aircraft at the RAAF Edinburgh airfield in South Australia, in which the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Donovan, was killed. The committee made the recommendation that the Defence Force Discipline Act period be extended from three to five years. The significance is that the Defence Force Discipline Act prescribes that, unless disciplinary action is taken against someone within a period of three calendar years, a statute of limitations applies and no action can be taken against the person so named.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a number of occasions&mdash;in fact, on far too many occasions&mdash;where accidents have occurred in the Department of Defence, the period of the inquiry has extended beyond three years, so the Defence Force Discipline Act has prevented any disciplinary action being taken against anyone who is found culpable in any way at all. This is clearly wrong; hence the committee's recommendation that the period be extended from three to five years so that it was not possible, procedurally, for someone to escape any censure, if indeed there was censure, to be attributed to their actions in relation to the accident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why it should take the Department of Defence more than three years to investigate an accident is a good question for the parliament to ask because, while a number of people are always involved in accident inquiries, and there is always research and data to be collected, a period of three years should be more than sufficient to reach conclusions and for action to be taken. But, unfortunately, that has not proved to be so in the past, so the government has advised the parliament that there will be an amendment to the Defence Force Discipline Act to extend that period from three to five years. That is something which I wholeheartedly support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is an important decision that the government has made. I would hope that it is only part of the business of an inquiry into, and a reform of, the processes used by the Department of Defence and the three services&mdash;the army, navy and air force&mdash;to inquire into accidents which involve either the loss of life or a major loss of property.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6742">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, these incidents are relatively rare in the services and, given the nature of service training, a loss of property and, at times, regrettably, a loss of life, even with the best of planning, occur. But it is important that there is a just and accurate inquiry process when those unfortunate incidents occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair comment that there is mounting public criticism of the way the services have conducted inquiries. We have had a number of them in the past. The principal one at the moment is the Black Hawk inquiry, which is getting a lot of publicity, and I do not wish to canvass or discuss that in the chamber this afternoon. But it is not confined to the Black Hawk inquiry. We have had a number of accidents, ranging through all three services, where lives have been lost and/or significant materiel or property damage has taken place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a degree of public criticism about the way those inquiries have been conducted. Consequential to that public criticism, of course, is a lack of public confidence in the services and their inquiries. It is terribly important that the services do have in place a system that provides a just analysis and a system of censure for anyone who falls short of what is expected of them in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken about this on numerous occasions because this has been an interest of mine that goes back many years. I do not intend to canvass the arguments this afternoon, but I just say that I have said in the past&mdash;and I have not looked at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to get the precise words, but I have used the phraseology in general&mdash;that the boards of inquiry which have been set up by the army, navy, air force or the Department of Defence have usually operated meticulously and accurately in their assessment of an accident. Yet no&hyphen;one has ever been held accountable for their actions when there has been clear evidence that they have failed to meet the standards or responsibilities placed upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the passage of time, I have looked at a number of boards of inquiry, and I am now satisfied that a lot of those boards of inquiry could have been much better conducted. It is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> important in the Defence Force that military justice takes place accurately and fairly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a complex issue, and it is bedevilled, in part, by the fact that, quite a number of years ago, this parliament moved away from having two forms of the application of military justice&mdash;military law&mdash;within the services. One form was where you appeared before the CO and were asked if you agreed to be dealt with by the CO in a summary manner or where you were asked if you wished to be subjected to a court martial or some sort of formal inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most misdemeanours were dealt with by the person on the charge electing to be dealt with summarily by the CO of the unit at the time. By and large, it might have been rough justice but it was pretty fair and most people supported that. Some years ago this parliament decided that we had to regularise it. We went more into a narrow legal application of military law. We have now seen a whole plethora of advocates and barristers and formal court proceedings. I think that has distorted, in some degree, the application of justice within the services. That is a bit of a red herring to what I am talking about here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am talking about here is when we lose lives through an accident or when we have major property damage. It is always essential in those cases to determine the cause&mdash;what went wrong and why it went wrong&mdash;so it does not occur again. If there had been negligence or carelessness involved then it is appropriate that those personnel who were negligent or committed acts of irresponsibility somewhere along the line get some censure for it; otherwise you cannot maintain discipline in the defence forces. Soldiers, airmen or sailors  are not going to do the difficult and dangerous things they have to do in defence activities in training if they see negligence or irresponsibility in their superiors, whether they are non-commissioned officers or officers, and loss of life or property as a consequence of it and no&hyphen;one being censured.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did propose that some while ago, about 18 months ago, we did need to look seriously at the whole of the system of inquiries that we have. I would hope that what we have seen 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6743"> today in the government agreeing to the extension from three years to five years for the statute of limitations under the Defence Force Discipline Act is the start of a review process by this government into the whole of the administration of justice within the Department of Defence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My proposition is that we have some independent inquiry, inspectorate&hyphen;general, set up so that beyond a certain level&mdash;and that level would be loss of life or material damage that runs into $5 million or $10 million&mdash;an independent body looks at all the causes and all the relevant facts, makes a recommendation and has the power to enforce disciplinary action or changes to procedures of the Defence Force that are consequential from that inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say with the greatest of regret, and having looked at this over a very long period in great detail, that I do not believe it is possible for the defence forces to act as judge and jury for their own affairs. I think it is a very similar case with the police forces. The police forces have demonstrated on numerous occasions that they cannot discipline and control their own activities. I think there is a parallel&mdash;and I say this with the greatest of sadness&mdash;with the Defence Force. We do need an independent assessment of that. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This report is the 25th in a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be accorded to persons who claim to have been adversely affected by being referred to in the Senate. On 21 July and 7 August 1997 the President referred to the committee letters from Mr Peter Mulheron and Mr Ray Platt respectively relating to remarks made by Senator Boswell in the Senate on 18 June 1997. The President referred the letters to the committee as submissions under privilege resolution 5. The committee has considered the submissions and recommends that responses agreed to by Mr Platt and Mr Mulheron and the committee be incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee wishes to emphasise, as it has done on previous occasions, that in matters of this nature it does not judge the truth or otherwise of statements made by honourable senators or persons. Rather, it ensures that any person's submission, and ultimately the response it recommends, accords with the criteria set out in privilege resolution 5.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the comments by Senator Denman are worthy of note. In particular, in following this procedure the Privileges Committee does not make a finding about the truth or otherwise of a statement made by an honourable senator. The whole purpose of this procedure is to allow people who have been adversely referred to in this place to have a right of reply. That means that sometimes people will have the opportunity to correct grievous errors against them, and sometimes people will take advantage of this procedure to perpetuate whatever myth they want to perpetuate. I do not want to form a judgment on particular circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6744">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do wish to address one of the matters which I think arises from the report of the committee, and that is the ability of persons who are not specifically named to make a submission to the President and to request of the Privileges Committee a right to make a statement to be incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. The practice to date has been that, where people are referred to obliquely, they should have that right of reply. Of course, Senator Ray has often said in this place that the committee errs on the side of safety and errs on the side of giving people a right of reply. But I am concerned that, if a person is not clearly identified, it is potentially inappropriate to extend that privilege too widely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give, for example, some possible fact situations. Suppose an honourable senator from the opposition were to get up and attack the members of the National Party.</PARA>

But, were that to happen, under the application of the convention as it currently stands it would be open to every one of the 40,000 members of the National Party in Queensland to make a submission to the Senate Privileges Committee via the President. Then the Privileges Committee would have to form a view as to whether to follow the practice or not.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How horrifying.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hogg says, `How horrifying.' I think it would be horrifying, Senator Hogg&mdash;not horrifying that we would set to right any of the wrongs of the opposition, but that the time of the Privileges Committee&mdash;and your time, Senator Hogg, is valuable&mdash;would be taken up in consideration of those sorts of matters. This is obviously the floodgate which could be potentially opened by the operation of the convention as it currently stands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously there has to be some leniency, but I believe that, unless it is possible to identify a specific person as a result of a reference made in this chamber, it is inappropriate for us to be extending a right of reply and incorporation of it in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to everybody who may potentially be caught in a class of persons. Imagine if 40,000 members 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the National Party in Queensland all replied to some of the things that we hear Senator Carr and his friends saying in the chamber every day. If that were to happen, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> would be several pages thick, the cost to the taxpayer would be outrageous and the good time of the Senate would be wasted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I am saying is I believe that the President should give some consideration to referring this matter to the Procedure Committee or to the Privileges Committee, as she thinks appropriate, and, in particular, asking either one of those committees to form a view as to what the threshold test should be for a person to have a right to make a submission and ultimately to have it considered by the Privileges Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If I were to say that members of the Labor Party, members of a particular branch of the Labor Party or members of a particular branch of a union had been indulging in whatever thuggish tactics, I do not believe it is appropriate that they should have a right of reply. If, however, I said that a person who was the secretary of a branch of a union&mdash;and there could only be one person&mdash;had indulged in thuggish activities, then obviously that person should have a right of reply against what I have to say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, the test should be whether a person or particular persons are exclusively identifiable by the reference made in this chamber. If a reference is made to a class of persons&mdash;and in the case of the matter before the Privileges Committee, I think Senator Boswell made reference to staff of a particular publication&mdash;then I believe that that does not necessarily mean that particular people are identifiable. There was no reference made to Mr Mulheron by name in the speech made by Senator Boswell. I do not believe that people were identifiable and therefore I do not believe an egregious wrong has been done against them. They have not been adversely referred to, in the same way as those people would probably not be entitled to take an action for defamation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators should bear in mind that this procedure was put in place because people who were adversely referred to in this chamber had no right to seek redress by way 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6745"> of an action for defamation. So, accordingly, Mr Acting Deputy President, may I respectfully suggest to you that you convey to the President my concerns about this matter and suggest that she give some consideration to referring it either to the Procedure Committee or to the Privileges Committee to ensure that we do not open a floodgate which would allow potentially thousands and thousands of people who feel aggrieved to have a statement incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> when they have not been personally referred to in this chamber and they are not exclusively identifiable as a result of a particular speech that has been given by an honourable senator.</PARA></SPEECH>

I do so only after extensive research. I do so only after deciding that it is in the public benefit to make certain facts known. It would be a sad day if senators were curtailed in this chamber from exposing extremists. Once we are possessed of such information and have checked and considered it carefully, it is our responsibility to communicate it to the Australian people. To hold back would be to be an accessory to the activities of the likes of Ray Platt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To keep this information private would be to stand by and do nothing while unsuspecting and decent Australians fall into the trap set by the likes of Platt and his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategy</EMPHASIS> magazine. The right forum for senators to use 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is the Senate. That is what we were elected to do and this is the place to do it in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Platt's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategy</EMPHASIS> newspaper is a haven for many of the undesirable far Right elements in our society. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategy</EMPHASIS> is full of one&hyphen;world&hyphen;government conspiracy theories. As editor, Ray Platt must take full responsibility for the offensive articles about Jews and for the advertising space he has sold to groups such as the League of Rights, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock, Stock and Barrel</EMPHASIS> and Christian identity ministries and&mdash;whether he sold it or not&mdash;for Pauline Hanson's half&hyphen;page ad in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategy</EMPHASIS>. Mr Platt is saying he did not sell the advertisement, but it is in there. What negotiations took place between Mr Platt and Pauline Hanson, I am not privy to. But, undeniably, there was a half&hyphen;page ad for Pauline Hanson in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategy</EMPHASIS> newspaper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Platt must take responsibility for promoting a tour by American extremist Jack McLamb, an associate of Bo Gritz who stood on the US presidential ticket along with the Ku Klux Klan's David Duke. That was in a paper. Platt must also take responsibility for publishing articles by Peter Archer and Tony Pitt, who are One Nation organisers and office holders. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategy</EMPHASIS> newspaper also ran a story about an interview with One Nation's Victorian convener, Andrew Carne, complete with a photo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While some articles may be harmless and merely ridiculous, other articles show up their true agenda of extreme Right thinking. I consider that my speech has been successful in alerting Australians to the dangers he and his newspaper represent. I voted for the legislation that allows Mr Platt to have his say this way. That is part of democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, many might think that, with his own newspaper, Mr Platt has had plenty of opportunity to defend himself and does not need to go whingeing to a Senate committee. I wish to point out to the Senate that Mr Platt has used his newspaper to make malicious and slanderous attacks on me, which so far I have been willing to let go through to the keeper as just one of the hazards of speaking out. I do not own a newspaper, but I am a senator, elected by the people of Queensland to raise issues of importance in the Senate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6746">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By bringing this matter to the attention of the Privileges Committee, Mr Platt gives me the opportunity to repeat with the greatest confidence the facts about his activities and the people with whom he associates. Ordinary Australians do not believe the same things as Mr Platt, or his newspaper would be a national daily. Mr Platt's connection to the One Nation party was integral to the speech I gave because it showed that Pauline Hanson's party was advertising for money and support in a newspaper tainted with extremism, racism and anti-Semitism. These are not social behaviours to which ordinary Australians aspire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In an interview with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 31 May this year, the national director of One Nation, David Ettridge, explained how radical far Right activists `won't have any effect on the policy, direction or literature of One Nation'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm streetwise enough to spot them and get rid of them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Ettridge has shown himself unable to deliver. My speech last June showed that One Nation was already advertising in Ray Platt's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategy</EMPHASIS>  newspaper. Since then, the links with other unsavoury groups of the far Right have grown more blatant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the current edition of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock, Stock and Barrel</EMPHASIS>, its editor, Ron Owen, describes in detail a meeting with David Oldfield at which strategy and policy were discussed. Also in attendance were Ian McNiven from the Firearm Owners Association and Tony Pitt, who has written for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategy</EMPHASIS> and is himself a One Nation office holder. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lock, Stock and Barrel</EMPHASIS> even advertises full transcripts of the meeting for $5 plus postage. They claim Oldfield said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If I'm going to fight anyone it's not going to be over keeping guns, it's going to be the bloody Indonesians.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Denis McCormack, chief spokesman for the group Australians Against Further Immigration, has also reported his meeting with Oldfield in the following way:</PARA>

It is not me who is suggesting that there are these links. I am reporting what the people involved have said on the public record. Far from not having anything to do with the far Right, as suggested by Ettridge, the One Nation party is actively associating with them. Oldfield is going around harvesting their support one by one. It is no wonder that the One Nation party is experiencing a slide in political support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, I thank Mr Platt for the opportunity he has given me today to fulfil my duty as a senator in exposing the extremist Right for what they are and who they are.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report does two things. It covers the reference to the Committee of a Bill as well as a broader reference involving the principles contained in that Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 19 June 1997, the Senate referred the Small Superannuation Accounts Amendment Bill 1997 to the Committee for inquiry and report. The provisions of this Bill tighten the arrangements relating to the early release of monies held in the Superannuation Holding Accounts Reserve (SHAR). The Committee was required to report on the provisions of that Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principles dealt with in this Bill are to be applied to the entire superannuation system. Accordingly, on 26 June  the Senate extended the reference to a comprehensive analysis and full public hearings on the implication of the provisions of the Bill, particularly their impact on low and middle income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill contains three principles for tightening the provisions governing the early release of superannuation benefits as outlined by the Government in the 1997 budget documents. These were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to remove access to superannuation monies where the balance is less than $500;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> to restrict access to superannuation monies for persons under preservation age who are permanently leaving Australia; and</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill affects the operation of the Superannuation Accounts Holding Reserve. SHAR was established by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Small Superannuation Accounts Act 1995</EMPHASIS> , commenced operating on 1 July 1995 and is administered by the Australian Taxation Office. It is a fee&hyphen;free collection system for small superannuation contributions, and provides for employers to pay superannuation contributions to the SHAR rather than to superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SHAR was established to accept contributions from employers where the employer's superannuation fund will not accept a particular contribution because of requirements that fees and charges cannot exceed the interest earned on such amounts.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matters raised in the amendments to the Small Superannuation Accounts Amendment Bill 1997 are also to apply to the whole of the superannuation system. To achieve the broader changes, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations</EMPHASIS>  and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Retirement Savings Accounts Regulations</EMPHASIS>  needed to be amended with effect from 1 July 1997.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's responsibility, however, was to inquire into the issues and not to recommend on the amending regulations themselves. Accordingly, the report examines, in turn, the general issue of preservation of superannuation and then the three specific issues raised by the amendments, namely:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee received 21 submissions and conducted three public hearings, the last of which was to hear from the relevant Government officials. During the first two hearings the Committee received evidence from the major accounting firms as well as internationally oriented companies affected by the changes to the permanent departure rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the changes to the hardship rules, evidence was provided by financial counsellors as well as individuals affected, which provided the Committee with useful case studies on the effects of the Government's changes.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government's original proposals were too harsh in their effect on lower middle income earners, particularly those suffering from financial hardship. In a climate of high unemployment, high redundancy rates and community wide job insecurity, workers who are retrenched or made redundant should be able to access their superannuation, as they have been able to in the past, if in severe financial difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's new arrangements could have an adverse impact on at least 78,000 people. That figure is based on the number of applications received by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission for early release in 1996&hyphen;97. Of course, the impact of the other measures preserving non&hyphen;residents' superannuation in Australia until preservation age would impact on tens of thousands of people on top of the 78,000 people that the new hardship provisions would impact on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's key recommendations in the report are: a reduction in the government's proposed waiting time to qualify for financial hardship from 52 weeks to 12 weeks; a reduction in the amount below which people can withdraw superannuation from $500 to $200; a six&hyphen;month transitional period for Australian citizens permanently departing Australia, to allow those who made plans under the previous rules to change their arrangements; and, finally, full access to superannuation benefits for non&hyphen;residents permanently departing Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's proposed measures, introduced by way of regulation, took effect from 1 July 1997. Labor has expressed concern in the report at the inconsistent approach of the government's overall superannuation policy, which restricts early access for people under 55, but effectively slugs Australians aged over 55 before they reach retirement age. The government is tightening the early release of superannuation on the one hand, but is forcing people who reach the age of 55 and who are in receipt of income support payments to draw down on their retirement nest egg before they are ready to retire. That is a result of social security measures that passed the Senate late last year. Effectively, the government is forcing battling Australians 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6751"> who have lost their job at the age of 55 to live on their superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee's report&mdash;I note with agreement from Senator Watson and his coalition colleagues&mdash;was critical of the government for the very short notice given before the changes took effect, describing it as `clearly inadequate'. This was supported by evidence from leading accounting firms, Coopers and Lybrand, Ernst and Young, and William M. Mercer. Mr Charles Blunt, whom some people here might remember as a former leader of the National Party, now Chief Executive Officer of the American Chamber of Commerce, described the short notice given by the government as `just a joke'. The report says that `many people were caught out by the swiftness of the government's changes'. The moves announced in the May 1997 budget were not gazetted until 26 June 1997, but took effect from 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee heard evidence critical of the government for failing to consult. This is a constant theme with the government in respect of superannuation changes: announce the changes, say you are going to consult, do not listen or fail to consult, and then just implement what you have announced. We have seen that time and time again in respect of superannuation changes. The superannuation tax just highlights in one major way the government's failure to consult. The report is critical of the government for failing to consult with those who may be affected by the proposed changes before they were implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the interesting, unintended consequences referred to by Mr Charles Blunt of the American Chamber of Commerce was the impact on the establishment of regional headquarters in Australia by international companies. The committee concluded that not allowing expatriate workers access to their superannuation upon permanent departure retrospectively overrides existing contracts of employment of those mainly chief executives, middle ranking management personnel temporarily in Australia. It was seen as a disincentive to the employment of expatriates and also to the establishment of regional headquarters in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The location of regional headquarters in Australia provides significant opportunities for economic growth and growth in trade and employment. Given this government's dismal record on unemployment, it is somewhat surprising that they have introduced a measure which acts as a barrier to investment in Australia and the creation of Australian jobs. Even government members of the committee were critical of the use of superannuation policy as a leverage for negotiating social security agreements with other countries&mdash;this is the government's excuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Concern was expressed at the length of time it will take to conclude such agreements and the lack of appreciation by the bureaucracy of the difference between Australia's superannuation system and that of other countries. Certainly, I do not think committee members were particularly optimistic about the alleged reason given for the tightening up of some of these provisions or that these negotiations with other countries could be resolved in the next 10 or 20 years, if at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor calls on the government to reconsider its policy of early release of superannuation policy. Labor will be moving a motion to disallow the current regulations before the Senate. There is one final reason that may convince the government of the foolishness of its approach&mdash;aside from the reasons I have outlined. We invite the government to take the opportunity to implement the fairer arrangements that I have identified. By implementing these fairer arrangements proposed by Labor, the government will save $182 million over four years. I reiterate that to the Senate: by adopting Labor's fairer approach on the early release of superannuation, the government will save $182 million over four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an amazing amount of money. And that is on top of the basic unfairness of these measures which are highlighted in the report&mdash;not just by Labor senators; a number of coalition senators have expressed concern at times in the report at the policy approach of the government. But saving  $182 million as a consequence of Labor's initiatives should convince the government, if anything can.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill would increase the amount previously appropriated for 1997 under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 by $17.938 million in line with normal price adjustments, taking total funding for 1997 to $909.263 million. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1997, Commonwealth funding alone is expected to provide 43,000 student places over and above those provided in 1996. This will contribute substantially to an estimated total increase of 55,000 training places this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill would also amend the legislated amount for 1998 to $890.585 million to give effect to the 1997-98 budget decision to reduce funding for distribution to the states and territories by the Australian National Training Authority by $20 million. The bill would appropriate the same level of funding for 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This budget measure provides an incentive to the states and territories to achieve efficiency gains in vocational education and training operations. The reduction represents about 0.7 per cent of total Commonwealth, state and territory funding for the sector. It should be seen against the background of a 37 per cent increase in Commonwealth funding for the sector since 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Australian National Training Authority Ministerial Council meeting on 23 May 1997, all state and territory ministers supported a resolution noting that the reform of the vocational education and training sector agreed at the meeting has the potential to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the provision of vocational education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, there should be substantial capacity to fund further growth in the sector from efficiency gains, including those resulting from the reforms led by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These reforms are far&hyphen;reaching and demonstrate the government's commitment to vocational education and training. This year's budget has clearly demonstrated this commitment with an overall increase in the allocation for vocational education and training of $144 million, or almost 12 per cent, compared with the expenditure of $1.2 billion in 1995&hyphen;96 when the labor party was in government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been some reallocation of funds to focus on our highest priority&mdash;the reform of the vocational education and training system and the establishment of new apprenticeships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">About 70 per cent of young Australians do not go from school into university. Vocational education and training has a major role to play in making sure young Australians obtain the skills needed to get them into jobs and in ensuring that Australian businesses can meet the challenges of the global economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is working with the states and territories to establish a training system which is responsive to the needs of industry and business enterprises, while operating within a national framework that is based on national standards and high quality, portable national qualifications. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6754"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The centrepiece of the government's reforms to vocational education and training is new apprenticeships. New apprenticeships are being developed to expand the number of training opportunities, especially for young people, into new industries to take advantage of economic growth and employment potential. At the ministerial council meeting last month, the states and territories endorsed arrangements to ensure implementation of new apprenticeships. This was an historic agreement to introduce a flexible, national system which meets the needs of today's enterprises wherever they may be located in Australia and whether they are large or small. It also maintains a focus on protecting the interests of those undertaking training, through simpler but quality&hyphen;assured regulatory arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ministerial council agreed that there will new funding arrangements for off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training for new apprenticeships, allowing employers and their trainees to choose the provider to deliver their training. For the first time, we will have a demand driven training system, giving employers an unprecedented opportunity to select the training that meets the needs of their business. More than $500 million a year in Commonwealth, state and territory funding will be available for allocation among public and private training providers under this `user choice' system. This bill provides the Commonwealth's contribution to that funding, as well as ongoing support for other aspects of vocational education and training provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides the solid foundation for building a national vocational education and training system which delivers quality outcomes, especially for young people, more efficiently and with less red tape. It provides a solid foundation for expanding opportunities for Australia's young people and improving the bottom&hyphen;line for Australian enterprises.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We had reached the stage in relation to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R216">Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  where I was replying briefly to some of the matters that had been raised. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS>  This bill has two principal purposes: one is to authorise nominated members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to issue interception and listening device warrants for law enforcement purposes; the other is to include the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission in the telecommunications interception scheme. Only one of those issues has been raised in this place and that, of course, deals with the authorisation of nominated members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to issue interception warrants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the Senate that the government has found itself in a situation where judges in the Federal Court and Family Court are declining to exercise their powers to issue warrants. As a result of this situation, the government has had to look to other means in order to issue warrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to clause 19 of the bill, the government has made it very clear that it is just not handing out this power to anyone; it is looking at people who will have to be nominated by the Attorney&hyphen;General and those people will come from a pool consisting of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6755"> the Deputy President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, a full&hyphen;time senior member, a part&hyphen;time senior member and a normal member. The deputy president has to be a qualified lawyer; the full&hyphen;time senior member has to be either a qualified lawyer or have special knowledge or skills as determined by the Governor&hyphen;General; and for the part&hyphen;time senior member or member there is a requirement that the person must have a practising certificate and must have been enrolled to practise for not less than five years. In other words, in the first instance we have the requirement that the pool from which the Attorney&hyphen;General draws is a pool of qualified people. That does not automatically mean that that person who so qualifies is automatically nominated. The Attorney&hyphen;General then exercises some discretion and nominates that person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would point out to Senator Bolkus who thought that some criminal experience was valuable in this area that, indeed, Family Court judges who have hitherto exercised this power have had no criminal experience. In fact, most Federal Court judges have had no criminal experience. Some of the finest judges in relation to the criminal law jurisdiction have had commercial backgrounds. So I do not see that as any particular problem in relation to the exercise of this power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect that I would raise is that in the Grollo decision the High Court had misgivings about the appropriateness of judges consenting to perform the function of issuing warrants. Even the High Court said that it was troubled by the matter. It went further in relation to the situation of the ACT where it indicated that there could be a conflict of interest. As a result of that, two of the ACT judges contacted the Attorney&hyphen;General and declined to exercise this power. It is a problem that I will touch on later when we come to one of the amendments posed by the Democrats. But suffice to say that, where you have a judge who is practising in the jurisdiction, there could well be problems with a conflict where that judge has previously issued a warrant for the interception of a telecommunication and then is dealing with bail of a person who is charged or is, indeed, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> dealing with the trial of that person. You simply could not have that happen. So there are aspects of conflict of interest to be looked at in this matter as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate that the government considers this to be a most serious power indeed. That was alluded to by speakers from the opposition, the Greens and the Democrats. It does not take this step lightly. It is a step that the government takes in an effort to have some way out of the impasse in which it finds itself. The interception of telecommunications is an important tool in the fight against organised crime but, at the same time, it is a serious exercise of power by a state over individual or individuals. What the government has come up with is a balanced approach whereby the liberty of the individual is protected, whilst at the same time ensuring that there is a strong mechanism available in the fight of organised crime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it regrettable that the opposition cannot agree to this and that others will oppose this bill. This bill has not been put together as some ad hoc remedy. It has been put together in a concise and rational manner to address a problem which was not of the government's making. It was the Grollo decision which said that the issuing of a warrant was an administrative matter. It was the Federal Court judges and the Family Court judges who said, `We do not wish to exercise this power to issue warrants.' Where does the government go? What room has it got left to move in? None, unless it comes up with legislative amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For there to be attacks on the government in relation to civil liberty or infringing on the rights of individuals is really quite out of order, because what the government is trying to do here is address a situation which was beyond its control. If those critical of the government were serious, they would look seriously at supporting this bill.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The issue before us is not the illegal tapping of phones but the legal tapping of phones. During the second reading debate, I heard some senators straying into the area of illegality. That is obviously an area which we would all be extremely concerned about, but the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R216">Telecommunications (Interception) and Listening Device Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  focuses entirely on the limited number of legal telecommunications interceptions allowed through the warranting process. Every speaker, especially those from the govern 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6757"> ment, confirmed that they would prefer judges to issue those warrants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1994 it was recorded that 30 out of 35 federal judges were designated as being appropriate to issue warrants. I am told that the number of judges who are capable of issuing warrants at this time is between 50 and 55. I would remind the Senate that there are over 700 judges in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we know is that the High Court has said that this function is an administrative one not a judicial one, but it has not said that judges may not do it. It has said that they may continue to issue warrants as designated persons. It is the federal judges who have now said that they do not wish to carry on because of their workload. It is the view of the Labor Party that they should simply be given the resources to relieve that workload, and that is a legitimate argument. If the demand for their services is such that they need extra resources, we should be examining that issue but that issue cannot be resolved through this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The judges have said essentially that they do not wish to do this job anymore. However, we all find some difficulty with that proposition because, in the meantime, they have been carrying on doing it. So there are senators and others who think, `Maybe it's just a bluff and they could do it regardless.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our approach is to recognise the problem, recognise the government's solution and essentially attack the problem from a different direction&mdash;that is, we would increase the pool of judges from which the Attorney-General can draw. We do not suggest that the more than 700 Australian judges would all be suitable or would all want to do the job, but we have laid out a set of judges who we do think would be suitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think judges of the Supreme Court of each state would be suitable. We think judges of the Supreme Court of the ACT or the Northern Territory would be suitable. We think a former judge of the Supreme Court of a state or territory would be suitable. Since every party has unequivocally said that it is judges they want to use first and foremost, we say to the government that here is a method 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by which you can increase your pool of judges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also remind the Senate that the AAT itself includes judges. My information is that the president is a judge of the Federal Court and 15 presidential members of the AAT are judges of the Federal Court. So by all means throw them into the pool as well from the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment is designed to take into account the particular circumstances that we find ourselves in. But it also has the benefit of enlarging access on a geographical basis; of making more judges available in cities, states and large regional centres where at present it is difficult to get the warrant process easily enacted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A judge means a judge or a former judge and will reflect the community concern clearly expressed by Senator Bolkus, of which we are aware, that the community wants these functions to be performed by judges wherever possible. We would suggest to you that these amendments are not contradictory to the government's intention or Labor's intention, but complementary to them. They in no way go against the spirit or the intention of the existing legislation, and in no way go against the spirit or the intention of the proposed amendments; they simply enlarge the pool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If anyone on either side of the chamber wants to tell me that state Supreme Court judges are not suitable for this task, having clearly outlined on the Labor side their preference for judges with criminal experience and background, and having outlined on both sides of the chamber their preference for judges anyway, I want to hear them publicly say to me why state judges cannot also fulfil this role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think I need to speak much longer. I think the amendments are quite plain on the face of them. I look forward to hearing your remarks and, hopefully, to experiencing your support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say on behalf of the government that it is unable to support this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6758"> amendment. Although there would be an increase in the pool, the question of whether the Supreme Court judges with their judicial duties would be in the same position as the Federal Court judges and the Family Court judges remains to be seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a similar problem with ACT court judges, as mentioned in the High Court, that is, the question of a conflict. There is no doubt that a state Supreme Court judge would be well qualified to make a decision of this sort, but the trouble is that in some of the smaller states, where the number of judges is fewer, they could well be deciding on a matter which comes before them in the criminal sittings. That of course poses a conflict situation. Although the pool is enlarged, you would need to make an application, perhaps, outside the state to try to avoid that. I am looking at, say, a state like my home state of Western Australia where there are only a dozen or so judges. It might have grown a bit more than that, but it is not a great deal. If you went to a pool of some 700 judges, as mentioned, you might well be looking beyond the state's border. That then has problems for the authorities concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As mentioned previously, the Commonwealth cannot force judges to do this job if they do not want to. That is a problem we face as well. That is what caused the amendments in the previous Labor government's time.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this stage I would like to make a few comments. The minister, probably a bit loosely, said that the opposition is opposing the bill. We are not opposing that part of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bill that relates to the Police Integrity Commission in New South Wales. We are on the record as consistently saying that we think that body should come within the ambit of this act. As I say, the minister may have been a bit loose in his language, but I want to make that clear at this particular stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I want to make is that we do not accept the argument put up by the government, nor do we accept the concerns of the Democrats in respect of this matter. The minister said that judges are declining. I think the facts will show that last year hundreds of intercept warrants were issued and there has been no hold up in the issuing of such warrants. The administration of justice has not been detrimentally affected by the reliance on Federal Court judges or federal judges to issue warrants under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the government to argue that judges are declining and warrants are not being issued is, I think, a misrepresentation of the situation. As I said, hundreds of warrants have been issued and the administration of justice is continuing at an acceptable rate. I say that to Senator Murray as well. He is concerned that the judges may go on strike. We do have a responsibility in this parliament to make the law, to balance all the policy considerations. We should not be pushed around by either judges or police forces. We should take their considerations into account and, of course, we should balance them in the context of all the concerns that we should take into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those concerns, of course, is to protect innocent Australians from excessive intrusiveness when it comes to telephone interception. That is particularly why, when this legislation was first framed, the balance was struck between federal jurisdiction judges having a role in issuing warrants and not judges of any other state or territory jurisdiction&mdash;and, in fact, no other person who does not hold a judicial office under the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So that is the balance that needs to be remembered. Our priority and our concern here needs to be to strike a balance again and to maintain a balance. Judges are in fact issuing warrants in their hundreds; they may in fact be knocking some back. I do not know 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6759"> how many have been knocked back, but it is within their ambit of operation and it is within their capacity to refuse the issuing of warrants in some circumstances. No&hyphen;one has argued that any police investigation has been jeopardised by a particular judge going on strike.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other concern raised by Senator Ellison is Grollo's case. Grollo's case was quite explicit. Six to one judges held that the exercise of the power to issue a telecom interception warrant by a judge was a valid exercise of power by the officers involved. It was not inconsistent with the exercise of judicial power. The High Court, of course, laid down some basic preconditions that needed to be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government, the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) and the Minister Assisting the Attorney&hyphen;General (Senator Ellison) cannot shy away from is that that particular case held six to one that the exercise of this power was constitutional. Not only that, in Wilson's case last year the High Court upheld the previous authority on the matter&mdash;Grollo's case. So we have had two recent High Court rulings upholding the constitutionality of this particular provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have to direct ourselves to on this particular instance is the proposal being put up by the Democrats. When this legislation was first framed, it was clearly understood that we were talking here of a federal function. Telecommunications is very much within the constitutional responsibility of the federal government. I think it was held by all sides of parliament at the time that, as such a function, it should be in the control of the Commonwealth government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of that, we held that it should be federal judicial officers who should have the power to assess any application for an intercept warrant. I do not think we should deviate from that particular position now. There may be a need for more judicial officers to exercise discretion here&mdash;that is the argument that the government is putting up&mdash;but I, for one, do not, and the opposition does not, accept the argument that we should broaden the net and allow state judges to exercise power as well.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, we are talking about a federal function. Secondly, at the time that this matter was first being canvassed in this place, there was real and legitimate concern about allowing state judges with the influence&mdash;and some of them under the influence&mdash;of their police forces to have the capacity to issue warrants. There was concern at that particular time about what was happening in Queensland with Premier Joh Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen and his lack of knowledge of the separation of powers. There was even concern about the corruption of some aspects of the police force in that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You could look at recent events in Queensland and say, `Well, there still has to be some concern about whether the separation of powers is understood in that particular state,' whether, in fact, there is sufficient separation from some judicial officers. We have seen the fiasco over recent months of commissions of inquiry in Queensland and how those commissions have been struck out on the basis of bias.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I think the policy concern is still a real one, and I think the concern about whether the separation of powers is understood sufficiently enough in some areas of some state jurisdictions is a real one as well. I do not say that is a legitimate concern in respect of most state jurisdictions, but I do say that it can be a problem. It has proven itself to be a problem in some state jurisdictions over recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So for those reasons, Senator Murray, we do not support your amendments. Not only for those reasons, though I accept that&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="HARRADINE" NAMEID="6H4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator Harradine</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is better than the government's from your point of view.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, from our point of view it is better that it be maintained under federal control, as opposed to allowing the net to broaden into state jurisdictions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing about the Democrats' amendments is that, in essence, despite Senator Murray's exhortations, at the end of the day the Attorney-General would probably still find himself in a position where he would be relying on the same range of officers that the government has put up in its package. So we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6760"> do not accept the Democrats' amendments for those two reasons and, as a consequence, we will not be supporting the Democrats' amendments. </PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="6760" TIME="5.35 p.m." SPEAKER="Murray, Sen Andrew" NAMEID="3M6" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="AD" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator MURRAY</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.35 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is better that I make a few remarks first, and then the Minister Assisting the Attorney&hyphen;General (Senator Ellison) will be able to respond. I would indicate that I have some difficulty with the arguments that have been put before us. If the federal judges have recused or excused or excised themselves, you no longer have any federal judges available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would have thought that, given Labor's choice&mdash;although, quite obviously, it is best to keep it neatly within the federal role&mdash;state judges are your next step before you go on to the AAT. What Labor essentially is saying is that they do not accept state judges, and we cannot have federal judges; therefore, they will accept the AAT. That is the indisputable logic of what they have just said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then the minister said he is concerned with conflicts of interest. Frankly, conflicts of interest arise now. It is always up to the judges themselves to recuse themselves or to refuse to deal with a particular issue. That issue is the same whether it is federal or state&mdash;and, in fact, it gets easier because of the larger pool.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point is that judges themselves are capable, by virtue of the authority vested in them by the constitution, of refusing to act at all in this situation. We have the Federal Court judges who have already refused to do that. So it is possible the state judges themselves&mdash;some or all of them&mdash;might take the same attitude and refuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth and most important rebuttal of the minister's remarks, I think, is that the Attorney-General himself or herself makes the choice as to which person to approach. Now he does that and he would do so in the future. So if there were a problem, as outlined by Senator Bolkus, with a Queensland judge or if there were a problem in the view of the Attorney-General as to competency, ability or appropriateness in a particular geographical or jurisdictional area, the Attorney-General would be able to deal with it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not found the reasons for opposing the Democrats' amendments convincing from either the government or Labor. From both sides it is the `we will have our model and nothing else' sort of approach, which I think is regrettable when we have actually tried to be of assistance in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, I have for my assistance checked on my last notes as to how many judges there are in Australia. Last year there were 767. So it was a pretty big pool.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bolkus asked a question about the number of warrants that were issued last year. The figures we have available are for 1995-96 and they show that there were 747 warrants issued. They were contained in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 report that is provided for under the act, which is a very good mechanism indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The judges have said that they are continuing to issue warrants on an interim basis only until alternative arrangements are made. That is only a temporary arrangement. This issue was not a problem when the 747 warrants were issued. So to rely on those numbers is by no means safe, because what we have now is only a temporary situation.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fine line, isn't it? What we are assessing here is the best way to go to ensure that some restraint is put on the issuing of warrants when police want to tap the phones of citizens. We have to be very careful that we put the civil rights of Australians up front in this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no minor matter that people have their phones tapped. It is also no minor matter that there are criminals in the community and we all want them caught. So it is a big balancing act. That is where the judiciary, whether it likes it or not&mdash;and, apparently, some of it does not like it&mdash;has a very responsible role to play.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think most citizens would want to know that, before a warrant was issued which allowed a police officer to tap their phone, the matter had been before a judge with consider 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6761"> able experience who had listened to the reasons and did not issue that warrant lightly. I do not think citizens would want it to go beyond judges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a piece of federal legislation. I have the feeling that Labor's position that it should therefore remain with federal judges is a strong one. Senator Murray has told us that there are 767 judges in Australia. Does that include state judges or is that federal judges?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MURRAY" NAMEID="3M6">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator Murray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is everybody.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the total. I do not know what the number of federal judges is. Senator Ellison for the government has told us that in the last year in which figures were available there were 747 warrants issued to allow phones to be tapped. I would love to have a list of whose phones were being tapped. In fact, I think that is information that ought to be available to the public&mdash;after the minimal amount of time lapse anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That information would make interesting reading for us all, particularly for people who are active in public life and who feel that their phones may be tapped for reasons which are not to do with criminal activities and are not to do with justifiable suspicion on behalf of the authorities but may have more to do with paranoia by the authorities which is wrongly directed against citizens active in public life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is a difficult matter, but I side with the Labor Party on this. As a strong defender of civil liberties, I believe it is a most grave matter to issue a warrant for police to listen in on phone calls. It is necessary on occasions. It ought to come before judges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The number of warrants we are dealing with is, on average, two per day for the whole of the nation. I do not think that is going to break the judicial officers down. I do not think that is a burden that is beyond the judicial capacity of the Federal Court judges. If it is, then the government has to see to it that the judges are given the augmented wherewithal to be able to deal with that average of one or two warrants coming before each judge per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come down very strongly on the side of civil liberties and safeguarding them. I am not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> saying that we should not have phone taps. Occasionally they are essential and the results coming from them bring good to society. We must not be cavalier about it; we must be extremely cautious.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might take that as an invitation from Senator Murray to just talk briefly about our amendments and arrange this committee stage into a cognate debate on the Democrat and opposition amendments. As I said in my speech on the second reading and as I said earlier today, we do not accept the government's contention that there is anything like a crisis in this area. There were 740 warrants issued in the last reported financial year. Though there have been some judges who have declined to issue warrants, it is obvious that the wide body of judges are performing this function entrusted to them by the parliament in a way they should do in accordance with the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not just our concern. As I said yesterday, the President of the New South Wales Law Society, Patrick Fair, said on 22 July:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the necessity of ensuring that appropriate safeguards of privacy are maintained, along with the integrity of innocent conversations transmitted by telephone, the Law Society has long expressed the view that any warrant to intercept these communications should only be granted by a judicial officer. Accordingly, the Criminal Law Committee does not support the devolution of the power to issue telephone interception warrants to members of the AAT.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is concern, there has been concern and there should be concern that governments and parliaments do balance the requirements of surveillance and law enforcement with the protection of the innocent. I think over the last 14 years or so since this legislation has been in place we have had a system in place which, it has to be said, the law enforcement agencies have been able to work within and work well within. I think 740 warrants a year is a fair indication that the system is working to the satisfaction of law enforcement interests. Without knowing the actual number of warrants rejected, I think it is fair to say that some innocent people have also been protected during the course of the operation of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney argues workload problems. But let us acknowledge that this government has slashed back funding for the courts. The Chief Justice of the High Court has been very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> explicit about his concerns. Other courts&mdash;family courts and federal courts&mdash;have also had the same pressures applied on them. Although you could argue that in actual terms the resources have been static, in real terms they have fallen behind. In a real sense federal courts have had to pick up more and more jurisdictions. The Federal Court itself, for instance, has over recent months had to assume responsibility for, amongst other things, industrial relations, human rights issues and a growing interest and concern in immigration related matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whereas the volume of work in that particular court has increased, its real resources have not increased. In fact, they have remained static in actual terms. So the courts do have more responsibilities. What this government should be doing in the interests of administration of justice is ensuring that the slash and burn policy when it comes to justice is not continued. If the government had adequately resourced the courts, and were it to do so in the next financial year, then you would not have this sort of pressure. But I suppose 740 warrants do not amount to more than a handful per judge per year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second concern that was raised by the Attorney was a constitutional one. It was raised again here today. I have to say that, in his public statements, both inside and outside the parliament, the Attorney has been quite misleading on the constitutional point. He talks about the constitutional problems raised by the Grollo case, but the Grollo case was explicit. In the Grollo case, which was a couple of years ago, the High Court held six to one that the exercise of the power to issue telecom intercept warrants by a judge, provided certain basic conditions of fairness and so on were met, was not inconsistent with the exercise of judicial power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was reinforced by the High Court last year in the Wilson case. In that particular case, all the judges noted that the issuing of telecom intercept warrants was not an issue before the court in that particular case, but the court specifically accepted the authority on the subject&mdash;namely, Grollo's case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Constitutionally, it is clear from recent High Court decisions that there is not the problem 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6766"> that the Attorney-General pretends there to be or that the Attorney-General's Department pretends there to be. In fact, I should say some parts of the Attorney-General's Department, because, as I mentioned yesterday, Chief General Counsel Mr Burmester only recently, in respect of the Crimes Amendment (Control Operations) Bill 1996, gave an opinion. I will read out what he had to say about Grollo. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the majority was prepared to uphold the particular exercise of power in question as it was the judges "deciding independently of the applicant agency whether an interception warrant should issue that separates the eligible judge from the executive function of law enforcement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the recognition of that independent role that preserves public confidence in the judiciary as an institution."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Chief General Counsel said that the High Court was prepared to uphold this particular exercise of power. So, on that particular ground, though the Attorney-General tries to blow it up into a concern, the law is quite clear&mdash;six to one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third argument the Attorney puts up to support his proposal is that it is, in some way, inappropriate for judges to issue warrants and then to be subject to judicial review by judges within their own court. That is and has been part and parcel of our judicial system. Judges are always susceptible to review by other judges of the same bench on a full bench. That happens quite consistently. Our argument is that the Attorney-General really is clutching at straws when he tosses up this third argument to support his agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, and I must put this on the record, we have here a recycled claim from the judiciary. I say `recycled' because it was one that was put up to us when we were in government. I think it has been put up annually for the last four or five years by the judges. The previous government, though it was suggested to us, did not feel there was a need for it. The figures that the minister has already spelt out today support the fact that we were right in our contention that there was not a need for it: 740 warrants issued by judicial officers of the federal jurisdiction over the last reportable financial year.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons, we oppose this. We oppose this for those broader concerns that led to the framing of this legislation in the way it was framed some 14 years ago: a concern to not hinder but to assist law enforcement agencies and also to protect the public from intrusiveness. We felt the protection was best maintained if you had a relatively high ranking judicial officer to scrutinise the issuing of the warrant. No reason has been proffered in this recent debate to suggest that we should deviate from that balance that has served the public and the parliament well over the last 14 years. It is for those reasons that we oppose the government's initiatives in this area.</PARA>

If that is so&mdash;and I want to put this on record&mdash;that seems to me a demeaning of people on the AAT. You have to make up your mind to have people from the AAT or not. It seems a bit harsh to enlist people from the AAT and then, when you get sufficient judges, to put them off the list. That seems to infer a lesser ability on the part of the AAT people and to use them according to convenience, which is not a very good way to go about this process.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I may respond through the chair, Senator Cooney, you are both right and wrong. The government, the opposition, and other parties within the Senate have clearly indicated a preference for judges. Undoubtedly, in the hierarchy of choice we as a Senate prefer judges ahead of other persons with legal training to issue warrants. That has been unequivocally stated in this chamber. But you are also wrong in this sense: 16 members, the President and the presidential members of the AAT, are also judges; therefore they feature in the hierarchy.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The whole thrust is that, if we do not have enough judges, then you appoint people from the AAT. Presumably they are going to do the job well and properly. If they do not do the job well and properly, we should not appoint them in any event. But if they are well and proper people to perform a job, how can you suddenly take it away?</PARA>

But if we do nominate him as a good surgeon, how can we then say he is not a good surgeon by taking away his brief in an obligatory way. The other problem that I have about this is that some members of the AAT at least are appointed on a temporary basis.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But to return to the thrust of your remarks, civil libertarians, the community, and everyone who has spoken in this house have all said that their preference is for judges, and that if the Federal Court judges had not said that they are refusing to do this task, they would have remained our first choice. The fact is that we are not advised that that refusal is permanent, so we wish to have the opportunity to give substance to the wishes of the community that if those federal judges change their minds&mdash;and it is the opinion of Labor that if they got enough resources they may well do so&mdash;the community would prefer that that function goes back to judges, however well regarded and however well the AAT does its job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me repeat what I said in the second reading debate. I, personally, and the Democrats, have the highest regard for the AAT.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have opened the floodgates now. You have given the government permission to go broader than judges and now you are saying, `Although we have said you can do that, we would actually like you not to do it.' Come on, give it a break! you are actually living in the real world here. What you have done by supporting the previous vote that we had in this place was to allow exactly what you are now saying should not happen. How about some consistency?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot go back to that vote&mdash;I know that&mdash;but you have let the public down in terms of your position on that previous vote. The arguments are all there, but you had some fear, formulated and fermented by the government, about traditional officers not doing the job. Now you are saying, `Well, they may have a rethink. They may wake up tomorrow morning and think it's not such a bad thing to do after all. We will do it.' You have been told consistently that this has been on the ambit claim agenda for four or five years; and, despite it being on the ambit claim agenda, some 740 warrants or more have been issued over the last full financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The judges have been explicit: some of them do not want to do it. That is what has led to the government putting this up. Now you are saying, `Well, okay.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Really, we are seeing an enormous overdose of naivety on this particular issue, Senator Murray, I am sorry to say. If you have those concerns, then you could have done something about it some 15 or 20 minutes ago. I said at the start that the opposition would support your amendments 4, 8 and 10 as a matter of principle.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In that case, I will certainly withdraw them. The fact is that just 30 minutes ago I moved an amendment which would have opened up the application of this bill to allow all the judges in this country to be accessed prior to having to go to the AAT. I said at the time that I thought that both the government's and the Labor Party's rejection of that amendment was very poorly argued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that there are 767 judges in this country. I understand that at the moment some 55 of those are accessed through this scheme. The Labor Party refused to even consider going down those avenues, and then they have the gall to complain that, because I would not let them split their bill, somehow I have been inconsistent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I say that something is a perverted system of logic, I mean that the twists and turns of it escape me. When I say that it is a dishonest representation of our views, I say it because, for blatantly political and aggressive reasons, the purpose, intent and argument behind our earlier amendments which were defeated by both the government and Labor were ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not intend to be referred to as being inconsistent in this matter. We have clearly said, `Judges first'. We have clearly said that we wish to enlarge the pool of judges, and we have clearly said that we rank the AAT behind judges. There is nothing inconsistent about that in our arguments or in our voting. All we refused to do was to split the bill. We refused to buckle under Labor's particular 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tactical purpose. That is the way this place works. The fact is this bill has to be dealt with on its merits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am quite happy to accept the points made by Senator Cooney&mdash;that he feels that there is an inference of a slight against the AAT. It is unintended, but it is without doubt the intention of these amendments to establish a hierarchy of choice and to reflect the community's view that these very serious matters should remain in the hands of judges; and that if the Federal Court judges review their attitude they will then be the people who should be accessed and the AAT people should be knocked off the list. That is the consequence of it. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have put the arguments plainly. I think I should have a plain response.

What is required is that, if enough judges become available, the minister must withdraw the nomination of a person appointed from the AAT. That must mean that, if the Senate passes this legislation, the Senate believes that an innocent person about whom an application is made to have his or her telephone tapped is going to get less fairness in some way if that application is made to someone from the AAT than he or she will if the application is made to a judge.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Murray tried to extend the pool to cover judges of the state jurisdiction, but that move failed. I then voted with the opposition in an effort, I suppose, in the long term, to retain this function for the judiciary. I can understand the points that are being made by Senator Cooney, but I do not quite see that that necessarily flows. One thing that I would like to raise with the committee&mdash;and perhaps the minister may respond as to how he sees it&mdash;concerns amendment 8, schedule 2, where the additional words say:</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask the minister and Senator Murray: in the event of a person being charged on the basis of information obtained as a result of the interception warrant, would it be open to that person, as an initial point I suppose, to challenge the basis of the charge on the grounds that the minister should prove that he was satisfied that the number of eligible judges was insuffi

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What the government says about this proposed amendment is precisely the query that Senator Harradine has raised, that is, that the proposed amendment not only requires the Attorney&hyphen;General to be satisfied at the time of nominating the person for the AAT that there are insufficient judges, but also to continually satisfy himself that the number of eligible judges is inadequate in order to justify the continuation of the AAT nominations. Not only is that an onerous task but, more importantly, it is an aspect which is subject to administrative law considerations. There is provision under the act that evidence which is obtained can be inadmissible if obtained under certain situations. Section 77(1) of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a communication passing over a telecommunications system has been intercepted, whether or not in contravention of subsection 7(1), then:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">other sections are concerned. What that means in general terms is that intercepted material and designated warrant information can be inadmissible except as provided. The government has the view that under that section there could be a problem if someone challenged the Attorney's nomination and said, `At the time you did not satisfy yourself adequately as to the number of judges available.' As I said earlier, this problem could be subject to legal challenge. There is also the practicality of it, that the Attorney&hyphen;General has to continually satisfy himself or herself that the number of judges is not sufficient. So you have two quite demanding obstacles in your path there.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand the system, it seems to me odd that my records are subject to an independent audit, yet the report that has been tabled here is not subject to any independent scrutiny whatsoever. I think that really is a weakness in the system. If one looks at the substantial claims that are outlined in this report before us&mdash;no-one is doubting the claims that are before us in this report&mdash;it lacks the authenticity of that independent evaluation and assessment so that there is no shadow of doubt that the document is free from any material error.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, though, I think it is good that the Australian people are made aware of what their politicians spend in exercising their duty and their right and their privilege in representing the Australian people. I think the Australian people do not necessarily have all that good an understanding of what politicians do in their day-to-day life. Of course, if they listen solely to the view that is presented to them by the media, in many instances they will have a completely distorted view. They 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6775"> will put completely out of perspective the amounts that politicians expend in dutifully pursuing what they are entrusted with by the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this report really does not serve as fodder for the media to carve up any politician of any persuasion&mdash;I think, in particular, it goes to the report that refers directly to me and other people in both this house and the other chamber&mdash;it serves the purpose of showing to the Australian public that we do have a great deal of responsibility, that we exercise it in a fair and equitable manner and that, like other people in the community, we are accountable for what we do.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, would like to comment on the DAS report and on the new travel arrangements. Like Senator Cooney and Senator Bob Collins before me, I found the utmost cooperation from the staff dealing with our travel arrangements in the past. Nothing but every level of assistance has been forwarded to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand the arguments for the need for new changes in terms of rationalising processes, cutting costs and introducing an element of accountability, but I am concerned to hear the points that Senator Hogg has just raised about whether that accountability extends right through all of our representatives. For instance, I note from tonight's news the concern with respect to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, Mr Sharp, and the question of whether he should be held accountable in relation to changes in his travel claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very concerning report on tonight's news was that Minister Sharp had made a significant adjustment to his travel allowance claims, but no reason had been given to the department as to why those changes needed to be made. I think we should all be accountable and Senator Hogg's comment is quite 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pertinent in that sense. I would like to know why I and any other senator or member has needed to change, especially in such a significant way, their claims in relation to their travel allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another issue I would like to highlight following Senator Bob Collins's comments about to what extent these changes relate to somewhat of a mirage or a fuss. I find those consequences affect me personally. They also relate to Senator Harradine's earlier questions in relation to the minister's department being responsible and the autonomy. Senator Harradine raises a very important point&mdash;this information will be within the minister's department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had an experience last year where certain information was leaked to the media about my proposed travel arrangements. It was very concerning. Whether I was planning to travel with my family or not was used as a political football in the workplace relations inquiry. How that information might be anybody's business is beyond me, but again it was used as a political football. If this information exists within ministers' departments, then how much more prone are we likely to be to those sorts of things occurring again in the future?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to highlight the point that, while all this fuss exists on accountability on these issues, where does it leave people such as me who are in situations new to representatives of this parliament, who have young children and need to juggle their family life in relation to their travel arrangements? We cannot raise those issues in this climate. The criticism would be appalling, because of all this emphasis and fuss that is being raised by this government on these issues. It is affecting women representatives with young families. We need to adjust the system to deal with our needs as they differ from those of other representatives. The system was designed to deal with a different nature of representative in the past.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, saw tonight's Channel 9 news story. I think the thing that needs to be said in relation to the DAS travel arrangements document tabled today in the Senate, which I understand was tabled in the House of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6776"> Representatives earlier, is that we can see what it says; we cannot see what it does not say. It is not an audited document in the sense that in an ordinary audit process an independent body would be vetting a document. What we have here is a document which expresses the view of the minister's department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I take the point that Senator Harradine made about the importance of there being a separation or at least a vindication of the minister's department position by independent bodies. For example, this document purports to set out certain travel costs of ministers. But if you look under the `car hire' column, you will see there is a hash symbol. If you look down at what that symbol means, you will see it means that the amount of money set out in that column only covers Comcar costs and excludes cabcharge and hire car costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some cities Comcar does not operate. So depending where the travel originated, it is possible that that would falsely represent the usage of the minister's entitlement in the sense that cabcharge or hire car&mdash;which are not represented there&mdash;might be a significant part of the costs incurred to enable the minister or parliamentary secretary to travel in accordance with entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say that because, if you look at the document, there are a great many annotations which set out changes or important factors which relate to the claims of individuals, for example, when they became a parliamentary secretary or a minister. I pointed out the annotation in relation to car hire charges and there is also an annotation that some figures include claims for spouse entitlement. Yet there is no annotation which relates to the alteration of the claim by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) as outlined in the report on Channel 9 tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Taking the words of Mr Laurie Oakes, who was the journalist presenting the report tonight, that alteration was made in `secret'. That is borne out by looking at this document and seeing that there is no annotation in this document which reflects the changes that had been made to the original claim and the repayment made in `secret'&mdash;and that was the term used by the journalist in that story. If the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> journalist is correct, then this is a very serious matter, and I am sure my comments will merely skim the surface of the comments that will be made in relation to this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hark back to Senator Harradine's comments that, if we are to receive these reports, then they should not be sanitised by the minister's department, certainly not simply to protect any particular minister or parliamentary secretary. I understand&mdash;and senators can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that no such alteration or concealment would have occurred in the figures which have been presented by the Senate over the last few years and published. Those figures were available publicly and, if someone claimed to have repaid something that they had originally claimed, that would be shown in the reports presented to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would like to raise an issue that came about as a result of the tabling of the report on the operation of the War Crimes Act 1945 to June 1997. This report highlights that a special investigation unit was established to investigate serious war crimes which arose out of revelations contained in a review of the material relating to the entry of suspected war criminals into Australia. That unit was established within the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department in 1987, with the stated objective being to collect probative evidence of the commission of war crimes, as defined by the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I raise this issue in the context of the recent revelations regarding Mr Konrad Kalejs, who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6777"> was extradited from Canada. He took out Australian citizenship in the 1950s. It was alleged that this particular individual had undertaken activities in relation to a paramilitary death squad which was responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Jewish people in the Baltic States during the Second World War.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure the Senate would remember that these issues caused considerable concern within the Australian community, particularly given the remarks of the Premier of Victoria, Mr Jeffrey Kennett, who indicated that in his view there was no way that these actions should be further investigated and that prosecutions should not be launched against this citizen. These are very serious matters which go to some fundamental issues about Australia's attitudes towards human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that in these particular cases the issues are particularly difficult. I also acknowledge that the United States government felt it necessary to reject Mr Kalejs's application for permanent residency and that he was sent back to Australia because of the allegations concerning his activities in the Second World War. I also acknowledge that these are issues that the Canadian government has thought were sufficiently serious to warrant the deportation of this person back to Australia, especially given that these matters do go to such basic issues of human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It concerns me that the Premier of Victoria feels it necessary to dismiss these questions in such a flippant and cavalier manner. While we have to acknowledge that the reasons taken by the Canadian government in relation to its deportation orders were based upon different legal standards&mdash;that is, the balance of probability&mdash;what is also apparent is that, to prosecute these matters, questions arise in terms of reasonable doubt. The Australian government ought be undertaking thorough investigations of the Canadians to ensure that there is no basis for prosecution.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently I had occasion to peruse the booklet of the National Indigenous Working Group on Native Title entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Native title and  reconciliation: an international brief</EMPHASIS> . This booklet was being provided to members of parliament in European communities. The booklet accompanied a delegation of the National Indigenous Working Group on Native Title to Europe. The native title working group has also briefed foreign diplomatic missions in Australia as, for example, they did on 21 May.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All this in itself is not remarkable. Indeed, on the face of it, these activities ought be welcomed to assist the people of the world to understand our approach to issues of native title and indigenous welfare. It is a tribute to our democracy that this delegation is able to brief the international community and produce booklets such as this at taxpayers' expense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So while there existed the potential for good to come out of all this, I am saddened to report that the opportunity for education was unfortunately discarded for the opportunity of propaganda. Right at the front of the booklet under the `contents' section appears this quote from the Chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, Pat Dodson:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(Aboriginal people) were poisoned&mdash;waterholes, soakages, where people sustained their life&mdash;they were places that were poisoned, and that is the imagery that Aborigines have in terms of the Wik 10 Points, that this is a final poisoning of the last waterhole.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those activities did occur, and they are condemned and regretted. Such actions are unforgivable; they should never have been contemplated, let alone undertaken. But I ask: for what purpose are we told these things, and why is this imagery used? It seems to me to be as helpful and intellectually sound as recent references by the One Nation Party to cannibalism by Aborigines. Neither view is promoted by those genuinely committed to achieving reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evoking of these types of images pours fuel on the fire; it does nothing for reconciliation, which we are led to believe is Mr Pat Dodson's purpose in life. Rather than gaining 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6778"> sympathy or support, this type of language will inflame and alienate. And those, like me, who spend literally days searching for genuine solutions, are left feeling deflated and frustrated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My experience is that Australia has such an excellent reputation overseas that the vast majority of the international community dismiss this type of offensive imagery. The imagery also alienates many non&hyphen;indigenous Australians because of its extremism. There are many aspects of the booklet which I could focus on, but time permits only a few exposes.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This booklet purports to discuss native title and reconciliation. In discussing native title and its development, there is only one mention of the land fund. This occurs on page 7, where we are told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government promised to establish a Land Fund and to implement a series of social justice measures (the Social Justice Package) to address the impact of dispossession, disempowerment and disadvantage of indigenous peoples. National consultations were conducted and reported, but the Social Justice package has not yet been implemented. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Our overseas friends reading such a commentary were led to believe that the land fund has not yet been established&mdash;and, on the basis of that quote, you cannot blame them. In fact, that is the only time that the land fund is referred to in the document. In fact, the land fund has been established and instalment payments have been made on time and in full.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fund is bankrolled by the Australian taxpayer at a contribution of $1.289 billion. That is approximately 70c per Australian man, woman and child, or $164 for each taxpayer and $3,650 for each Aborigine. The fund will give the Aboriginal community in this country $45 million per annum to buy property until eternity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make no mention of the land fund and the size of it is at best an unprofessional oversight and at worst an attempt to deliberately mislead by way of omission. To fail to mention the $1.289 billion land fund in any discussion on native title, pastoral leases and extinguishment is to fail to understand the issues. Pastoral leases were deemed to extinguish native title before the High Court decision on Wik. Therefore, part of the indigenous land fund compensation for dispossession was for dispossession due to pastoral leases. Yet no&hyphen;one has suggested that we claw back any of the indigenous land fund although, logically, such an argument could be sustained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The payment of the land fund in the context of 18 million Australians is a substantial contribution in monetary terms. But behind the monetary contribution and, indeed, more important than the money, was the act of the Australian people in extending their hands of goodwill. To ignore this significant goodwill gesture, and to fail to mention the size of it, is to mislead the international community. It is on the basis of this misinformation that some elements may be making judgments about Australia in the run&hyphen;up to the Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having been provided with a booklet, a number of European parliamentarians asked me about native title issues. They were horrified and disappointed at the failure of the National Indigenous Working Group to make full disclosure of the land fund and the huge 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6779"> sum involved. The National Indigenous Working Group has done untold damage to themselves and our indigenous community by their misrepresentations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even worse than this omission is the gross and unforgivable misrepresentation of the 10&hyphen;point plan. On page 13 of the booklet we are quite blandly told about the government's proposal to upgrade pastoral leases to freehold. This is simply untrue and that assertion besmirches Australia's image overseas. When one is confronted with such gross and deliberate distortion, one is less likely to give the National Indigenous Working Group the benefit of the doubt as to the omission of the land fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I plead with the National Indigenous Working Group and our indigenous brothers and sisters not to engage in such activities as I have outlined. I am desperately concerned that these activities not only belittle the indigenous community overseas when the truth comes to light but, more importantly, they evaporate the substantial reservoir of goodwill that non&hyphen;indigenous Australians hold towards their indigenous brothers and sisters. If you overplead your cause, you lose credibility and are treated with cynicism and scepticism; your sincerity is questioned and, ultimately, you will be seen as opportunistic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By all means, the National Indigenous Working Group ought to be forceful in their representations but, ultimately, truth will out and all the passion, representations and effort will be for naught if the representations are based on falsehoods or gross omissions. You see, human nature is to reject the gilding of the lily, because the gilding of the lily is usually a practice engaged in when one thinks the truth is not enough. So, to my indigenous friends, let me plead: keep it straight and you will regain the goodwill of the Australian people.</PARA>

It has been exposed today that Minister Sharp claimed since the election 144 days travel allowance and that he has repaid some 47 of those 144 days&mdash;and, in fact, now claims only 97.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to talk very briefly about the pattern of travel allowance claimed by Minister Sharp. I just want to put the lie to the spin doctoring that is going on feverishly at the moment from the government's spin doctors in the gallery. They are saying, `Oh, this is just the odd Thursday night after a week sitting in Canberra.' Let us be absolutely clear. There are a number of occasions when we are talking about several days on end. It is not just Canberra that we are talking about either. At least eight days were claimed at the higher rate in Sydney. He was not in Canberra; he was in Sydney. It is travel allowance at that higher rate that Mr Sharp has paid back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is going to be explored most forensically, I can assure you, by the opposition in the days and weeks ahead. But I do want to say this: it absolutely beggars belief that these are inadvertent mistakes. That claim completely lacks credibility. I will leave Mr Sharp to another day, starting tomorrow. Tonight I want to talk about the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Jull, because Mr Jull has been involved in the most blatant and underhand cover-up of Mr Sharp's travel claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Sharp has been exposed not by his own actions at all; he has been exposed by the media. In fact, he has been exposed by Laurie Oakes, a journalist for Channel 9 and the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6780"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. The truth of the matter is that Mr Jull, the Minister for Administrative Services, said to the House of Representatives on 5 March when asked a question about parliamentarians' entitlements:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me just say that we are going to clean it up and we are not going to give any comfort to those who are found to have undertaken any impropriety in the use of their entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what Mr Jull said in the House of Representatives on 5 March. What has he done? He has allowed a cabinet minister, a colleague, a mate, to doctor his travel details. That is what Mr Jull has done. He has allowed a cabinet minister, a colleague, a mate, to doctor his travel details before they were tabled in the House of Representatives. Mr Jull has accepted a cheque from Mr Sharp&mdash;a cheque for no small amount, a cheque for $8,740&mdash;no questions asked. In fact, we are told that Mr Jull, the responsible minister, did not seek any explanation from his cabinet colleague.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This compares to the situation in relation to the tabling of travel allowance claims from former Labor ministers in circumstances where Labor ministers were morally but not legally obligated to repay some moneys to DAS&mdash;and I say very clearly in a very different league to Mr Sharp, a completely different league to Mr Sharp. But what happened when that occurred? The fact that they repaid those small moneys was highlighted in the documents that were tabled in the parliament. The fact that they were required to repay money was drawn attention to. It was a different standard because a number of then Liberal and National Party shadow ministers were in a similar situation. Of course that was not highlighted by Mr Jull. It was a different rule for former Liberal and National Party shadow ministers than it was for former Labor ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is the same minister involved in this cover-up who on 15 June assured the parliament, and more importantly assured the Australian people, that he would do the right thing under a new system for parliamentarians' entitlements. Let me quote what he said. Let me draw attention to this extraordinary 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> press release of 15 June, given the expose that has occurred today. The press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Administrative Services, David Jull, today announced proposals for a more transparent and streamlined system for the administration of Parliamentarians' entitlements, including full disclosure of politicians' travel expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Oh, really! It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Jull also announced the introduction of six&hyphen;monthly tabling in Parliament of expenditure details for all Senators and Members, including Ministers, on the costs of air and car transport and related travelling allowance payments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Oh, really! Then Mr Jull went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would enable expenditure against entitlements to be fully reconciled and available for public scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister said the Government's changes would restore confidence in the entitlements system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What has been exposed today is that Mr Jull deliberately covered up the fact that a ministerial colleague of his&mdash;a senior cabinet colleague of his&mdash;repaid a very substantial amount of money to the Department of Administrative Services, no questions asked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is, as I have said, a blatant cover&hyphen;up from Mr Jull. It will not only be Mr Sharp who has a lot of explaining to do about this issue. It will not only be Mr Sharp who has to explain why he repaid apparently wrongly claimed travel allowance of some 47 days. It will not only be Mr Sharp, because Mr Jull has a lot of explaining to do about the administration of his own portfolio. If it is shown that Mr Jull deliberately covered this up, then Mr Jull will have no alternative but to resign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a serious offence from not only Mr Sharp but also Mr Jull, who has shown a complete abrogation of commitments he made in the parliament and commitments he made to the Australian people about accountability of parliamentarians' entitlements. Mr Jull has an awful lot of explaining to do.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . It has been argued that telecommunications carriers and perhaps even internet service providers could potentially become liable as a result of internet users' down loading works which are protected by copyright . . . the Parliament may need to consider these questions&mdash;and others arising&mdash;and to formulate a legislative response to them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">They cannot be solved</EMPHASIS> , but have not been overlooked, by me.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Digital technology has evolved into something significantly different from what these laws were designed to protect. We have seen the struggle of the Australian courts and of international bodies which have tried to fit computer programs under the existing copyright 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> regimes. In each instance, the courts or tribunals have sought to protect the ideas behind the programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the problem of which laws we should apply to a technology which crosses the traditional institutional boundaries. For example, an Australian user connected computer connected to the Internet can listen to an Internet radio station that is in America. The Copyright Act has a technology specific broadcasting right covering over the air wireless broadcasts while there are no copyright rights over sound recordings or broadcasts that occur over cables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Internet user relies on a telephone line provided by a telecommunications carrier to connect them to the Internet. The server they use may be in Australia and the content could be by an Australian artist. Which laws should cover this and how should we change our laws to best reflect our community interests and the interests of those with particular ideas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Intellectual property in the digital forum is concerned with rights that attach to particular subject matter which, of course, is intangible. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognises this as a right to protection of a person's mental labours. Our current laws cover these rights in terms of property&mdash;an institution that is given the sanction of positive laws for a social purpose. The traditional concepts of poverty are a far cry from our current needs and are arguably the source of many of our present difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Intellectual property is a distinct class of incorporeal property, which is significantly different from the rights recognised in corporeal objects. It is not possible to possess or occupy an item of intellectual property in the same way one may possess or occupy a piece of land, a cow or whatever particular object you might refer to. Further, the concept of property fails to recognise that there is nothing inherently scarce or sacred in the subject matter. A copy of a particular subject matter does not affect the further copying, and one person's inventive idea does not limit the amount of an idea available to others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should recognise the rights which attach to the intangible products of intellectual 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6782"> labour. This is particularly important in the digital forum so that our thinking and the way we deal with this new technology are not constrained by the institutions of the past. We need to develop new laws and new ways of recognising intellectual effort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ideas, of course, are the basis for our ongoing technological advances, and they need to be recognised by our community. So I look forward to the government legislating in this area. Perhaps the new minister for the information economy might like to put forward some ideas.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Might I suggest to the minister that some of the areas he could consider include not only how we use the information economy and information technology as a wealth creator or a generator of jobs but also an examination of some of the key issues related to the IT sector&mdash;that he look not only at how we resource that sector and resource the department, because clearly he was not particularly sure as to how he was going to resource his own needs in this particular area, but also at encryption, electronic commerce, defamation, intellectual property rights, privacy and, I guess, just general community concerns in relation to unfair practices of, say, large businesses when it comes to the IT sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, no doubt colleagues on this side would suggest that outsourcing of the IT field should be among those areas that the new minister should consider. But I hope that he will pay attention not only to intellectual property rights and the difficulties in the electronic age but also, in particular, to the issue of privacy and the extension of the privacy laws to the private sector so that information technology is also protected.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="6782"><TITLE>Minister for Transport and Regional Development: Travel Allowance

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The jury is certainly out on Mr Sharp 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> as to whether he should stay a minister or not. We are witnessing at the moment something which I always find fascinating&mdash;that is, a matter is leached from a department, a minister is embarrassed, then the minister starts running the lines out to journalists and others in defence. It is our job to forensically look at those lines of defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first line run tonight, which I was a bit confused about, was the 100&hyphen;kilometre rule. What that has to do with overnight claims in Canberra, I do not know. The second line run out was, `I took them out of my diary and I made mistakes.' Give him credit: he is not blaming his staff. He does all his travel allowance forms himself and he happened to take 47 mistakes out of 144 nights claimed!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, if you want to check the credibility of this, Mr Jull and Mr Sharp are in a position to do so. They should table his original travel allowance claims and his amended ones, and we should see the date on which he signed off the false claims to see whether it was only a week ago, two weeks ago or six months ago. I might have some understanding if Mr Sharp did not claim any travel allowance for six months, went through his diary and made some mistakes, albeit 47 mistakes in two cities. But, if in fact he put them in month by month and cannot, as a minister, remember where he was in the previous month and has such an incompetent diary or incompetent staff, doubts remain about Mr Sharp and these travel allowance claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original story that sort of floated out was that this was the odd Thursday night, yet in March 1996 we see he claimed four nights in a row in Canberra. That was four in a row when he was not here, according to his own admissions now. The next week he claims two, has a night off and claims another two, yet these are apparently inadvertent errors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How can you claim eight nights in Sydney at $320 a night when you were not there but thought you were there? It is all very well to radio the air traffic controllers and demand priority entry into Sydney&mdash;so we know he does go there&mdash;but how could he claim eight nights scattered over this period, including two in a row, and not remember? You see, when he comes to defend himself, inadver 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="6783"> tence is going to be difficult. But, if the government comes clean at last and tables both forms, we can at least measure whether there is some credibility to his argument about inadvertence, poor memory, poor diary or poor work there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner hit it right on the head tonight when he said that the first person in the gun is Mr Jull. This is the same Mr Jull who was happy to release Labor ministers' travel allowance on three occasions. First of all, we were criticised for not putting out the 1994-95 figures. So the moment Mr Jull came to office he published them. He then did not wait until the normal August period for the 1995&hyphen;96 figures; he put them out in June and drew attention to them. Finally, when he published all the annual ones, having delayed his own first three months for nine months&mdash;a lot longer than we ever have&mdash;he republished them for the third time in case anyone missed them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you something else he did two weeks ago. When he published ministerial and office holder travel allowance and other expenses in the House of Representatives, he had his office draw up a one-page anonymous document and sent it round the gallery trying to highlight what he saw was any embarrassment to the opposition. He did that. He started the war. So never look across to us and say that we are starting the war on this. He did it, but he did it anonymously through his office two weeks ago&mdash;Thursday, the last day of sitting here. He did that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember Senator Herron saying, `What did your blokes do?' This has to be understood: the repayments that were made by Labor ministers were for claims made after the election policy speech, and they only had a moral, not a legal, obligation to refund it. Senator Minchin claimed 11. Did we ever mention it in this chamber? Never. Senator Macdonald claimed some and repaid. We did not raise it as an issue. Someone on our side claimed. You could argue that it was official duty, you could argue it was campaign duty. So they repaid. They thought, `Let us have the cleanest system possible. There is some doubt in this. We will repay.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does Mr Jull do when it comes to publishing the figures? Here are the figures. He puts an inverted `v' next to each of the claims of the Labor ministers saying the following: `Amount which the former member or minister has indicated was legitimately claimed, but for which he was repaid or intends to repay.' Again: `Amounts which the member has indicated were legitimately claimed but the member intends to pay.' He drew attention to it for Labor members. Their equivalents, the shadow ministers, who were paid out of the House of Representatives and had paid back money&mdash;not one iota of attention was drawn to them in the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having set the standard two weeks ago, which he may say is only appropriate for ministers and office holders, when he published in the House of Representatives all the office holders' money, did he put a little asterisk next to the biggest refunder of all, bigger than Senator Colston? Does he do that? He puts in the amended figure of $20,000 and does not put in a note that the minister has repaid a certain amount of money&mdash;not even an amount. Why not? He was trying to cover up. He did not want attention drawn to this. That is why he did it, and it is shameful behaviour by a minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Administrative Services does have a slightly higher ethical responsibility to parliament because he is given a whole range of confidential material to do with all of us, and therefore he should try to be a little more impartial than he has been. But constantly what we have had out of the minister's office are these sorts of smarmy attempts to smear the opposition while covering up for any inadvertence in government ranks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said at the start, there is some doubt&mdash;you might listen to this, Senator Harradine&mdash;about Mr Sharp. It is the accountability that is important here, in an adversarial sense; that we can make them accountable where it is much harder in the Senate. But that is an argument and a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6784"> discussion we can have another time, which you concede.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But if there is some doubt about Mr Sharp's future, there are a lot more doubts about Mr Jull. This is unethical behaviour: to highlight other ministers of another government who have repaid money and not to highlight yourself. This has been an absolutely consistent pattern of behaviour. What we would like Mr Jull to do in five minutes time, when he goes into the other place and makes his statement, is table both sets of forms so we can make a judgment, so we can see when Mr Sharp signed these off&mdash;whether it was six or eight months later, when memory may have dimmed, when mistakes were possible. But I tell you what: if you claimed, as here, some nights in Sydney right towards the end of the month and signed the form off four days later, you can remember whether you were in Sydney or not. All the evasions that we are getting now: the confusion about the 100 kilometres; the confusion about whether he was in Goulburn on a Thursday night or whether in Canberra&mdash;all these disseminating little bits put out in the gallery, all these misleaders, can be forensically examined and he can be brought to account for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As John Faulkner has said, the real case here is why Mr Jull did not draw this to our attention two weeks ago when he published this figures, when he did for others, and why it took a leak from the Department of Administrative Services and a journalist to expose this. He might explain the nature of the conversation he had with Mr Howard yesterday when he was called in to discuss these particular matters in Mr Howard's office. He may like to explain why he made no statement earlier in the day, until he found out that this was going to be on the Channel Nine news tonight and in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> tomorrow, why he did not come clean and explain these particular things. Until he does, I have to say Mr Sharp's future is doubtful, but Mr Jull's future is extremely gloomy.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="7.57 p.m." PAGE="6784"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 7.57 p.m.</EMPHASIS>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (the Act) (s16) do not permit the disclosure or communication of information in respect of the affairs of another person.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) does not provide general rulings in respect of specific arrangements and therefore it is not possible to say generally whether or not the `growers' are entitled to a deduction for the costs

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (b) The ATO is soon to issue a draft Taxation Ruling in respect of afforestation schemes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the `grower' should be in the business of growing and harvesting for sale forest trees or timber.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">CSLC distributed a H&hyphen;B&hyphen;Vax, hepatitis B vaccine manufactured by Merck Sharp and Dohme (Australia) Pty Ltd, which was based on hepatitis B surface antigen, a non infectious viral protein harvested from plasma in which it was present and subjected to a 3 stage inactivation process.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Protection against infection with hepatitis B virus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) The conditions of approval of H&hyphen;B&hyphen;Vax in Australia included a requirement that the sponsor company forward to the Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee (ADRAC) details of all 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian reports of suspected adverse reactions to the vaccine. This was, and remains, a standard condition applied to the registration of new medicines and vaccines. There was no additional requirement for special post&hyphen;marketing or follow&hyphen;up monitoring in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to this requirement, health professionals were, as at present, encouraged to report any suspected adverse reactions to drugs and vaccines to ADRAC. In contrast to the obligation on the manufacturer, reporting by health professionals is not compulsory. ADRAC then reviews all reports from sponsor companies and health professionals and may recommend that the sponsor take appropriate action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) In respect of the hepatitis B vaccine, there were 65 suspected adverse reactions in Australia reported to and considered by ADRAC during the period 1983 to 1988. About half the reports specified H&hyphen;B&hyphen;Vax as the suspected product. The other half described suspected reactions to "hepatitis B vaccine". It is highly likely that all the reports submitted prior to late 1987 related to the plasma derived Merck product as it was the only vaccine registered for use in Australia. It is possible that some of the reports submitted during late 1987 and 1988 related to use of a non&hyphen;plasma derived, recombinant vaccine, which became available at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reported local and systemic adverse reactions were consistent with the description in the H&hyphen;B&hyphen;Vax product information which was based principally on the clinical trial experience available when H&hyphen;B&hyphen;Vax was recommended for approval by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee in 1982, but which was also updated by the sponsor in the light of international experience.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I am not aware of Murdoch University's proposal to lease part of its campus. My Department has also informed me that the University's Education Profile for the 1997&hyphen;2000 period does not refer to this proposal.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (b) The Commonwealth has no concerns regarding the commercial developments undertaken by universities providing that they are consistent with the National Competition Principles. The principles require the elimination of any net competitive advantages or disadvantages that publicly owned or funded organisations enjoy simply as a result of their public sector ownership or support. Significant progress has been made in developing a framework to implement these principles. Specifically, the Ministerial Council for Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs (of which I am a member) recently endorsed a coordinated policy position for the implementation of competition policy in the higher education sector. One of the principles agreed by the Council is that:</PARA>

<ANSWER PAGE="6798" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Brown's question raises issues which fall within the portfolio responsibilities of both the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and myself. As such, I have consulted with my colleague, The Hon John Moore MP, about this matter and the following reply represents the Government's response. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I am aware that a spacecraft named Cassini is due to be launched no earlier than 6 October 1997 by the National Aeronautics Space Agency (NASA) from Cape Canaveral, Florida, for a Saturn-bound mission. Because the Cassini spacecraft will be operating at a distance from the sun that makes the use of solar power systems not feasible, Cassini's electrical power source will be provided by Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs). RTGs provide power through the natural radioactive decay of plutonium (mostly Pu-238, a non-weapons grade isotope). RTGs are not nuclear reactors, have no moving parts, and use neither fission nor fusion processes to produce energy. Cassini will employ three RTGs, each of which will carry 10.8 kg (23.8 lb) of plutonium dioxide fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Launch reliability should be considered with respect to the launch vehicle being used for Cassini, in this case the Titan IV launch vehicle. As of February 1997, there have been 20 Titan IV launches, of which 19 have been successful. The single failure, in August 1993, was due to a flaw in one of the solid rocket motors which was caused by an inadequate repair procedure following manufacture. This problem has been fixed. I am advised that since RTG's were redesigned in 1965, to prevent the release of radioactive material, there have been two accidents during NASA missions where RTG's were on board. These were the 1968 NIMBUS-B satellite launch and the 1970 Apollo 13 lunar module re-entry. In both cases the plutonium fuel was fully contained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Plutonium is a hazardous material and if a small particle is inhaled, there is a chance that a cancer may result from long term radiation exposure. However, the risk to human health as a result of the Cassini launch is extremely low because of the design of the fuel and the RTG's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following should be noted with respect to the plutonium fuel aboard Cassini: The fuel is divided among 18 small independent modular units, each with its own heat shield and impact shell to reduce the chances of fuel release in an accident. In addition, multiple layers of protective materials are used to protect the fuel and prevent its accidental dispersion. The fuel itself is in a heat-resistant, ceramic form, which reduces its chance of vaporising in an accidental fire or in re-entry environments. The fuel is also highly insoluble, has a low chemical reactivity, and primarily fractures into large, non-respirable particles and chunks. This would mitigate the potential health effects in the unlikely event of an accident involving the release of this fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An extensive independent safety evaluation of the Cassini mission was performed as part of the nuclear launch safety approval process by an Inter-agency Nuclear Safety Review Panel, which is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6799"> supported by experts from the US Government, industry and academia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) (a) I am advised that the following environmental impact assessments have been produced in the USA: Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Cassini Mission (June 1995), Nuclear Safety Analyses for Cassini Mission Environmental Impact Statement Process (April 1997), and Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for the Cassini Mission (June 1997). The Department of Industry, Science and Tourism holds a copy of the Cassini environmental impact statement (EIS). Neither I nor my Department have had reason to examine the EIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Odds calculated by NASA are contained in the aforementioned reports. NASA's analysis estimates that the probability of an early launch accident is 1 in 160, the probability of a late launch accident is 1 in 48, the probability of an inadvertent earth re-entry is less than one in 1 million, and the probability for an accident releasing plutonium dioxide into the atmosphere is 1 in 19,200 for pre-launch phase, 1 in 1,490 for early launch, 1 in 476 for late launch, 1 in 1,250,000 for short term inadvertent re-entry, and 1 in 5,000,000 for long-term inadvertent re-entry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) A Cassini spacecraft equipped with the highest efficiency solar cells available, or even the new high-efficiency cells under development by ESA, would make Cassini too massive for launching to Saturn. I am advised that the ESA scientists who developed the high-efficiency cells have stated that their cells would not enable a solar powered Cassini mission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) In view of the circumstances outlined above the Government does not consider it appropriate to request the United States of America and NASA to postpone despatching plutonium-bearing spacecraft pending the application of safe solar cells.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) I do not consider an injunction to the World Court of Justice in the Hague on behalf of the Australian Government in order to delay the launch of Cassini is necessary or appropriate.</PARA>
