<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Hill representing the Prime Minister. Minister, can you explain on what basis Mr Max Moore-Wilton accepted Philomena Bisshop's resignation? Isn't it the case that she took the initiative in inquiring of DAS whether there had been any cover&hyphen;up of repayments of travel allowance by government ministers? Isn't it also the case that when she recalled on 26 September the conference that she had with Carolyn Hughes of DAS in early July, she drew the conversation to the attention of her superior officers without any mention being made of resignation at that stage? Why is it that two days later, on 28 September, her failure to pass her conversation with DAS up the line was dealt with as a hanging offence? Do you agree that this is an appropriate sanction for a public servant in her position?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I remember the matter, she chose to resign for what she said was basically a failure to meet the responsibilities of her office. As I recall, what she said was that she acknowledged that she, at the relevant time&mdash;which was when she believed that she had the earlier discussion&mdash;should have brought the substance of these discussions to the attention of her superiors. As I further recall, she very much regretted that she failed to do so, but certainly acknowledged that that was a failure of her responsibilities within her office. That is basically where the matter rests.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Surely not quite, Minister. Because doesn't the much more serious offence lie in fact with the Department of Administrative Services? Isn't it clear from the documentation that was tabled yesterday by the Prime Minister that DAS knew of the cover&hyphen;up of the repayment of travel allowance by a government minister, knew that this has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been decided by Mr Jull, knew that it has been discussed with the Prime Minister's office and acquiesced in it?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think there are any implications that follow from the decision that was made by Philomena Bisshop. That was her decision and her interaction was with the superiors within her department. The extent of DAS's knowledge of these matters is an interesting but different question. Certainly, it would seem that at least some officers in DAS were aware of the way in which it had been decided to deal with the correction to Mr Sharp's statement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is to Senator Alston, the Minister representing the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, given the small business sector's call for reform across many fronts, will the government distinguish itself from the previous Labor administration and take further action to improve the outlook for Australian small business?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="7181" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 May this year the House of  Representatives handed down 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7182"> a fair trading committee report and a matter of months later the government is now in a position to respond to that report, as Mr Reith will be doing in the House of Representatives later today. That stands in stark contrast to the approach adopted by Labor to small business over very many years. In fact, over a period of 11 years they tabled 17 different reports. If you look at all of those reports&mdash;talk about a recipe for inaction&mdash;there was a particular contribution by the minister for making businesses smaller, Senator Schacht, who commissioned a couple of working party reports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About all they managed to do over that whole period was boost one small business, and that was the printing industry. But apart from that, they were not serious at all. In fact, in the run&hyphen;up to the last election they finally proposed into the House of Representatives a better business conduct bill, but of course that lapsed because of the proroguing of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is perfectly clear that Labor had absolutely no interest in the whole issue of small business and that is why it stands in such stark contrast to the actions that Mr Reith will be announcing later today. The government will be outlawing unconscionable conduct against small business, strengthening the protection for retail tenants and giving full effect to industry codes of practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where does the Labor Party stand on all these issues? The fact is that Mr Beazley is out there having the cheek to claim credit for what the government is now doing in this area. This is the gentleman who managed to distinguish himself recently by saying on commercial radio that he is no genius. We know what that means&mdash;that is code for, `I'm not terribly bright.' If you think the people of Australia are looking for someone who is running around as a chronic underachiever, not prepared to disguise his quite well justified modesty on the issue, then quite clearly you are in very big trouble. Mr Beazley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I've got to be honest about these things. Sometimes people arrive on the political scene, men of true genius. I'm not. I'm probably the most experienced Labor leader there has been, through no fault of my own.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, he does not have merit or experience going for him. He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I've tried to be constructive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would like to know what he means by that. They certainly have not been constructive in the area of small business. They certainly have not been constructive in the area of workplace reform. They certainly were not constructive in the area of allowing people to buy shares in Telstra. They have ditched enterprise bargaining. They have gone back to the future. They are now utterly beholden to the trade union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scandalous attack we saw mounted on ACOSS recently no doubt came straight from the Robert Ray charm school, with Senator Conroy thinking the only way back into the political game was to get out there and belt up on defenceless policy analysts. Once again, that will be exposed for what it is&mdash;crass political intimidation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their litany of failure to lead&mdash;in fact, leading from behind&mdash;is distinguished even more, not just by their backflips on work for the dole or Hindmarsh Island or, particularly, tariffs but also by their sneaky backflips over greenhouse gases and the immigration intake. In other words, it is perfectly clear from all that has been going on on the other side of politics and from all of these grandstanding performances by the young roosters that Senator Ray and his colleagues are perfectly happy to see Kim Beazley wallowing in the ratings. Senator Ray's latest preferred candidate, Simon Crean, would not want to have it any other way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is fine by us, but I think it ought to be well understood out there that you do not have any solutions to these problems. George Campbell actually got it right when he said a matter of months ago:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Resources and Energy. Yesterday the Sydney Futures Exchange opened an electricity futures market. In the light of the importance of developing a competitive national electricity market, what are the obstacles that stand in the way of New South Wales consumers benefiting from low electricity prices?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="7183" SPEAKER="Parer, Sen Warwick" NAMEID="KI4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Resources and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank Senator Heffernan for that question, which is particularly timely. The New South Wales 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cabinet this morning endorsed the privatisation of the state's electricity industry. Of course, there is going to be the mother of all brawls over electricity reform at the state Labor conference on Friday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Sydney Futures Exchange yesterday opened an electricity futures market, which is an important advance on the development of a competitive national market for electricity. The futures market will help electricity suppliers and distributors keep the price of electricity as low as possible because they will be able to control the risks they face and will have more information about the demand and the supply of power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of the development of the national electricity market, spot prices have fallen almost 35 per cent from $23 per megawatt hour to $15 per megawatt hour. The New South Wales government is continuing the electricity reform process with its plans to privatise the state's electricity assets. The privatisation of the New South Wales power industry will not only raise $25 billion but will also result in lower electricity prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is intense opposition from sections of the ALP to privatising the power industry in New South Wales. I want to know where the federal opposition stands on this issue. Where does Senator Faulkner stand on this issue? Where does Senator Forshaw stand on this issue? Where does Senator Neal stand on this issue? We know where Senator George Campbell stands on this issue. Not only was he content, according to the previous Prime Minister, with having the blood of 90,000 unemployed on his hands; he now wants to add more to the total.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is curious, isn't it? Mr Brereton and Mr McLeay, who represent the New South Wales Right, are sneaking around behind the back of Mr Beazley, who said this is entirely a New South Wales issue, opposing the sale on the grounds that it would be harder for them to campaign against the partial sale of Telstra at the next federal election. What absolute hypocrisy! What double standards! It was these people that sold off Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition of these members of the New South Wales Right is, of course, in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7184"> historic tradition of the way they operate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, you have asked your question and I am just giving you an answer on the basis of what you asked. I am trying to clarify for you my view. It is not that the CES could do this job better. The previous government did not believe that. It was the previous government that introduced competition in employment services, that brought in the private sector and that brought in community groups. We agree with that innovation of the previous government. It was one of the few good things in the Working Nation program and we intend to continue that competition between government, private and community sector organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7185">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important point is that unemployed Australians who are on benefits, who are eligible for this type of assistance, will be able to choose who they think will best help them. This is not Big Brother saying, `You must go to the CES.' This is a government saying, `You can choose the provider of your choice. If you want to go to a community provider, you do so. If they get you a job, we'll pay the bill. If you want to go to a private provider that has tendered and been successful, then you go there. And, if they get you a job, we'll pay the bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you don't mind, Senator, you have asked the question and I am making the odd assumption that you are interested in the answer. Unemployed Australians will walk into the premises of their choice knowing not that they are someone who is expecting to get something for nothing&mdash;a service provided by the government at the CES&mdash;but that they are a valued client and that, if the service is provided&mdash;that is, if the person gets a job&mdash;the business will get the money.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am coming to the rest of your question, but I wanted to answer that aspect fully. Senator, there must be a very long list of organisations that did not tender. Good luck to them; that is their choice. But let me explain something to you: the tender has not been prepared in order to allow private sector people to make huge amounts of money out the unemployed. If people are not tendering because they do not think it is commercial enough and that there is not enough profit in it for them, then that is their decision and I am not worried about that, because the tender was prepared with two things in mind: delivering better services to unemployed people and having contracts&mdash;unlike most of the contracts drawn up under 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> new work opportunities, the remnants of which we see in the existing programs where CES managers negotiated very substantial contracts that did not, in the end, deliver. This contract is a tight contract in the Commonwealth's favour; that is, taxpayers' money is protected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two quite clear purposes behind this tender: better services for unemployed Australians and protection of taxpayers' money. If someone says, `Well, I don't want that; there's not enough room in there for me to make a buck', I do not care because my job is not to help people make money. My job is to design a system that helps more people get jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the tender, over 1,000 organisations from across Australia have submitted tenders. They have been received from each of the 29 labour market regions, with an excellent response of some 5,000 bids across all service types, that is, flex, entry level training support services and the new enterprise incentive scheme. I think that number of bids across the 29 regions demonstrates the value of the very extensive consultations that were undertaken with the market from September 1996. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

I note that several nations have made efforts to manage their forests on a sustainable basis while others have not.</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does recognise the importance of ensuring that the world's forests are managed sustainably, both because of the environmental and economic consequences of doing otherwise. It is for that reason that Australia is involved in a range of international fora and activities designed to encourage the adoption of ecologically sustainable forest management in nations that have within their boundaries commercially utilised forest resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Principal among those fora is the newly created International Forum on Forests, which is the high level group recently established by the international community and which will actually be holding its first meeting next week in New York. The IFF brings together most forested nations, including Indonesia and Malaysia, and has responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the recommendations of its predecessor, the International Panel on Forests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Chief among those recommendations is the adoption of sustainable forest management through mechanisms such as the development of national forest programs, the sharing of knowledge between countries about forest management and the development of international criteria and indicators that will allow nations to establish measurable benchmarks. In relation to that point, I would also add that Australia has been one of the leading nations in encouraging the work of what is known as the Montreal process, which is seeking to establish criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management in countries containing temperate forests, such as our own.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7187">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is also pursuing the issue of sustainable forest management within tropical timber producing countries through the International Tropical Timber Organisation, which is seeking to ensure that the tropical forests in member nations are managed sustainably by the year 2000. More specifically, my department and that of Minister Anderson are jointly funding the development of an Asia&hyphen;Pacific code of practice for forest harvesting for our region. We are working with Indonesia, the lead nation for the code, and other regional neighbours to ensure its completion. At this stage we anticipate that it will be considered for adoption by the regional body of the FAO next February.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has also been involved in the international dialogue on the issue of certification and labelling. As Senator Margetts would know, a range of groups, such as the Worldwide Fund for Nature, have been advocating an international certification system that would allow consumers to discriminate between sustainably and unsustainably produced timber. We believe the debate about issues such as these is important. That is why we hosted a major international conference on certification and labelling in Brisbane last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is concerned about unsustainable forest practices, and we are taking measures to work cooperatively with our neighbours in other countries to ensure that those concerns are addressed. We believe that it is through cooperative action and the sharing of information that we can actually produce meaningful changes in the ways that other nations manage their forests.</PARA></ANSWER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Macdonald for the question. I understand that the report was tabled in parliament yesterday. It followed a national inquiry into the employment of young people that I was very keen to see proceed. The government very much appreciates the work of committees such as this one because they make a very valuable contribution to the debate on such vitally important areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will take some time to digest the recommendations made and to provide an appropriate response, but it will be done as soon as possible. We very much welcome the strong case that is made by the majority members of the committee for the retention of age based junior rates. Obviously the majority members of the committee are aware of how irresponsible it would be to abolish age based junior rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These rates are absolutely essential for letting young Australians gain a foothold in the labour market. They give them a cost advantage. Far from disadvantaging junior employees, they actually assist them to get jobs. The current junior award arrangements that have been in place for the last 70 years or so should be retained within the scope of the awards system for the parties to establish skills based wage arrangements where this will not damage youth employment. At the same time, it is important that I indicate very clearly that this government will not be replacing existing junior traineeship and apprenticeship wages with a national youth wage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is also committed to ensuring that young people are the winners with the government's new youth allowance. It is true: when you restructure, there are winners and losers. However, it is now less attractive to leave school early and not do any training. But young Australians will, in the end, be the winners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The incentives have finally been rejigged away from remaining unskilled and toward the benefits of a good education and training. The youth allowance will provide students with much better financial support. It will remove financial incentives that have in the past seen young people choose to receive 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7189"> unemployment benefits rather than undertake further education and training. In addition to those matters, the government is delivering on its promise to increase genuine job opportunities for young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new national apprenticeship system will provide trainees with world class skills, giving Australian businesses a competitive edge in the global economy. The federal government will provide a total of more than $1.3 billion for vocational education and training in 1997-98, which is an increase of $144 million or 12 per cent on funding provided in the last year of the Labor government. It includes $265 million for more than 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in this financial year. The new apprenticeships and traineeships will be in high growth industries, such as technology, finance, tourism, hospitality and sport as well as the traditional trades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1997-98, $415 million is being provided for the new national apprenticeship system. For the first time, there will be national recognition of skills and qualifications, thereby expanding job and career options. Employers will be able to choose who will deliver the off&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training of their apprentices and trainees. Hiring apprentices and trainees will be easier through one-stop shop arrangements. Students will now be able to earn while they learn by combining a paid new apprenticeship with their secondary education, and we will also be committing almost four times as much funding for VET in schools as the Labor Party provided over its last 13 years.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

I will table a letter from the Attorney-General to Alan Rose, who is the President of the Australian Law Reform Commission. There is no threat in that letter. In fact, I would refer Senator Bolkus to the transcript of an interview with Alan Rose on 2CN. He denied that he had been threatened. Any question of there having been any suppression or attempted suppression by the Attorney&hyphen;General is utterly false.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one looks at the advice that the opposition commissioned from Harry Evans, you see that it starts off on the premise that the Attorney-General has suppressed evidence. What the opposition failed to tell the Clerk of the Senate was that the Attorney-General had not suppressed evidence and had not even tried to do so. So they misled the clerk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Attorney-General was doing was pointing out to the ALRC its functions under the act. Under the act, it acts within references referred to it by the Attorney-General. In fact, in 1994 Daryl Melham, the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, recommended that that provision remain, that is, that the ALRC deal only with references referred to it by the Attorney-General.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And in particular by Senator Sherry, who really distinguished himself by claiming that we were wrecking confidence in super. Judging by the contributions pouring into super, you would have to argue that confidence in superannuation is at a record high.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On coming to office, a key priority of this government has been to resurrect Australia's national savings from the very parlous position that it reached under the former government. I am pleased to report, and it is well known, that huge advances have been made in the area of public savings. We have turned around the Labor deficit of $10.3 billion that was left to us and, by the end of our term, we will show a surplus. I think that is particularly good news.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also committed to boosting private savings. Certainly, on the basis of the latest growth figures for superannuation, it appears that the government's efforts to achieve a savings culture in this country are well on track. I draw the Senate's attention to the headlines in today's papers. One headline says `We're saving $500m a week'&mdash;very good news. Another one, which is not good news for Senator Sherry&mdash;and, of course, Senator Sherry was responsible for this&mdash;says `ALP confounded by super boost'. Having spent the last 18 months saying that confidence was being wrecked in super, Senator Sherry is now trying to claim credit. You are a total joke, Senator Sherry!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have noted in this chamber, the retirement assets of Australians have grown by a quarter since this government came into office. This is really fantastic news for Aus

The gloom and doom merchants of the ALP, as the headline said, have been utterly confounded by these figures. It shows the appalling advice that Senator Nick `don't tax the rich' Sherry gave to the Labor caucus on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Gibson intimated, the government is looking to the future to see how it can continue to promote a savings culture in this country.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very important question, not just for this parliament but also for all those parents who have gone through the anguish of divorce and the charged emotions in those circumstances. The government has been working very hard to address the remaining recommendations which the joint select committee made prior to our coming into government. You would recognise that there is a very great concern in the community at what are perceived to be inequities both in the way the system is administered and in the formula.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The details will be announced this afternoon. The reforms underscore the principle that children are the financial responsibility of both their parents and that the government should not seek to intrude unnecessarily into people's lives, but that government involvement will provide the safety net to ensure children of separated parents are adequately supported and that the general community is not asked to carry an undue burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The agreed package which we are announcing today includes: changes to the calculation of child support liabilities payments, recognising that after separation some payers do not have sufficient means to support themselves and their second families; additional assistance to many thousands of children by introducing a minimum payment of child support and by including a wider range of income when assessing child support liability; parents will be able to move from the Child Support Agency collection to private collection by agreement at any time, allowing the Child Support Agency to concentrate on those people who are unable to reach a private agreement; parents will be required to move into private collection where they have a consistent payment record, but the Child Support Agency will continue to provide a safety net if the new arrangements fail; support programs, including self&hyphen;help, education, mediation and help for payers, to encourage parents to make private collection 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> arrangements; and a range of important administrative reforms which will make the scheme more responsive to people's needs by, for example, so streamlining arrangements that the payments are made up to 20 days earlier, and including the right to object to any Child Support Agency decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of the 163 recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, 111 have now been addressed. The remaining 52 recommendations will be addressed shortly. Eleven recommendations were addressed in the legislation that this government passed in June 1997 and 53 were addressed by the previous government's interim response. Today's reforms, which in many cases will lead to significantly simplified and more reliable payment arrangements, are a very positive step in what is a difficult and highly emotional social area, as I have said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the first time, where parents can make sensible arrangements for their children's support, as is the case with the majority of Child Support Agency clients, the new private payment arrangements give them a chance to get on with their lives without unnecessary bureaucratic intervention. Many senators would realise that that has been a major contributor to the frustrations of parents. It may also herald a better deal for children, who deserve to have the continuing involvement of both parents in their lives. These are good, sound changes and they will be welcomed by all interested parties. The changes will provide real benefits to Child Support Agency clients by introducing much needed flexibility into the administration of the child support system and by improving its timeliness, accuracy and responsiveness.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the reasons given below, each of these actions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">actions that were raised with him&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would constitute improper interference with a witness, could be dealt with by a House of the Parliament as a contempt of Parliament, and could also constitute the criminal offence of improper interference with a witness under section 12 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on in the advice, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Past judgments of the courts leave no doubt that the actions that have been specified would, if proved, amount to contempt of court and an attempt to pervert the course of justice if undertaken in respect of witnesses or potential witnesses before courts. Equally, those actions could, if proved, be dealt with by a House as contempt of Parliament and could be successfully prosecuted as offences under the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary Privileges Act</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have here allegations of serious improper behaviour without precedent. The Attorney&hyphen;General sat on the Australian Law Reform Commission to suppress evidence from the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the midst of all the allegations, a number of facts are clear. This Attorney&hyphen;General did not like the advice of the Law Reform Commission. He rang and pressured Mr Rose. He got Mr Reaburn, the Acting Secretary to his department, to ring and pressure Mr Rose. As a consequence of those conversations, the commission withdrew its intention to give evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is just not good enough for the government to say that there was no formal direction, because you do not need a formal direction&mdash;pressure is sufficient. That is very clear from the advice of the Clerk of the Senate. In essence, the commissioner was given an offer he could not refuse and, if you do not believe it, listen to the following. In 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Margot Kingston's article this morning, Mr Rose says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was given a choice&mdash;hold back the submission and be able to discuss commission guidelines later, or go ahead with the submission and get a very strong letter from the Attorney&hyphen;General directing us only to work on formal references from him.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So we were really given no choice at all.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They were given absolutely no choice at all. Why was this? Not because they were embarking upon a course of action that the Attorney did not like. The Attorney has sat back on 49 times whilst he has been a minister and allowed this to happen. They were given no choice because the advice was unpalatable to the government. It was advice they did not want even though it was advice that they asked for. That is the nub of this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have here an exposure of the government's position as unworkable and uncertain. Mr Howard's pet project&mdash;the 10&hyphen;point plan response&mdash;is one that convincingly, page after page after page, in the Law Reform Commission's draft submission is exposed as uncertain, unworkable, discriminatory and of massive cost to Australian taxpayers. It was advice that the government did not want, and it was advice that the government sought to suppress, though, as I say, while they may have suppressed it, they did not extinguish it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this particular case, the Attorney has not just got the politics wrong&mdash;he has also got the law wrong. As a consequence, though he tries very hard to dissemble the truth as he did this morning on the ABC and as he did when he tried to argue that the Clerk's advice was a load of nonsense, the undeniable fact is that we are dealing here with a case of pressure&mdash;pressure which needs to be treated seriously by this parliament and which, unless this parliament does treat it seriously, will continue to linger on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, these are the sorts of allegations that can be pursued by anyone outside of this place under section 12 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. The pressure is now on the government either to accede to moves that will be made in this place over the next day

<PARA STYLE="Para">There is no threat in that; there is no cover&hyphen;up in that letter. In fact, the Attorney&hyphen;General tabled it in the other place yesterday and I have tabled it today. The Attorney&hyphen;General has been totally transparent in the communications he has had with the ALRC. Where is the cover&hyphen;up in that? It totally dispenses with the allegation of any cover&hyphen;up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next thing the opposition trot out is that they are relying on advice from Mr Harry Evans, Clerk of the Senate. I do not take issue with the advice, of course, but what I do take issue with is the briefing given to the Clerk of the Senate. In the letter that Harry Evans wrote to Senator Faulkner, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have asked for advice on the implications of a situation in which an office holder of the executive government directs a person who is not a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> public servant and who has been invited to appear before a parliamentary committee not to appear before the committee, to suppress evidence which may be relevant to the committee's inquiry and to destroy sucH evidence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So what they were briefing Harry Evans to do was to give an opinion on someone who was already guilty of such conduct. It is like going to a QC and saying, `Look, if someone commits murder, are they guilty of an offence?' That is precisely the farcical situation in this advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Clerk of the Senate responded to that and gave his advice. But he did it on the premise that there had already been a direction not to appear before the committee, he did it  on the basis that there was a suppression of evidence and he did it on the basis that there was an order to destroy such evidence. On those instructions, of course the Clerk of the Senate would give that advice.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Clerk of the Senate, I should say. What we have here is a situation where the opposition embellished on the facts. They put to the clerk a situation which they regarded as a fait accompli. So, when they say they have advice, the opposition have to clarify precisely the terms of the brief upon which that advice was obtained. When you look at that letter, you can see that it is quite plain that there was no such attempt to interfere with Mr Alan Rose and the evidence he was thinking of giving.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other side of the coin is that Mr Rose has been interviewed by the press and he said that there was no threat. So you have corroboration from Mr Rose, President of the ALRC, who says he was not threatened. So where is the threat here? Again, that dispenses with the allegation by the opposition that there has been any attempt by the Attorney&hyphen;General to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7199"> interfere with evidence which was going to be given by the ALRC or was contemplated being given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, there is a statutory aspect to this. The Australian Law Reform Commission is a body which is set up by statute, the Australian Law Reform Commission Act 1996, which deals with the powers of that body. That body can only do those things which are within the act, and that is the point the Attorney&hyphen;General was making. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to speak on the answer given to Senator Bolkus's question. I think that Senator Ellison's contribution today has in fact helped to establish the case. He relied on the letter the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) presented in his defence, but I think that answers the central question involved in that issue, and that is why and when did the Attorney&hyphen;General decide to act on the question of the Australian Law Reform Commission's involvement in these issues. The answer to that is that he decided to act when he read their advice to the Wik task force, when he decided that their advice was politically incorrect and did not fit with the government's own political objectives and that their criticisms would expose and blow away the government's whole rationale for its supposed 10&hyphen;point plan, which now consists of more than 290 pages of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General chose to act because he did not like what he read. It has got nothing to do with the process arguments that Senator Ellison so conveniently wraps himself in because that is his only line of defence: to argue about process and to divert from the real issue. The real issue is that the government did not like the advice. They did not like the politics of the advice, and they did the same thing they do with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and any other form of independent advice they get that they do not like&mdash;they attack that source of advice, they try and close down that advice, try and restrict the advice, because they do not want competing points of view. They do not want people saying, `Hang on. We have a different view of the world. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We have a different bit of legal advice as to how you should be responding to problems in society.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third thing they do after that is to attack the individuals involved. What we have seen since is an attempt by Mr Williams and by Mr Entsch, the chair of the native title committee, to play the man, to attack those involved. They want to denigrate them because they do not like the advice. The key issue is why and when Mr Williams responded, and he responded, as was made clear by Mr Rose today in an interview with Ross Solly, because he did not like the advice. I quote Mr Rose because people have been saying, `Oh, he was not really threatened.' He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last Tuesday I had a conversation with the Acting Secretary to the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, Norman Reaburn, in which he conveyed to me the very great dislike which the Attorney had for the proposal that we were proposing to put to the parliamentary committee, that is, he, the Attorney&hyphen;General, was strongly opposed to that draft submission, which we had provided him a copy of, being made to the commission.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, it was not the fact that they were commenting that concerned the Attorney&hyphen;General. It was the fact of what they were saying because they have blown the Wik legislation right out of the water. They expose it as being unfair, unjust, unconstitutional and as not providing the certainty that the government should provide. It is the content of the advice which the government do not want to accept. So they seek to close down the Law Reform Commission in terms of it providing that sort of advice in the future, they are trying to stifle them from appearing before the native title committee and now they are starting to attack individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chair of the native title committee, Mr Warren Entsch, a member of the House of Representatives, added to that today. When asked about the Law Reform Commission, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From what I have seen they are offering absolutely nothing more than what has been pushed by the Labor Party and some groups within the Aboriginal community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The thrust of this attack seems to be that the Australian Law Reform Commission should be making comments on matters that are not the subject of a reference, which I must say is a novel way to look at it; that the Australian Law Reform Commission can exceed its power, it can run around and make a submission to any committee it likes and it can do so with impunity; that it can talk on any topic it likes, anything that takes 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> its fancy, and can use up the resources that it is supposed to be using for the references it does have in deciding what it might rather do; and that it can go around without a reference and just exceed its power. Had the Attorney&hyphen;General, Mr Williams, been aware a little earlier that the commission was making a practice of making submissions to committees on matters for which it did not have a reference, I am quite certain that he would have had something more to say about that. Clearly, he took the matter up when he said that he also expressed concerns in relation to the commission making submissions on matters such as copyright, for which there is no current reference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue here is not the content of this submission. It is not the content that is in issue, nor is it the fact that the commission has gone and, off its own bat, decided that it should make references on other topics. The issue is what power it has to do it. The issue is whether it should be making submissions to inquiries and committees on subject matters that just take its fancy from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one comes back to the Clerk of the Senate's letter one sees a very interesting distinction, and that is in a subsequent letter dated 29 September from the clerk to Senator Faulkner. The letter said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been revealed by answer to a question in the Senate that the Attorney&hyphen;General suggested or directed that the Commission not make a submission to the joint committee because the Commission does not have a current relevant reference and that the government wishes that the Commission confine itself to the subjects of its references.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A lot has been said here today and I do not need to repeat the fact that it is patently obvious that if you give someone a false assumption on which to write an advice you get the wrong advice. The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears from public comments by the President of the Commission that it was indicated that the government might give a direction to restrict the activities of the Commission if the Attorney&hyphen;General's suggestion or direction was not heeded.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">How could anyone take that as a threat? What you are saying here is that if the commission does not observe its terms of reference and if it does not do what it is constituted and set up 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7201"> to do then, by gee, you will restrict its activities; you will do something about it. That is the Attorney&hyphen;General's duty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is absolute nonsense not to have made that distinction. It is patently dishonest not to have made that distinction and to have asked the clerk to comment when the assumption is entirely fallacious and is also totally mischievous. This is a total and utter beat&hyphen;up of something that everyone knows is where the commission is simply exceeding its powers. The Attorney&hyphen;General has, of course, categorically denied that there is any threat and his statement has actually been agreed with by Mr Rose, the president of the commission. Apparently Mr Rose does not think that he has been threatened, Mr Williams says that he was not threatened, so who on earth thinks he was threatened?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is ultimately a matter for the commission to decide whether or not to comment on the native title bill. I suppose it is a matter for the commission to decide whether it is going to carry out its proper function and attend to the references and matters that it has in front of it or whether it is going to go completely outside its powers and try and comment upon something else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General has asserted, and it is absolutely correct, that he has at all times acted in accordance with his duties as the minister with the portfolio responsibilities for the commission. He said&mdash;and indeed he would have been remiss and would have failed in his duty if he had not made it known&mdash;to the commission that it should only act within the powers conferred on it by the parliament. Everyone is going on here about the powers of the parliament. One has to always act within power and I am absolutely astounded that anyone with an ounce of legal nous could think that somebody should act without power and make submissions about it to this place or to some properly constituted Senate committee. It beggars believe that that could be contended. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do want to spend just a minute or two talking about that, because I thought it was a very low moment indeed in Australian democracy when the federal Attorney-General (Mr Williams) denigrated the professional integrity of Mr Rose as a lawyer&mdash;and a very competent and senior lawyer in the Australian constitutional establishment&mdash;on the basis that Mr Rose had been appointed to the position he held by Mr Keating when he was Prime Minister.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that was followed up this morning by a personal attack on Mr Rose by Warren Entsch, the chair of the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander Land Fund.

It was actually announced at the time by Michael Lavarch. Cabinet appointed Mr Rose, and rightly so, on the recommendation of Mr Lavarch as Attorney-General.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, Mr Rose&mdash;for the information of those people&mdash;actually worked in the office of the then Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Fraser. Mr Rose occupied senior positions in the bureaucracy throughout the entire period of the Fraser government. Mr Rose then became the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department federally. So it was hardly an unreasonable appointment to appoint Mr Rose.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why were they doing so? It was because they did not like the advice.

The commission was in fact specifically and in writing invited to do so by Senator Nick Minchin, who forwarded them a copy of the bill and asked them to comment on it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are still the only Australians, sent overseas on active service, whose service has not been recognised in three important areas:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. R.A.N. casualties are not yet included on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial alongside Army and R.A.A.F. casualties;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. R.A.N. service has not yet been recognised with the visible signs of service to Australia; the Returned from Active Service Badge and the Naval campaign medal; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. R.A.N. service is still not acknowledged as eligible service for the Australian Service Pension, while service by Commonwealth and allied veterans from 55 other countries is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Members of the Army and R.A.A.F. who served during the same period in Malaya had their service fully recognised 24 hours after arriving in Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1997 Budget the Government partly recognised that R.A.N. service was `operational' and accepted responsibility for disabilities resulting from that service. Those affected appreciate the belated, partial recognition. However, government departments are still resorting to old, and inventing new excuses, to deny the above 3 points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request that the Senate acts to help remove the injustice of 40 years and fully recognise R.A.N. service by providing the same recognition and benefits for that service. The cost will be minuscule, being mainly a transfer of pensions from `age' as paid by the Department of Social Security, to `service' pensions, paid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator Calvert</NAME><FROM>(from eight citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

These measures, which were introduced into the Parliament before the High Court decision, introduce differential rates of duty on petroleum products according to their end use and the presence of a chemical marker and have required a complete restructure of those parts of the Customs Tariff Act and the Excise Tariff Act that apply to petroleum products.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Firstly, we do put in place in the corridors outside this chamber, through whips' meetings and other things, sensible arrangements so that these matters can be raised without using up the precious and scarce time of the chamber. This request for being excluded from the provisions of standing order 111 was communicated to all parties recently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of how long it takes to draft these laws, I think Senator Margetts knows at least as well as I do&mdash;she has the privilege on some occasions to take these measures through the parliament&mdash;that they are extremely complicated measures seeking to deal with provisions in the tax laws. They are not easily drafted and they are not easily put together. They do take some time. The government brings them to the parliament as quickly as drafting resources and other policy resources allow. We do not leave them sitting in a bottom drawer and bring them up at the last minute just to trick people. We seek the support of the Senate in dealing with this legislation as soon as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator Margetts most genuinely that when we provide letters giving the reasons for dealing with matters outside the cut-off provisions of standing order 111 and seek indications at whips' meetings and through other informal processes, we do so genuinely. We like these reasons to be brought up at that time and we will continue to do so.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">FAMILY COURT OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA (ORDERS OF REGISTRARS) BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains no new policy but overcomes technical deficiencies in the way Commonwealth and State family law legislation and Rules of Court have applied in Western Australia. Western Australia is the only State to have its own family court. The bill is designed to complement Western Australian legislation addressing these deficiencies from within the legislative capabilities of that State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will create family law rights and liabilities for the many people who may be affected by a recent decision of the Full Court of the Family Court of Australia in the matter of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Horne v Horne </EMPHASIS> 13 February 1997, Appeal No. WA 13 of 1996. In that case, the Full Family Court held that the Family Law Rule that purportedly allowed Registrars of the Family Court of Western Australia to exercise the power to make consent orders was invalid. As a result, many consent orders made by Registrars in Western Australia are ineffective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will overcome this problem by ensuring that all affected people in Western Australia obtain enforceable, statutory family law rights and liabilities that mirror the rights and liabilities that would have been created by valid Registrars' orders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The approach taken in the bill is based on a similar one approved by the High Court in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">R v Humby</EMPHASIS>  ex 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parte Rooney (1973) 129 CLR 231 and subsequently in cases such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Polyukhovich v the Commonwealth </EMPHASIS> (1991) 172 CLR 501. This approach does not attempt to validate the purported orders made by Registrars. Instead, it creates new statutory rights and liabilities that may be exercised and enforced in the same manner as orders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will not have any significant financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HEALTH INSURANCE COMMISSION (REFORM AND SEPARATION OF FUNCTIONS) BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides for the separation of Medibank Private from the Health Insurance Commission (HIC), and the creation of a new Medibank Private corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through the separation, the Government will ensure that Medibank Private cannot be perceived to have any competitive advantage over other private health funds through its association with Medicare or other government programme functions of the HIC. It reinforces Government's commitment to the principle of competitive neutrality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Medibank Private corporation, after a transitional period in which it will operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the HIC, will remain in public ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill therefore provides for the HIC initially to hold shares in the nominated company and to seek registration of that company as a registered health benefits organisation under the National Health Act 1953. The HIC may not transfer any of its shares or voting rights attached to the shares before the date on which the shares are transferred to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any change to these ownership arrangements can only be made by parliamentary amendment of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new company, once it is operating Medibank Private, will not be limited by the current provisions of the Health Insurance Commission Act to determine the range of activities that may be carried out by the company. This will ensure that Medibank Private, to all intents and purposes, will be able to compete on an even footing with other private health insurers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the transfer of the fund and its business to the "nominated company" (not yet formed) which will operate Medibank Private. The HIC is specifically empowered by the bill to facilitate that transfer. The transfer scheme will be published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision for the transfer of assets, contracts&mdash;including the splitting of contracts between the HIC and the nominated company in some cases&mdash;and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7212"> liabilities to Medibank Private by ministerial declaration are specifically covered in the bill. Gazettal of any related determinations and a number of other determinations necessary to effect separation will ensure the transparency of transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff affected by the transfer will be treated fairly. Where an employee is transferred under these provisions, their terms and conditions of employment and other rights and entitlements defined in the bill, have been preserved. The bill does not, of course, prevent variations at a later date under any law, award, determination or agreement, but the interests of staff will be taken into account by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transferred employees will not be,entitled to any termination payment by leaving HIC employment, but re-transfer provisions will give considerable flexibility for staff transfers back to the HIC for a period of twelve months from the date on which the Commonwealth assumes ownership of the Medibank Private company.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minor provisions in the bill include stamp duty exemption for designated matters necessary to carry out the separation, the capacity to transfer pending legal proceedings to the new company where appropriate. the transfer of records in accordance with the Archives Act 1983, provision for the company not to be taken legally as an agency of the Commonwealth, for the Minister to be represented at corporations law meetings by the Chairman or the Secretary, and delegations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also permits any complaints or investigations under the Ombudsman Act 1976 or the Privacy Act 1988, and requests under the Freedom of Information Act 1982, which may have been or have been made prior to the Medibank Private fund-transfer day, and which relate to Medibank Private, to be completed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to meet the requirement for Medibank Private to operate on an equal footing with its competitors, these enactments will not apply to Medibank Private thereafter, other than in this transitional sense. The company will, however, continue to operate within the spirit of these regimes (as it does today where the Medibank Private business is not prescribed under these enactments). Medibank Private will, like its competitors, remain subject to the complaints investigations powers of the Private Health Insurance Complaints Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes a number of consequential changes to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973, other acts. and the Health Insurance Commission Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government stresses that the provision of Medicare services will be maintained as a core HIC function, and the HIC will be expected to continue 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to strive for excellence in delivering quality claims and related services to the public. Other existing government programmes functions, including the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, will also continue to be performed by the HIC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, the bill also recognises a widening role for the HIC in the delivery of health payments services and information to support health sector initiatives. The HIC may, in future, provide health information and payments support services to State governments as well as to the Commonwealth. For this reason, the bill permits consultation with the States and Territories as to their possible representation on the HIC board.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This response on fair trading policy, entitled `<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Deal: Fair Deal&mdash;Giving Small Business a Fair Go</EMPHASIS> , is the strongest message ever sent from Canberra to Australia's small business community that they now have a national government that has listened, has understood and has acted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt that after 13 years of Federal Labor governments small business has done it tough.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor gave small business an economic recession, record interest rates, a punishing tax system, a huge burden of bureaucracy and red tape and a job&hyphen;destroying unfair dismissal law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And in relation to fair trading, labor governments squibbed the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small business did it tough under labor governments. Now a coalition government is making the tough decisions for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In July I assumed portfolio responsibility for small business when the prime minister elevated small business policy into the Australian cabinet. I have spent the bulk of this time listening to small business across Australia on the issue of fair trading and on other issues of concern. I have been reminded by small business how frustrated they have been by the failure of previous governments to take action to address fair trading issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor's approach was to raise small business hopes by promising reviews, reports and recommendations only to have those hopes dashed by inaction, by reports shelved, recommendations ignored and issues deferred to the too&hyphen;hard basket. In all, 17 fair trading reports, reviews or draft proposals in 13 years of labor. Nothing achieved. That was life for small business under labor, where the Hawke&hyphen;Keating cabinets rolled small business every time because they never really understood the non&hyphen;unionised small business community in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is laughable that labor would now have you believe they suddenly care about this and wanted to act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased, Mr Speaker, to announce that the cycle of reports shelved, hopes dashed and labor cabinet inaction has been broken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today I announce to this House that after consideration of our one and only report on fair trading we have decided, unambiguously, that small business is right when it calls for action to address fair trading issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With a coalition government, small business gets action, not just words or promises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So much so that I will be immediately introducing into this House legislation to amend the Trade Practices Act that gives small business protection in its commercial dealings with big business. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, the package of reforms arises directly from the decision of the Howard coalition government to act as it promised in establishing the parliamentary committee on fair trading three months after coming to government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That committee chaired by my highly respected colleague the Member for Bendigo, Mr Bruce Reid MP, and its subsequent Report<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Finding a Balance</EMPHASIS> , outlined the litany of business conduct issues that had emerged during the past decade and which had not been addressed by Australian governments and policy makers in the ALP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was given broad terms of reference to examine these business conduct issues, and to develop options and strategies which would provide solutions. Although not limited in its analysis, the committee was asked to have particular reference to the position of small retail tenants and franchisees&mdash;areas of industry where repeated calls for action against unfair conduct had been made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Reid Committee received more than 200 submissions from business groups and individuals, and over 50 organisations gave evidence in public hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report was tabled on 26 May 1997&mdash;18 weeks ago. The committee found that small businesses were often disadvantaged in their dealings with big business. According to the committee, much of this unfair business conduct has arisen from the imbalance between parties prior to making an agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without a doubt many small business operators have suffered as a result. The risks associated with operating a business have increased with the economic and social costs being borne by the whole community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In presenting the Report the committee advised the House that the concerns about unfair business conduct towards small business are justified, and should be addressed urgently. The committee recommended a number of specific measures, including legislation, to induce behavioural change on the part of big business towards smaller business, and to provide unfairly treated small business with adequate means of redress.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, the government has accepted these conclusions. This is the time to act&mdash;to rectify the policy failures of past Labor governments and labor cabinets and to induce the behavioural change which the committee so rightly identified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is why I am moving immediately to introduce legislation into this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will act on the recommendations of each of the seven areas of reform identified by the committee&mdash;unfair conduct, retail tenancy, franchising, misuse of market power, small business finance, access to justice and education. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7214">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has accepted the committee's recommendations either in whole or in part, according to the constraints on Commonwealth powers and the importance of delivering a policy outcome that maximises the benefits to small business whilst minimising any counterproductive impacts on the sector. In a number of important respects the government response has gone further than the committee has recommended, particularly in the area of effective enforcement of fair trading issues for small business by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, ACCC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, the government response is a package of reforms. The reforms are based around stronger legislation protecting small business through the Trade Practices Act 1974 and state and territory retail tenancy laws, as well as legally recognised codes of conduct, more powerful enforcement of legal rights and better targeted information and alternative dispute resolution. Our response will ensure that small business can confidently deal with large firms in the knowledge that the rules under which they are operating are fair, and that there will be proper redress available when those rules are broken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our response will give small business the confidence to grow jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fundamental objective of the government is, in the words of the committee, to `induce behavioural change' where improved standards of commercial conduct are required, and not a mere desire to create a more litigious commercial environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By adopting these measures the government has ensured that the desired outcomes are achieved without unduly impacting on the operation of the open market or compromising the basic principles of contractual relations and commercial risk which remain at the core of our free enterprise economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now outline the major strategies which have been determined by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Unfair conduct and trade practices reform</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pivotal to the government's response is an acceptance that the Trade Practices Act must be made to work for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This requires an approach which improves the substantive legal rights available to small business against unfair business conduct, as well as administrative measures which facilitate improved enforcement of rights and access to remedies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will achieve these objectives in five ways:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a new provision in the Trade Practices Act that will give small business genuine access to protection against unconscionable conduct;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a new provision which will allow industry&hyphen;designed codes of practice, in whole or part, to be legally underpinned and be made mandatory 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> under the Trade Practices Act and enforced as breaches of the act;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a new provision which will allow the ACCC to take representative actions on behalf of small business for misuse of market power by big business;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a new provision which will give small business interests equal importance to consumer interests when appointments are made to the ACCC; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the issuing of a direction to the ACCC under the Trade Practices Act requiring the ACCC to enforce small business legal rights against unfair business conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Speaker, the legislative strengthening of the Trade Practices Act in this manner will provide for open and fair competition which underpins the legislative scheme of the act. It is wholly consistent with the philosophy of the government parties which first introduced trade practices legislation into Australia some 30 years ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In announcing this measure, the government has accepted the principle that small business people are entitled to a legal protection against unfair business conduct comparable with that which consumers already have against corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly the government will mirror in a new section of the Trade Practices Act the legal rights available to consumers in section 51AB, and incorporate a range of additional matters set out in recommendation 6.1 of the committee's report in order to tailor the provision appropriately to its statutory purpose of protecting small businesses. Conduct against business consumers which is unconscionable having regard to the enumerated factors will be prohibited by the act and give rise to a broad range of remedies under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new provision will extend the existing common law doctrine of unconscionability expressed in the existing section 51AA of the current act. The bill will use the expression `unconscionable conduct' rather than `unfair conduct' in order to build on the existing body of case law which has worked with respect to consumer protection provisions of the act, and which will provide greater certainty to small businesses in assessing their legal rights and remedies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As this is a new provision targeted to small business, the new provision will be limited to transactions which do not exceed $1 million. Publicly&hyphen;listed companies will not be able to instigate action under this new provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Legal recognition of Codes of Conduct</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognises that industry codes of practice can offer flexible and efficient mechanisms to address issues of business practice. However, experience has shown that for some codes of practice legislative underpinning is necessary to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7215"> ensure the effective operation of the code and to achieve the desired behavioural change in industry sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has accepted the principle of the Reid committee's recommendation 6.2. The bill I will be introducing will include in the Trade Practices Act a new Part which will enable the whole or parts of codes of practice to be underpinned as either mandatory or voluntary codes, after an appropriate approval process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This measure will provide small business with dual advantages&mdash;the benefit of participating in the design of industry regulation addressing unfair conduct, and the security of knowing that mandated codes or provisions of codes can be directly enforced under the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Franchising </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Reid Committee devoted much analysis to unfair conduct issues experienced in the franchising sector. The Committee concluded that specific legislative measures were required to be taken to redress the imbalance in commercial relations between franchisors and franchisees. It is clear that the previous government's approach to voluntary franchising regulation has not worked.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has decided that a strengthened franchising code of practice must be re&hyphen;established as a matter of urgency. The government has also decided that this code must be a mandatory code with key elements such as pre&hyphen;contractual disclosure underpinned by the Trade Practices Act. These measures are essential to provide the franchising sector with the required certainty of operation and an equitable scheme of regulation across franchise systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will establish a nine&hyphen;member Franchising Policy Council, consisting of an independent chair, three members representing franchisors, three representing franchisees and two representing service providers. The Council's first task will be to advise and report to the government on the recommended terms of the mandatory code, including the definition of `franchise system' for the purposes of the code and whether any sector of the franchising industry should or should not be exempt from the recommended provisions of the mandatory code. The government will distribute an exposure draft of a new code in order to accelerate the work of the Franchising Policy Council. The council will continue to advise the government on policy issues associated with the code, many of which were raised by the committee including the rights of franchisees in tenancy arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The franchising code will be monitored and enforced by a Codes of Conduct Enforcement Unit to be established within the Australian Competition 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and Consumer Commission. The government has a strong preference for including alternative dispute resolution mechanisms in the franchising code in order to minimise litigation and legal costs in the sector. In addition to the recommendations of the committee, the government will appoint a Dispute Resolution Adviser to assist parties to avoid disputes and to quickly resolve disputes that arise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will ensure that small business franchisees and franchisors are well informed about the franchising code through the development of information modules, training packages and widespread promotion of the Code and its benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has also decided that specific attention must be given to strengthening the position of small business franchisees in the oil industry in relation to unfair conduct issues. The government has decided that these issues are best addressed by accepting the objectives of recommendation 3.3 of the Reid Committee and establishing a stronger Oil Code as a mandatory code of practice. This mandatory Code will also be underpinned by the Trade Practices Act. Further details relating to OilCode will be separately released by the minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, the Hon John Moore MP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Retail tenancy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has accepted the broad conclusion of the committee that retail tenants are entitled to stronger legislative protection against unfair conduct than currently applies. That stronger protection must include improved legislation based on two principles&mdash;that the legislation should apply equitably across the retail sector, and that the legislation should not result in a more complex regime of cross&hyphen;jurisdictional tenancy regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must be recognised that the Federal government has only limited constitutional capacity to legislate with respect to retail tenancies. Any legislation would leave some small businesses outside the scope of such protections because they and their landlords may not be incorporated. Small businesses seeking to enforce remedies would be trapped into litigation focused on technical matters such as the cross&hyphen;jurisdictional reach of Federal or state/territory laws, and not the issues of substance. These outcomes would be highly discriminatory within the retail sector and counterproductive to small retail tenants. Only state and territory legislation, which does not suffer these constraints, can provide the universal and non discriminatory protections required by small and specialist retailers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Notwithstanding these limitations on Commonwealth power, the government has seized the political opportunity made possible by the Reid Report to facilitate national negotiations between peak representatives of retail tenants, the Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7216"> Retailers Association, and retail landlords, the Property Council of Australia, on best practice principles for tenancy reform. Through the government's leadership and the cooperative approach of the parties I am pleased to advise that progress has been made by the industry on agreements to improve the legislative safety net for small business retailers under state and territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government particularly believes that effective low cost justice is an essential element of any retail tenancy safety net and should be incorporated in all state and territory legislation where it does not currently exist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the government will adopt a dual strategy to address tenancy issues raised in the committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, the government will release to state and territory governments, and publicly, national benchmark principles for tenancy reform, and take a leadership role in advocating an enhanced safety net of legal protections for retail tenants under state and territory legislation. A special meeting of state and territory ministers responsible for retail tenancy will be convened before the end of this year. That special ministerial meeting will be charged with the task of responding to the nationally determined benchmark principles, as well as addressing the non&hyphen;agreed matters which relate to security of tenure, disclosure of turnover, and recovery of outgoings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the government's small business amendment to the Trade Practices Act proposed by this bill will provide a new avenue for some small and specialist retailers to pursue remedies against unconscionable conduct in the retail tenancy relationship. This would provide legal recourse under the Trade Practices Act where retail leasing contracts or conduct by retail landlords within the scope of the law was unconscionable. This new provision will be particularly beneficial to retail tenants as it allows a court to have regard to the relative strengths of the bargaining position of the retailer and the landlord in determining whether the conduct complained of was unconscionable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the government has accepted the recommendation of the committee concerning the economic and social impact of the proliferation of shopping centres and recognising that this is primarily an issue for state and territory planning laws, will refer this matter for consideration by state and territory governments, as contemplated by the Reid Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Misuse of market power</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In focusing its attention on the issue of the misuse of market power, the committee recommended that the Trade Practices Act be amended to enable the ACCC to take representative actions on behalf of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> small businesses under Part IV of the act. The government has accepted this recommendation, as well as the related recommendation that these matters be the subject of investigation by the appropriate enforcement authority in the retail sector as a priority matter.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Small business finance</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government acted decisively earlier this month to announce fundamental reforms to the structure of the Australian financial system following the report of the Wallis Inquiry. Small business is a significant client of the Australian financial industry. These reforms will promote greater competition and efficiency within the financial sector, and will benefit small business in dealing with large lending institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to making structural changes to the Australian financial system, the government has considered each of the specific recommendations made by the Committee on small business finance issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has accepted in principle the Reid Committee's recommendation that the Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman Scheme and the Banking Code of Practice should be extended from unincorporated small business to include small business which is incorporated. The government will advise the financial industry of this decision, and invite immediate consultation on an appropriate definition of small business for these purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government also accepts the recommendation of the Reid Committee to examine the feasibility of establishing a specialised dispute resolution mechanism for complaints against receivers and liquidators in consultation with industry bodies and other interested parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendations of the committee relating to client confidentiality will be accepted by submitting these matters to the review by Treasury and the Attorney General's Department on the potential economic implications of positive credit reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has also agreed that Treasury continue to monitor the small business lending market to ensure that the benefits of enhanced competition are passed on to the small business sector. In this context, banks will be expected to review and develop better methods of risk assessment and re&hyphen;examine interest rate premiums charged on small business loans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small business will also have access to the new provision of the Trade Practices Act relating to unconscionable conduct in seeking redress against unfair dealing by financial institutions.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Reid Committee recommended in its report that the ACCC be proactive in promoting compliance with legal remedies for small business, and in establishing a body of precedents which could be used to influence inappropriate business conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government accepts the need to ensure that the improved legal rights for small business and in this response are supplemented with credible and effective enforcement mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although limitations exist on the Commonwealth's power to compel alternative dispute resolution, the government will promote, particularly in codes of practice, low cost alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, especially in relation to franchising disputes, tenancy disputes and disputes between small business and financial institutions. These mechanisms include mediation, arbitration, conciliation and in appropriate cases early neutral evaluation or expert appraisal. The government will also accept the Reid Committee's recommendation to have the Attorney&hyphen;General examine impediments to the ability of small business to access the traditional legal system, in consultation with state and territory Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has decided to go further than the Reid Committee's recommendations on the issue of enforcement. Once the amendments to the Trade Practices Act are in operation, the government will issue a direction under section 29 of that act requiring the ACCC to initiate test cases under the new unconscionability provision at the earliest possible opportunity. This will send a strong message to the business community that the government is serious about improving the standard of business conduct affecting small business. Additional funding of $480 000 each year for the next four years has been committed to fund precedent setting test cases to be taken by the ACCC on behalf of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will also amend section 7 of the Trade Practices Act to require at least one full&hyphen;time Commissioner of the ACCC to be a person experienced in small business matters, thereby putting small business on an equal footing with the statutory requirement for representation of consumer interests. This amendment will also be introduced following the necessary consultations with state and territory governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the interim, the government will appoint two new Associate Commissioners of the ACCC dedicated to small business issues.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report brought down in the House of Representatives and in the Senate just a moment ago is a report by the government responding to a House of Representatives committee inquiring into aspects of small business trading, particularly into those aspects relating to tenants of shopping malls who are at the mercy of the owners of those shopping malls&mdash;aspects such as rent, circumstances of tenancy and all of the other issues associated with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report deals with the parlous position of franchisees&mdash;that is, small franchised businesses that buy a franchise from a major corporation and then trade under that corporation's name, logo and product. It is a small business sector which is the most 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> litigated in the Australian business area. The report deals with all of those things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition welcomes the government's response to this report in the main. We welcome it with a qualification. We do not know how overjoyed we should be until we see the actual legislation that gives voice in practical legislative terms to the promises that the government makes in its statement. With the qualification that we expect that the heady rhetoric of the government's statement will be translated into cold, black&hyphen;letter law which really does mean something, we have to say that what the government has done on balance in responding to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair trading in Australia</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that is the title of the House of Representatives' report&mdash;is by and large welcomed by us. Of course, there are deficiencies, and I will turn to those in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A fair bit of the statement that the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, has tabled in the House begins with a long lambasting of the record of the Labor government. As I have said, if winners write history, this is an effort by Mr Reith to rewrite the facts of the case. The truth is that small business recognises that the previous Labor government was the first federal government of Australia to appoint a small business minister&mdash;David Beddall. He took a number of innovative steps to lift the profile of small business and to impart into the legislative considerations of both the cabinet and the parliament steps to protect the interests of the small business community, and he introduced a number of inquiries from which government action flowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS>, which the government is responding to today, picks up 90 per cent of the recommendations of a report that the Labor Party brought down when in office in 1995, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Better business</EMPHASIS> report. The government, in now responding to the later report&mdash;it became available late last year&mdash;is two years off the pace. Had it not obstructed us for political and election purposes in 1995, many of the measures that are now being proposed would have been in place and small business would have benefited from them. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7219">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not a reason to not recognise and give credit to the changes that the government proposes to make. It is, though, reason to say quite clearly on the record that these could have been done sooner had the government not, for political and electoral purposes in 1995 and early in 1996, obstructed the course of the then government when it brought them down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very inquiry that the government is now responding to&mdash;the inquiry which brought down the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance</EMPHASIS> and which was well conducted, with a government majority, though all party members were on it&mdash;arose because the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Kim Beazley, had a private member's bill before the chamber in the other place and would have proceeded with it were the government ever to give him leave to do so. They did not. He was not able to proceed. To cover the political embarrassment of preventing the Kim Beazley fair trading, small business bill coming on, the government then created this inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is important to get the sequence of events on the table. The Beazley private member's bill stimulated the government to political action in setting up their inquiry which they now reply to and which we now welcome many of the findings from. That said, the response by the government is not an adequate response in the all round sense. Let me now turn to the merit of some of the recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business has foreshadowed a number of, I think, important changes, but the government has not at all delivered in the area of retail tenancy. Dispute resolution over retail tenancies, the establishment of retail lease tribunals, security of tenure for retail lessees in shopping malls in particular, lease assignments, disclosure of rents, a review of rent proceedings, outgoings and promotions, leases and disclosure statements, the mix of tenancies, and the redevelopment and relocation of tenants were all subject to recommendations in the report, and all of those have been ignored by the government in its response to the report. This leaves as a running sore justice for small tenants in major shopping 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> complexes in Australia&mdash;an area of major concern and an area of major outcry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a broader note, this area of business is a growth area. The tendency for Australian consumers is to choose the more congenial shopping facilities of a large mall and to buy through the major retail outlets in that mall and the boutique stores that also provide the colour and the variation of retailing that is available there. The corner store is increasingly a thing of the past, but for small retailers who seek lease holdings in the major mall they are increasingly finding that the big end of town&mdash;big business in Australia&mdash;squeezes them and either forces them to the margin, pushes them out of business or forces them to be uncompetitive in pushing up their prices to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an area which requires a government to make a decision at the end of the day as to whose side they are on. Are they on the side of increasing competition, of increasing the opportunities in business for small entrepreneurs, or are they lined up with the big end of town which takes the view that there is somehow a fair negotiating situation between someone who owns the premises and the mall and someone who seeks to be a tenant in it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are they of the view that the negotiations between the owner and the rent seeker&mdash;the small boutique shopkeeper&mdash;is somehow fair and conducted between equal partners? Well, it is not. That is what the recommendations of the House of Representatives committee found&mdash;a committee with a majority of government backbenchers on it. The government has not proceeded to accept those recommendations. The opposition think they ought to have done so. To do so would have improved the access to justice of small shopkeepers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the government's response to this report they have announced that they are setting up the franchising policy council. It is an interesting recommendation. We endorse it, but we draw attention to the fact that government funding for a franchising policy council was cut out in the 1996 budget. That is, funds of $2 million were removed. We had a council in name with no funding to give effect to their responsibilities.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7220">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government then did was flirt with the idea of inviting the franchisors&mdash;that is, the head owners of the franchise&mdash;to set up a council which the government would recognise, as if that end of the bargaining equation could represent the interests of the franchisees&mdash;the people whom they contracted to&mdash;and could therefore represent their interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The quickest and fastest growing area of litigation is between the franchisors and the franchisees in the small business area. Increasingly, a business in Australia will be conducted as it is in the United States and Europe through franchises. To get the law right in this area means to protect those who are the small end of the equation&mdash;the franchisees&mdash;and who are often at the mercy of unscrupulous dealers who own the franchise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To set up a council that will remove the high cost of law and access to justice for franchisees is a moderate step. It should be taken; it was taken. Funds were bled away under the previous budget. It will be taken now. That is a good thing. I wish it had been done sooner. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly today to the statement by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith). Peter Reith is at once the minister for small business but also the minister for industrial relations. The reason I mention that is that he has given some recognition to the fact that there are some problems in the way of making agreements between small business and large business. The report on page 2 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will be immediately introducing into this House legislation to amend the Trade Practices Act that gives small business protection in its commercial dealings with big business.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a welcome step, but it depends exactly how that is done as to whether or not it will help the situation. On page 3 it mentions the report tabled on 26 May 1997, where the Reid committee found that small business were often disadvantaged in their dealings with big business. According to the committee, much of this unfair business conduct has arisen from the imbalance between parties prior to making an agreement.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a very useful statement. The fact that I mentioned that Mr Reith is also the minister for industrial relations is that he should have realised this is also the case between employers and employees. We certainly have an imbalance in our society in terms of the ability to make fair choices. If a person has a virtually monopoly on the provision of employment, then you are in an imbalanced situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you own a small business and somebody is a monopoly supplier of those goods that are vital for your business, you are in an imbalanced situation. If you own a small business and you have a monopoly buyer for your goods and services&mdash;for instance, in the footwear, clothing and textile industries where perhaps one company has outsourced suppliers in a number of different places&mdash;they can do what they do in North Korea or Japan: that is, they can ratchet down the annual negotiated price for those suppliers. That has been going on for a long time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very interesting that this minister has recognised the existence of that imbalance in bargaining power between small business and large business but has not adequately acknowledged it in relation to employers and employees. Of course, everybody else knew that there is not much of a choice when somebody offers you, as an employee, a take it or leave it agreement. The reality is that there is a vast imbalance. People do not have much of a choice, except perhaps to be on unemployment, and then perhaps to be dobbed in for not taking the job that was offered to them, no matter how bad the job was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is another issue as well. As we in Australia have gone in the last few years through the new World Trade Organisation agreements that have resulted from the Uruguay Round of GATT, more and more investors have bought up greater and greater chunks of Australian industry. This means that, amongst big business, we often do have monopolies and oligopolies who, in fact, have vertical integration they can arrange right through from the production to the marketing stage, and they can control the outcomes. In those situations, small businesses, often local family firms, do not get a look in.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7221">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need an industry policy which deals with those things&mdash;not just little tweaks at the edges in terms of legislation, but an industry policy that actually recognises that, when you have monopolies and oligopolies, when you have whole takeovers of industry&mdash;a whole range of industries, including media and sport industries in Australia&mdash;we have to have legislation that deals with that imbalance and the failures of the market. Unless we have that, unless we deal with those real issues, we are never, by tweaking little bits of legislation, going to deal with that imbalance so that people do get fair outcomes, get a fairer deal as consumers, and also get a fairer deal as dealers and business people of small business in Australia&mdash;which, of course, is a major employer in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great day for small business, and I think there will be great rejoicing around the shopping centres and in the small business sector. It is a day for which small business has waited for something like 30 years, as it is 30 years since the original Trade Practices Act in which there was some sort of token support for small business. Small business tried repeatedly for 14 or 15 years, without any success, to use the present Trade Practices Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I was like doubting Thomas. I went out and spoke very strongly for this fair trading report in various centres around Queensland, while thinking to myself, `Well, I hope we can perform.' Today, my worst fears have been put to rest.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did believe that there would be some sort of a token effort to give small business a bit of a go. But I never believed that Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Mr Reith, would be able to come up with such a comprehensive package. I believed that the big end of town would prevent him from doing so, and he deserves very strong commendation for having the fortitude to stand up and deliver for small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package goes, I would say, 99 per cent of the way. You would have to give it a nine 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> out of 10 for everything it does&mdash;for protecting small business; for recognising unconscionable conduct; for allowing two commissioners, representing small business, to be assigned to the ACCC; for recognising the oil code conduct; for recognising that the franchising act and the leases acts are there and that, if they are to be removed, as was recommended by Ray Braithwaite, who was commissioned to do a report, the oil code be underpinned by legislation; and for there being a retail tenancy safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many governments have paid lip-service to small business. It has been a sort of catchcry that `We are for small business.' But let it be said&mdash;and I say it as someone who has had 20 years running my own small business&mdash;that this day is the day that small business has some equality and can compete with big business. If the muscle and the might of big business is brought to bear on some of the smaller businesses then, under this new proposal put forward by Mr Howard, Mr Reith and the National Party, those smaller businesses can take their problems to the ACCC, and the ACCC can take up the case and the cudgel on behalf of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hopefully, you will never get Shell, Woolworths or Coles taking on a small business tenant or a small service station operator where the might of their colossal economic force can be pitted against that of the small business. If small business has a case of unconscionable conduct then, under the new proposed act that Mr Reith says he will introduce at the earliest possible moment, small business will be able to get some type of support from the ACCC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say again: I never believed that I would see such a comprehensive statement put down, such comprehensive support given to small business, by a coalition government. I have seen it, I am very pleased with it, and I congratulate the minister for it. I think it had to be done by a minister in cabinet; it had to have that sort of muscle. As far as I am concerned, Peter Reith will be the hero of the small business community&mdash;and he deserves to be. I will get this package out as fast and as widely as I can.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7222">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I feel that the coalition has honoured a commitment that it made to small business at the last election when it said to them, `If you support us, we will support you.' We have heard that ad nauseam from various governments, whether they be governments of my persuasion or governments of the Labor Party, but never before have we seen such a full commitment given to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think small business will respond, as they responded at the last election. I believe that they will get right behind this government, because the government has now really claimed them as a constituency. Small business have always voted for the National&hyphen;Liberal Party but now they have a reason to stand with them shoulder to shoulder to progress this country further forward, because the government has put its money where its mouth is.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is indeed a pleasing response from the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business, Peter Reith, to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fair training in Australia</EMPHASIS> , otherwise known as the Reid small business fair trading report. It was a unanimous report supported by the Labor and the coalition members of that committee. What we all feared was that it was the 20th report in 20 years and that it would die the same death as the others. But it appears that Mr Reith is determined that it will not do so. I hope that the minister has introduced the government's recommendations not because the polls said they should and not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> because there were votes in it, but because it was the right thing to do. I congratulate the minister on what is, without doubt, a fair and good effort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I particularly welcome proposed amendments to the Trade Practices Act. But we should recognise that the language in which the proposal is phrased does not convey the detail which will have to accompany it. The problem with unconscionable conduct provisions is that a lot of legal history and a lot of legal baggage goes with them. The problem with unconscionable conduct is that, in the past, it has been very difficult to prove.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I and my party, the Australian Democrats, will be examining the detail particularly carefully to ensure that the criteria and the test will be broad enough so that unfair business conduct which is presently legal will no longer be legal. That is one area of concentration. We see our job, in the coming months as the legislation comes before us, as being to strengthen the legislation wherever it shows signs of not delivering the full intent of the Reid fair trading report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second area I want to comment on is the franchising area. The former Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Prosser, did an appalling job. He pulled the legal and financial rug out from the Franchising Code Council and ditched it. This minister, who does not have a conflict of interest in these matters, has put that rug back under the feet of franchisors and franchisees with his proposal for an independent statutory authority which will be underpinned by the appropriate legislation and the appropriate codes through the ACCC and the Trade Practices Act. That mirrors, in many respects, what I have been calling for concerning the franchising industry. Once again I say to Mr Reith: on that matter, that looks like a good job well done and I look forward to the detail matching the intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The third area I wish to comment on, as we assess the government's response, is the area of retail tenancies. Without doubt, this is the most difficult, most serious and most urgent area which faces small business, because it is in the long-term contractual relationship that tenants have with landlords 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7223"> that unconscionable conduct, that standover activity, and that muscling from big oligopolists and monopolists have been going on. It is in this area that the government has the weakest card to play. Minister Reith says that his card is weak because of the constitutional restraints on his being able to introduce Australia-wide legislation in this area. Therefore, he is forced to rely on state and territory legislation to deliver his intention. While we recognise that that is so, we are not completely convinced by that argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The worst thing which affects retail tenancies&mdash;and, indeed, any commercial tenancies&mdash;is that, out of all the provisions of goods and services, these are the provisions which are secret. In contrast to labour and to capital, which are deregulated and are relatively open in the marketplace, land is a secret marketplace. You do not know in a shopping centre what your competitors' rents are. You do know in a shopping centre what the prices of washing machines, of shoes or of bread are; but you do not know and are not able to compare on a fair basis the price of rents. It is that secrecy which delivers the power to landlords in being able to manipulate the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those of you who are interested in this matter, I have considerable background and experience in this area and I have written a booklet of 47 pages called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Leases, landlords and tenants</EMPHASIS>, which outlines my own and the Democrats' views in that area. It is in the retail tenancy area that there needs to be the greatest attention paid to the agony of so many small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to see in the summary, which I have glanced at, of Minister Reith's proposals that he has attended to many of the issues that I and others are concerned with, such as rack rents, valuations and the way in which outgoings and taxes are dealt with. I am sure that he and his department will pay attention to the views that I and many other people who are experienced in this field will put to him. We will be driving hard on the retail tenancy issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the question of codes of conduct. We have been strong supporters of the view that there should be both voluntary and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mandatory codes of conduct depending upon the industry sector affected and that those codes of conduct should be underpinned where appropriate through the Trade Practices Act and the ACCC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to Minister Reith's announcement we wrote to him with regard to those proposals and we are pleased to see that he agrees with us and we agree with him that these kinds of codes of conduct are appropriate in this matter. So he will find us supportive and helpful when he introduces the detail of his intention in the area of codes of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the extraordinary power and strength of the oil majors, we are particularly pleased to see the intention of the government to strengthen the oil code and to improve the relationship between retail tenancies in the oil industry and the oil majors. Once again this is an area where Minister Reith has paid attention to many of the submissions put before the Reid fair trading committee and sent to his office&mdash;I expect that they were also sent to all the senators who act in or who have taken an interest in this area. It is particularly pleasing, too, that he has paid attention to that. We are a society where monopolies and undue concentration are allowed to develop, and we are very pleased to see that he is intending to pay greater attention to the misuse of market power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final area I wish to comment on is the area of small business finance. It is the intention of the government to oblige banks and those providing small business finance to pay far more attention to the detail, content and nature of the financial relationships that banks have with small business. This review, this intention, is long overdue. Once again we want to thank the government for signalling this intention and we will support all your efforts in this regard. We hope that the banks do not persuade you to pull back from the intention which has been outlined in the ministerial statement today. As always, it is the detail that we will look to. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first reason was that there was a pressing need to improve the speed and quality of decision making within the Defence Organisation and to reduce the size of bureaucratic structures which had developed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second reason was that, over the last decade Defence funding has been under great pressure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In that period it has declined as a percentage of Commonwealth outlays&mdash;from 8.8 per cent down to 8.2 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a time when spending in the areas of health, education and social security have significantly increased, Defence spending declined from 2.6 per cent of Gross National product in 1986 to 1.9 per cent in 1997.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These factors have made it enormously difficult for Defence to maintain high levels of operational and training activities, and to buy and modernise equipment.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our last key outcome relates to the management approach we need to realise substantial efficiency gains.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We must move many elements of the Defence Organisation away from the belief that they need to own and control the support services and organisations which support them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The difficulty with this old approach is that it leads to very costly and substantial duplication and overlapping of activities&mdash;&hyphen; for example running three separate logistic support organisations, four personnel management organisations and so on.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Contrary to the opening statement of the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan), there is nothing truly radical about the reform objectives and outcomes that he mentions. He states that under a so&hyphen;called `funding crisis' the defence department was drifting towards an unacceptable point where the only choice was to cut capability and that this would be an unrealistic choice. It could have been said that it is realistic to cut some military capabilities. The military defence of Australia can be met, for example, without the long range and threatening Collins class submarines. The broader security issues facing people in Australia&mdash;social issues, environmental, security and their future&mdash;are all being cut back by the current government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The approach is contradictory: on the one hand it is said that Defence must be focused on maintaining and developing combat capability as a primary task and on the other is the idea that the same reforms will maximise the focus of all Defence activities on promoting the security of Australia and its interests. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7228"> latter appeals to broad sentiments on the need for security but only wants to deliver the first&mdash;a narrow projection of force which sends signals of threat and military capability to the Asia&hyphen;Pacific, in which we must live and cooperate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fleeting statements that prioritise a range of contingencies from the defence of Australia to offshore operations has not, first of all, considered the bad record of our training and supply of overseas troops or, secondly, in whose name the range of offshore operations are taken. How is the legitimacy of operations outside Australia assessed? The value of a military force should not be measured by its efficiency in dealing military capabilities but by whether or not its forces are counterproductive because they themselves are generating military reactions. Are they capable of reducing the spread of weapons? Are they effective at producing positive influence in the region for real security? Are our forces working with, for example, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea to really produce an improved human rights outcome&mdash;as we are often told, without evidence&mdash;or are they defending narrow notions of self&hyphen;interest, such as CRA reconsidering investment in Papua New Guinea after the Bougainville crisis started in 1988?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we want to focus on responses to crises and the finances for them, the defence cooperation project should be cut. The money should be spent on civil development aid in South&hyphen;East Asia and the South Pacific and be focused on sustainable, equitable economic development and social justice&mdash;the real security issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Military aid has not brought peace and security to Bougainville. It has allowed successive Papua New Guinean governments to proceed with military options to the conflict. It has required New Zealand to host peace negotiations&mdash;and good on them. Australia is too deeply entrenched in the conflict to have any notions of neutrality or legitimacy to sponsor a peaceful settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should comment on some of the findings of the report. One of them is on the strategic setting&mdash;it is funny that this is the one that got instant agreement by the minister. Yes, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the end of the Cold War might have made Australia's regional strategic circumstances more complex and demanding, but it does not follow that Australia's need for military capability remains high. This complex task is handled by an interwoven and thorough approach to security&mdash;that is, conflict resolution. How do you stop people from wanting to kill each other? How do you stop that situation from starting in the first place? By addressing root causes&mdash;community development aid, negotiation and dialogue. The world is not simply in a spiral of changing military preparations. It also presents opportunities to break out of traditional cycles of military threat and military response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to comment on the defence trade commissioners as well. The cost&hyphen;effectiveness of the overseas defence trade commissioners was examined, and they have been retained in Indonesia and Thailand. But there is much more to looking at how valuable these roles are than simply a rationalist question. Rather, we should be looking at how our overseas representatives are furthering security. I doubt whether the commissioners in the role they play have a vested interest in the security of all&mdash;just that of the buyers, I imagine. I wonder if they bear any responsibility to the financial burden carried by the public purse of the buying country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to training and education, if the strategic setting has identified that the regional environment has changed since the Cold War, why are there no specific recommendations reflecting the new skills and education necessary for working in the features of the new environment? Changes in peacekeeping operations and a focus on human rights issues are two significant features of the world in the 1990s&mdash;surely that should be reflected in Australia Defence Force training and education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think a lot of this is based on supposition that Australia will be involved in more joint overseas operations, and this is going to be the case if we ignore the fact that real security within and between countries is affected by the growing gaps which are part of the economic, fundamentalist, international push&mdash;the free trade push, the one that says we rip out 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7229"> resources from those who own them and try to make money by exports to feed the international markets. That is the one that ends up being part of the fertile ground for scapegoatism within countries where people start feeling threatened by each other if they are of different ethnic groups and different religious groups, and end up either in conflict or, at worst, at war. Simply dealing with ways that we can be part of such wars is not good enough&mdash;Australia has to actually ascertain what is causing regional and world insecurities and be part of the solution, not part of the problem.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the opposition to speak on the defence statement put down by the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan). I, as a senator, was on the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee which has examined the estimates of the Department of Defence over the last 12 months. During that time, we have had opportunities to ask the minister's representative, Senator Newman, and the senior defence officials&mdash;both civilian and service&mdash;about the process of the defence reform program that came out of the defence efficiency review and, I have to say, it is a very muddled process judging by what we have seen exposed at the estimates hearing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having had a quick look at the minister's statement, the best way you might describe it is as some sort of a report on progress being made. This again highlights the problems we have had as an estimates committee in trying to get reasonable information out of the government about just what they are up to with this defence reform program coming out of the efficiency review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the estimates committee has had long discussions about the difference between a finding and a recommendation in the documents. I think we got down to trying to work out what these documents meant. We have got a thin document&mdash;that was the best way we could describe it because it obviously is&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The future directions of the management of Australia's defence</EMPHASIS> and an addendum to the report, which is a much thicker document. Both have mixtures of recommendations and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> findings. We could never get a satisfactory answer to the nature and the standing of a finding versus a recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I notice that the minister says in his statement on page 9 under the heading `70 Findings and Recommendations':</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I can report that there were seventy findings and recommendations in the original Defence Efficiency Review:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I cannot argue with that because they are actually listed one to 70, and then he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . of the 18 findings, 16 have been studied in detail and will be used to direct future planning.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When you asked, `Does that mean you accept the finding, Minister, or do you amend it or reject it?', it all became very clouded indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you will note from the minister's own statement, of the 18 findings he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16 have been studied in detail and will be used to direct future planning.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Two have gone missing in action, you might well say, using a defence analogy&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . of the 49 recommendations, action is complete on 14 and well underway on a further 31.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">By my simple mathematics, that comes up to 45 recommendations&mdash;four recommendations seem, again, to have gone missing in action from the minister's own statement today, which just reinforces the difficulties the opposition members have had at the defence estimates committee as they went on for interminable hour after hour trying to find out the real status of many of these recommendations. Again, it reflects the muddled attitude of this government to handling the defence arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This statement by the minister has to be just nothing more than PR spin. For example, to say on page nine:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contrary to some ill&hyphen;informed speculation, the effect of the reform Program has been to boost morale in the Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not know where he has been and what he has been doing but according to all the evidence we received at the estimates hearing and all the anecdotal information around, the absolute opposite has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The downgrading of the various headquarters of the three services has created great upset amongst the officers in each of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7230"> services. Although the minister tried to put some gobbledygook before us at the estimates hearing, and in this sort of statement, that the service chiefs now have a more direct role in policy formulation, all the evidence that we got at estimates was that the exact opposite was occurring.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a further centralisation of advice and policy development to the ADF headquarters. That may be a good thing as far as the restructuring of the defence forces is concerned, but don't get up and tell us that the service chiefs in the three services believe it is a good idea. It was pretty clear from the body language at the estimates hearing that a lot of people are very unhappy about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has got to be pointed out to this minister that it is not just a matter of saying in the efficiency review that we have improved the administration, have made it more efficient, by implying that bureaucrats have been moved out of Russell or something. What this minister has done is to reduce the fighting force of the Australian Defence Force to its lowest levels in numbers since the early 1960s. We now have the least full&hyphen;time soldiers since the early 1960s. Under this plan, in addition to the 5,000 troops who go under the DRP, the defence reform program, the government has cut more than 2,000 full&hyphen;time military positions in its two budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statement follows 18 months of uncoordinated decisions that have rocked morale, which I have already referred to. It is an effort to turn decisions into a plan. The actual goal, the strategic review, will be released later this year. I would have thought you would do it around the other way. You would have the strategic review first and, based on the strategic review, you would work out the restructuring to meet the objectives of the strategic review. Not this minister: he has gone about it the other way. It is just like in my own portfolio area, where Senator Alston cut $55 million from the ABC and said, `Let us have a review of the operations and functions of the ABC.' This government always does it round that way: cut the administration, cut the capability first, then have a strategic review to justify what you have done in the cuts. That is why this minister has really got it back to front.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without wanting to be too parochial about this, taking my own state of South Australia, we have already announced as an opposition that on re&hyphen;election to government we will commit to build a further two Collins class submarines, Nos 7 and 8.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no response from the government at all about the opposition's promise, on a strategic basis, to build two extra Collins class submarines. I must say that in his 18 months in the job the only interest the minister seems to have shown in South Australia in relation to the defence forces is to provide his wife with a helicopter to get from the golf course to the Edinburgh air show. That seems to be about the biggest effort we have had in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, of course, he was there opening the new DSTO buildings&mdash;a $50 million project. He forgot to mention that that was a decision committed by the previous Labor government by the then Defence Minister, Senator Robert Ray. It seemed to have completely escaped the attention of the minister that this was a commitment the former Labor government gave because we in government recognised the importance of the defence infrastructure on the industry side to the South Australian economy and to developing a self&hyphen;reliant defence force in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our 13 years in defence were about making a self&hyphen;reliant defence force, not something we would always buy off the shelf. We have improved the capacity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have always maintained that the defence portfolio is both the most complex and the most intellectually demanding of all portfolios in this parliament. Senator Schacht, with his total lack of understanding of it, has demonstrated that point beautifully this afternoon. He has not got the faintest concept of what is involved in the defence of this country and in providing for our national security. It is no wonder when you look at where Senator Schacht comes from, from a Labor Party which for 13 years ran down the defence vote from roughly 2.8 or 2.9 per cent of the GDP of this country to an effective level of about 1.8 per cent of GDP. They took it down to nearly 60 per cent of the outlays which the Department of Defence agreed were the minimal levels to maintain the capabilities we had when the Labor Party came into power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this government came into office in March last year, it inherited a grossly under&hyphen;funded and greatly run&hyphen;down Department of Defence. The proof of that can be seen in the lack of capabilities in the Australian Defence Force. In 1991, when the United Nations called for support from armed forces around the world in the Gulf War, what could Australia do? It could not commit one air unit other than transport units to combat. It could not commit one army or land force unit to combat on a modern battlefield, it was so run down. In the navy, all we could get were two frigates for patrolling duties after the immediate expenditure, the rushed expenditure, of $180 million to provide essential equipment. So much for the capability of the Australian Defence Force under the Labor government. By the time they left office in 1996, that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> capability had declined even further than it had in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the relevance of that, you say? The relevance of that is that, in today's international arena, national security has to be backed up by forces which are available at the present time. You need professional defence forces and you need a high level of capability. I am not saying that they must be at the highest level of capability, because that becomes disproportionately expensive, but you have to have a credible force, and that means having a force in being. It means having a credible air force, it means having a credible land component and it means having a credible naval force. The Labor Party left us with none of those three essential requirements for a defence force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, they left us with a grossly underfunded defence force and the problems of underfunding are enormously severe. A defence force is not created by bringing down a budget and throwing money at it. To assess and buy the equipment you need may well take 10 or 15 years with today's technology in defence. To train forces to use that technology effectively, to develop the doctrine for its use and train the personnel who can use that equipment in a coordinated way may well take another 10 to 15 years. So if you are serious about the national security of this or any other country then you do have to have an integrated and a continuous program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot, as the Labor Party did with their essential interest in pacifist activities and all the other things that are so important to the Labor Party, run down a defence force and then believe that overnight you can create some effective fighting units to give you the national security that you need. Those days disappeared really with the ending of the Second World War. Since the ending of the Second World War we have lived in an age where we are very dependent on our own activity and our own energy to provide our own national security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But not only did the Labor Party not provide the funding for this, they had gross inefficiencies. From opposition we told the Labor Party of the gross inefficiencies that they had&mdash;the huge, bloated officer corps in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7232"> Canberra. The Australian Defence Force has a ratio of officers to ORs that is higher&mdash;there are more officers to ORs&mdash;than any other defence force in the world. When the McIntosh review, the defence efficiency review which is the basis of this report, took place earlier this year the estimate was that $1 billion was being wasted annually by Labor administration practices. We are not talking about $1 billion in part of a budget that ran to hundreds of billions of dollars; we are talking about $1 billion out of a small budget of only $10 billion. The enormity of the inefficiency of the Labor management of defence beggars description. Most people cannot understand it. If you say to the average person on the street, `The Labor Party ran things so badly that they were throwing $1 billion away in the management of the Australian Defence Force,' people just do not understand what you are saying.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleagues to insist on the amendment. The government's move not to insist on the amendment does nothing more than assist the mates of the government. It does nothing to assist the battlers. After all, the battlers are the PAYE taxpayers and this move does nothing at all on the government's part to assist those people. As I say, purely and simply it assists their mates. What it does is give their mates access to a privilege which is not otherwise accessible to the battlers. To insist on this amendment makes good sense indeed because it cuts out a privilege which will be felt and experienced by only a few.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking to this matter yesterday, Senator Sherry, my colleague, pointed out that something like 97 per cent of small businesses have $1.3 million in business assets. I understand that is an ABS figure. If so, and if that is a correct figure, then one is really looking 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at the remaining three per cent being affected by the government's decision not to insist on the amendment that this Senate has passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one looks at those who would fall in that three per cent above the $1.3 million, there would be a number who would even fall outside the government's own test of $5 million in business assets. So what we are really talking about in this whole debate is those who lie between the $1.3 million in business assets and those with less than $5 million. Even under the government's own stricture, those people outside the $5 million bracket would have been excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When one takes into consideration which businesses those might be, we are indeed looking at a very small group of businesses that would get the direct benefit if the government's motion not to insist on this Senate amendment were to succeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In effect, this is doing nothing more than satisfying the needs of a few mates and a few privileged people&mdash;people who undoubtedly, in their own right, have personal wealth. They may well have their yachts, their Ferraris, their artworks, their antiques and their holiday houses as personal assets on the side, and they may be very well&hyphen;heeled indeed to meet the rigours of the economic environment in which we live today. These people are not really in need of any additional privilege; they have privilege to start off with. This is nothing more than a boost to the personal wealth of a group of business people that lie within that $1.3 to $5 million bracket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are insisting on, by taking into account of the personal assets of these people, is that we will limit the access of some people to a free ride on the back of the PAYE taxpayer. In insisting on the Senate amendment, we are not talking about the Newcastle workers, those people who will find themselves without jobs or those people who will have to use their superannuation, if they are over 55, before accessing social security. Those people have no nest egg for themselves. We are not talking about them in this particular move by the government not to insist on the Senate amendment. We are talking about a select group of wealthy people who really do not need a leg up to have a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7234"> comfortable retirement. They are more than adequately catered for as it is now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The average battler retiring on superannuation will have in the order of $100,000 to $200,000 maximum on which to retire. That, by many standards, is not an overwhelmingly great amount of money but nonetheless they are forced and caused to struggle to survive and plan their retirement around those amounts of money. And yet here we have a windfall which will fall to those people in that select range where they will stand to benefit to the tune of almost half a million dollars&mdash;give or take the tax that might come out of it. Of course, this benefit is not, under any circumstances, available to the PAYE taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we see a group of people being very nicely advantaged by this move by the government. If the government initiative removes a tax responsibility from the rich, then all it does is transfer the responsibility to the poor. What we must see in this case is that, if a select, wealthy group of people are going to benefit by what is in effect a tax benefit to them, then someone has to pay&mdash;and I would put to you that the people who will pay the most are the poor people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact in my mind remains that the benefit, whilst it will be for a few, will be for a very select few. It will be for those who are well&hyphen;heeled; it will not be for the battler. The retirement benefit that this will confer upon those people is a retirement benefit that is well and truly beyond the reach or even the dream of the average worker. It is not hard work that is being rewarded; it is purely and simply something that is giving a select group of people an even better retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, the Senate must insist on the amendment for the issue of equity and justice not only to be seen to prevail but to actually prevail in our society. I seek that the Senate insist on the amendment that has been passed by this Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to vote for the motion that has been put forward by the government. I do understand some of the matters that the government has been raising and these have given me some considerable concern since the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> last time this matter was discussed. The question that I think we all ought to think about&mdash;including the opposition&mdash;is what effect the carriage of the amendment will have on possible employment, and what are the compliance costs of this amendment which the government is asking not be insisted upon. Those are the questions that have been exercising my mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been a number of suggestions that the compliance costs will be quite considerable because the effect of the opposition's amendment would be to include in the $5 million threshold criteria used to determine whether a taxpayer qualifies for the CGT retirement exemption personal assets which may appreciate in value or which may have a resale value of more than $5,000. So the question is whether, under a number of situations&mdash;and forget the three per cent&mdash;a number of the 97 per cent will have to undergo considerable compliance costs. As I understand it&mdash;and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Ian Campbell) might correct me if I am wrong&mdash;it is a question of valuing personal assets which may appreciate in value or which may have a resale value of more than $5,000. That seems to me to be quite a considerable compliance cost for very little benefit to revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure, either&mdash;and the parliamentary secretary may examine this&mdash;whether small businesses in general are going to be benefited. Obviously, if there is the ability to roll over funds&mdash;and, as I understand it, we are only talking about $500,000 that can actually be rolled over, and, again, the parliamentary secretary may correct me&mdash;then obviously the buyer of the small business would most likely get a better deal. I am not sure whether that would always be the case, but I would have thought it would be quite probable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had a look at what was said last night. The minister indicated certain things about that particular test, which I will not canvass again here. But the other matter that concerns me is the overall effect on small businesses and the fact that the government went to the election on this particular matter. I have said this before today: I am not here to give a rubber&hyphen;stamp&mdash;if it comes down to me 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7235"> to do so, and it does not always do so&mdash;to anything the government might have said somewhere before the last election which it claims is an election undertaking and therefore has the mandate to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know what they did precisely with the workplace relations legislation, including the unfair dismissal proposals, but I do not think the government would expect me, nor do I think anybody would expect me or anybody else&mdash;apart from, presumably, the government&mdash;to hold the flag up in support of that policy simply on the basis that it was mentioned by the government before the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened is that the government has made a statement on small business in response to the report of the House of Representatives committee on small business. You can see what can occur. If the Senate does insist upon the amendments, I suppose that gives the government the opportunity to accuse the Senate of being anti-small business. I do not suggest, through you, Madam Chair, that Senator Ian Campbell would do that. That is probably the last thing on his mind. Nevertheless, it is a matter that has crossed my mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I am often persuaded by what Senator Sherry says on these matters. He certainly appears to be across his portfolio, and I congratulate him on that. But I wonder whether this is an area that we ought to insist upon here and now. The whole concept of whether the CGT is operating as it was intended to operate is a very important question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is evidence in the United States at the moment that there is increasing debate on tax reform. It is cutting the CGT as a means of stimulating investment and thus employment. I know a number of the United States economic policies have not worked in regard to unemployment. I raise the question: should we hold our preconceived ideas about the value of the CGT or should we have another look at that to see how much it might be a disincentive to the employment of workers? We will obviously have quite a debate on that over the next 12 to 18 months.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can also understand the point&mdash;and I am not sure whether the government did raise the point, but I will raise it&mdash;that this amendment, if incorporated into the legislation, would be difficult to enforce. It could be readily avoided by those people keeping their assets in other entities or outside the country; and that sort of activity, which does not do the Australian economy much good, would be encouraged. Although I have said that, I am not prepared to vote for the motion that has been moved by the government. I will listen to what else is said in this debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that you have said that you will not support the motion, but I seek to give you answers to the questions. You say that you have seen the comments that I made last night; I did try to keep them brief, but I am happy to expand in terms of the compliance costs. We do see, particularly where you bring in a differential regime between the rollover relief on the sale of a business and the relief we are providing for retirement, that you create compliance problems. You create problems by having two different systems applying to the capital gains tax treatment of small businesses. We would like those two thresholds to be in line with each other to reduce confusion and cost, particularly to small business, in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine, you quite rightly draw attention to the fact that the provisions of the amendment, which we are hoping that the Senate will not insist upon, do place a burden&mdash;and we regard it as an onerous burden&mdash;upon small business people in relation to those people having to identify, firstly, which assets may appreciate. They have to make a judgment as to which assets may appreciate. I guess that, in these days of inflation that I have spent most of my adult 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7236"> life in, most things seem to appreciate. But in times of very low inflation, that may be a much harder judgment to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the Senate is also asking that small businessmen and women make a judgment in relation to whether or not an item would have a resale value of more than $5,000 and make predictions as to what will happen in the future. We regard that as something that is onerous and which will add to compliance costs to small business people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We raised the issue of a taxpayer who makes an incorrect prediction and does not include an asset in a threshold test when it should have been. There are technical problems that Senator Harradine alluded to as well. There is no way of determining, either in the Income Tax Assessment Act or as a subject of this regulation, what a resale value is. I understand that there is no definition of resale value in the legislation either. Certainly, the compliance costs to small business people would be increased where professional advice and valuations are required, and a prudent small business person would be forced by this, in some cases, to identify what should be brought in and what should be taken out, bearing in mind the two criteria. We do see those as problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine, you raised a question in relation to whether or not the buyer&mdash;if I have the gist of it&mdash;may end up getting a better deal as a result of this measure. In other words, the seller may pass on some of the benefit to the buyer in terms of a higher price. From my experience of watching small businesses change hands and emerge and grow in value, I suspect that the buyer of the business would be looking at the fundamentals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a broad generalisation, but I would imagine if you or I were looking at a small business, I guess in the way that our old friend ex&hyphen;Senator Robert Bell did when he was buying that lovely little delicatessen at Battery Point&mdash;gee, I long for the days when Robert was around here; he is probably tuned in right now; `g'day Robert, how are you going?'&mdash;you would look at the fundamentals of the business. You would look at the growth potential of the business. You would look at 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the stock you were dealing with, you would look back over the monthly figures and you would look at the potential. Clearly, it would be wrong to suggest that some sort of tax benefit to the seller of the business would not enter the mind of the seller of the business when they sought to make an assessment as to what price they would accept. I think it would be silly to deny that that could happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To bring this to a conclusion, the government's motivation here is that we believe that small business can be a big job generator. As I said last night, small business people often tend to put an enormous amount of their own savings into their business. The sale of their business is regarded by many Australians who run small businesses as being their form of superannuation. All of us have had experience of those sort of people who work extremely long hours. They get their families involved and they commit themselves to building up a small business in the hope that, when they retire, the gain they make on that investment will be their nest egg. This government has always made it quite clear that we regard that as a very important foundation of Australia's society, particularly our free enterprise sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that we need to build up small business by encouraging the people who make that sort of commitment and who take enormous risks. They take much bigger risks than those of us who have a weekly or monthly income with the tax instalments deducted. They risk the vagaries of the marketplace every day. People like Robert Bell do not know whether somebody is going to come in and buy a bottle of milk. I am not being facetious when I say that. A small business person who runs a newsagency or a delicatessen does not know when they open their doors in the morning whether someone is going to buy their milk, bread or newspaper from such a small business. Although many of us have risks to our income stream, small business people have that risk every day. We believe that people who take those risks do seek reward. They also have the potential to employ many people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government, as I said last night, is pro small business. We are pro individuals taking a risk. We think that this is a measure that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7237"> can give them reward for that risk and for that effort, with the hope that they will expand their businesses and create employment. For many small business people, the capital gains tax can provide a disincentive for taking those sorts of risks and for putting their savings and their lifetime's work into a small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate did oppose a measure to cut the value of this benefit. That was supported, as I recall, by the Democrats, the Australian Labor Party and the Greens. I do not think Senator Harradine supported them in this, as I recall. I easily get these things wrong; I often do. The Labor Party's agenda here was not only to reduce the threshold, which this amendment, if insisted upon, would try to do, but they also voted for an amendment that would have slashed the value of it in half. I think that is the take&hyphen;out of this for small business people when they look at the behaviour of the Australian Labor Party, in particular, in relation to this entire bill. They sought to slash the benefit in half.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do hope that I have answered the questions that Senator Harradine has raised. I maintain my hope that the Senate will support my motion, which is to not insist upon its amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

There were a number of issues that Senator Harradine raised. I am aware that he has listened to the debate and considered this issue thoroughly over the last few weeks. There is a general concept of assistance to small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor does not have a problem with general assistance to small business, either with respect to the sale of the small business&mdash;we have dealt with the issue of capital gains tax on the sale of a business in previous legislation&mdash;or superannuation retirement income on the sale of that small business. We do not have a problem with the concept of providing an incentive as an encouragement to small business to develop the growth of their business. We do not have a problem with that encouragement creating jobs. Very clearly, we agree with that thrust in policy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we do not agree with is open-ended assistance that will be going to a very small number of wealthy businesses. We have made the point time and again that 97 per cent of small businesses in this country have business assets of less than $1.3 million. Presumably, even if the 97 per cent of small businesses that have business assets of less than $1.3 million are personally wealthy and have wealth of $1 million, $2 million, $3 million or even $3.7 million, excluding $5,000 worth of personal use assets, they will receive a benefit from this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is effectively asking for open-ended assistance to small businesses when they sell their small business, however they choose to dispose of it on retirement. The money has to be made up from somewhere; that exemption will come from other taxpayers. It must do. Whilst we are in favour of rewarding small business in a number of quite vital areas&mdash;this is a vital area&mdash;an open-ended favour that will allow very wealthy small businesses to take advantage of this provision will have to be paid for by everyone else in the community paying taxes. I am not just talking about PAYE taxpayers but many small businesses who pay their tax in the normal commercial way. Effectively, they are going to be assisting to subsidise the very top end of town wealthy small businesses. As I have said, there is a very small number of small businesses that would be excluded by the amendment currently being considered by the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to deal with the issue of costs to small businesses. As I understand it, most people in small business, indeed most people in the community, have insurance valuations other than for small items such as personal use assets, although usually you complete an insurance form listing your personal use assets such as your clothing and matters of that type. I do not think most people's individual items of furniture would exceed $5,000. They probably would if they were antiques, but I do not think the vast majority of small businesses, which are facing a very difficult commercial environment at the moment, would have that many antiques in their personal asset portfolio. </PARA>

Certainly in my experience there are not too many small business people with significant assets of antiques. We have used the $5,000 because apparently that is the figure provided for in the personal use assets CGT legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will get back to this point about insurance. I think any small business operator would have insurance cover. They would be very foolish if they did not. I am sure the vast majority of people would have insurance on their personal assets and would be familiar with the procedures you go through in respect of insurance on personal assets&mdash;whether it is their house, motor vehicle, second car, yacht, holiday home or whatever it may be that would be valued at more than $5,000. If you add all that up and it comes to more than $5 million, and depending on the value of your business, you do not get this tax advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not see the compliance cost as being a major issue, particularly given this government's approach. I am just reflecting on the superannuation tax issue. We are continually assured by the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, that the government does not want to add to compliance costs for small business in that area. Yet that is not what we read daily. Senator Kemp is fond of saying that I am a doom and gloom merchant on the super tax issue, but I can go only on the evidence that I receive constantly from accounting firms that are concerned about what must be one of the most cumbersome collection methods for any tax measure we have in this country&mdash;the superannuation tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I find quite interesting and at times perplexing about this government's approach is that the government says to small businesses&mdash;many small businesses have a superannuation fund&mdash;with more than $70,000 a year as income, `We are going to crack down on these higher income earners. We are going to make the system fairer.' Many of these people are small business. Yet, in contrast to this measure&mdash; </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we are getting to it on Thursday, Senator Harradine. On the one hand, the government argues that it is cracking down on tax minimisation for high income earners in the area of superannuation. Much of the crackdown affects small business. On the other hand, in respect of CGT it argues that you should give a much greater benefit to the higher wealth small businesses. There seems to be a contradiction in the government's philosophical approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have debated this issue long and hard. We have to weigh up the cost of open-ended tax exemptions. As I have said, we do not believe the costs to small business, given the size of the tax break, are unreasonable. There is the potential for tax evasion. Whatever the government comes up with in the context of its tax reform package&mdash;whenever that is announced&mdash;it will be interesting to see what they consider here. Obviously I will be taking a close interest in what Labor does in this area over the next year, in the lead-up to the election, whenever that may be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government continues to say that it is defending the interests of the small business battlers. In this provision, nothing could be further from the truth. As I have said time and time again, 97 per cent of small business people have business assets of $1.3 million or less. So the overwhelming bulk of small businesses are not going to be affected by this Senate amendment. It has the potential to provide a huge windfall tax break for those people with more than $5 million in net assets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that I do not have a lot of sympathy for those small businesses which have art collections, antique collections and yachts, in the sense that they should get a further tax break. I do not believe that that is an appropriately targeted measure in what is difficult economic circumstances for the vast majority of Australians and the vast majority of small businesses who will end up having to pay for this particular measure. I hope the Senate insists on the amendment that we passed previously.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the report of the committee be adopted.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I want to put on the record a couple of matters of importance which relate to this legislation. Firstly, the provisions which relate particularly to prospectors&mdash;that is, the 23PA provisions&mdash;have clearly been the matter of some controversy, particularly in Western Australia. I note today that the member for Perth, Mr Stephen Smith, has made a statement in relation to the way WA Liberal senators have voted on these matters, particularly, to quote Mr Smith, in relation to a technical amendment to remove&mdash;as Senator Cook's so-called third amendment would do&mdash;the requirement that you be a bona fide prospector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would just set the record straight because, to be kind about it, Mr Smith seems to be confused as to the government's action in relation to this matter. The government accepted Senator Cook's third amendment. Senator Cook, as he admitted last night in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7240"> debate, had moved that amendment only to the 1936 act; he failed to move it to the 1997 act. The government suggested to Senator Cook at the time that he do that, but he decided not to take any action. Senator Cook did seek to take action last night and was defeated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the fact of the matter is that the government in the House of Representatives, and again here in the Senate, agreed to accept Senator Cook's amendment. We cannot fix up the problems that either Mr Smith or Senator Cook would make in their drafting or preparation for amendments to bills. But we did accept that amendment, and I think Mr Smith should at least be forthright, frank and honest when he deals with these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Smith has said that I have led the charge against the prospectors in Western Australia on these matters. Nothing, again, could be further from the truth. Indeed, I have been discussing these matters with prospectors since budget night, as, I am sure, all WA Liberal senators have done. As a result of the controversy surrounding this piece of legislation, I have held, I think, no less than four or five consultations with a range of prospectors in Western Australia, including the heads of their peak organisations, including a trip I did to Kalgoorlie a few weeks ago to speak to their representative in the goldfields.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of those discussions and discussions I have held with the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) and officials of the tax office since then, and because of concerns raised by prospectors and people who represent them, the government has agreed a number of matters which we think are of importance to prospectors in the longer term and which require attention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, we believe that, in the post&hyphen;August 2001 regime, prospectors could find themselves faced with the same problem faced by people like farmers and, in particular, authors, artists and sports people, who receive abnormal flows of income, and that they could benefit from income averaging. A prospector, if he or she was lucky, may well find a prospective tenement that they were able to sell for a significant amount of money from time to time and receive a sale&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not be very long, Senator Faulkner; I know that you care about how long we take with the passing of legislation through the Senate. I am cognisant of that, and I will be as quick as I possibly can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government commits that it will look at making available to prospectors the income averaging provision that apply to people such as authors, artists, and sports men and women who receive similar abnormal income flows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prospectors and those who represent them have raised a taxation problem in relation to the taxation of shares that are often received by prospectors when they sell a tenement. As the law stands at the moment, the tax is assessed on the value of the shares when they are received by the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But most shares on the sale of a prospect are held in escrow; that means that the person who receives the shares is unable to sell them often for periods of two or three years. Quite often at the end of that period, the shares may possibly be worth a small fraction of what they were worth when the prospector received them. The government is committed to look at the treatment of shares that are received by prospectors and held in escrow in relation to the taxation treatment of those, particularly the matter of whether they should be assessed when they are received or when they are capable of being dealt with by the prospector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, another matter which has come to the government's attention only most recently is the fact that there may well be some prospectors who did not hold formal title to tenements on the night of the budget announcement, and that gaining formal title to those tenements could have been delayed because of the requirements of the Native Title Act. The government has, and I have personally, initiated measures to look at how many prospectors may be affected in this way in Western Australia. Also, I have already made contact with the Minister for Mines in Western Australia in regard to this matter. The government is going to actively look at whether that problem which may affect those people in that way can be alleviated.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7241">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I put on the record these commitments of the government to assist prospectors. We believe that they are all matters that are of genuine concern to prospectors, and the government is prepared to have a very good look at them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Yet, on the other hand, it was the same Prime Minister, along with the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey), who on 16 April 1996 actually requested that the National Commission of Audit investigate and consider the issue of benchmarking the level of the aged pension against 25 per cent of average weekly earnings&mdash;not of male total average weekly earnings but of average weekly earnings. In particular, they asked the National Commission of Audit to investigate the appropriateness of the current benchmark being expressed in terms of average weekly earnings for males.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You see, mucking around with the pension benchmark would have a devastating impact on pensioners. The NCA report recommended changing the benchmark for male total average weekly earnings to a different measure of weekly earnings. The options presented were to make savings by measuring weekly earnings by all persons instead of males, or median instead of average weekly earnings. If the government were to break its commitment and follow the advice of the National Commission of Audit, it would result in a reduction in payments to pensioners who would lose around $15 a week if the median weekly earnings benchmark were used or, even more, around $27 a week if the all persons average weekly earnings benchmark were used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This recommendation of the National Commission of Audit obviously caused enormous concern in the Australian community. I acknowledge&mdash;I try to be generous to the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman&mdash;that the minister was quick to back away from the National Commission of Audit's findings. She put out a press release which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has ruled out fixing pensions by any different formula. The Government maintains its commitment to pensions being determined at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7242">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However, it is the view of the opposition and it is certainly now the view of the community more broadly that the commitments that this government gives or that any of the ministers of the government give are worth very little. Look at the way the government abolished the Commonwealth dental health scheme&mdash;that was another commitment that the government had given earlier on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was my view that, after the referral to the National Commission of Audit, we just could not trust Mr Howard or Senator Newman on this particular issue. If the recommendation of the National Commission of Audit were to be accepted by the government, it would effectively take millions and millions of dollars out of the pockets of pensioners. Put simply: I do not trust Mr Howard; I do not trust Senator Newman; and I certainly do not trust the Howard government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> We need to ensure that the current benchmark that Labor has been committed to, literally for generations, is secure&mdash;secure from the government's lack of commitment to pensioners and secure from the government's penchant for breaking its election commitments. This is the government that just does not appear to be able to uphold the promises that it has made. The way that we in the Labor Party saw fit to ensure that this benchmark was secure was to introduce benefits to the legislation I was speaking about yesterday&mdash;the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures Bill) 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to ask ourselves: if the government were really committed to maintaining the benchmark and enshrining it in legislation, why have they given it an expiry date? Why have they whacked a five&hyphen;year sunset clause into this bill? The answer is that, really, they are not committed. We will not accept this sunset clause. We will not accept Mr Howard's and Senator Newman's escape clause in this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only have they imposed an expiry date in the bill but they have also given this legislation very narrow parameters. The legislation deals only with pensions, leaving allowances vulnerable to the government's slash and burn policies. Under Labor we ensured that the benchmark increases flowed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on to most allowances. This government's legislation does not ensure that the benchmark increases will flow on to hundreds of thousands of people on allowances, breaking the longstanding nexus between pensions and allowances, further widening the gap between rates of payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another flaw in the government's legislation is that the adjustment is retrospective. That is, when pensions are adjusted each March and September they will be aligned with 25 per cent of the latest available estimate for average weekly earnings. Those estimates will, by that time, be nearly six months old. This means that, with average earnings growing by 3&half; to four per cent a year and the CPI at about 1&frac34; per cent, at no time will the pension actually be at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. At each indexation point the pension will be around 24.6 per cent of male total average weekly earnings, declining over the next six months. In contrast, Labor kept the pension above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings at all times. As I said, it was about 25.3 per cent at the time Labor left office&mdash;a point that Senator Neal made most persuasively in her speech. This difference is significant; it is equivalent to $4 per week for a single pensioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We certainly support this legislation enshrining the benchmarking of pension rates at at least 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. It is actually our initiative. It is the initiative of the opposition. But we distance ourselves completely from the government's underhand approach to dealing with this by placing a sunset clause on the legislation and severing the link between pensions and allowances. Senator Neal will be moving amendments at a later stage to attempt to resolve those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend to the Senate the opposition's approach on this legislation and look forward to the Senate supporting the initiatives that Senator Neal will be progressing on our behalf.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We committed in our social security policy the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under a coalition government the pension benchmark of at least 25 per cent of average weekly earnings will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is, we undertook to retain the benchmark which the ALP had always talked about but had never put into place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have delivered on our commitment in two ways. We have provided for the funding of this commitment in the forward estimates&mdash;something which Labor never did. As well, we are proposing that the commitment be legislated for&mdash;something which Labor also failed to do. So I really find it a bit rich to sit here and hear these sanctimonious allegations, such as those made by Senator Neal yesterday, that somehow we had delayed this bill. It has come to be debated before the Senate in the normal course as one of many priorities we have in reforming the mess left to us by the ALP. Many bills have come before the Senate. This has taken its place in that queue. We have not held it back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's hypocrisy is just mammoth. We introduced this legislation within one year of coming into office. On the other hand, the current opposition, Labor, first started talking about this issue in 1969. It was Gough Whitlam. He promised it. But they have had 16 years in government since then to actually put it into legislation, to lock in the ongoing benchmarking. Where is that legislation on the statute books? It is not there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am amused to hear Senator Faulkner say that this is Labor's initiative. Perhaps he has not realised&mdash;perhaps he fell asleep like Rip Van Winkle&mdash;that they are out of government now. This is the government's initiative. They had plenty of time over 16 years to introduce it. Explain why you did not. We have really done more in 18 months than you did in 16 years of government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am drawn to answer the question put by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) about the previous government not having included within legislation the requirement that pensions and allowances be kept at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. I suppose it comes down very much to whether there was really ever a threat under the previous Labor government that this would not occur and whether there really is a threat under this particular government. It is my view that the requirement probably would have been most secure with legislation, but no&hyphen;one ever believed that Labor would not set it at 25 per cent. There was no threat; there was no concern in the community; and there was a general understanding that, under Labor, this procedure would continue and we would never step back from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other than that, there is certainly a very strong concern in the community that, except for a promise and legislation being put to ensure the pensions are retained at 25 per cent, this government will take the first and earliest opportunity to step back from that promise and will continue in all ways to try to do so. In saying that, I would like to ask the minister to answer the question that I put in my speech during the second reading debate yesterday: if the government is so committed to retaining pensions at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings, why has a five&hyphen;year sunset clause been put into this legislation?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is quite an important issue, and it is not that this legislation, as has been portrayed by sceptics in the Labor Party, somehow shows a lesser commitment on the part of the government. Senator Neal, I do not believe that you will win the next election and the one after that either, but we do live in a democracy and, if the people of Australia 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7244"> decided that you were to be the next government, you would be faced with being the government of the day when this sunset clause came up. You could be, but I think it is most unlikely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments apply only for a period of five years ending on 21 September 2002. That will give the parliament of the day the opportunity to review the provisions as to how the system has been implemented to ensure that the fiscal dollars are being appropriately targeted. It will be up to parliament at that time to again decide whether this legislative provision is appropriate, and surely that is a responsible and a reasonable approach for any government concerned with proper financial management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not saying it should come to an end. I would think it would be most unlikely that the parliament of the day would want to change it&mdash;I would imagine it would have to be in extraordinary circumstances. But the budget cost of fulfilling the AWE commitment may change markedly in the future if there is a divergence, for example, in movements in the AWE and the CPI figures. The sunset clause ensures that in five years the government of the day&mdash;your side or ours&mdash;will review the commitment to ensure that it is the best method of maintaining pensions at a rate that will preserve the social security safety net. There may in fact be a better method. It would be improper to make an indefinite budget commitment without reviewing the commitment at a later date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the forward estimates, we think we are doing well to try to give an indication of what the expenditure will be in four years. To make a commitment for future governments more than five years out is surely presumptuous of this generation at the very least. So giving the opportunity to have a review at a later date does mean that all proper considerations can be taken into account. I think one could say fairly that the sunset clause is in line with the policy that the community should not be locked into expenditures that may not accord with their priorities at that particular time and which at some point might prove to be unsustainable.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is not a matter of a lack of commitment&mdash;it is essentially an issue of financial responsibility, and I urge you to think about that. I remember Senator Ray standing on this side saying quite often that what goes up, comes down&mdash;it is a government one day and another time it is in opposition. Some day it might be a Labor government that is looking to try to deal with this issue of financial responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The measure does not in any way diminish our government's commitment to providing an adequate age pension. We would not have come forward with this measure and this legislation if we had not believed that, for our times, this was the right way to go. But we cannot make commitments so far down the track for future generations that this will stay the appropriate benchmark and that it will be the best way to maintain the social security safety net&mdash;that is for future governments to decide and future parliaments to determine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have clearly demonstrated our credentials by being the first government to set aside money in the budget forward estimates to pay for this commitment in future years. It would be a pity if that was not recognised in the debate as further evidence of our good purpose in this area. We have been prepared to bring forward legislation. We have been prepared to give a parliament and a government in five years the opportunity to review it, but we have also provided in the forward estimates for the funds to be available, which has never happened before.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say, Minister, it is not really a terribly convincing argument, this idea that if you do not have a sunset clause this parliament can somehow bind every other parliament ad infinitum. We are all experienced enough to be quite aware that at any time any government&mdash;this government or future governments&mdash;can introduce legislation and change the indexation of pensions. I salute your courage and your bravado in putting forward that argument, but I have to say that putting it forward really strains reality a little.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that putting in a five&hyphen;year sunset clause does not allow a government to review its position in the open and make a change of

If you really believe that in five years time you wish to remove the priorities and remove the indexation, my view is that whatever government is in power should do it up&hyphen;front. They should introduce legislation in the parliament and have it scrutinised in the same way as all other legislation is scrutinised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would hate to see in particular the pensioners in our community miss out on the indexation of their pensions. If you look at it in real terms, what it means is that their pension slips backwards in real terms if they do not have this indexation.

The Senate may recall that during my speech on the second reading last night I indicated that it had been the practice for some time&mdash;I think since the early 1990s or maybe even earlier&mdash;for the previous Labor government not only to index the pensions and veterans' payments but also to create a link between those and allowances, which are those payments that are generally paid to those people in the work force during the period that they are unemployed. These requests give effect to that desire on the part of the opposition. If we believe that pensioners are entitled to indexation, that they are entitled to those payments being maintained in real terms, certainly those people who are suffering the difficulties of unemployment are also entitled to have their allowances indexed and maintained in real terms.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Paragraph (c) of the ALP request No. 3 proposes to include single beneficiaries in the MTAWE bill. Paragraph (d) proposes to include partner beneficiaries in the bill. Request No. 8 provides that, if a single or a partnered pensioner has his or her pension increased under the provision of the MTAWE bill, a single or partnered beneficiary will

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government opposes these requests because the bipartisan commitment from all major parties was for a 25 per cent male total average weekly earnings benchmark for pensioners. I repeat: that was for pensioners&mdash;from both sides of the chamber. The election commitment given by the government was only for pensions. If we accept the need to correctly target taxpayers' funds, as the government does, then it is consistent that pensioners who on average rely on social security support for much longer periods of time are therefore the people most in need of having their base level pension protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The MTAWE increases flow through to family payments and senators should recognise that that is the case as a result of the legislative link that already exists between family payments and the married rate of pension. All family payment recipients will continue to have the base rate of that payment kept at or above 16.6 per cent of the combined pensioner couple married rate for under 13&hyphen;year&hyphen;old children and 21.6 per cent for those aged 13 to 15. Therefore these amendments will also provide protection for family payment recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All allowees will continue to have their allowances indexed for cost of living increases as measured by the CPI. This measure enshrines in legislation, in a sensible and in a fiscally responsible way, the government's commitment to maintain pensions at a minimum of 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. Under this legislation, pensions will be reassessed twice a year to ensure that they are increased in accordance with CPI increases or to 25 per cent of the male total average weekly earnings benchmark, whichever is the greater.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For all the posturing we have heard, as I said earlier, the ALP has never put money aside in the budget forward estimates for these matters. We are the first government ever to put money aside for future years to see that money is available to meet the commitment. Provision will continue to be included in the forward estimates to allow flow&hyphen;ons to those allowances that have pension type 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> characteristics, which is the way flow&hyphen;ons have occurred over the years; that is, for married allowees, single allowees with children and single allowees aged over 60 who have been on long&hyphen;term income support. Traditionally the flow&hyphen;ons from the pension have gone to those with pension type characteristics as I have described.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The difficulty for the government, overnight, has been that the requests were only provided by the opposition late yesterday. It has been difficult to provide an entirely satisfactory indication to the Senate of the cost and impact of the amendments, but it is estimated by my department that the cost of extending the flow&hyphen;on to single allowees without children would be $401 million over the years to 2001. I therefore urge the Senate to reject requests 3 and 8 provided by the opposition for all of those reasons that I have indicated.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe very strongly that they should be protected in this way. In an environment where those people who receive social security payments feel that they are constantly under attack, where the view by this government which is seen in Australia at large is that security payments are under threat and could be potentially cut back or reduced or that the benchmark could be reduced at any time, it is necessary and worth while for the benchmarking to be extended to allowees within a partnership. I feel it would certainly be unjust and inequitable for us not to include allowees within this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of those matters, I believe it is extremely important that we move requests Nos 3 and 8 to ensure that those comparable groups that are not included in this legislation are put in and that they have the guarantee of benchmarking as well. As I said earlier in this debate, it is probably more important now than it ever was when we were in government to ensure that this benchmarking is in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the time the Labor government was in power, the CPI growth was higher than the growth in wages. So it was probably not as important.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In relation to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal annual report 1996&hyphen;97, I think it would be useful to indicate that it probably makes a fairly telling pigeon pair with the Ombudsman's report of 1996&hyphen;97, which we did not get a chance to speak to in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason it is fairly important in conjunction with that report is that both give a very worrying picture of increased concerns and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7252"> complaints within the community about the level of service they are receiving. We found out from the Ombudsman's report that there is a growing number of people who are not getting access to good advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were circumstances where people were entitled to get some assistance with meeting the cost of luxuries&mdash;like daily bread on their table, and so on&mdash;and there had been mistakes in advice given to them. There was no accountability and no responsibility taken by the departments for providing proper advice, and people were often penalised for being given bad advice in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We find out from the Social Security Appeals Tribunal annual report that the number of lodgments of new applications for review is at an all&hyphen;time high of 13,817. This is 12.9 per cent up on the previous year, and 46.3 per cent up over a period of two years. When the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) comes into this chamber and we hear her talking about the tens of thousands of people who have been thrown off social security&mdash;the indication being that those people were cheats&mdash;you can only look at figures like 13,817 and wonder how many people are there in the community who actually know that they can access the Social Security Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What kind of information is available to those people who receive their letters&mdash;or who sometimes do not receive their letters because they have been sent to the wrong address and they get their social security cut off anyway&mdash;and find that they have no means of support, who do not know that they have rights to appeal and who do not know that there is something they can do if they have no means of surviving?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know, and there is clear evidence, that agencies out in the community&mdash;the church groups and so on&mdash;are desperately short of funds to try to make up emergency care for those people upon whom the system is turning its back. The indications are that appeals against the Department of Social Security decisions fell as a proportion of total appeals but that they rose by 10.3 per cent in numerical terms, and that most of the growth concerned decisions about family payment 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> allowance. We must remember that this was a centre point of the government's election proposals, but it seems that it is not working very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also seems that quite a large number of people who are putting in their appeals are actually succeeding. It would seem to give the lie to the indication that the Minister for Social Security would tend to give that the figures for those people who have been thrown off social security indicate that there are that many cheats in society. Unfortunately, when they are people on social security benefits, we do not give them the benefit of the doubt as we might perhaps do for people in the government who have problems with their travel claims. We do not give them the benefit of the doubt and we do not say, `Innocent until proven guilty.' What we say, what the minister is saying and what the department is now saying is, `Guilty until proven innocent.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people&mdash;obviously, a growing number of people&mdash;are trying to find out where they can possibly go to right some of the wrongs that may have been perpetuated against them. I should think that 13,817 new applications is probably the tip of the iceberg. It is a disgraceful indictment on the current way that discretion has presumably been removed from officers of various departments in terms of acting professionally and giving people the benefit of the doubt and finding out whether they are in the wrong rather than being officious enough to take people off their only means for support for such things as maybe not turning up for an interview they did not know they were supposed to be at or a response to a letter which was sent to an address where they were no longer living. It might be a case where there were rules that people were badly advised. Both the Ombudsman's report and the annual report of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal seem to indicate that there is a growing number of people who are constantly falling between the gaps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Maybe the next response from the government will further remove funding from the Ombudsman and the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Maybe if you take away the fund 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7253"> ing, these people might go away and you do not even have to hear about it in the parliament. That is the frightening scenario that I see in the future. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

It is a report that has been given to parliament so that parliament can see how this very important tribunal is operating. I am glad to see that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) has stayed in the chamber while this report is being spoken to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The function of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal is to exercise quality control over decisions that are made in several areas. It has performed a very good function over the years. Its operation has been successful. It enables people who could not go through the cost of a full&hyphen;scale judicial hearing to go to a body that provides a review of a decision of the Department of Social Security that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. Page 19 of the report assesses a test of those particular qualities. It would be useful reading for everybody in parliament&mdash;indeed, for anybody who wants to know that there are good and efficient bodies within the community doing some very good work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some very good people operating this tribunal. I notice that the national convenor is Julian Gardner, who has spent a long period of time doing work of a very socially useful nature. He was one of the founders of the Fitzroy Legal Service, for example, and he continues on in that vein. I notice that the senior member in Melbourne is Deirdre FitzGerald, a person who has given service to the law and public administration for years. As one looks through this report, one sees that it is a very useful body that has been established and kept going under governments of all colours. No doubt it will continue to give good service in this area of review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quick, cheap, efficient and fair review is essential for the proper operation of government. People within government make decisions that are, by and large and in general, correct because proportionally very few reviews are taken. For those decisions that do go wrong&mdash;the decisions that miscarry for a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> variety of reasons&mdash;it is important that we have a system that enables those to be corrected. There is now a long tradition of review of decisions by government and people within government that has gone on for well into a third decade. It started off in the 1970s, continued in the 1980s and has gone on into the 1990s. It is important that, when a report like this is made to parliament, we as senators speak to it because it is important to acknowledge, as I am sure the minister would acknowledge, the very good work that is done by people who staff these tribunals.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I rise to speak to the protocol with the International Atomic Energy Agency, done at Vienna on 23 September 1997. With that is the national interest analysis in relation to that treaty. I am rising because there are a number of issues involved with this treaty and Australia's response to it. It is a very complex issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the ongoing problems in relation to the International Atomic Energy Agency is that it is and continues to have a dual function&mdash;that is, it is an agency which has the function of providing safeguards but it is also an agency whose function is to promote the use of nuclear fuel. Basically, it is the seller and the policeman at the same time. There have been concerns about that for many years, and that does not seem to be changing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a concern in Australia that the money Australia puts into our own nuclear safeguards office is perhaps insufficient for the level of radiation related industry in Australia. I applaud and welcome any increased safeguards that are involved with this agreement. I suppose there are a few people who would not applaud any increases in safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder, though, whether this is real effectiveness or whether it is paper effective 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7254"> ness. A short while ago in the Senate, I rose to speak to the Australian Safeguard Office report on Lucas Heights and realised that after two lots of three months there were still major problems in the operation there, most of which we did not see because it did not come out in the agenda. But Australia still gets ticks on the paper internationally for being seen to operate an effective safeguard regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is active in the international arena in negotiations on such things as international atomic energy agreements. However, one wonders whether this is being used as an excuse for Australia to be involved in putting together a new reactor&mdash;if Australia needs it at all. Of course, there is a whole different issue about whether or not the science is anything more than mediocre, whether or not the net $2.5 million cost involved with ANSTO and Lucas Heights has been in any way rewarded to the Australian community and whether or not there are alternative ways, for instance, for accessing radioisotopes for medical purposes. The government has not seen fit to address those issues in any full way, except that the minister selectively quoted from a four year old Internet article to suggest that this is what the government has looked at in the last few years to find alternative methods of medical isotopes. Of course, that is not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have Australia vying, if you like, for a continued seat on international negotiations. The cost has been and will continue to be very expensive. The cost of being on that seat could end up being the cost of decommissioning our current reactor&mdash;it has been acknowledged as having problems and needing to be shut down over time&mdash;the cost of dealing with the waste forever, in any realistic sense, and also the cost of potentially putting together a new reactor in the future and then dealing with the waste and the other problems associated with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It remains to be seen that the paper achievements with such protocols will bear fruit. Signing the protocol should not be seen as Australia's response to greenhouse gas reductions. It is far from that. There are many other environmental and health problems associated with nuclear energy. I think it is a very 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expensive seat that Australia has had on the international table, and in the future we will have to think twice about whether spending $2.5 billion gives us any credibility on the international arena if at the same time we are continuing to promote the sale of uranium for other people's proliferation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter that I wish to raise on the adjournment debate tonight is the affiliation, so&hyphen;called, of the Armidale campus of the University of New England with the National Union of Students. My attention was drawn to this matter by an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 17 September, in which the President of the National Union of Students, Mr John Carey, boasted about this affiliation and the rise of support for the National Union of Students. He gratuitously pointed out that this was due to the personal style and comments of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, which had the effect of raising the NUS's profile and giving the organisation credibility. However, this evening I want to point out to the Senate that credibility is something that the National Union of Students does not enjoy in any shape or form.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To enable a referendum on affiliation to the National Union of Students to occur, a petition signed by at least 300 students is required. The student association, being aware that they would be unlikely to get 300 stu 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7255"> dents to sign such a petition, had a free barbecue for the day and signed up people as they came along for the barbecue&mdash;an old tactic employed by the left wing on student unions for ever and a day, it would seem. I know it occurred in my day, and I used to fight vociferously against it. Unfortunately, it would appear that 20 years later not much has changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have this petition of allegedly 300 students. The thing we have not been able to completely get a grasp on is how many of those signatories were in fact valid students. We do know that 390 signatures appeared on the petition, but the chief executive officer knocked out at least 75. We are not told whether he knocked out more to undermine that threshold of 300 signatures. Suffice it to say that that first apparent rort was then allowed to go to a referendum of the student body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those at the Armidale campus of the University of New England would be aware that there are many internal students, but even more external students. Those students who study on campus voted overwhelmingly against affiliation. However, external students voted overwhelmingly in favour of affiliation. You have to ask the question: what could be the possible difference? There is a very clear difference between the strategies that were employed. The students on campus were provided with a no case. Individual students organised to convince their fellow students on campus that it was not a good idea to join the National Union of Students, and that was overwhelmingly supported by their fellow students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why did the external students happen to have a different point of view? It is instructive to learn that in 1995 a similar affiliation attempt was defeated by the student body. Do you know the big mistake the students' association made? They sent out a yes case and a no case to the external students with their postal ballot. What a foolish thing to do; to send out both sides of the argument with a postal ballot!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, this is exposed in the minutes of the University of New England Armidale Students' Association special council meeting 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> held on 10 August 1997 at 8.00 p.m. by way of a teleconference. Tanya Barber and Joshua Walmsley moved a particular motion and certain comments were noted in the minutes. It is also instructive to note that Tanya Barber is a paid employee of the Australian Workers Union whilst also being on the student union association. I have no problem with that, but listen to the tricks that she gets up to. The minutes of that special council meeting state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tanya Barber outlined the experience of the 1995 NUS affiliation referendum, in which both a `Yes' and a `No' case were included with the ballot papers, and misinformation and confusion of the students with incorrect information about the affiliation had resulted.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The poor little dears! The students could not really make a decision for themselves when they were confronted with a yes and a no case. What did they decide? The minutes further state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The meeting felt that it was not the role of the ASA to distribute misleading information&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">in other words, the no case&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to the students, and that including an information sheet would be more appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let me refer to this NUS information sheet. It has NUS letterhead on it. It has the logo on it and it tells us: `NUS uncovered. Yes to NUS. NUS representing over 500,000 students'. That was the information sheet. Of course, it was a biased sheet in favour of the yes campaign. These people who promote student democracy and compulsory student unionism get their power and their manipulation by rorting the system, as I have just exposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The external students were only given the yes case under the guise of an information sheet and were denied their democratic right to hear the no case. I understand that they played the same game on campus when students turned up to a ballot box to vote. The ballot papers were handed out with this so-called information sheet, and the no case was not allowed to be handed out with the ballot paper. Despite that, on campus, where students were able to read the no case for themselves, they overwhelmingly rejected the National Union of Students.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7256">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where is the credibility of this National Union of Students that Mr Carey tries to claim and, undoubtedly, misled the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> into printing? What this campaign shows is that the NUS supporters were so scared of the success of the no case&mdash;and with good reason, because when the no case was presented to the students they overwhelmingly rejected NUS&mdash;they would not allow the other point of view to be put. As a result of that, they won the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the university council does not intervene in this issue, they will have absolutely and utterly abrogated their responsibilities as the governing university council, which is the body that enforces compulsory student unionism on this campus. If students do not join the union, they are denied their results. They are denied the right to study and an academic career. All the hot air that we have heard from people on the other side of the chamber about the right of people to gain a tertiary education is overlooked and forgotten when it comes to the question of compulsory student unionism, which is unfortunately a blot on our society and a requirement if you want a tertiary education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having highlighted those facts, the point that I wish to make is that a paid official of the Australian Workers Union was involved in this scam at the University of New England. The supporters of the National Union of Students were involved in this scam to win by a margin of about 100 votes. Why students should be forced to pay a compulsory levy to such an organisation is beyond me. Why the Australian Workers Union allows somebody to remain in their employ whilst their officials get up to the behaviour that I have just outlined in relation to Tanya Barber is beyond me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Possibly what is happening is that the big grown&hyphen;up trade union is teaching the little student unionists how to behave when they grow up and become trade unionists and then get catapulted into the federal parliament through their union affiliations. It creates a complete culture of rorting the democratic process. I call on the university council of the University of New England to investigate and invalidate this referendum. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak about a ceremony I attended last Sunday, 28 September&mdash;the National Day of Remembrance for those who have lost their lives to drugs, I was invited to attend this ceremony which was held at the Gold Coast in Queensland. It was a beautiful ceremony, attended by family and friends of loved ones and, I must admit, I was very pleased and honoured to be included. The reason I was there was twofold: one, because I wanted to be there; and, two, because I was asked to dedicate a newly planted tree, a bauhinia alba.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This tree symbolises the lives of those who have died from drug use. In spring the tree is covered with leaves and beautiful blossoms, symbolising the beautiful and special person we remember so well. In winter the tree stands bare revealing thorny branches, signifying how the person is thought of, through ignorance and misunderstanding, by many in our community. This tree will grow in a place of beauty near the sea and will provide testimony to families who have lost loved ones that they have support from others in the community. The presence of the tree will also serve as a reminder to the community that those who have died have a right to be remembered with love and dignity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I want to pay tribute to those people who helped make this service possible. The ceremony was organised by the Family and Friends for Drug Law Reform. The Master of Ceremonies was Rohan Wenn, who conducted the proceedings with dignity and compassion. Speeches were made by parents Pat Assheton and David Cuthbert. Also a message was sent by the Mayor of the Gold Coast City Council, Gary Baildon, who could not be there. Officiating in his place was Councillor Lex Bell, about whom I will speak later. The site was blessed by Father Joseph Thottankara. As I have said, I was extremely honoured to be asked to participate in this ceremony and, as you can imagine, Madam Acting Deputy President, it was an extremely emotional occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to pay tribute to a band called Fire Sign, who performed music and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7257"> songs containing messages of the dangers of drugs. They were a very young band, and they were excellent. I would also like to pay tribute to a young woman by the name of Jamie Lee Wilson. She sang a song called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tears of Ice</EMPHASIS>, written by a mother who had lost her son to drugs, and also a song she had written herself in memory of her dear friend Lisa, who also had lost her life to drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly want to place on record my congratulations to the Gold Coast City Council who have thrown their support behind those of us in this country who believe in drug law reform. By doing so, they have proved to be not only progressive but also exceptionally aware of what is a growing problem not only on the Gold Coast but also in our community at large throughout Australia. They have also shown themselves to be a council that is not afraid of trying to do something about this problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Gold Coast City Council placed a monument and plaque in a small park on the very busy Esplanade at Surfers Paradise, overlooking the ocean. This plaque was unveiled by former Mayor, Councillor Lex Bell. Councillor Bell said that this place would become a `focal point for those who grieve'. This, of course, is what will happen. But for some of us, like me, whose son's ashes were scattered at sea, it will indeed become a special place. I would like to thank those of the council for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ceremony gave those of us who attended a chance to offer each other support and understanding, and to demonstrate that families are not alone in their struggle to come to terms with drug related deaths. When a person dies from drug problems, it is the families who are left to mourn and suffer. Sunday's ceremony, with its emphasis on new life, showed those families and friends present that there is support, sympathy and solidarity both within this assembly and in the general community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This gathering must also be an example to those in authority that the present treatments and programs are not working. Each year there are over 500 opiate related deaths. This is grossly unsatisfactory in our community. I urge all governments to have a profound look 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> at the tragedy each one of these deaths causes, let alone in numbers of such magnitude&mdash;and, more importantly, to look at the reasons why.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said on the day, I hope that this ceremony and those held in the future will help the community realise the plight of families who have lost loved ones, and will be able to break down traditional stereotypes and prejudices that have long been associated with drug use. An educated community is a caring and compassionate community, and I hope that this and other ceremonies throughout the country will help to take us a further step towards this goal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I once again applaud the Gold Coast City Council for their support and, before I finish, I would like to publicly apologise to my friend Councillor Lex Bell. On the day I was so concerned about getting through my dedication speech without crying that I quite forgot my manners and did not acknowledge Councillor Bell. For that I apologise&mdash;and, of course, I did not achieve my aim.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7257"><TITLE>Child Care</TITLE>

The document contains 22 sections, 50 pages of information for current and prospective child-care providers. In introducing the kit, the current Minister for Family Services, Mrs Moylan, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It outlines a national planning strategy which builds on existing partnerships with state and local governments and improves the quality of information available to existing and potential investors in child care.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We read of the minister's responsibility to provide support for families who need access to quality care and of partnerships between government and the child&hyphen;care industry.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7258">
<PARA STYLE="Para">We even read in this document:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . achieving quality outcomes for children using long day care centres is underpinned by a comprehensive quality improvement and accreditation system.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is silence at the moment from the opposite benches, but I recall the period some two years ago when accreditation was very much an issue dear to the hearts of some coalition senators. If I recall correctly, Senator McGauran had particular concerns about Christmas carols. Those opposite are silent now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have already said, this impressive package contains 22 sections, 50 pages detailing all sorts of information for potential child&hyphen;care providers. However, what the minister does not say in her foreword is that the entire document is based on legislative changes proposed by the government in the  Child Care Payments Bill 1997  that is not even before the Senate yet. The bill has been referred to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee with a report back date of 27 October, but the document is out there in the community. The legislation proposes to put in place administrative changes to operate from 1 January 1998. I will get to that point later, because it really is putting the cart before the horse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have a government that has made cuts to child care of over $800 million in the last two budgets, increasing the cost of child care and encouraging the growth of informal care, yet it can squander taxpayers' money with the production of this type of propaganda that is not even current&mdash;again, putting the cart before the horse. If we look at section six of the package, it starts off with this disclaimer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full details of the new arrangements outlined here will be contained in legislation which is expected to be effective from 1 January 1998, but has not yet been passed by parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Well, that is a half truth. The bill has not even been introduced into the Senate at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look more clearly at section six, which is entitled `Targeting areas of need'. First, we start with the disclaimer. Then we have an introduction, a background section 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and a section entitled `Longer term outlook'. The background section introduces an issue very dear to me&mdash;child-care planning. Child&hyphen;care planning is very important in the area in which I reside because it has the largest number of children under the age of five in Australia. This background section states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth funding for new community sponsored long day care centres, family day care and outside school hours care services is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">as we all know&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">limited to the amounts provided through the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the government might claim it has made some changes which address some issues of equity in relation to child-care services, it has not redirected that money into the industry; it has just cut services. It further states what we all know: New places are established in the high need areas identified through a needs based planning process.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government has been talking about this process for some time. That is why I was particularly keen to have a look at this document to see what was part of the plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let us look at the high need areas identified through a needs based planning process. This is mentioned in the section entitled `Longer term outlook'. There is a list of the government's objectives in establishing a new national planning system. They include: equity for families; a focus on meeting gaps; targeting of assistance to families; and certainty for parents. There are the strategies to encourage new services to areas of greatest need: providing information, advertising demand and supply information, and influencing new investors to locate in areas of need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we finally get to the point that I might have been looking for under the heading `Main elements of the new planning system'. This point talks about better supply and demand information and then states that an Australia&hyphen;wide assessment of areas of need for child care should be undertaken by October 1997. I hope that assessment is undertaken by October 1997 and that something will come out of a document such as this, which will actually tell the industry what they want to do and what investments they want to make for 1998 and 1999. But it is not leaving the industry with much time.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7259">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Planning to succeed in child care</EMPHASIS>, is certainly not providing the industry with the information that they need. It says that information on high needs areas will be made available through this kit&mdash;but the kit is already out there&mdash;and through an Internet site. Within the limits, and they seem to be fairly comprehensive limits, operators will only be approved to receive Commonwealth child-care assistance if they are established in these identified areas of need. New places established in areas other than those identified&mdash;which have not yet been identified&mdash;will not attract Commonwealth child-care assistance during 1998 and 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is this government's answer to providing timely information to potential child&hyphen;care providers&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Planning to succeed in child care</EMPHASIS>. This document, every page of which is labelled `effective at 29 August 1997', talks about planning and targeting new services for 1998 and 1999 in areas of high need, such as where I live.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what is the reality? The reality is that much of this document is based on legislation which may not have passed the Senate by the time many of its proposed changes are due to commence. The reality is that the potential investors in new child-care places for 1998&mdash;next year&mdash;have no idea of where the high needs areas are. Thus, they have no idea which areas will have access to Commonwealth child-care assistance. The reality is that this document represents something besides being a waste of taxpayers' money; it masquerades as proof of government support for the child-care industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is trying to say it is doing something when there is nothing there. It is a Trojan horse. The reality of the situation is a government that has introduced changes which have seen families removing their children from centres&mdash;73 per cent of whom cite increased fees as their reasons for leaving&mdash;and a government that is taking child care back to the days of low standard informal care. The National Association of Community Based Children's Services says that 67 per cent of families leaving centres are now using informal care. We have a government that should stand condemned for its lack of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> support for families with child&hyphen;care needs. We have a government that should not be masquerading behind a document such as this, which says nothing.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7259"><TITLE><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rabelais</EMPHASIS></TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I6">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</NAME><STATE> (South Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(7.29 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to refer to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rabelais</EMPHASIS> , which is a student newspaper published monthly by La Trobe University. The publisher is the students' association of that particular university. An article that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rabelais</EMPHASIS>  published entitled `The art of shoplifting' has, to the shock of the Australian Democrats and many others in the community, brought extensive legal proceedings against the editors. Tonight I want to talk about this issue and point out the need to re&hyphen;evaluate and re-examine the relevant laws in this case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The laws involved in this case are both state and territory laws which have been adopted from the Classification of Publications Ordinance 1983 from the act as it was amended in 1989. The relevant words in those laws are that any publication will be refused classification if it `instructs in matters of crime or violence'. In Victoria, any material that is deemed objectionable material cannot be published. So material, therefore, that is refused classification is objectionable material and its publication can lead to a penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following an approach by the Retail Traders Association of Victoria, the Chief Censor refused classification to this La Trobe publication of the article `The art of shoplifting' on the basis that the publication `instructed in methods of shoplifting and associated fraud'&mdash;an exact quote from the Chief Censor. This decision was confirmed by the Classification Board and reasons were provided on 26 July 1996. That decision has been subject to review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The heart of this matter is the national classification code which sets out the publications which are to be refused classification. These are publications which `promote, incite or instruct in matters of crime and violence'. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rabelais</EMPHASIS> article was considered by the board to instruct in matters of crime because 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7260"> it was a step&hyphen;by&hyphen;step guide to shoplifting. So the board decided that it had a political flavour but that it did not have any indicators of satire or tongue in cheek and that it therefore did not fulfil those particular criteria. It was deemed to have a political flavour and to be instructing people how to commit shoplifting crimes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The board recognised the nature of the publication and its audience&mdash;the student audience, which is, presumably, a reasonably educated audience willing to take into account a variety of factors and the context in which this publication was made available&mdash;but concluded that the critical issue was the intent to instruct in crime. This decision has now been upheld by the Federal Court and will be subject to further review by the full Federal Court in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concern I have tonight is that this case has identified a clear failing in our laws, and it is now the place for parliament to fix that particular failing. I make no assessment of the legal arguments in this case, on the basis that the technical legal issues are a distraction from the issue which the parliament must decide upon&mdash;and that is our need to enable open and accessible debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rabelais</EMPHASIS> case is a good example of the random application of the particular law involved. For example, if the Retail Traders Association of Victoria had not raised the matter this publication would have joined any number of other publications that have not fallen foul of this law&mdash;maybe they would have but they have never even been considered as possible contenders. That is, they have never been referred for or highlighted as containing deemed objectionable material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we were to examine them, the range of publications and other materials in our community that could actually fall foul of the particular legislation is incredible, for example, union leaflets calling on workers to strike. What about a boxing manual, which clearly instructs people how to box and, presumably, to inflict damage on others? A range of other materials could be deemed objectionable or, in particular, instructing or inciting crime.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to a recent article by Australian lawyer Geoffrey Dutton in September 1996, the article `The art of shoplifting' reminded him of his student days when hippies would wrap a jacket around a book that stated, `steal this book'. Geoffrey Dutton actually points to examples of films and books that Australia has seen fit to censor in the past. I can name a number of examples, including <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Frankenstein</EMPHASIS> because of its horror component, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Of Mice and Men</EMPHASIS> because of its sex and violence components&mdash;funny that that was lost on me when I studied the book&mdash;and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Challenge</EMPHASIS> for its kidnapping references. These are concrete examples of materials that our laws should not exclude but which, under the laws in their present form, would be excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If people really wanted to instruct themselves in matters of crime or violence, they would not really need to go to the student papers&mdash;they need look only as far as last night's television programs. At 7.30 p.m. Channel 7 showed <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Most Wanted</EMPHASIS>, which involves the re&hyphen;enactment of actual crimes. They could then switch over to Channel 9 at about 8.30 and watch <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Murder Call</EMPHASIS> in which what at first appears to be a suicide unravels to reveal a murder case. To finish off that diet of viewing, they could stay on Channel 9 for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Diagnosis: Murder</EMPHASIS> in which, presumably, they could watch the machinations of at least one, if not several, murders taking place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Or, for example, if someone wanted to pursue the matter of shoplifting and be instructed in how to commit that crime, perhaps on a larger scale, they could rent the video of an English movie called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shopping</EMPHASIS>, which was released a few years ago. It was not actually banned in this country but it did detail&mdash;and, you could argue, potentially instructed people in&mdash;ram raids. Clearly, that would fall foul of this particular piece of legislation. However, the most blatant example, and perhaps an obvious one, of a publication that instructs in stealing is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oliver Twist</EMPHASIS>, the Charles Dickens classic, which talks about instructing Oliver in pick&hyphen;pocketing&mdash;`pick a pocket or two'. What if that were to be removed under these guidelines? </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7261">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not mean to look at ludicrous or perhaps somewhat farcical or extreme examples because the point is that the ones I have cited are not. Yet, under the laws and under the classification codes as they are currently constructed, if these particular publications, articles, videos or television programs were referred to a board, potentially they could be banned on the basis of being objectionable material and penalties, perhaps even gaol sentences, could be incurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The solution to this matter is a reconsideration of the particular provision by the law&hyphen;makers, and in Australia that would involve a number of states and territories and, of course, the federal parliament. I think we want to retain the diversity of materials that form our entertainment and our education in this country, but we must have a law that cannot be arbitrarily applied, and its wording must be clear not only to avoid confusion but also to ensure that we protect our community and that we treasure and protect the very freedoms we have in this country when it comes to civil liberties, the press and speech.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="7.38 p.m." PAGE="7261"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 7.38 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7270"> following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The department has indicated an intention to include salary packaging in any workplace agreement which it is able to negotiate with its employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes, in the context of discussing workplace agreements with staff, at a seminar held on 18 June 1997, the Secretary advised an open meeting of staff of his intention to include access to salary packaging as a feature of any future workplace agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)The Secretary's presentation to staff on 18 June included a reference to the department's position on salary packaging. Attached is a copy of the overhead slide used in the presentation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) As already mentioned, the information was presented to an open meeting of departmental staff at the seminar held on 18 June, 1997. (b) Having tested the market and consulted with staff and other Commonwealth agencies, the department's Executive has engaged a private sector remuneration consultant to provide remuneration packaging services for this department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remuneration consultant has been asked to develop a detailed remuneration packaging policy for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, conduct information sessions for staff and, once the department has negotiated workplace agreements, provide a completely outsourced remuneration packaging administration service. The administration service would then be used by any staff who wish to access salary packaging, in return</PARA>
<PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for an administration fee charged by the remuneration consultant; there will be no cost to the department for this service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) At this stage, no salary packaging arrangements have been offered to employees of the department. The department is still developing its policy on salary packaging, recognising that this policy will need to conform with the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business' Policy Parameters on Agreement-making in the Australian Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) No salary packaging arrangements have yet been entered into by employees of this department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) (a), (b) and (c) These questions will need to be considered by the department in developing its policy framework on remuneration packaging. As indicated above, the department has not yet decided on its final policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) This issue will be considered by the department in developing its policy framework on remuneration packaging</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) The items have not yet been decided upon, and will need to be addressed as part of salary packaging policy development process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) No. The department is required to pay Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) on noncash benefits it provides to its employees, in accordance with the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. Consistent with the requirement under the Policy Parameters on Agreement-making in the Australian Public Service that salary packaging involve no extra cost to the agency, the department will require its employees who access salary packaging to include any FBT liability in their remuneration packaging arrangements.</PARA>
