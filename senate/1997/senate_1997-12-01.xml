<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of 17 bills deals with a range of issues with respect to restructuring the regulatory framework of the Aus 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9832"> tralian meat and livestock industry. In particular, a number of the bills relate to changes in the method of levying charges or levies for purposes related to such things as marketing and research in the meat and livestock industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition supports passage of the bills. However, we have two issues we wish to raise specifically. The first relates to the Livestock Transactions Levy Bill 1997. This bill was the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee. The Senate committee took evidence from various representative organisations in the meat and livestock industry and the wool industry and, as a result of that evidence, the committee unanimously concluded in its report that the bill should be withdrawn until a round table conference was held.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee came to that recommendation because, whilst in principle there was strong support from the majority of the industry for a transaction levy to replace the current slaughter levy, there was a great divergence of views as to just what form that levy should take. Some argued, as the bill proposed, that it should be based on a per head basis. Others put to the committee that it should be an ad valorem rate. Other groups suggested the possibility of a mixture of a per head and an ad valorem levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were various proposals which related to exemptions from the levy. As a result of this divergence and, in some cases, conflicting views on the actual method of applying the levy, the committee reached the unanimous position that the bill should be withdrawn and discussions held to try to sort out an agreement so the bill could be reintroduced or redrafted to reflect any such agreement. I reiterate that that was the unanimous position of members of the committee, both government and opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following the committee's report, there was strong representation from major representative organisations seeking that the Senate pass the bill as soon as possible. That seems to be the view being adopted in regard to lots of legislation at this point in time. But, given the overwhelming indication from the industry 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that that is what they desire, the opposition has proposed that the bill be passed but with a cessation provision such that the bill will operate for a period of two years from its commencement date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have done that because, as I said, we do support the in&hyphen;principle position of moving to a transaction based levy. We still retain our concern that there is some disagreement within the industry as to precisely what form that transactions levy should take. We believe that one way to ensure that it is properly introduced and is accepted by the industry over time is for the bill to be given a life of two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that point of time when it expires, hopefully, things will be working okay, and the government of the day would be required to then come back to the parliament to either seek to put further legislation through to continue the system as it exists at that time or to make any necessary changes that have been demonstrated to be needed during the two years. So we have proposed an amendment to the  Live&hyphen;stock Transactions Levy Bill  and that has been circulated in the chamber. It is in the form of a request because, as I am advised, this is a money bill and is not capable of amendment directly by the Senate. So we have proposed that the clause `Cessation of operation of Act' be inserted into the bill, and we will be requesting that the House of Representatives agree to that. I understand that the government is agreeable to our proposal in that regard. I do not think I need to say anything more about that particular legislation. I think my colleague Senator O'Brien may wish to add some further remarks as he was also a member of the committee that dealt with that bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have concerns with the  Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Industry (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997 . I acknowledge that we have only just been able to draw these concerns directly to the attention of the government this morning. I apologise for that. We were proceeding on the basis that this legislation was coming on tomorrow. Nevertheless, the government will recall the speech in the second reading debate 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9833"> given by the member for Burke, Mr O'Keefe, in the other place on 27 October. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also foreshadow concern about a provision in the Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Industry (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997 which accompanies this legislation on the Australian meat and livestock industry reforms. In proposed section 45 of the repeals and consequential provisions bill, there is a section headed `Certain staff members taken to have resigned'. As I understand this particular section, it relates to people who are at the moment employees of statutory corporations such as the AMLC and who, when those bodies are phased out, will obviously be without a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that those people will be offered an equivalent of employment opportunity. But it also provides that, if they choose not to take it, they are deemed to have resigned.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr O'Keefe then goes on to indicate that the opposition would be considering what provisions it might seek to move in regard to that section of the bill. The concern is that persons who are offered employment in one of the other bodies to replace the Meat and Livestock Corporation but who decline such employment will be taken to have resigned. In such case it is intended that they would lose, as we understand it, their rights to redundancy, which would otherwise be available if they were to be made redundant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our concern is that, as we are advised, this is actually contrary to an enterprise agreement between the CPSU and the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. I am advised that the agreement reached between the union and the corporation provided that choice was of paramount importance. The advice states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 4 of the AMLC Agreement incorporated the concept of employee "choice" in the event of privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Bear in mind that at the time this agreement was negotiated the future of the AMLC was still not finalised. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under that provision, where employees chose to transfer to a privatised part of the AMLC's existing operations they agreed to be treated as though there had been no break in continuity, ie "uninterrupted service". In voting to support the Agreement, staff agreed that in those circumstances they would be willing to forgo an entitlement to redundancy payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was also the understanding of the parties that those employees who chose not to transfer to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> privatised operation would retain their entitlement to redundancy payments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the concern that we have. The provisions of clause 45 with consequential provisions in clause 46 would be contrary to that agreement and certainly to the employees' understanding of that agreement. Consequently, we have circulated amendments to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R314">Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Industry (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997</XREF> . If they have not been circulated, they will be shortly. Those amendments would delete clause 45 and more consequential amendments to clause 46.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicated to the government just prior to commencement of the debate this morning that, given that this has only just been raised now but was foreshadowed some time ago, there may need to be some further consultation before the matter is finally resolved this morning, if that is possible. I would be interested to hear the government's view on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, if there is a need&mdash;and I think there certainly is&mdash;to discuss this matter further, I am proposing to proceed to deal with all the other bills in the package and adjourn these two bills to be brought on later this morning once we have resolved the issue. Alternatively, if we are unable to resolve the issue, the bills will need to be brought on to enable the opposition to put its amendments and have them determined accordingly. I indicate that the opposition supports the totality of the package of legislation with the proviso that we are proposing amendments to the  Live&hyphen;stock Transactions Levy Bill 1997  and the  Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Industry (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997 .</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given that there appears to be agreement in relation to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R334">Live&hyphen;stock Transactions Levy Bill 1997</XREF>  amendment that the opposition proposed, it may seem unusual that I rise to speak in this debate. However, we do have a situation where effectively a unanimous committee report has recommended that this bill be amended substantially prior to its passage. I thought I needed to touch on the position that members of the committee took in relation to this bill in the second reading 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9834"> debate, given the slight variation in position. I will seek to explain why the position now taken is entirely consistent with the committee's findings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee hearing on this bill was called on rather hastily, given the time of year in which the proceedings commenced and the amount of time available to conduct hearings. I, firstly, would like to congratulate the various  organisations who, on very short notice, appeared before the committee and presented their points of view. Subsequently, the government, through the department, presented its point of view in relation to this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What came out of those hearings was that the committee was quite confused about the overall position of the industry. Indeed, there was a significant body of evidence which indicated that, although there were many organisations supporting the proposed transaction levy arrangement, most, if not all, of the organisations&mdash;certainly the producer organisations&mdash;supported the existing scheme. However, it was felt that perhaps there was a problem in its administration because of the processors refusing to continue to collect the slaughter levy on into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that there did exist, as it seemed to the committee, a situation where a scheme was cobbled together in a reasonably short period and did not necessarily have broad support from producers themselves, if one disregards the position taken by their representative organisations, it was suggested during the hearings that in some areas the votes taken within organisations to support the proposal were carried by very slim majorities. Given that situation, what the committee felt minded to do was seek a reconsideration of the proposal for the transaction levy which effectively transfers the responsibility for payment of the levy from the processor to the producer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe over time that will effectively transfer the cost of the levy from the processor to the producer, and it will impact on the return they receive from their stock. However, that is a matter which the various representative organisations around the country, with a couple of notable exceptions, have indicated 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to many senators that they support. As they are the representative organisations of the growers and, as a significant majority of those organisations have, subsequent to the report, indicated to senators that they believe it is in the interest of the industry that the bill be passed, the opposition is not intending to stand in the way of that wish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the concerns which the committee have expressed about the operation of the scheme remain. As a result, we propose and, as I understand it, the government accepts that, to ensure there is the ability for parliament to review this legislation within two years, a sunset clause is to be introduced by means of an opposition amendment. The intent of that is, if there are the problems which have been raised in the hearings, to allow the various industry bodies, if it is their wish, the opportunity to come back to the parliament and suggest alternatives or variations to the scheme. That can be done in a number of ways&mdash;by amending the legislation at any time by, for example, simply removing the sunset clause or making some other significant changes or in removing the sunset clause amending any regulations that arise out of the legislation which affect the operation of the levy so as to give effect to a scheme which is equitable and acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A significant concern was expressed in the hearings that, because the transaction applies at the point of sale, unless there were significant exemptions in the regulations arising out of the legislation, a transaction levy could be payable on a number of occasions because it is sold on a number of occasions prior to being sorted. That concern may well be addressed in regulations arising out of the legislation. It is a significant concern. The opposition will be looking closely at the equity of any regulations that arise out of this legislation. Having said that, on the understanding I expressed about our amendment, which I think is well-founded, the opposition will not oppose the passage of the Live&hyphen;stock Transaction Levy Bill 1997, if amended in the way that we suggest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Forshaw referred to the consequential amendments legislation. I support his suggestion that, perhaps in the committee 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9835"> stage, that matter be dealt with separately. If need be, the committee stage can be adjourned while other legislation is being dealt with to allow the further consideration of that matter. With those brief remarks, I commend our amendment and the other legislation to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have discussed this. I thank Senator Forshaw for his apology in relation to the late notice. We have had time to consider those matters dealing with clause 45. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) has considered the concerns. We believe that the concerns are unwarranted and that the package is fair. We have had a close look at this. The matters have been raised before; it is not as though it is a totally new issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not think there are any breaches of agreements. We think it is fair to all parties. It offers a person moving from one organisation to another fairness and equity in these matters. I am not sure whether the precedents upon which these transfer provisions are based are exhaustive. The precedents in this section include the Moomba&hyphen;Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act 1994. That was a Labor government bill which involved moving staff from one organisation to another. There is also the Repatriation Institutions (Transfer) Act 1992. Again, that was another Labor Party bill where people were moved from one repatriation organisation to another. There is also the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation (Sale of Assets and Abolition) Act 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there are three precedents. These measures are based on them. We do not believe that any delays or further discussion would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9836"> move things further, because the government has a firm view on it. Even though we like to consult on these things and try to find common ground where it is possible, we do not think that it will progress things here. The government is quite keen to see this legislation dealt with as quickly as possible. We have a very heavy legislative burden, which we seek to get through before lunchtime so that we can get on to the Wik debate. I think any further delay will delay the consideration of the Native Title Amendment Bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I realise that this matter was only specifically drawn to the attention of the government this morning. However, it was, as I said, flagged in the second reading stage in the other place. You might say that that means it has been under consideration for some time. The problem we have is this: on the advice I have received&mdash;it seems that it is very good advice&mdash;the clause is contrary to the agreement reached between the union and the Meat and Livestock Corporation. That agreement is the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation Enterprise Agreement 1997 and it sets out certain rights and entitlements of employees, specifically in clauses 4 and 9. That agreement was negotiated at a time when the future of the Meat and Livestock Corporation was still being sorted out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, under the provisions of this legislation&mdash;the  Australian Meat and Live&hyphen;stock Industry (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997 &mdash;clause 45 deems that staff members who are offered employment in one of the new bodies but who decline it are deemed to have resigned. Further, what is even more draconian in terms of the impact of that position is that clause 45(5) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a person is taken to have resigned under subitem 2, the resignation is not to be treated for any purpose as a termination of employment at the initiative of the person's employer.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have a situation where employees of the Meat and Livestock Corporation are going to fall into a number of categories. Those not offered employment in one of the new bodies will be afforded all their rights as redundant employees. Those who are offered employment and accept it will continue on with no 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> substantive change to their rights or entitlements. However, for those who are offered employment&mdash;in other words, are asked to move from the public sector to the private sector&mdash;and who decline that offer, this legislation will deem them to have resigned. Once that comes into play, they are then not entitled to take that to the Industrial Relations Commission under, for instance, the unfair dismissals provisions. So they are snookered well and truly. In effect, even though they are currently employees in the public sector pursuant to the Meat and Livestock Industry Act, if as a result of this legislation they offered employment in the private sector and they decline it, they are going to be assumed to have resigned their public sector employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are advised that that is totally inconsistent with the agreement reached with the union. I will return to that. The agreement recognises in clause 4 the concept of employee choice in the event of privatisation. Under that provision, where employees chose to transfer to a privatised part of the Meat and Livestock Corporation's existing operations, they agreed to be treated as though there had been no break in continuity; that is, they continue with uninterrupted service. In voting to support the agreement, the staff agreed that in those circumstances they would be willing to forgo an entitlement to redundancy payment, because they accepted, in effect, a transfer of employment from the public sector to the private sector and a continuation or uninterruption of their service. All their entitlements follow them through. They therefore accepted no entitlement to redundancy. They were not seeking to cease one day as a public sector employee, pick up redundancy and then the next day start with the new  privatised body as a new employee. They have specifically not sought that, something in my many years of experience in the union movement I saw happen quite often in the private sector&mdash;by way of agreement. But that is not to apply here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If employees who are offered employment or who are asked to transfer from the public sector to a new privatised body in the private sector exercise their right to choose not to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9837"> take up that transfer of employment, they are deemed to have resigned from the public sector and they lose the entitlements that all of their fellow employees will receive who were not offered employment; yet they are in no different position because their employment in the public sector is being terminated. There is no job for them. They should not be, in effect, put in a position with one arm twisted behind their back and told, `Your public sector employment is going to cease because the Meat and Livestock Corporation is going to cease. It will be replaced by private sector bodies. You either take the job within the private sector or you lose all the entitlements that you have accrued, which may be many years of service in the public sector.' That is totally unfair and inequitable and, as I said, contrary to the understanding and the words of the agreement reached between the union and the corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been made very clear to me that at the time that agreement was negotiated there would be a corresponding entitlement. Those employees who chose not to transfer to the privatised operation would retain their entitlement to redundancy payments. In that context, we have a clear difference in position between the government and the opposition. We are saying and the union is saying that the provisions of proposed clause 45 are completely at odds with the understanding in that agreement. The fact that very few, if any, employees are ultimately to be affected is not the point. The point is whether or not this legislation is consistent or inconsistent with an enterprise agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that says it wants enterprise agreements both in the private sector and in the public sector. This is a government that is proceeding down the path of deregulation of these bodies. We have indicated our support for the rest of the package of legislation. We have indicated our support for the industry to have a greater role and say in that regulation. Why should the current employees who have had the entitlements of public sector employment be denied those rights simply because they decline to be forced into a position of taking employment 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in a private sector body that will replace the Meat and Livestock Corporation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge the government again to think about this issue and to support our amendments. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be pretty unfortunate if this debate were extended longer than it needed to be, because otherwise it appears that this legislation is basically uncontroversial. I am interested to know what position the government and the department take in relation to this matter, given that I understand the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation were not made aware of the content of this legislation; they were not aware of the intent of the government to override the agreement in this regard. I say that because I have been given a copy of correspondence dated 14 November from the AMLC to the Community and Public Sector Union. They say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is simply not true that the AMLC has attempted to override through legislation employees' rights to choose whether or not to transfer to a private successor body. As you know, the legislation was drafted by the Department of Primary Industries 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9838"> and Energy. We were given limited opportunities to make comment. In fact AMLC and MRC made unsolicited representations to the department to have the draft legislation changed. These requests were ignored.

<PARA STYLE="Para">a name is mentioned&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DPIE, who has been one of the main architects of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The AMLC position, at least as they expressed it to the union, is that they did not seek the provisions in the legislation which would override the agreement that they apparently freely made with the Community and Public Sector Union. It is, of course, a serious principle to override the terms of a freely reached agreement by legislation and there ought to be expressed by the government in this debate good public interest reasons for doing so. We have not in this debate heard anything from the government as to why the agreement should be overridden. Perhaps their view is that it is not being overridden. But that is the difficulty we are in. As I said at the start, it would be unfortunate if we were to unnecessarily prolong this debate, with Senator Forshaw's suggestion of moving, for example, that this committee report progress while we do that. We should proceed with another bill and come back later this morning at least knowing where everyone stands on this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, it may appear a small issue to the government. It is certainly a significant issue to those people affected by it. It would be a matter which no doubt will take the time of other bodies if this legislation passes in the current form. I think the potential for injustice is great and contrasts the opportunity to rectify issues easily at hand. I strongly suggest that we ensure we do not create an injustice for want of taking a very simply taken opportunity to review the provision, given the material that is before the Senate at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be that the government knows full well what it is doing in this regard. It would not be a very honourable position for the government to take if that were its position. As I said, there ought to be very strong public

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R339">Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1997</XREF>  and two associated bills. This bill seeks to implement the will of the government to create a migration agents registration authority and to effectively and dramatically change the immigration assistance industry. The industry is currently regulated but this was not always the case. There were some protective measures in place prior to 1992 but these offered little protection to consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The migration agents registration scheme, MARS, was established in 1992 under the stewardship of the then Minister for Immigration and Local Government, Gerry Hand. MARS was a response by the then Labor government to complaints about unscrupulous conduct and to reports of poor, negligent and incompetent advice being given by people holding themselves up to be experts in migration. Allegations about consumers being exploited and often asked or forced to pay enormous fees for services abounded. Recipients of migration advice were recognised by the then government as a particularly vulnerable group. Many of the group did not speak 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9839"> or understand English and were unaware of avenues of complaint when poor or unethical service was rendered to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main features of the MAR scheme included registration for would&hyphen;be providers of immigration advice, a code of conduct for registered agents, procedures for investigating complaints against agents, processes for suspending and deregistering agents and criminal sanctions for unregistered practice. The scheme was originally established to operate for three years with a government commitment to evaluate its effectiveness after two years. It has since had a number of temporary extensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme is administered by a board and the Secretary to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Each have distinct roles. The scheme has been reviewed twice in its short life. In 1995, in accordance with the minister's commitment at the commencement of the scheme, the Joint Standing Committee on Migration produced the results of its year&hyphen;long inquiry in a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Protecting the vulnerable? The migration agents registration scheme</EMPHASIS>. The current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, was a member of the committee that produced a unanimous report containing 49 recommendations. The recommendations were aimed at improving the standard of conduct and quality of advice given in the migration advice industry and ensuring greater consumer protection for clients of agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first recommendation in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Protecting the vulnerable?</EMPHASIS> report was that the scheme continue for a further three years and then be further reviewed. This recommendation was accepted by the then minister, Senator Bolkus, in the government's response to the committee's report, which was tabled in the House of Representatives on 30 November 1995. It appears that the current minister and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs were not informed of or were unaware of this important event. Mr Ruddock said in the other place on 30 October 1997:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The further comment that was made, and I think it was picked up by other members who spoke, was the reference to the Joint Standing Committee on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Migration report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Protecting the vulnerable?</EMPHASIS>  I was a party to that committee report, and I know what happened in relation to the deliberations on it. I know that the report was not one that had been responded to by the former government&mdash;notwithstanding that it was a committee report that they had had in their hands for some 12 months before the last election.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In fact, Minister Bolkus had responded and had done so within six months of the presentation of the report. In its response to a question on notice from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, the department told the committee about the presentation of the report to the Senate President on 1 December 1995 but failed to record that the report had earlier been presented to the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister Ruddock either ignored or forgot the report when he established a further review of the scheme in June last year. The review was conducted by a departmental task force which was guided by a six&hyphen;member reference group headed by Mr Ian Spicer, former Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The reference group also included two officers of the Migration Institute of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to record the minister's boast made in his second reading speech that MARS was the first regulatory arrangement to be reviewed by the Commonwealth as a party to the competition principles agreement. That is what this legislation is about&mdash;deregulation and self&hyphen;regulation. It is not about strengthening consumer protection for those people in the community who are vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous or incompetent migration agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister proposes to delegate the administration of migration agents to the Migration Institute of Australia. The explanatory memorandum to the bills notes a key finding of the Spicer review in relation to the MIA:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The industry association, the Migration Institute of Australia has only limited coverage of the industry, having only 10 per cent of registered agents as members. The Association also lacks resources, with a membership of 250, an annual income sufficient only to meet the costs of one full&hyphen;time Secretary and with executive positions filled on an honorary basis. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9840">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The MIA was founded in 1992. Until recently the institute employed only one person. It operated its national headquarters from a post office box in Normanhurst, New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's commitment to this organisation, however, is beyond question. It recently provided the MIA with a grant of $380,000 to assist with the development of the systems and infrastructure of the Migration Agents Registration Authority. The money has been paid, despite the fact that the bills to establish the authority have not yet been passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition have grave concerns about possible conflicts of interest if the MIA is appointed as the administrator and regulator of the industry. Our concerns were compounded by the responses to questions from officials of the MIA at the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee public hearings on 5 November 1997. The interchange appears at pages 34, 35 and 36 of the committee's report, which was presented to the Senate on 18 November 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth while briefly quoting the comments of the national President and the national Vice&hyphen;President of the MIA from that public hearing. Mr Brown, the President said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of MARA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is the Migration Agents Registration Authority&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the point needs to be made&mdash;and I think it became apparent during this morning's proceedings&mdash;that it has not been understood that MARA will in fact be a separate body to the MIA. MARA is not MIA, so it will not be the MIA registering agents; it will be MARA. Conflict of interest issues will be removed by making that separation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Cope, the Vice President, went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Could I add to that? What Ray is saying is that the MIA is acting on a delegation from the minister, so the MIA membership is comprised through election processes to create a national executive, such as that which exists. The Migration Institute will continue to run in that fashion but, in addition to that, there will be a legislative overlay, so the institute itself will carry out the regulatory roles. Those regulatory roles will not be exercised by us, the national executive directors, but by employees paid through the registration levies of people who seek registration with MARA. MARA is the MIA in terms of exercising those legislative responsibilities.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that Mark Sullivan, from the department, explained this morning that they are separate roles. They are separate, but additional, roles. People might be still writing a cheque for their registration fees. They will not be going to the MIA; they will be going to the registering authority, of which the MIA is nominally the name, but it is exercised by employees whom this body&mdash;the national executive of the MIA&mdash;employs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Cope later clarified by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was meaning to clarify that there is not another MARA. It is the MIA. If you wanted to make a complaint you would contact the institute's employees, through the MARA legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I know that was an extensive quote, but I think it is very worth while to put it in at this early stage in the debate on these bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This legislation is a very direct, ideologically based attack on the community sector that provides immigration advice on a no&hyphen;cost basis. The fact that it is such an attack is proven in many ways. The community sector accounts for some 24 per cent of registered agents. It was not represented on the minister's reference group, but the MIA, then representative of only 10 per cent of the registered agents, had two senior officials on the six&hyphen;member reference group. It is no wonder that the review found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that there is no basis for public funding of the regulation of the migration advice industry and that, in an environment of statutory&hyphen;based regulation, regulation should be funded on a cost&hyphen;recovery basis.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When the issue of registration fees is discussed, the ideological attack is crystal clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the current legislation, non&hyphen;fee charging registered agents do not pay a registration fee. The bill before the Senate will change that, and the change will be dramatic. Under regulations that will accompany this bill&mdash;if it is passed&mdash;if an individual, voluntary, non&hyphen;fee charging person seeks to register with the Migration Agents Registration Authority, MARA&mdash;for which, perhaps, read MIA&mdash;each will have to fork out a whopping $475 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To get this into perspective, the Senate should note that fee charging agents can and do charge up to five figure sums for migration advice. To register, these agents will have to pay $1,000 per annum. Those who charge 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9841"> nothing to service the most vulnerable may have to pay a half of what is to be levied on the commercial sector. I say, advisedly, that, in the event of the opposition's committee stage amendments failing and this bill passing, the opposition will consider whether to move to disallow the regulations that propose to levy the exorbitant and unrealistic registration fee on the voluntary non&hyphen;fee charging sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition in its minority report to the Senate committee report condemned the government for its lack of consultation with the voluntary, non&hyphen;fee charging sector in deciding the fees issue. Labor members of the committee said that they considered making the same finding against the MIA but withdrew from this only because of the confusion about the MIA's role in the development of the bills. Did the MIA have some form of semi&hyphen;official, de jure, de facto consultative role in the process?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the department and the MIA strenuously denied that the MIA had at any time had an official appointment or delegation to act or negotiate on behalf of the minister or the department. MIA officers were known to admit that discussions on fees had occurred with sections of the voluntary sector. Under questioning, they admitted that they were not negotiating on behalf of the minister or the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor opposition is disturbed and distressed by the following response to committee members' questions from Ms Bedlington, the First Assistant Secretary&mdash;Refugee and Humanitarian Division of the department at the Senate estimates committee on 13 November:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of how fees were going to be set was one that was primarily led by the MIA. If the minister is going to delegate the authority for the registration of migration agents, the way in which that is going to be run and its overall cost would be under the direct control of the MIA. Therefore, the level of fees that would be required to meet that cost, it seems, would more appropriately be worked through with the MIA.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This type of conduct is disgusting and the voluntary non&hyphen;fee charging sector which has contributed so much over the years does not deserve to be treated in this way. The opposi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion is disappointed that the government, in suggesting the proposed fee regime, fails to recognise the significant role and contribution of the voluntary sector agents who are operating in an environment of increasing government cutbacks and competing demands. Both the Victorian Immigration Advice and Rights Centre and the Immigration Advice and Rights Centre of New South Wales told the committee that that proposed fee regime would undermine their capacity to provide service to the more disadvantaged sections of the community that seek immigration advice. All would agree that VIARC and IARC are representative of the community sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister and the department have not provided any plausible justification for the imposition of a fees regime on those least able to meet those exorbitant and outrageous charges. It should be noted that at the same time the bills propose to reduce the registration charges for more than 25 per cent of currently registered agents. I put it to the Senate that those who would benefit by the reductions are in fact the very agents who would be more able to afford a much higher fee. The minister clearly displayed his antipathy toward the voluntary sector during debate on the bills. He made an extraordinary statement about the 450 non&hyphen;fee charging agents when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They did not have to meet the same standards as fee charging agents. You cannot tolerate a two&hyphen;tier system where the most vulnerable receive a lower standard of service.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The department was questioned about this statement during the Senate committee's inquiry, but officers could not produce any evidence to support or verify the minister's statement, other than to draw attention to the different admission standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One measure of standards and quality of performance might be the number of complaints made against the voluntary sector in comparison to other registered agents such as lawyers and fee charging registered agents. The Migration Agents Registration Board has received 1,248 complaints since the scheme commenced. Out of that total, only 18 were against persons registered in the voluntary sector. This is an astonishingly good figure 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9842"> considering this sector accounts for a quarter of the registered agents. No prosecutions have ever been launched against any registered agents from the voluntary sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Queensland branch president of the MIA, Mr John Hodges, appeared before the Senate committee as an MIA national executive member. Mr Hodges offered an opinion on the performance of the voluntary sector. He made some highly critical reflections against the providers of migration advice at the South Brisbane Immigration and Community Legal Service. These allegations have since been vigorously and categorically rejected by the service in a five&hyphen;page response which was attached to the opposition members' minority report to the Senate committee report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Hodges, a member of the minister's reference group, said that he had not reported his allegations about poor service. He stated that he had not lodged any complaint. It is disturbing to note that, under the legislation that is now being debated in the Senate, Mr Hodges, who is an executive member of the MIA, would be an executive member of the Migration Agents Registration Authority. He, with his other MIA and MARA colleagues, would be in charge of the body which would administer the new scheme. It is proposed that this authority would govern standards and police behaviour and ethics of registered agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have not heard yet if the MIA has publicly apologised to the South Brisbane Immigration and Community Legal Service for the comments that were made by one of their members during the public hearing. I have attempted to get a copy of the speech by the national president, at a conference in Melbourne last week, but so far I have been unable to get that. I hope that an apology was part of that speech. If not, I hope that a public apology is delivered very shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills do not represent the unanimous views of the industry as some would have us believe. Remember, the Spicer review group did not include one representative from a major community based group. Indeed, the Spicer review group recognised in its report the major stakeholders to be only the MIA 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the Law Council of Australia. The bill introduces a form of statutory self&hyphen;regulation and the minister will appoint the Migration Institute of Australia as the Migrant Agents Registration Authority. In his evidence to the Senate committee, a representative of the MIA said that the MIA, as MARA, will be exercising `a statutory power'&mdash;`a public power of a public authority in delegation'&mdash;`within a statutory framework'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate committee received advice from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department confirming some of the legal and administrative arrangements proposed under the bill. The Office of General Counsel, whilst confirming that MARA would not be a statutory authority, said there may be avenues for parliamentary scrutiny of the MIA's actions when acting as MARA. These opportunities are going to be very limited, as explained in the following response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Institute is incorporated as a company limited by guarantee. As such it is not part of the Commonwealth, for example, part of DIMA. Nor is it a statutory authority established by the Commonwealth. Rather, it is a separate, private sector company proposed to be given Commonwealth statutory powers and functions and to be known for these purposes as MARA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It follows from the preceding comments that MIA will be a separate body for the purposes of DIMA's annual reports. The operations of MIA will not be the operations of DIMA. Therefore, DIMA will not be in a position to report on the activities of MIA as though they were activities of DIMA. However, it could report on its dealings with MIA and for that purpose report on matters to which it has access concerning the exercise of functions and powers of MIA under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It may be possible for a Senate estimates committee to call MARA or the MIA as a recipient of Commonwealth funds to appear before that committee. This is an interesting exercise which we will be exploring perhaps at some time in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition had some concerns about the time for objections for the registration of agents. We note the government's amendments which will be moved in the second reading debate. We are very pleased that the government has seen fit to alter its proposal. We think this is sensible, as indeed we believe that there are some sensible propositions 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9843"> contained in the bills. However, we believe those sensible provisions could be implemented without the need to resort to self&hyphen;regulation or a move towards self&hyphen;regulation, which this bill is about. There will be an opposition committee stage amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The package of migration bills that the Senate is considering today is designed to do two main things: it is designed to move the migration advice industry towards a system of self&hyphen;regulation via an initial period of statutory self&hyphen;regulation and it is designed to establish a new system of fees for migration agents who seek registration. I think it is important to emphasise right at the start that the Democrats have a number of problems with these changes and the direction they are going in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have got particular problems with the proposal to move the migration industry towards self&hyphen;regulation, as well as the proposal to start charging fees for non&hyphen;fee charging agents working in the voluntary sector. That is certainly not to say that the Democrats do not understand and fully support the need for a system which offers the often very vulnerable clients of migration agents strong and effective protection&mdash;I think we would all agree on that&mdash;but we are not convinced that a system based on voluntary or even statutory self&hyphen;regulation is the best way that this can be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his second reading speech in the other place, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) made it very clear that statutory self&hyphen;regulation for the migration advice industry is to be an interim measure for two years commencing in March next year and that this proposed scheme would be reviewed before March in the year 2000 to determine the extent to which the Migration Institute of Australia has developed the capacity and infrastructure to undertake the role of industry regulator in a fully self&hyphen;regulating environment. What is not really questioned here though is whether or not the move towards voluntary self&hyphen;regulation is actually a desirable one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When considering this I do not think we can afford to ignore the comments made by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Joint Standing Committee on Migration in their 1995 report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Protecting the vulnerable?</EMPHASIS> I understand the current minister was a member of that committee. That committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . self regulation is more effective where there are mature and concentrated markets or where there is a propensity for consumers to make repeat purchases.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When it comes to the migration advice industry, the Spicer review in March of this year&mdash;and I think the government itself&mdash;has acknowledged that, at least at this stage, we do not have a very mature market; that this is something which can change over time. It is something that the government obviously believes is moving in the right direction. However, what is not likely to change much is that the consumers of migration advice are rarely in a position to make repeat purchases and because so many clients are disadvantaged&mdash;many cannot speak English&mdash;they are often not in a position to complain or to even recognise that they have been given poor advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think what we need to be asking here is a much broader question about the direction we are going in. That question is: is it possible that there are alternatives to voluntary self&hyphen;regulation which may in fact provide much more effective protection for consumers, but simply have not been considered because they fall outside the government's narrow ideological view of how things should operate in a market framework?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time that we start to broaden the debate on this issue and a whole range of areas across the board and move beyond the assumption that the hands&hyphen;off approach is always the best or economic and competition considerations should always be give priority. It is important to continue to emphasise that the impact on people should be given priority and the market should take second place to that, regardless of what the market is; and in this case we are talking about the migration advice market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of questions have been raised and were outlined by Senator McKiernan in his speech about whether the Migration Institute of Australia, the MIA, is the appropriate body to act as the Migration Agents 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9844"> Registration Authority during this interim statutory regulation period. Witnesses at the recent committee hearings stated their concerns that the MIA was not the appropriate body to carry out these tasks. The Democrats share many of those doubts about the MIA's ability to act as the registration authority. Again, Senator Mckiernan has outlined a number of those, including: how representative the MIA actually is; whether they have the capacity to administer the scheme adequately; the very real concerns about the potential for conflicts of interest; and how they would be able to adequately handle complaints and disciplinary matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One witness to the recent committee hearing asked whether it was possible for a body which is not truly representative of the industry&mdash;being made up at this stage primarily of commercial agents&mdash;to carry out the tasks which will be required when it has virtually no experience in very important areas such as refugees and humanitarian visas. Often the people looking for advice in those areas are amongst the most vulnerable. A number of other witnesses also suggested that there was potential for a conflict of interest in the MIA, the industry body, also carrying out the regulatory role. As one witness put it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is a rather odd situation that the government should be handing over disciplinary and complaints handling and consumer protection to a body which is also representing the interests of the actual people who are providing the service.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the light of these issues and others raised by witnesses during the 1995 joint committee hearings, the Spicer review and the recent Senate committee hearings, the Democrats are of the view that the migration industry is not ready to move towards self&hyphen;regulation at this stage. Nor do we believe that the MIA is the appropriate body to act as a migration agents registration authority. For those reasons, the Democrats are supportive of the aim of the ALP's amendments, which would act to extend the system that currently operates by three years and ensure that there is a viable and workable system in place while allowing the government to give further thought and consideration to the direction it is taking in this area.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the problem that the Senate faces in relation to this area is that this amendment of the ALP's will need the agreement of the government at the end of the day to enable the exiting system to continue. If that agreement is not forthcoming from the government then we will basically be left with a situation where, come March next year, there would be no protection in place at all for migrants. That is a situation which the Democrats would find totally unacceptable and I am sure all senators would be concerned about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst we would urge the government to consider agreeing to the ALP's amendment to extend the current system by three years, we do recognise, given the indications they have expressed to date, that they are not willing to pursue that option. That would leave us in a situation where we have no scheme in place at all come March next year, which is obviously not a good scenario.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are pleased with the amendments that the government has circulated today. Those amendments extend the period during which a person may lodge an objection to the registration of a migration agent and introduce a requirement for the MIA to report to the minister and for the minister to report to the parliament on how the new scheme is going. We are happy with both those changes, particularly the extension of time allowing for objections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will ask the minister a couple of questions in the committee stage about the publication of notifications, et cetera. I will leave my comments on that until then. The other main area of the bill is the introduction of fees for non&hyphen;fee charging agents working in voluntary community organisations. The Democrats acknowledge the very important and high quality services that these organisations provide. Whilst we strongly support the requirement that volunteer bodies comply with continuing education requirements, we do not believe that it is desirable to have the impact of fees on the capacity of community groups to provide migration advice to those who are most disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am please that the office of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Ruddock, has been willing to consider the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9845"> level of fees that are charged. It is the view of the Democrats that the community sector should not be charged any fees at all, because we believe that it will impact on a sector that is clearly extremely under&hyphen;resourced. Many of the organisations that provide voluntary advice have a number of people who provide that advice. The compounding effect of each of those people having to pay any sort of fee would add up pretty quickly for a severely under&hyphen;resourced voluntary organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrat view is that the appropriate way to go is to have no fees at all for those organisations. We have been having ongoing discussions with the office of the minister, Mr Ruddock, about this issue. I am pleased that he has been willing to consider amending the level of fees charged to the voluntary sector. When we get to the committee stage, I will ask the minister in this chamber, Senator Vanstone, some questions about the government's approach in relation to fees. I have certainly had some indications from Mr Ruddock's office that he is willing to reduce the fee levels for the voluntary sector fairly significantly. Whilst I restate the Democrats' view that we believe that no fees will be appropriate at this stage, obviously, the lower the fee, the better for the voluntary sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the committee stage, and perhaps before we get to the ALP's amendments, I will also seek to ask the minister some questions about what approach the government is looking to take with the implementation of the legislation and the monitoring of how it operates, particularly on the voluntary sector, but also on the broader sector as a whole. I will leave any further comments on that until we get to the committee stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R339">Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1997</XREF>  deals with the issue of migration agents&mdash;the people who help the immigration system to ensure that those who are allowed to come into Australia do so as best they can and with as much expedition as possible, and to keep out those who should not come to Australia. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs has two functions: one is a regulatory function, making sure that people comply 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with the immigration legislation; and the other is a facilitation function to ensure that those who come in do so with as much comfort and ease as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For that to happen, there must be agents who give advice to those who are subject to the immigration laws. Lawyers do a lot of that work, and so do migration agents. It has been the policy of this government and the former government to make those who assist people with immigration problems subject to regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who help those who are seeking advice about migration law should be as competent as possible. I am not sure that this legislation assures that. The most effective agents in this area are community agents. These people have been referred to by the last two speakers. The policy that is presently afoot seems to make it as hard as possible for those agents to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, they are the most effective agents. In my state, bodies like the Victorian Immigration Advice and Rights Centre and the Refugee Advice and Casework Service are staffed by very dedicated people who know the law in this area and can apply it. During the committee stage I will ask questions&mdash;which, perhaps, the department can answer&mdash;about what lawyers they have had looking at the standard of knowledge of the people who give advice on this law, what advice they have got about the amount of money that those people charge, and how they treat their clients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were to look at those three issues, the Refugee Advice and Casework Service and the Victorian Immigration Advice and Rights Centre would score very highly. However, that does not seem to be the standard that is applied in deciding who are going to be the agents in this area. The standard applied is the issue of how much money will be available and where that money will go. There is a danger that money provided by the government in this area to ensure that people are properly looked after will go into law firms which do not have this as a primary aspect of their practice and which do not have cheap partners.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9846">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it, for example, the Refugee Advice and Casework Service in Victoria has a lot of work at the moment. I am told they have 650 East Timorese to look to, and 130 other cases, and have been provided with $42,000 until next June to accomplish that service. It seems a very interesting approach for the department to be taking. Does the department want an efficient service that runs well? What I mean by an efficient service is a service where the department is able to present a case efficiently and where those against whom they present a case can also do so efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Refugee Advice and Casework Service Victoria Ltd is talking with people who are amongst the most vulnerable in this society&mdash;indeed, in any society throughout the world. But as I understand it, apart from the problems that are associated with those seeking protection as refugees here, there are the general immigration problem people, if I can put it that way, whom the Victorian Immigration and Advice and Rights Centre look after. VIARC has been given $22,000 to do that work until June 1998. It just seems ridiculous&mdash;and if this is not to be accepted, then perhaps the minister can contradict it&mdash;that those two bodies which contain the most dedicated, most efficient and most learned group able to give advice to people with problems in migration, should be treated in that way. It is just a nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These organisations are not in the public sector; they are in the community sector. Take RACS, for example. Lots of people go there to give advice and work voluntarily, and for that, as I understand, those people have to pay a fee to register. I am subject to correction here, but I think they have to pay the full fee, $475, or a reduced fee, but it is substantial in any event. This is an issue that is to be seen in the context of legal aid generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Victorian Bar News</EMPHASIS>&mdash;which I am sure the department reads whenever it comes out; certainly, the minister would&mdash;for Spring 1997, on page 7 I see this heading, `Legal aid funding crisis continues to dominate bar council business'. The way the Refugee Advice and Casework Service Victoria and the Victorian Immigration Advice 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and Rights Centre Inc. are being treated will demonstrate just how correct it is for the Victorian Bar Council to be talking about legal aid and the way it dominates the bar's discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another article in this magazine with a great heading which reads, `How to lose a contested matter without really trying'. A lot of people who act in this area would be great demonstrators of the truth of that headline. They show how to lose a contested matter without really trying, whereas bodies like RACS and VIARC show quite the opposite. They have the skills, the learning and the experience to make sure that people's rights are properly vindicated. It is not the purpose of those two bodies to keep people in Australia who should not be kept here. It is not their function, as it were, to try to get around the law. It is their function to see that the law is properly applied to their clients and to properly attend to their clients' position, as it is for any legal adviser, but it is getting very difficult to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On one side you have the vast resources of the department filled with learning and people who know this area of the law backwards, who can give advice and draw on advice from the Attorney&hyphen;General, if the department needs it, and on the other side of the contest is a person who has very little in the way of resources and whose hope really is to be able to rely only on bodies like the Victorian Immigration Advice and Rights Centre Inc. and the Refugee Advice and Casework Service Victoria Inc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that there are some very good solicitors in this area, whom I know&mdash;I do not know many agents who are not solicitors&mdash;but for people who do not know the country, the society and the community as well as those who were born here, it is very difficult to go to the right place for the best advice. Indeed, it is very hard for people who were born here to know who to go to for the right advice on the matters which they have to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here you have two bodies which people can go to and be guaranteed of proper advice, yet they are being starved of funds to the point where they may have to close down. This 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9847"> system is put under awful pressure that may lead those bodies to close down. Then the system would be well and truly loaded against the people who want to see their way through a very complex act, and the minister would understand that. The act itself is complex, the regulations are complex and need skill and learning, and the very bodies which would enable people to get through that, so that we at least would have an approach to justice in the whole system, are going to be closed down. I would be interested to hear what the minister has to say about those issues.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Cooney made an extremely fine contribution to this debate on the migration bills, raising matters which need a response from the government. I listened carefully to what Senator Bartlett had to say, and I apologise that I did not hear what Senator McKiernan had to say because I was in another meeting, but certainly they raised matters that the government needs to respond to in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come from the view that access to good information by those who often are without English and who are in very vulnerable situations is a right, not to be regarded just as a service subject to the demands of competition policy and user pays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I have great difficulty with this particular legislation. My biggest concern is with regard to the impact of the legislation on voluntary community sectors. Only this morning I received a fax&mdash;and it is surprising I received it because thousands and thousands of faxes are pouring into my office on another unmentionable matter that is before the Senate&mdash;from the Migrant Resource Centre. This fax raises a number of matters to which Senator Cooney has referred. As Senator Cooney indicated, these dedicated and efficient organisations believe in the need for the most vulnerable&mdash;and for others, of course&mdash;to receive access to good information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amongst other things I will say that the provision of immigration advice by voluntary organisations such as RACS and the VIARC is of vital importance to those who cannot afford to pay. Unfortunately, some of those groups have seen their funding slashed. They 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> function in continuing uncertainty. I personally know many dedicated individuals who are working in the area of refugee advice. Their work is of the highest quality and is delivered with great concern for the wellbeing of their clients. These groups already operate on very tight budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this fax that was sent to me, RACS says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . RACS has eaten into a considerable amount of our savings and have enough money to continue for only about another four months at the most.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 27 November 1997, we received a fax from the Department advising us that the figures . . . were a mistake and that the true level of funding is: Victoria $42,076&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and NSW $54,257.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">down from $133,000&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This represents just over one third of what we had previously been advised.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Surely there must be some explanation for this. In the committee stage, I&mdash;and no doubt Senator Bartlett, Senator Cooney and Senator McKiernan&mdash;will be asking a few questions which it is not appropriate for me to ask in this debate. As RACS points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If applicants are unable to adequately present their claims and applications, the whole integrity of the immigration program is threatened. When unrepresented and unassisted clients receive decisions they consider to be unjust, they move into the appeals.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is something the minister constantly argues he is trying to reduce. If he is reducing the efficacy of these voluntary services, he will increase the costs of appeals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cooney mentioned a very interesting point which is in the missive from RACS about the services that RACS and other voluntary organisations provide for advice.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;May I, because it is here on page 4 of the document. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RACs and VIARC both consider the MARS Bill as proposed to be extremely problematic. Even with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9848"> the concessions you mentioned to me on the telephone . . . we continue to have grave reservations about whether the Bill should be passed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Here is a most interesting point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even with a fee of $100 to register, our volunteer evening advice services would be annihilated. We would be unable to cover any registration fees given our dire funding situation. Fees would have to be covered by volunteers, many of whom are impecunious.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The point is that it is a $100 registration fee for each and every person who is involved in the service. These organisations may have 120 or 130 people who are providing the service and taking time to go out at night and give evening advice services. As they say here, those services will be junked&mdash;annihilated, to use their more civilised word. I really do need to know that the government will make a commitment not to erode the funding of groups in the voluntary sector&mdash;a commitment that will make that certain for them. I urge the government to demonstrate a commitment to the voluntary sector and to ensure adequate funding so that these groups can continue to provide the highest quality service to those who need it. How can they be expected to pay the registration fees if they can barely survive now?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am in a difficult position on this matter. I have expressed my views on migration over the years. You know my views. I have entered into the debate over the years and argued with the previous government in respect of some of their legislation which I felt affected the most vulnerable. Of course, my position has to do with the sunset clause. I know and acknowledge that certain things have been done. I recognise that the minister has made a number of concessions. The fees to be paid by the voluntary sector have been reduced from $475 to $150 in the first year and $100 in the second year. The minister has also undertaken to extend from 10 days to 30 days the notification of intention to register, which would allow more time for lodgment of an objection. This increase from 10 days is certainly an improvement when you are considering issues of consumer protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the fact is that I am in a difficult position, and Senator Bartlett has indicated similarly. The opposition has suggested that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we amend the legislation to allow it to have a further period of three years. That would be fine except that we do have a sunset clause in the legislation at the moment. The minister has made it perfectly clear that, if the Labor Party amendment is adopted by the chamber, that would not be acceptable to the House of Representatives. That is a matter to which Senator Bartlett referred. People seeking migration advice do need protection. As I understand it, and I will ask the minister here, in the event of the House of Representatives not agreeing, the government does not intend to bring the legislation back here. I suppose it would not have the opportunity of doing so in time. And then we will be rushing across the precipice with no legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While people do need advice and protection, there needs to be some regulation. Statutory self-regulation is a better option than no regulation at all, which is a situation we could face next year. I know there are people in the government who would not mind living with that situation. I do not believe that the minister is in that category. I suspect that Senator Vanstone, the minister representing the minister, would not be in that category either. But I must say that, in the end, I really would like, and I am sure the Senate would like, some questions answered that will be able to be put to the minister once we reach the committee stage.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank senators for participating in the second reading debate. I will refer to a couple of points. I understand that Senator McKiernan, perhaps before I got here, made some remarks about the Spicer review reference group. I am advised that members were chosen for their skills and expertise, not for being representatives of any particular group. One of the six members, Ms Cheryl Webster, was with Careforce which is an Anglican Home Mission. She brought knowledge of the community sector. She had a very good understanding of the issues concerning vulnerable consumers. Senator, I was not here when you raised that point. I am not sure if it is directly on the point that you raised, but I am advised that it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9849">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of speakers have made a number of comments in relation to RACS and VIARC. I think it is probably appropriate to respond to those comments. The government agrees that all have well qualified staff&mdash;arguably, one might say, the best in the voluntary sector. The department put services for immigration advice and assistance out to tender and these two organisations were the successful tenderers. Interim contracts were offered pending the resolution of final contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out to Senator Harradine that while I am not able to be specific at the moment about funding, as negotiations are currently both organisations are likely to be funded at the same overall level this financial year as last financial year. The matter is not concluded, but I am advised that that is where it is in the negotiating stage at this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the services will be different. VIARC successfully tendered for training for voluntary agents, which is a new service type. RACS Australia has successfully tendered, as you mentioned in your speech, Senator Harradine, not just for work in Victoria but for work in New South Wales as well. While they are likely to have therefore a lesser amount of work in Victoria, they will provide a significant level of services in New South Wales. I think those points are worth making with respect to those groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to the remarks made by Senator Cooney, Senator Harradine specifically raised the issue of the misinformation to RACS with respect to the level of funding. As I am advised, the covering letter from the department was wrong although the contract was correct. The advice the following day, I think you indicated it was, was to correct the covering letter, not the contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The said amount excluded detention case work which is paid per case and referred by DIMA. The amount in the letter did include a planned amount for detention. They may or may not, I am advised, get that number of cases in funding, depending on the number of referrals for detention. The contract amount, which was attached, was minus the possible detention cases and that, in fact, was the correct amount. Detention work will be extra.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bartlett in his contribution made reference to monitoring the performance of the MIA as a registering authority. There is a formal agreement between the minister and MIA, including reporting requirements on a regular basis to the minister, which will probably be on a monthly basis and will be governed by legislation. If they are found not to be operating in the interests of consumers, the minister does have the power to withdraw the delegation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a number of other points made in speeches in the second reading debate. I think the government's response to those is reflected in the amendments which we will be moving in the committee stage.

<PARA STYLE="Para">The government has noted concerns that were raised about this bill. We have been listening. There are concerns about the short length of time allowed for the making of objections to an agent's intention to register and about the lack of a formal reporting requirement to parliament for the proposed Migration Agents Registration Authority.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9850">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has had discussions on these issues with a number of parties and has made amendments to the bill to meet these concerns. The first will extend the period of notification for intention to register as a migration agent from 10 to 30 days. That will provide a much longer period for objections to be lodged. The second will require the Migration Institute of Australia to lodge an annual report on the activities of the Migration Agents Registration Authority with the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs for tabling in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An additional concern has been the charging of registration fees for voluntary sector agents. The government appreciates the concern that has been raised by the Democrats and Senator Harradine just recently with respect to this matter. It was originally proposed that voluntary agents be charged $475 in the first year and $350 in later years. We have now agreed to reduce that amount to $150 in the first year and $100 in subsequent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a fairly dramatic concession or reduction&mdash;phrase it whichever way you will&mdash;in acknowledgment of the arguments that have been raised in favour of these voluntary groups. For the government to reduce the charge for the first year from the proposed $475 to $150 and the charge for subsequent years from $350 to $100 is a fairly clear indication that it has listened to these concerns and responded very substantially. I admit that the government has not gone as far as some would like. Some would like no fees to be charged, but nonetheless it is a very significant acknowledgment of the concerns that have raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To finance this reduction, full fee paying agents will be required to pay a fee of $800 in the second and subsequent years rather than $750. This fee structure will be reflected in the regulations to the bill. The government does not accept the proposition that agents who are employed by, or are volunteers with, community organisations should be totally free from paying a registration fee. Charging the voluntary sector agents a small registration fee&mdash;as I indicate, it is going from $475 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> down to $150 and from $350 down to $100&mdash;we believe is fair and reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is appropriate to expect voluntary agents to be responsible for making a contribution to the running of a scheme which is self&hyphen;funding rather than being fully subsidised by the other full fee paying agents. By paying a fee, we believe agents are more likely to take responsibly the task of being a competent migration agent, and that gives a degree of status to the task. In any event, many of the organisations which provide free immigration advice receive funding from Commonwealth and state governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that all senators would agree that the migration advice industry needs regulation. Senator Harradine was making some remarks with respect to this matter. This bill provides for an enhanced new regulation scheme for the industry. As senators are aware, the existing scheme is subject to a sunset clause which will come into effect in March next year. I commend the bill to senators. I ask them to ensure that we do not put ourselves in a situation where the entire industry will be unregulated and there will be no specific consumer protection available to this very vulnerable client group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be ideal if there were a longer period of time. I appreciate that. We might have all sorts of options, but we do not have that longer period of time. The sunset clause will operate in March. We are not coming back until some time in March&mdash;I am not quite sure of the date&mdash;or late February, and there will not be time to shift from the scheme that is operating now to a new scheme without creating some sort of mayhem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend Senator Harradine's advice or comments&mdash;I do not know which it was&mdash;to other senators. Despite the fact there might be some differences of opinion, I ask senators to accept that the government has made a number of amendments responding to community concerns and has committed itself today to a very significant reduction in the charges that were proposed to be charged to community groups in an effort to acknowledge the concerns that have been raised; recognise the validity of the concerns that have been raised, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9851"> in an effort to get this bill through; and ensure that we can move from here through to the sunset clause into a properly regulated system. Without doing that, we will not be providing the appropriate consumer protection to, as I say, one of the most vulnerable client groups.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition has one major concern, and it is better to put it on the table right from the beginning. At no time until Senator Harradine spoke during the second reading debate did we know that the government was considering reducing the fees that are going to apply to the non-fee charging voluntary sector. It is a breach of faith on behalf of the government to not at least inform the shadow minister of that fact. We had a briefing with the government and senior departmental figures as late as last week and we were told on that occasion that the fees were a matter for the regulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no mention of fees in our amendment. Neither Senator Harradine nor the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Senator Vanstone, were present during my speech at the second reading stage. I did refer to the issue of fees then, but I did indicate that we would be dealing with the matter of fees when the regulations came before this place. In fact, on behalf of the opposition, I warned this chamber that we might&mdash;we did not say we would&mdash;move to disallow the regulations and the fees that apply to the voluntary sector. That is a decision to be made by others in another place, but I had an authority to say that here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major movement in the fees question, whilst it might be welcome as an initial gesture, opens up somewhat of a pandora's box. During the Senate committee deliberations on the bill, the matter of fees, of course, was addressed. One of the reasons given for the levying of fees on the voluntary sector at the levels that were suggested&mdash;and remember we are talking about $475 in the first instance and then in subsequent years it would be $350 per person&mdash;was that it was the total amount needed to run the MARA when it was established.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It raises the point that, if there are going to be these substantial reductions from $475 to $150 and from $350 to $100, there is going to be a subsequent loss of revenue for the MARA. Is that going to be made up by an increased levy on the other sectors of industry, the fee charging sector? Are the fees that apply to lawyers who register as a migration agent going to be increased in order to compensate? If there is going to be a shortfall, where is it going to come from? It does raise some questions. I will make some more general comments at this time and then sit down because there is no wish on this side of the chamber to delay proceedings at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine, in his very careful and very measured second reading contribution, raised the question of funding to the various organisations. In particular, like Senator Cooney, he referred to what has happened with the Refugee Advice and Casework Service in Victoria, and I understand the minister will come back to that in some more detail. The story told to us by both Senator Harradine and Senator Cooney is being replicated in organisations like RACS right around the country. Organisations such as that which are providing a very valuable and needed service to the community are strapped for cash and, in some instances, have just had to fold up. In fact, this has happened to people who were working with ethnic communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine mentioned the dilemma we are in because of the lateness of debate on the bill, and the minister referred to this herself. The opposition have a solution to this problem. It would have been perhaps more logical to deal with the opposition's amendment No. 771 which has been circulated and which calls for the extension of the sunset provision in the bill for a further two years. I suggest it would have been more logical to deal with that amendment in the first instance, rather than dealing with the minister's amendments because if our amendment and the government's amendments are carried by the chamber, it will create some difficulties as to how the bill will be implemented and how workable it will be.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9852">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will be back here all too soon in early March and, if our amendment is carried now, there will be time in that intervening period for the minister, the department and the government to go back and revisit the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration and seek to implement the favourable provisions that were contained in that report. There was no need&mdash;and we reiterate it here again today&mdash;for a further review by Spicer. All the mechanisms were there&mdash;they were in place&mdash;and it could have been done if there was a will to do it. As I said in my speech during the second reading debate, these bills are not about protecting the vulnerable. They are about deregulation; they are about self-regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a final point I want to make, and I am trying to keep things as brief and focused as possible. The minister responded to my comments about representation of the community sector on the Spicer review. I did note that Ms Cheryl Webster, a grant&hyphen;in&hyphen;aid worker for Careforce, the Anglican Home Mission, was indeed a member of the minister's reference group. I have had a long involvement in migration with the Senate&mdash;both on the joint standing committee and on the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee&mdash;and I might say that the Anglican Home Mission is not an organisation that comes to the fore when one is looking for a community viewpoint on immigration advice. It is not one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Careforce may be in receipt of some government funding, because I note Ms Webster is a grant&hyphen;in&hyphen;aid worker with Careforce and I understand the very good work that Careforce does in a whole host of areas, including migration, not only in New South Wales but around Australia. I am not in any way seeking to denigrate it, but I would argue that the Anglican Home Mission is not an essential figure in community migration advice in Australia. There are a number of other organisations like VIARC, IARC, RACS and the Refugee Council of Australia that one would lead to, but one would not immediately think of the Anglican Home Mission when one was looking for advice on a measure of how the community 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was feeling on these matters. The precipice that Senator Harradine referred to is not there. We believe that we have put the barrier up across the top of the precipice with our amendment No. 771, which we will move at a later time in the debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the issue of charging $150 to volunteers, I think that is an excessive amount because the number of volunteers who go into organisations like this or other community legal centres are numerous and they change, so if they have to pay even $100 for them, it quickly mounts up. They might have 15 a week and that is $1,500, and the 15 they have the following week might not be the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is typical of people doing studies. They might go to university during the day, come home on Monday night and go down and do a couple of hours volunteering. On Tuesday night, they might have tennis or football training and then do some study. On Wednesday night, they might study, with football or tennis training on Thursday night. You know, Senator Vanstone, that Saturday is off to the football. You used to watch Fitzroy when they were in the league. Then there is the replay. There is church on Sunday morning perhaps, and away they go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The picture I want to paint is that these volunteers do it out of a sense of social responsibility and do it in a context where their lives and studies have to go on. To charge $100 for each of those when they

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator McKiernan, I do not know who was doing the negotiations on your side but, as I am advised, after a briefing on the bill&mdash;during which the possibility of a reduction of the fees was canvassed&mdash;the briefing concluded with, `Is there any more that you feel ready to discuss with us?'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to seek a couple more comments from Minister Vanstone. I do appreciate the willingness of the government to go some way towards reducing the burden on the voluntary sector, whilst I and the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9854"> Democrats still believe, as I indicated previously, that any fee is going to have a significant impact on them for the reasons that Senator Cooney outlined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the amendments that the government will move in relation to reporting requirements, obviously the big concern that many people have, including the Democrats, is the effect that this charging of fees will have on the voluntary sector. That certainly came out in the committee hearings on this that I have read the transcripts for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Part of the rationale that the government is putting forward is that this change is promoting competition. Concerns have been expressed by people, such as FECCA, that it will restrict competition because it will have the potential to wipe out a big chunk of the industry if it severely impacts on the voluntary sector. Certainly there was a very strong undertone in some of the comments made during the hearings, particularly from Mr Hodges, that the wiping out of the voluntary sector would not be too bad a thing, given his views on the quality of advice that they would give.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I would be seeking some assurance from the government that, in terms of the ongoing reports from the MIA about the operation of the scheme and the reports that will need to be given to the parliament under these amendments, the impact of the fees on the voluntary sector will be given close attention so that we are able to see what sort of impact it is having in the information that is provided to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to get some indication from the minister on behalf of the government that they in no way support the implication made by Mr Hodges in his evidence to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee which was very critical of the standard of advice provided by community sectors, particular the South Brisbane Immigration and Community Legal Service, which is a service in Brisbane that I have a fair bit of knowledge of over many years. It has got an extremely high reputation. In general, I believe it is important that the government not only reaffirms its commitment to services such as these but also expresses its belief&mdash;assuming 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it is its belief&mdash;that the quality of advice provided by these services is at a standard as good as the fee charging sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the suggestion was made that the standard of advice provided by the voluntary sector was not up to that of the fee charging sector and, secondly, some sort of implication, as Senator McKiernan indicated in his speech during the second reading, was made that they are not required to meet as high a standard as the fee charging sector. Certainly my understanding of this set&hyphen;up as it exists now, as well as with the new set&hyphen;up, is that the standards that they have to meet are as high. They still have to do the same training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, from my experience, the quality of advice given by the voluntary sector is very good. It is a matter of great concern to me to see such a very strong attack made upon that sector. It certainly did give me the impression that some sections of the industry would be quite pleased if the voluntary sector were wiped out by these changes. I would very much like a commitment from the government that that is not their intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, I think Senator Harradine indicated in his contribution earlier that parts of the government&mdash;and he excluded the minister from this, I think rightly&mdash;would not be too upset if the whole regulatory system did fall over come March next year and people were left with no protection in the migration industry. Again that is a situation which the Democrats would be very concerned about. Again we would be seeking a commitment of the government that they would seek to avoid that outcome.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bartlett, I can indicate that the reporting to the government will give such information as is available on the impact on the community sector, should there be one, one way or the other. The purpose of the fee on the community sector is not to discourage that sort of work by the community sector at all but to try to put all agents on a similar level, as you indicated, in terms of the training they need to undertake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not about the agents or the advisers themselves; it is about ensuring that the

We have simply taken the view that it is not appropriate for the fee paying sector to completely subsidise the community groups because they will just pass that on to their customers. We have listened to what Senator Bartlett, Senator Harradine and the community groups have said&mdash;very substantially, as Senator McKiernan has said&mdash;and a very major reduction in the fees is an acknowledgment of that.

If you have a voluntary sector where you have 50 people of the sort I described before&mdash;people who come and go&mdash;each of whom will have to pay $100, that means that the community service will have to pay $5,000 to run that show, if I can use that expression, whereas the professionals have to pay only $2,400.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I am not going to speak for very long to these amendments. I think my speech in the second reading debate was all directed towards the effect and impact that these amendments, if they were carried, would have. To explain briefly, what we are proposing to do here is to extend a sunset clause provision in the Migration Act which would mean that on 21 or 20 March next year&mdash;that is three days after St Patrick's Day&mdash;the protective provisions contained in the bill would fail to operate any more and would expire. That is what the sunset clause means. What we are proposing is that that sunset clause be extended for a further two years so that, if the government agrees to it and our amendments are carried, there will be some form of protective system in place to protect those in our community who need the protection. Practically the whole of my speech in the second reading debate was directed to that. I will not belabour the Senate further now to follow it through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just refer back to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. This was a year&hyphen;long inquiry by that joint committee. The persons who served on the committee were, indeed, distinguished and knowledgeable. The deputy chair of the committee was the shadow minister for immigration. We had Mr Clyde Holding, a former minister for immigration, on the committee. Mr Phillip Ruddock, who was a member of the committee, is now the minister. We also had Mr Ian 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Sinclair, the longest&hyphen;serving member of this parliament, a member of the other House. Ms Kathy Sullivan, a member of the other place, was also a member of the committee. I had the privilege of chairing the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the long and detailed deliberations on the scheme, in response to what the then minister said when the scheme was established, we conducted this 12&hyphen;month review. It was not something quick, cheap and nasty that happened overnight in order to bring forward a prearranged viewpoint. It was a considered report that was presented. We deliberated long and hard before the committee unanimously agreed to 49 separate recommendations to improve and enhance the protective measures that were contained in the migration agents registration scheme. It was unanimous. The current minister for immigration, who was a member of the committee, agreed to each and every one of the recommendations going forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equally important to the presentation of the report was the fact that the then government responded to the report in a relatively quick period of time, as I said in the second reading debate, within six months of its presentation. The then minister, Senator Bolkus, agreed to the majority of the recommendations. He did not agree to each and every one of them. Some he agreed to were consequential and others were suggestions to be accepted in part with modification. The first recommendation that we made was accepted in full: that the arrangements should continue. He also agreed that there should be a review. Nothing is in place forever and ever and we accept that. Even in the argument today we have not dismissed that in the long term this industry might be self&hyphen;regulatory. We have not dismissed that at all; as indeed the joint standing committee, after its year&hyphen;long deliberation, did not dismiss it either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The door is still open on that, but what is happening now is premature. The organisation for the regulation, control and policing of this industry is not, in our opinion, ready to undertake that role. It can be assisted with government funding, as indeed it has been, in order to do it, but at the moment it has not demonstrated that it can do it. It is doing very 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9859"> good work in the education and training area; there is no question about that. Together with VIARC and IARC it is doing this excellent work in preparing people. That is where I want to lead to in the questions that I want to direct to the minister at this point in time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that we do accept in the bill is that it is improving the qualifications of people who can register within the scheme. At our briefing on Tuesday of last week, less than a week ago, we were told by senior officials of the department that government funds are going to be made available to the community sector in order to assist them to meet the standards for registration to provide migration advice. If the minister is in a position now to put on the record some of those commitments by the government, we would be pleased if he could do that. There were certain sums of money talked about last week. We did not agree from this side of the chamber. We thought perhaps there might be more money. But, at this point in time, it would be worth while for the minister to put that on the record and explain, perhaps in some brief detail because time is pressing, what the qualifications for registration and reregistration would be under the new provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask those questions and I have clearly stated now and earlier in the debate that we will be pressing our amendment to extend the sunset provisions for a further two years. Nonetheless, if we press that amendment and it either is carried or falls, there will not be time to respond to these very important questions.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a couple of other questions for the minister about the operation of the legislation before we vote on this clause. Again, they go to the issue of sunset clauses. As I have indicated before, it is an impossible situation for the Senate to be in. I have indicated before that the Democrats are supportive of the aim of Labor's amendments to extend the current scheme because we believe that is the best way to go. If the government is giving a cast&hyphen;iron indication that they are not going to support the extension of the sunset clause and would be willing

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to ask some questions which link to the current bill. I note in the explanatory memorandum and, to some extent, in the minister's second reading speech that features of the amendments to the Migration Act in this bill include a sunset provision on the statutory self&hyphen;regulatory scheme that is being introduced. Could I get an indication to make it clear&mdash;because I am not 100 per cent clear&mdash;what happens when we get to the end of that sunset period, assuming the bill goes through? Will we again be faced with a situation where the government can come back with a scheme that we are not happy with and where the alternative is, `Take it or end up with nothing?' Will that be revisited on us under the sunset provision in this bill?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the last point you raised, there is often a debate amongst law reformers about the goodness or otherwise of sunset clauses because they force a relook at any situation, but all they really do is force parliament to reconsider what it wants to proceed with. Parliament has the choice of debating in the two chambers what the appropriate replacement is. While that can create a level of uncertainty, some would argue that the provision of such clauses gives parliament an opportunity rather than forcing it into a situation. The numbers will have changed in parliament by the time these clauses come up and parliament as it is then configured will decide what to do. I think that is appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make the point in respect of the opposition's amendments that if this bill is not passed we will lose an opportunity to strengthen consumer protection for what I think we are all agreed is a very vulnerable group in the community. There is an extension to sponsors, there is a universal knowledge qualification&mdash;a law degree or an existing course and test&mdash;and there will be mandatory professional development qualifications for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9860"> reregistration. Failure to live up to that will result in deregistration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe I am divulging any secrets, but at the briefing last week we were talking, I think, about a range somewhat higher but not massively higher than that figure. The point was made&mdash;if not publicly, then in the briefings&mdash;that the Migration Institute of Australia can receive something like $380,000 to set up and run the scheme for the government. There are 442 registered agents in the voluntary sector. The government is prepared to give less than $120,000 to assist those people in their continued self&hyphen;development. It is not just a one&hyphen;off thing, although possibly it is the case that $116,000 is one&hyphen;off funding. But it is a very small amount of money and it has to be compared with the $380,000 worth of taxpayers' money that has been ceded to the Migration Institute of Australia to set up the scheme and later on run the scheme on behalf of the government.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

In relation to sunset clauses, the minister outlined before that one of the potential benefits is providing the parliament with the opportunity to reconsider what it wants to proceed with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The trouble is that, in doing this, we are in a situation where, without wanting necessarily to speak for Senator Harradine's view, we potentially end up with something that is quite clearly not what the Senate wants to proceed with. We are going to get what the government wants to proceed with. That is a different thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nonetheless, it does ends up with a situation where we have basically got a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reservoir Dogs</EMPHASIS> type stand&hyphen;off: everybody has his gun loaded, cocked and pointed and ready to go. Unfortunately, on this occasion, instead of having our guns pointed at each other and threatening to fire first, we have a situation where basically the people who are going to potentially end up getting shot are the most vulnerable people&mdash;those who are seeking migration advice. That is the situation that it appears we would end up with if the Senate insisted on the ALP amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is for those reasons that, whilst the Democrats are very supportive of that path and recognise that that path is closed by the government's refusal to open that door, we wish to make it clear that that is totally a decision of the government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In normal circumstances we would insist on this and go through the process of having it sent back to the House of Representatives for the government to restate formally that it will not accept that. While that may be a partly symbolic step, it is still an important symbolic step. Given the current circumstances that we find ourselves in, with this being the last sitting week and the need to focus as much attention as possible on the extremely crucial  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 , the Democrats will not insist on going through that procedure this time around.</PARA>

Whilst that might be a game of bluff, in that sort of stand&hyphen;off situation, the Democrats are not willing to risk those who are seeking migration advice having basically no protection whatsoever. In that circumstance, the Democrats, being in the unusual situation of supporting what the amendment aims to do but fearing the risk of what it might end up achieving&mdash;having the whole scheme collapse&mdash;will be abstaining on this amendment if it is pressed to a division.</PARA></SPEECH>

Let me reinforce that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As late as Tuesday of last week, from our side of negotiations, a $475 fee was going to be imposed on every individual registered as a migration agent in the voluntary sector&mdash;that is, a person who provides migration advice for no fee. As late as last Tuesday the fee was going to move from no charge to $475. In that short period, there has been a dramatic reduction in those levels&mdash;from $475 to $150 in the first year of registration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be a game of bluff and counterbluff here. From the opposition's point of view, we gave very deep consideration to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> impact of the moving of our amendment, understanding where the government is coming from. The government has been quite categorical that, if the bill did not go through and the sunset clause arose on 21 March next year, the regulatory system that we have in place would collapse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had experience of being in government and we understand that you can get claims and counterclaims and bluff and counterbluff. I do not accept the analogy of guns pointed at heads. We are certainly not in that position. We have not been trying to get in that position. We are very strong in our position that a regulatory system must be in place to protect individuals who need immigration advice. We are very strong on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are putting forward our amendment in the position that a regulatory system will remain in place for at least two years. If the government chooses not to have a regulatory system in place from 21 March next year, that will be the government's decision. If it decides that a regulatory system is not going to be put place, that will be its problem and it will have to live with the consequences if no regulatory system is in place to at least attempt to protect the vulnerable. The government will be responsible and accountable for that. We are proposing that, with the carriage of this amendment, a regulatory system will be in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally&mdash;and I am not trying to delay this&mdash;a number of references have been made to Mr Hodges and the South Brisbane Immigration and Community Legal Centre. If our amendment is defeated and the bill goes on to pass, I will be making a very short third reading statement in regard to that matter because I do not believe that that matter should be allowed to rest.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support what Senator McKiernan has said and make a plea to Senator Bartlett to reconsider. It is not a situation where the government should be taken on face value. There will remain a government responsibility for ensuring that the migration advisory service is adequate and is proper. The opposition is saying, let us extend the current regulatory service for another two years. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9862"> problem with not taking that course is that suddenly there is a fee impost on the voluntary service given to people wanting migration advice around the country. That is going to create a great deal of pressure on that voluntary service and it is certainly going to weigh things in favour of non&hyphen;voluntary service in the community. The Greens do not think that is a good thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government ought to be tested on this. I know there are backstop positions, but they are not as strong and they are not in the interests of the non&hyphen;government sector of the community in the way that the opposition amendments are. I join with the opposition in saying we should think again about this. Think again about the impact on the community sector. On this side of the chamber, we are trying to protect that community sector and the excellent service that they provide in the field of migration advice and to stop them being clobbered by the sudden imposition of fees, which, notwithstanding the fact that they have been reduced somewhat by recent pressure on the government, are still there as an impediment to the delivery of services as we know them. I reiterate that the Greens will be supporting the Labor Party's amendment because we believe it is in the interests of the community service being provided by the voluntary sector.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should make a response to the comments made since I was asked to consider the matter. I obviously take on board seriously what people are saying. I certainly do not want to criticise anybody's approach to this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support the aim of the opposition amendments, as I said before, but they will leave us with a situation where the government, as it has stated, will not accept them, so we will therefore be in a situation where we will have no scheme in place. In his contribution, Senator Harradine referred to the fact that there are people in government who would be quite happy to have that situation occur. That is why I am quite strongly of the view that the government is not bluffing on this matter. I am not necessarily saying this about the current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock), or his representative in this chamber, Senator Vanstone, but I am very sure a number of people in the government would be very happy to have no detection or regulation over migration agents at all in place. That is the situation we are faced with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said a number of times, we are in a no&hyphen;win situation, but that is the worst outcome, as I see it, and that is why the Australian Democrats are trying to obtain the least worst outcome. That is why we are dealing with it now rather than sending it back to the other place so that it can come back here for us to go through again. In 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> normal circumstances we would do that but, as I said, due to the importance of the native title legislation, we will not press for that on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Personally, it gives me a great deal of pain to be giving even the limited support I am giving to what the government is doing&mdash;that is, to be providing some reluctant support for a situation where the community sector is to be charged fees. It is a sector I personally have had a lot of involvement with&mdash;not so much in the migration area but with lots of community legal centres, and I know the impact it will have. The government may say it will not impact, but I know it will. Yes, it is not a situation that I or the Democrats are happy with, but I would not have agreed to come into the Senate if I could not wear a bit of pain. The situation is that it is the least worst outcome rather than there being no protection at all for those who are the most vulnerable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator McKiernan said, it is a situation the government will have to live with if the whole scheme is pulled down. The impact on the voluntary sector is also something the government will have to live with. But, if we have no scheme at all in place, it will not be just the government who will have to live with it but migrants and people seeking migration advice&mdash;some of the most vulnerable people in our community. The Democrats will not support a situation that will have a very high risk of people having to live with that outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said before, I do not think a large number of people within the government will worry terribly much about having to live with that outcome, just as I do not think they will have a great deal of trouble living with the outcome of slugging the community sector. Either way, the government will have to live with it. This outcome is the least worst outcome, and that is the reason the Democrats are taking the position they are taking with these amendments.</PARA>

They changed their mind during the debate and then chose not to vote at all on the division for the second reading. I find that extraordinary. I will say nothing further on that at this point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main reason I am speaking on the third reading is to make a plea. With the passage of this bill, the MIA will be put in charge of the Migration Agents Registration Authority. There is a very great onus upon Mr Brown, the President of the MIA, to now publicly apologise for the comments one of his national executive members, Mr John Hodges, made during the Senate committee deliberations. I am not going to labour the point, but the comments that were made were quite untrue, as it appears from the five&hyphen;page letter that was given to the committee. That has been attached to the report so the comments are on the public record. Those comments should be refuted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be a measure of Mr Brown as president of the organisation, a measure of the MIA as an organisation of integrity, if it were to rule and police the integrity of the agents operating in this field, and a measure of the new body, MARA, the Migration Agents Registration Authority, if that apology were put on the public record.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats believe that the Senate should insist on this amendment. The amendment moved by the Senate was entirely reasonable. What it said was that if a person subsequently provides a tax file number and it is discovered by the tax office that that person should not have paid that surcharge, then the tax office should pay interest as well as return that surcharge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate has long campaigned for interest to be paid on overcharged and subsequently refunded tax payments. It has been a very reluctant tax office that has ever so slowly 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> started to concede that point in recent times. That the coalition has dropped its longstanding principle in support of interest on overpayment and run what is essentially the bureaucrats' line on this issue, particularly given the strong stance of Senator Kemp and others in the opposition, we think is very disappointing. The government wants to place the blame of the financial cost of its collection mechanism for the surcharge on the shoulders of ordinary taxpayers and we do not think that is acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The collecting mechanism utilising tax file numbers was not the preferred collecting mechanism. The entire collection of tax file numbers would have been unnecessary if the government had agreed to collect the tax through PAYE tax certificates as recommended by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. It and its tax office advisers chose this tax mechanism. Therefore, in our view, it is the tax office which should wear the cost of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In evidence to the committee, Jacques Martin reported that as of a couple of weeks ago, despite three requests from its members, only 23 per cent had provided tax file numbers. The tax office now says that it is up to 40 per cent and it is confident that it will get to 65 per cent. That is okay, but even if we get to 65 per cent that means that the number of people who are still paying the surcharge when they do not need to will be seven to eight times the number who should be paying it&mdash;so 2.8 million instead of 350,000. That means a windfall gain to the tax office of up to $4 billion. That is simply unacceptable and we must do everything we can to ensure that millions of Australians are not paying more tax than  they should be and we should develop policy that ensures that such an outcome is avoided if at all possible. I do not think this can be compared with the interest withholding tax situation. The interest withholding tax is an anti-avoidance provision and there is no other fairer way of collecting that tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were better alternatives to the surcharge. Indeed, if the government's assurances that the efficiency of its data matching and its advertising campaign are to be believed, then 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9867"> no high income earners should be able to avoid the tax and no low income earner should be paying the tax. It really is the government's problem. The tax office should not reap the fiscal benefit from collecting tax off low income earners who should otherwise not pay. This amendment will provide a significant incentive to the tax office to accelerate its data matching to avoid the contingent cost of the surcharge. It is good policy and, in our view, it was wrong for the House to disagree with it. The Democrats will be voting against this motion and will be calling upon the Senate to insist on our amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.52 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition does not support the government's motion to reject this amendment, and we do not do that for several reasons. Firstly, the need for this amendment highlights the absurdity of the government's superannuation surcharge tax collection method. As a general proposition, this is a tax on a third party, on a superannuation fund, resulting from the actions of a superannuation fund member. In the situation where the member does not provide their tax file number to the fund, the tax office will levy the full amount of the surcharge tax&mdash;that is, 15 per cent of surchargeable contributions on the fund. That means that low and middle income earners who do not provide their tax file numbers to their superannuation fund will pay the full 15 per cent of the surcharge tax. I have to say, that is a terrible situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the situation that I have described does occur, the member can subsequently provide their tax file number and the tax office may reassess the tax liability on the superannuation fund. This amendment is designed to bring some justice to that type of situation by ensuring the payment of interest on the amount that was wrongly collected. In the eyes of the opposition, that is a fair and reasonable thing to do. The refund should include interest on that amount which the tax office was holding unnecessarily as a result of the government's complex collection method. The money would have been earning interest had it stayed in the member's superannuation fund account, of course. That is my first 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> reason for opposing the motion of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, it is puzzling as to why the government does not accept this amendment, given that it is so confident that low and middle income earners will not pay the surcharge tax for the reason this amendment addresses. Senator Kemp told us when these bills were debated last week that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . collection rates of tax file numbers are currently in line with expectations at this stage of the process . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am not sure what Senator Kemp's expectations are, but that is contrary to the advice which some superannuation funds are giving, which is that only a small number of people are providing their tax file numbers. Even if we ignore that advice from the superannuation funds and take the government at its word, which is, of course, a risk, there is still a problem with the collection of tax file numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reportedly, there are six million individual taxpayers in Australia who are covered by superannuation. If the collection rate for tax file numbers is as high as 65 per cent, which is the figure given by the tax office, that leaves over 2.1 million people unaccounted for. The tax office assures us that it can locate another two&hyphen;thirds of those people who do not provide their tax file number, which leaves some 700,000 people unknown. That means some 700,000 people will pay the full rate of 15 per cent of surcharge tax regardless of their income level. Giving these people the opportunity to earn interest on their wrongly collected moneys is a fair and reasonable amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, the government claims that this amendment will be inconsistent with other legislation which determines the action the Australian tax office must take if a tax file number is not quoted. The inconsistencies in the government's surcharge tax legislation are legendary. There is the 15 per cent cap applying to some funds but not to others. There is the inconsistent collection method depending on what type of fund you are in. There are the allocated surplus amounts inconsistencies. There are the inconsistencies between defined benefit funds and accumula 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9868"> tion funds. The surcharge tax is inconsistent with any sense of fairness or reasonableness that can be applied. At least this amendment seeks to redress those inconsistencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government also claims that there may be an incentive for someone not to provide their tax file number in the hope of receiving a nil assessment from the tax commissioner. I assume that the government is arguing that the incentive applies to high income earners and not to low income earners. According to the government, low and middle income earners will not pay the tax anyway. If they do, they can give their tax file number and get their money back with interest if this amendment is insisted upon. If a high income earner does not provide their tax file number, the tax office will be able to charge them the full rate and they will not receive any refund if they subsequently provide their tax file number. Therefore, there is no reason for the ATO to pay interest. I am not sure where the incentive not to provide your tax file number comes from, providing the tax office is doing its job properly, which we all assume it will be doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In those circumstances, with 700,000 taxpayers possibly caught in this net, the only conclusion one can come to is that the reason why the government will not support this amendment that was previously made by the Senate is that it is aware that it can make a windfall out of inadvertence. People, particularly low and middle income earners, who are not aware of or who have not had impressed upon them the need to provide their tax file number to avoid paying the 15 per cent surcharge tax will get caught. The government does not mind if they get caught because it will not ensure that the value of their money is adequately maintained by the payment of interest on money wrongly collected. It does not mind because it makes a windfall gain itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an insidious, hidden form of taxation which, because of the government's recalcitrance on this point, has to be laid at its door. It will be able to secretly collect a tax without people being aware of how they can adequately protect themselves against it. When they do wake up, they will not have the value of their 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> money adequately maintained because the government will not pay interest on tax wrongly collected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a mean&hyphen;spirited, narrow-minded approach by the government. It does reflect what many commentators these days describe as the attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to these things&mdash;that is, mean, narrow and shifting the burden on to the battlers, whom the government sometimes pretends that it represents. If the government does represent the battlers, it will drop off on this amendment. If it does not represent them, it will pursue it. The fact that the government is pursuing this amendment leads inexorably to the conclusion that it does not care, and it is prepared to push this matter right to the limit and threaten the Senate with the prospect of using this bill as a trigger. That is an outrageous proposition, and I look forward to hearing from the minister some sort of ameliorating explanation, which I am sure he cannot provide.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no dispute that criminal activity associated with violence has been a difficult problem for PNG in recent years and that injuries and deaths have resulted therefrom. That is what I have just said. There is nothing new in that, unfortunately. As Senator Ray knows, the Australian government has given advice to Australian citizens from time to time in PNG about ways in which they could reduce the risk of being injured or worse as a result of these gangs.

The headline CPI fell 0.3 per cent over the year to September, reflecting the very big falls in home mortgage rates that this government has been able to achieve. The government's strategy is producing the goods. Home mortgage rates are the lowest since the late 1960s and rates available to small business are the lowest in possibly a quarter of a century. That is the positive proof that this government is delivering for families and delivering for business.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Watson for this most important question. Today marks one of the most significant reforms in 50 years in relation to improving services for job seekers. Commonwealth funding of $16.2 million has been contracted out to more than 300 private and community agencies to find jobs for up to 65,000 unemployed people. These agencies will compete with the CES, which today is being managed by the government owned employment placement enterprise. To mark this changeover and the new services for job seekers and employers, the government owned company was launched yesterday under its new name: Employment National Ltd. The new arrangements are part of a transition to the contracting out of $1.7 billion to private, community and public employment agencies from 1 May next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The improved services will provide significant benefits to job seekers, employers and taxpayers. Put simply, the new services will ensure more unemployed people get jobs. From today, private job placement agencies will be paid a fee when, and only when, an unemployed person is placed in a job. The focus on jobs will continue from 1 May next year, when providers will only be paid their full major fees after an unemployed person has been placed in a job for 26 weeks. Incentives will also be targeted to the most needy job seekers, with long&hyphen;term unemployed and other disadvantaged groups attracting the highest placement fees.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9872">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes will be a welcome relief for taxpayers as they see government funds being used to place unemployed people in real jobs. Job seekers will no longer be put on short&hyphen;term training merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;rounds. Funds will not be wasted as they were under Labor, which threw away hundreds of millions of dollars on schemes that simply led nowhere. Job seekers and employers will benefit from a wider range, a wider choice, of expert employment agencies providing flexible assistance tailored to their individual placement needs. There will be an increased share of job vacancies open to unemployed people. This is because the new expert service providers will have greater access to job vacancies&mdash;many more than the 20 per cent of jobs currently available through the CES.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The changes mean that the government can now make a number of firm commitments to job seekers, employers and the community. Firstly, a commitment will be that unemployed people will get jobs. Secondly, job seekers will not be churned through short&hyphen;term training programs that simply lead nowhere. Thirdly, assistance will be tailored to job seekers' and employers' individual needs. Job seekers will no longer be forced into inflexible bureaucratic programs that do not help them get jobs. Finally, under this coalition government, taxpayer dollars will never again be wasted on schemes that can cost up to $143,000 per net job outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These commitments should be measured against the commitment of the Labor Party. The only commitment they have offered is that they are going to return to Working Nation and that, as we know, is in sharp contrast to what we are offering today. We want unemployed people to get jobs, but the opposition want to bring back the $10 billion deficit and Working Nation, which simply did not work.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister, in taking this argument to Kyoto, is defending all Australians against the unacceptable demands of other nations. He is arguing that the aim should be equality of economic sacrifice not equality in target emission reductions. It is a position that all Australians should support.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As a broad based representative of Australian industries, I think the ACCI puts the position fairly and well. We are putting a position in Kyoto that will enable Australia to more than pull its weight. Unlike most other parties in the negotiation, we will implement the commitments that were part of the Prime Minister's recently announced $180 million statement, come what may. We will do this because we believe they are good domestic policy and they will have a significant effect on reducing domestic greenhouse gases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said many times in this place before, we do want to be part of a good outcome in Kyoto where we pull our weight and we contribute to an ultimate stabilisation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Our complaint that Senator Lees has had trouble in understanding is that we can see no reason why Australia should take an unfair share of the burden, particularly when abatement costs in Australia are higher than those of practically any other party in this negotiation. In other words, the economic cost on a uniform reduction will be greater for Australia than for another party. Or, put yet another way, the cost in Australian jobs will be greater for Australia than for other parties in this negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian government is interested in protecting Australian jobs. As a result of the recent statement, we have gone beyond no regrets for the first time. We are prepared to take economic sacrifice to contribute to a better global greenhouse outcome, but it has to be a fair share of the burden&mdash;or an equali

The policy has been developed to a stage that it is capable of being announced and finality will be reached on it. I am sure that the minister has been working on it on a regular basis. He would not have been prompted by something that appeared in a newspaper today, whether it was correct or not. He has been working on this, as Senator Faulkner knows, and we will come up with a policy that is in the best interests of the people who are in nursing homes and the people who are providing nursing care. We would not be in this position but for the neglect that has been produced in the nursing homes by 13 years of Labor. They had to do something about it, but they left us with a crisis in relation to nursing homes in this country which we now have to fix up.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In 1992, the Australian government&mdash;a Labor government&mdash;signed up to stabilise Australian emission rates at 1990 levels by the year 2000. In the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression, our emission levels continued to rise. That demonstrates how difficult it is to restrain emission growth in Australia. Even at times of major economic difficulty, major recession, emissions still rise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do they continue to rise? Firstly, because of the growing population in Australia and secondly because the profile of our economy differs significantly from that of most others within the Kyoto negotiations. We are much more energy dependent in terms of our GNP, both in terms of energy production direct and energy intensive production. The combination of both of those&mdash;an examination of our economic profile and an examination of the population growth&mdash;demonstrates how difficult it is for us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may not interest the Australian Democrats but, between 1990 and the year 2020, our population is expected to grow by about 30 per cent, whereas the European Union population is expected to grow by 1.7 per cent. They have a stable population, ours will increase by 30 per cent, and yet the Australian Democrats say that we should be doing as well as the European Union in its pledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is another way of saying the same thing. What they are arguing is that we should be accepting a much greater economic sacrifice than other parties. That is what we are not prepared to do; but we are prepared to make reasonable efforts to reduce our emissions. The package brought down by the Prime Minister in the week before last is evidence of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That package will significantly reduce emissions across a whole range of areas on both the sources and sink side. It will reduce emissions direct and it will increase the scope of sources to absorb carbon dioxide from the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9878"> atmosphere, thus having the same effect. It is the equivalent in sacrifice to that position put down by most of the other key negotiators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is easy for a particular local or state government to come out and say, `We will do better.' If they can, I welcome it. In fact, we are working with the Local Government Association to help local government contribute to a better national bottom line. As the Democrats may be aware, we were initiating a program&mdash;the cities for climate change in Australia&mdash;in which we were embracing some 30 councils to contribute better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That will be done through an education program. They will have to keep a record of emissions, look for ways of abatement, and then keep a record of performance. We have now expanded that very significantly&mdash;some sixtyfold in expenditure&mdash;and we are putting in $13 million to build that number up to 300 councils Australia&hyphen;wide. In terms of their own emissions and their capacity to influence the behaviour of their ratepayers, local councils can play a significant role and help us contribute to a better national outcome. We will work with state and local governments that want to contribute to better outcomes and we will achieve that goal.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Payne for the question. Yes, today is World AIDS Day. Australia has a very good record in relation to the containment of the epidemic that has afflicted the world. First and foremost, many people in Australia would want to commemorate and remember the loss of friends, relatives and loved ones to HIV&hyphen;AIDS. Many events happening across Australia in cities and in small country towns are allowing people to do this.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian response to the HIV&hyphen;AIDS epidemic is acknowledged as one of the best in the world and is often characterised by enlightened pragmatism. In Australia, we can take some pride in the success we have achieved in containing the HIV&hyphen;AIDS epidemic. Australia has recorded 20,706 HIV infections. We have moved from a peak infection rate of approximately 3,000 in 1983 to about 500 new infections annually. Deaths from AIDS have now dropped to an all&hyphen;time low since notification commenced. The cornerstone of Australia's response to HIV&hyphen;AIDS has been a partnership forged in the early days of the epidemic between the affected communities, government at all levels and medical, scientific and health care profession 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9880"> als. It was bipartisan. It is, however, important for HIV&hyphen;AIDS awareness to be maintained and improved in light of the absence of a vaccine or cure and continued discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A meeting of the parliamentary liaison group held only last week reaffirmed our non&hyphen;partisan approach to Australia's response to HIV&hyphen;AIDS. At the same time, we need to recognise that Australia is part of a world&hyphen;wide epidemic in which children are major casualties. That is why we have this year adopted the United Nations theme `Give children hope in a world with AIDS'. Every day, 1,000 children around the world become infected with HIV and 350,000 children died from AIDS in 1996. More than nine million have lost their mothers to AIDS, and that is particularly so on the continent of Africa.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the global nature of the epidemic and its impact on Australia, the government is committed to building on past successes and improving current responses. In order to sustain the low rate of incidence of HIV&hyphen;AIDS, the government, in partnership with the appropriate community and government agencies, is responding in a number of areas. Each year, over $2 million is spent at the federal level on national education initiatives for those at risk of or affected by HIV&hyphen;AIDS. This activity is complemented at state and territory level by locally targeted education activity. Our education activity focuses on those groups identified in the third national HIV&hyphen;AIDS strategy as being at increased risk of infection: homosexually active men, injecting drug users and the indigenous community, where there is also potential risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been many recent media reports of the possibility of a vaccine and cure for HIV&hyphen;AIDS. Initial media reports falsely implied that the advances in new combination therapies in the treatment of HIV&hyphen;AIDS may cure a person of the disease and end the epidemic. Combination therapies have been shown to increase the lifespan and improve the health status of people with HIV who are receptive to the therapies. However, to date there is no scientific evidence that HIV can be completely eradicated from the body through combination therapies. Therefore, at this point in time the aim of combination treatments is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to offer a long&hyphen;term suppression of the HIV virus in an infected person. An indication of the success of combination therapies is a reduction in an individual's HIV viral load.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), to questions without notice asked by Senator Faulkner today, relating to nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What we have, I think, through the media exposure of Minister Smith's letter to Mr Howard is a unique insight into how the Howard government does business. It really again demonstrates the hopeless mire that this government has managed to immerse itself in in nursing home policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a letter from a very desperate minister to an incompetent Prime Minister. It really does show, quite clearly, that there has been another secret increase in the annual nursing home up-front fee. Until he was exposed in the media today by three press articles, Mr Warwick Smith had absolutely no intention of making his ministerial statement on the government's plans for elderly Australians&mdash;none whatsoever. It is just another example of this government's failure to honour due process and its total inability to accept the forms and conventions of good government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 5 November we had the Prime Minister appear on national television to announce the government's nursing home policy&mdash;a wholesale backflip, as senators would recall. He stated at that time that the annual payment for nursing home fees would be $4,000. This was announced on television without the benefit of any cabinet consideration and without the benefit of a cabinet committee looking at the proposal. There was no departmental submission or involvement in Mr Howard's proposals and no adherence to the watered down 10-day rule, the five-day rule of the Howard government. It was just pandemonium and panic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 7 November Mr Smith indicated at a doorstop that the fee would be $4,380, as I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9883"> mentioned in question time today. On 13 November the same minister said he would make a ministerial statement in parliament on 17 November, the same day, as we now know, as cabinet met to overturn his announced position that the fee would be $4,380 per annum. Now we have a leaked letter outlining that cabinet decision that was made on 17 November and which set the annual fee at $5,500. That is a rise of about $1,500 in 12 days. I think that is a pretty substantial amount for any elderly Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that on 17 November the matter was dealt with below the line. Again, we know that there was no formal cabinet submission and that there was no benefit of departmental advice on this matter. Again, the five&hyphen;day rule was not adhered to. In fact, the whole thing smacks of a cover&hyphen;up. Today we know that Mr Smith has written to Mr Howard. He made it absolutely clear. He said, `Let's not get this out in the public arena. We'll settle the remaining issues progressively without reopening the issue in the media.' He said he wanted to avoid making a ministerial statement in the House, but, unfortunately for Mr Smith, he has been forced into it today because he has been exposed in the media. He has been exposed. He has no choice but to come into the parliament and make a statement&mdash;or we think it is going to be in the parliament even though it is not on the order of business for the House of Representatives. It is just another panic move, just another example of decision making on the run and just another example of poor cabinet process from this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, today Mr Smith wrote a letter saying, `Oh, Prime Minister, please waive the five&hyphen;day rule of cabinet accordingly and deal with this matter,' in order to try to cover up the aged care shemozzle that the Howard government has been responsible for. What can Minister Herron, the Minister representing the Minister for Family Services, do in this place? All he can do is blame the public servants for leaking the letter. What we have exposed again today is extraordinarily poor process, another cover&hyphen;up and another example of the Howard government not honouring

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even if it was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> , these journalists really are scratching to come up with a story like that. The fact is that we all have to come back to the realities of the situation. The realities of the situation are that, in Australia, we have an ageing population. In the next 25 years the number of people over 65 is going to increase by some 48 per cent. That is a huge problem that we have to deal with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other reality we have to deal with is the fact that nursing homes in Australia are of very poor quality. They are of very poor quality because the Labor Party in 13 years of government let them degenerate into the appalling state that they are in today. Something like 40 per cent of the residents of nursing homes share a bedroom with four or more people, 13 per cent of nursing homes do not meet fire regulations and 11 per cent of nursing homes do not meet health regulations. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9884"> These are realities which the Labor Party government did not deal with but the present federal government is determined to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have introduced a program&mdash;copied, I might say, from the Labor Party&mdash;to improve the standard of nursing homes. The original proposal was that accommodation bonds be paid. Because that seemed to be causing a certain amount of problem in the community, that policy has been changed. The fact remains that, to achieve improvements in nursing homes, a certain amount of money has to be generated. The government has come up with a very reasonable proposal, which perhaps needs a bit of finetuning, but that is occurring. The purpose of this is to improve the standard of nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to look at Labor's record in nursing homes. The reality is that Labor cut funding for capital expenditure for nursing homes in a very substantial way. In 1992&hyphen;93, $45 billion was available to nursing homes for capital purposes. Under the Keating government, by 1995-96 this had dropped to $10.7 million&mdash;a 75 per cent reduction in the amount of capital available for improvement in nursing homes. Even though the Labor Party was very much aware, we must understand, of the appalling conditions in the nursing homes of Australia they actually cut funding by 75 per cent. The then Minister for Finance, who was ultimately responsible for that decision, was none other than Kim Beazley, the great and glorious leader of the Labor Party today who, one must presume, is behind all the stirring up that has been going on and the fear and scaremongering which the Labor Party is seeking to engender in the elderly people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party left the community without enough funding for nursing homes and this government has come up with some very reasonable policies to ensure that there is adequate funding for nursing homes. I think that that exposes, as nothing else could, the hypocrisy of the claims made by the Labor Party today. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is it little wonder that Senator Eggleston can give no credence to the authen 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ticity of a document that the Minister for Family Services, Mr Smith, wrote to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I believe Senator Eggleston because who would want to believe what is in this letter and the sneaky, opportunistic way in which it is written.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is a government professing transparency and honesty in every set of public platitudes they issue, but behind the scenes they write letters like this saying, `We're going to cover up. We're not going to tell the truth. We're going to try to sleaze our way through what has been a very difficult political issue for us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the first breakdown in this government occurred when they abolished the 10&hyphen;day rule for cabinet submissions, which was always there so all cabinet ministers would have notice of the issues coming up and be able to give them due consideration. This government cut that rule from 10 days to five.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we have in this instance? The five&hyphen;day rule has not been applied. The matter was bought under the line in cabinet&mdash;that is, without a formal circulation of a submission and without the considered views of the Department of Health and Family Services. You can ambush the rest of the ministers and send a letter around, which was copied by the way, to only the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), the Treasurer (Mr Costello), the Minister for Finance and Administration (Mr Fahey) and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott). When the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron, blames public servants for leaking this particular Smith letter to the Prime Minister maybe they should put the Federal Police onto those four ministers first just to make sure that they were not the ones who leaked the letter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are seeing here is an absolute replica of what happened a month ago. When the Prime Minister went on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> to announce enormous nursing home changes, what were all the officials of the Department of Health and Family Services doing at 6.30 at night? They were sitting in front of their televisions with their notebooks and pens out seeking guidance on the new policy because 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9885"> this was the very first time they had heard anything about this change in policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only has this government got rid of the five&hyphen;day rule by going under the line, they have completely revamped the way cabinet submissions are put in. I will tell you why. Cabinet submissions have been traditional over the years. They are meant to be concise. They are meant to have restrictions as to their wordiness, but the full explanation as to what is behind a cabinet submission is put in the attachments. Sometimes you might get attachment C through to J. I am certain Senator Bob Collins has seen them through to attachment R. All the things at the back of the submission explain the details of the submission and contain views of other departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has this government done? It has scrapped that. They still exist, but they do not circulate them. They are paranoid about leaking but even more concerned about the complexity that will stress ministers like Senator Herron who do not have the competence to go through them. What they do with all those attachments is lodge them in the cabinet office. That is the office that got expelled from Prime Minister and Cabinet over a turf war because they would not pay rent. They are now down in this building.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to access those particular attachments you go and read them down there, which is, I suppose, fair enough. Guess who has the loneliest job in the world? It is the guardian of the attachments. He sits down there day after day expecting some forlorn minister to come down and actually read these detailed cabinet submissions. No appearance your honour. No&hyphen;one in this intellectual government, no&hyphen;one in this government that wants to consider policy in detail, goes down there. Next they will have comics and pictures in their cabinet submissions. They are not interested in looking at the detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hence Mr Smith raises these issues under the line. Hence Mr Smith says that it will be vital to avoid re&hyphen;ignition of the issue in the media. What they intended to do was to sneak their policy through today, issue the odd departmental guidance, issue no press release or ministerial statement and have no transparency and let it slide through. When they got 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sprung in this morning's press they suddenly panicked at the cabinet meeting and they decided to have a ministerial statement later today. I do not mind that, but Senator Herron claimed that this was always planned. It was not on their <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. It is something they are going to put in additionally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government of Nixonian proportions absolutely determined to cover up these issues, to dampen down public debate and to deceive the public. Why did they not announce their $5,500 or whatever cap instead of the $4,380 cap? They thought they could sneak it through without debate.</PARA></SPEECH>

In another debate in which I participated in this chamber last week, I accused this government of being a government of division and distortion.

Australians need to ask themselves whether or not they have a Prime Minister they can trust, whether or not they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9887"> have a government they can trust and whether or not any aged Australians today would believe anything that this government have to say. Why would any Australian believe anything they have to say?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard speakers from the government say to us today that you should not believe everything you read in the newspaper. I say to Australians today: you should not listen to everything you hear on a television set, particularly when it comes out of the mouth of the Prime Minister of this government, Mr Howard. The Minister for Family Services (Mr Warwick Smith) put out a press release on 13 November. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I have listened carefully and have acted to ensure certainty and clarity for consumers who enter nursing homes. I'll be taking action to ensure that we now communicate this clearly to older people, their families and others in the aged care sector", Mr Smith said.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key issue is the cap on the daily accommodation charge which replaces the accommodation bond for nursing home level residents. Cabinet discussed this issue and agreed on a cap of $5500 on 17 November.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was just four days after the minister put out his press release. What is more outrageous is that the Prime Minister got up in the House on the same day, 17 November, and said:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">What he did not say to them was that they had in mind changing what they had publicly said their policy was just four days beforehand. I also indicate that on 24 November in an answer in the House the minister again said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us revisit the ALP's record on this area. The ALP government reduced capital funding to nursing homes by 75 per cent between 1992&hyphen;93 and 1995-96. A cut of 75 per cent and you have the audacity to stand here and criticise our policy. You deliberately ran down the nursing home sector. Bob Gregory warned the then government&mdash;you&mdash;in 1985 that $125 million was needed to upgrade nursing homes. At the last election, the ALP&mdash;your government&mdash;had 200 words on your aged care policy, less than a page. Two hundred words signified your commitment to older Australians.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madame President, I wish to comment on the twelfth report tabled today by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties entitled the Australia&hyphen;Indonesia Maritime Delimitation Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treaty is an important one as it further establishes the seabed and water column boundaries between the two countries after more than two decades of deliberation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia and Indonesia have conducted a series of maritime boundary delimitation negotiations since the late 1960's that have resulted in three treaties being concluded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that the treaties negotiated to date have treated the seabed differently from the water column. Primarily, this is because recognition of continental shelf jurisdiction in international law predated the recognition of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) jurisdiction. That is to say, the concept of the EEZ was not known to international law at the time of the negotiation of the 1971 and 1972 seabed treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, the principle of natural prolongation that suggested using features such as the Timor Trough in maritime boundary delimitation had been progressively eroded and ultimately rejected in a series of International Court of Justice cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australia&hyphen;Indonesia Maritime Delamination Treaty finalises maritime boundaries between Australia and Indonesia in those areas which were not covered by existing treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The three boundaries finalised by the Treaty are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and seabed boundary between Christmas Island and Java;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The western extension of the seabed boundary between continental Australia and Indonesia;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The EEZ boundary between continental Australia and Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The boundaries delimited by the Treaty stretch over approximately 3,000 kms. The treaty provides Australia with security of jurisdiction over the relevant offshore resources south of these boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main recommendations made by the Joint Standing Committee are as follows: 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9894">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government review the 1974 traditional fisher Memorandum of Understanding with Indonesia in light of the changes to the EEZ boundary in the vicinity of the Ashmore Islands;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Government review the issue of ongoing Indonesian traditional fisher access to Australian waters and its impact on the sustained management of Australian fish resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Government review existing or established reciprocal maritime scientific research arrangements with Indonesia to facilitate cross&hyphen;border access for Australian researchers in the vicinity of Christmas Island. This co&hyphen;operative approach benefits both countries with respect to ecological issues arising out of activities such as fishing and exploration (pp. 47&hyphen;49).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The treaty highlights good working relations between neighbours. It exemplifies the manner in which the two countries are able to work together to resolve issues of common concern and achieve productive outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Treaty represents a good outcome for Australia and has been welcomed by the resources industry and by the relevant State and Territory Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry raised a number of complex resource management issues including fisheries matters, natural resource exploration and exploitation issues, and boundary enforcement. It also has ramifications for the local fishing industry, illegal immigration and environmental management as well as the need for adequate consultation with the local communities on Christmas Island.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A specific recommendation of the Committee was that the Commonwealth departmental officials conduct a thorough consultation process on Christmas Island with officials and the local community prior to ratification in order to explain the provisions of the Maritime Delimitation Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the significance of the issues, and the number of specific questions yet to be resolved, it is imperative that the Committee continue its ongoing deliberations and discussions in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has come to the view that the Delimitation Treaty represents a satisfactory outcome for Australia and makes a useful contribution to Australian&hyphen;Indonesian bilateral relations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The treaty does establish separate water column and seabed boundaries that result in areas of overlapping jurisdiction. Based on historical precedent, any solution to the maritime boundaries between the two countries would have involved separate boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This situation represents a fair and equitable outcome which will be maintained through mutual cooperation and management. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to make mention of the fact that the local community on Christmas Island sought an equidistant boundary with Indonesia. However, the Committee believes that had that option gone to international arbitration, Australia may not have received as good an outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of Indonesian traditional fisher access to the area prescribed by the 1974 memorandum of understanding was also raised as a matter requiring clarification. The Committee agreed that, while moving the boundary a further 12 nm to the north of the Ashmore Islands represents a significant gain for Australia, it does nethertheless create an anomaly with the current memorandum of understanding boundary which has an impact on boundary enforcement. In light of this change, the Committee has recommended further review of the MOU.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has no doubt that this treaty will create certainty for resource exploration and exploitation, particularly in relation to potential oil and gas fields. With respect to shared resources, such as fish stocks, we have recommended that the Government review existing agreements with Indonesia to ensure that suitable management controls are in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During our public hearing on Christmas Island a number of important environmental and immigration issues were raised by the local community. However an issue of concern was the apparent lack of consultation with the community on Christmas Island. The Committee had received some conflicting statements from Western Australian and Northern Territory Departments over the level and adequacy of consultation throughout the process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was in response to these issues that the committee made the recommendation that the Government establish cooperative marine scientific research provisions with Indonesia, and that it review the issues of illegal immigration and marine pollution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that, at the very least, this remote island community should have been given the opportunity to put forward its views in preparing the National Interest Analysis. In turn, the Committee has recommended that departmental officials go to Christmas Island and conduct a thorough briefing with officials and the local community prior to ratification of the treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madame President, this inquiry was an interesting and challenging task, dealing with a bi&hyphen;lateral relationship of fundamental importance to Australia. The treaty serves as a model of bilateral cooperation in the region. This would not have been possible without the productive dialogue between our Minister for Foreign Affairs the Hon. Alexander Downer and the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9895">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By any measure, the treaty is of significance to Australia because it settles the issue of seabed jurisdiction and provides a firm basis for the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the seabed in a climate of confidence. The treaty is a boost to the broader bilateral relationship between Australia and Indonesia and contributes to the strengthening of security for the broader region,.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no surprise at all that the agreement was reached so quickly. Australia's negotiators may well have been naive in their expectations. I obviously have not had a chance to read the 12th report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties but I will be looking at it carefully, as will be a number of my constituents who have shown a particular interest in this issue. There has been a lot of interest in this treaty from the points of view of such things as security, greenhouse studies in the future; most importantly, marine resources and the ecosystem between Australia and Indonesia; the implications for the Timor Gap treaty; and many other issues. In particular, I have been advised of areas around Christmas Island where we have reduced the size of Australia's boundaries, which has implications for safety and rescue. There is a lot of interest in this area from the fishing industry, marine conservationists, scientists and people interested in the way treaties are made between two countries. As I say, I will be looking carefully at the report that this committee has presented.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we suspended the sitting for lunch, I was concluding my remarks on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, the opposition, and saying why we do not support the government's motion. I do not wish to unduly prolong the proceedings of the chamber but I think it is worth while bringing my remarks 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9896"> to conclusion by making the following two points: first of all, the point I was summarising when we suspended for lunch was that the government has made great play in this nation that it is a government for the battlers; yet this measure it is insisting on will penalise the very people it claims to support&mdash;namely, the battlers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment the government is insisting on is that if the Australian Taxation Office collects unfairly a payment on behalf of a worker contributor to a superannuation scheme and the tax office has use of that contributor's funds and it is later found that the funds were unfairly collected, then the funds are returned to the individual. So far, so good. The normal circumstances are though that, where the tax office returns funds that have been unfairly collected, an interest payment is made so that the value of the money&mdash;while it was retained by the tax office&mdash;does not deteriorate to the disadvantage of the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment means that the government proposes not to pay that interest so that if the funds are unfairly collected, then the value of the money will deteriorate to the disadvantage of the individual and the improper collection of the funds will not be something that the government wants to address. I want to cite two reasons why that is a reprehensible situation. Last week I read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of a survey of the superannuation industry conducted by the superannuation firm Jacques Martin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were two significant findings in that survey. One was that 70 per cent of the respondents&mdash;bear in mind these are the companies that deal with superannuation in Australia&mdash;believed that the government's push for so&hyphen;called choice of fund is a good thing, and 69 per cent of those surveyed&mdash;bearing in mind that this is the industry that manages superannuation&mdash;believed that superannuation beneficiaries would lose money because of the government's insistence on choice of fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cite those two figures because the reason is quite obvious. The superannuation fund managers operate as intermediaries managing the funds on behalf of the beneficiaries, that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is, the contributors, or, in this case, the workers of Australia. The bigger the choice, the more the bureaucratic responsibility taken on by the funds and the more money the funds managers earn. The people who pay for that are the beneficiaries&mdash;the workers who make the contributions and ultimately stand to gain. What we have is a survey which pinpoints that the superannuation industry will make a bigger profit at the expense of the beneficiaries because of this government measure. That simply promotes the industry. The real people that we should be concerned about here are the beneficiaries. It is their money that is being managed; it is their retirement nest egg that is being eroded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that, we now have another measure where people are required to contribute their tax file number voluntarily. If they do not do so, and their tax file number cannot be identified, they automatically have a 15 per cent tax imposed on them&mdash;laughingly called by this government a surcharge&mdash;even if their income is below $70,000 a year, which is the cut&hyphen;off point by the government. When later their tax file number becomes known the funds are repaid but not the interest on the money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Added to that situation, there is in today's Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> an article, which appears in the business pages on page 6, headed `Tax file numbers don't add up'. The author is someone called Beth Quinlivan. She cites a fund by way of an example, and I propose to draw the Senate's attention to this by quoting from the article. She cites a Mr Michael Lillicrap, chief executive of the 700,000&hyphen;strong Retail Employees Fund. He said that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . about 10 per cent of its members had provided TFNs. That was after spending $250,000 on direct member mail&hyphen;outs and providing workplace information.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If I can interpolate, 10 per cent of 700,000 members had provided the necessary tax file numbers. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  story goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said they were not disappointed at the response rate. It was about the level they would expect based on previous experience and probably better than that of some other industry funds. By targeting the mail&hyphen;out, they had managed to gather the TFNs of more than half of those categorised as high risk, basically people who were receiving 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9897"> more than $2000 a year in super and therefore would not qualify for the exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This left about 28,000 people who would probably end up paying the tax unnecessarily.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, we have the chief executive of a 700,000&hyphen;strong fund saying that 28,000 members of that fund would probably end up paying the tax unnecessarily. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The experience of the large funds and large superannuation administrators is at ods with recent ATO statements, that 65 per cent of super fund members had provided their TFNs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The tax office believes that 65 per cent of superannuation fund members had provided their tax file numbers. Here is, printed today, a report of a 700,000&hyphen;strong fund saying only 10 per cent have. What do you conclude from this? You can conclude that there is a wide variation between what the optimists at the tax office say will be the outcome and what the practical managers in the field say is the empirical evidence of an outcome. The only conclusion from both those points that has been now established is that a large number of Australians will be unnecessarily taxed. Yet the government wants to persist with this amendment which will punish them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no argument: that is unfair. That is totally unfair. It is for those reasons that the opposition will stand up and protect the right of those people not to be unfairly punished. We will insist that this amendment stand, and that the Senate returns it to the House and tells the government to actually do what it tells Australian battlers it is supposed to do for them&mdash;stand up for them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, let me underline the point that the government has accepted all of the Senate's amendments, with the sole exception of the amendment relating to the payment of interest on re&hyphen;assessment where a tax file number was not initially provided. Despite what Senator Cook has said, as I have indicated in this chamber on a number of occasions, no low or middle income earner need be subject to the surcharge&mdash;all they have to do is supply their tax file number.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of glaring omissions in Senator Cook's rhetoric. First of all, no 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> surcharge is imposed on accounts that existed before 7 May 1997 unless the surchargeable contributions exceed the contributor's threshold of $2,000&mdash;a very important amendment put through by the Senate, accepted, and not mentioned once in the remarks by Senator Cook. Further, the commissioner must write to the member twice, advising him or her of the consequences of failing to quote a tax file number, before the surcharge can be imposed&mdash;not mentioned once by Senator Cook. It is interesting that the Labor Party seeks to pretend to protect the battlers. The reality is what they sought to do all through this debate is to stop the payment of a surcharge by high income earners. The Labor Party got itself into that difficult position and now tries to pretend that it is protecting the battlers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all the remarks that you made, Senator Cook, you forgot two rather essential points, and I bring those to the Senate's attention. In relation to the amendment&mdash;I have been asked to keep this very brief as I understand agreements have been reached&mdash;it is simply not appropriate to provide an incentive to people who do not provide their tax file number. In all other instances where the ATO has assessed an individual, interest will be applied. However, where the overassessment arises from a deliberate decision on the part of a fund member not to quote their tax file number, interest should not be given. The amendment would result in inconsistent consequences for the failure to quote a tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other legislation administered by the Commissioner of Taxation interest is not applied to amended assessments after the quotation of a TFN. For example, failure to quote a TFN results in tax being withheld at the top marginal rate on salary and wages paid by an employer, payments under the prescribed payments system and reportable payment system and bank accounts. Subsequent quotation of a TFN in these circumstances will allow the taxpayer to claim a credit for the tax withheld but no interest is payable. Therefore, what we are doing is perfectly consistent with what I believe was done by the previous government. We therefore urge the Senate to ensure that this bill is

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 58 ensures that the limitation period for claims for compensation runs from the time at which the act giving rise to the compensation is notified. In other words, the six&hyphen;year limit on compensation claims will run from the time of notice, and that notice must go to registered native title bodies corporate, registered native title claimants and representative bodies for the area affected by the compensable act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 61 is a government amendment which flows from the report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund. We believe that the word `unduly' should be added, in order that the cultural and customary concerns may be taken into account by the Federal Court, but not where to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9900"> do so would `unduly prejudice' the other parties. We think that this relaxation is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In general, the issue of the rules for the Federal Court, from the government's point of view, should be based on giving the court discretion and the relevant flexibility in handling these matters. We certainly agree that the court should be able to take account of cultural and customary concerns. We provide accordingly. We have accepted that our previous proposition that they should not do so where it would prejudice the other parties was too tight. We think adding the word `unduly' is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to remember we are now talking about a different situation from that which prevailed in 1993. We are now clearly dealing with the situation where native title claims can and will involve a range of other parties&mdash;other title holders, other permit holders, et cetera&mdash;whereas that was not contemplated to anything like the degree which will now be the case given that pastoral leases may not extinguish native title. Therefore, the Federal Court, in hearing these matters, needs to take account of the fact that there could well be many other parties to the proceedings. While we do agree that the court should be able to take account of cultural and customary concerns, we think that should not result in undue prejudice to other parties; but our amendment, I would have thought, would be welcomed by other parties in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 62 merely applies the same amendment&mdash;that is, to add the word `unduly'&mdash;in relation to the operation of the National Native Title Tribunal, and is a consequential amendment again really flowing from the parliamentary committee report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 63 relates to the proposition which has come before the parliament a number of times now, that is, the qualifications for a presidential member of the tribunal. We agreed with the former Keating government that the president of the tribunal need not necessarily be a Federal Court judge. Obviously, when the tribunal was first created it was given quasi&hyphen;judicial functions that appeared appropriate, but I think the former Labor government, in response to the Brandy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> decision when it brought in its own amendments to provide that the tribunal would no longer act judicially, made the sensible decision that there should be more flexibility therefore in relation to governments being able to appoint presidential members. I think our amendment 63 picks up entirely what was the previous government's proposition, that is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person who is, and has been for at least 5 years, enrolled as a legal practitioner of the High Court, of another federal court or of the Supreme Court of a State or Territory&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">is eligible for appointment as a presidential member. Given that the tribunal can no longer act judicially, it seems eminently sensible for our government or any future government to have greater flexibility in relation to the appointment of a president. Given the enormous pressures now on the Federal Court restricting the availability of people who can act as presidents in the way that is currently the case and in the way the previous government tried to change, we think this change is eminently sensible and we ask the Senate, once again, to give this serious consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 64 is again a relatively technical amendment. It simply provides that a mediation conference, which would ordinarily be held in private, may not necessarily be held in private if none of the parties object. It is simply giving some flexibility to enable a mediation conference to be opened if none of the parties object to it. It is simply giving the presiding member of the tribunal that discretion. Again, that amendment has come from parties involved in mediation who suggest that that sort of discretion should be available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 65 is again a technical amendment&mdash;very technical&mdash;in relation to the power of the tribunal to dismiss an application at any stage of the inquiry relating to the application. It is technical and has come from those dealing with these matters. It is not something inspired by the government, but is a response to a suggestion made to us by those closely associated with the conduct of these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 66 clarifies that the Registrar of the Federal Court must advise the native title registrar whenever an application is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9901"> withdrawn, even if that application has not actually been registered. Again, it is a very technical amendment and is simply designed to ensure the effective maintenance of the register.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government amendment 71 is designed to make it clear that there can be more than one group of native title holders for one area of land. There is perhaps some misunderstanding of the government's intentions here. It is generally the government's policy framework to ensure, when native title determinations are being heard, that all claims are brought in together. So you could have one Federal Court hearing and one determination of all relevant claims in relation to one area. That is the policy which is eminently sensible. Otherwise, it means that you have an endless stream of native title claims being able to be made. You make one determination in relation to an area, then somebody else comes along and makes another claim and the process just continues for ever, in theory. Given that claims can now be made over land on which there is another title, it seems only fair, just and sensible to provide a framework which enables the process to deal with all native title claims over one area at one time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment simply makes it clear that of course there can be more than one group of native title holders for one area of land. It is the job of the court to determine which claimants have what title. The amendments will ensure that determinations clearly identify whom the holders are and how, in terms of group composition, they hold the title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 72 simply adds a note to explain that, when making a determination of native title that deals with other  interests in the area, the determination can refer to particular kinds of non&hyphen;native title interests rather than dealing with each non&hyphen;native title interest or even each category of interest. An example of what we mean here: the determination could be that fishing licences exist in the area and that native title rights are subject to those licences. We are simply seeking to ensure, now that we know that native title can be claimed where there are other titles, that the determination seeks to ensure, as much as possible, clarity in relation to the interrelation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ship between all the rights, having found that native title exists, to provide in the determination the relationship between the various rights, native title and non&hyphen;native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are the government's amendments. They are largely technical, with the exception of the question of the qualifications for the president of the tribunal. We are disappointed that the ALP seems to have changed its position on this question compared with its attitude while in government. As I say, I think, given that the tribunal is not now a judicial body, it seems appropriate that our government or a future Labor government should have the discretion to be able to have a wider field of candidates from which to choose.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed government amendment No. 58 amends the sunset clause. We do not accept that at all, so we will not be voting for that sunset clause amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed amendment 61 relates to page 162 of the bill and proposed amendment 62 relates to page 176 of the bill. The amendments make changes to the Federal Court's way of operating. We do not support any of these grossly unfair changes. The amendments may improve the situation slightly, but it is like putting a bandaid on an amputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a sense of deja vu with regard to proposed government amendment 63 because we are dealing with a repeat of the native title tribunal appointments bill, which was defeated. I will speak to that in more detail later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed government amendment 64 is one of the few amendments that I believe I could support. It allows some flexibility for hearings to be open, but only if all parties agree. So, when it comes to voting on the government's proposed amendments, I certainly will be asking that No. 64 be excised so that it can be voted on separately.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9902">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Proposed government amendment 65 is way too broad. It allows for the dismissal of an application at any stage. We will not be supporting that. Proposed government amendment 70 amends provisions relating to state and territory bodies to which we are opposed, and proposed amendments 71 and 72 amend provisions relating to the determination of native title which we will also be opposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will speak in a little more detail on proposed government amendment 63 by which the government is trying to bring in what was rejected under the native title tribunal appointments bill. Currently only current or former Federal Court judges from any jurisdiction can be appointed as presidential members after recommendations cross Mr Howard's desk. This amendment seeks to change this requirement so that a person who has been a legal practitioner for at least five years can be appointed as a presidential member. It inserts a new subsection in the table contained in section 110.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Currently there are five presidential members, including the President, Justice French, and 13 ordinary members of the tribunal. Two of the current full&hyphen;time ordinary members are Aboriginal. Ordinary members are only required to have been legal practitioners for at least five years. The main difference between ordinary and presidential members is the power to direct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principle of non&hyphen;judges being appointed to presidential positions may appear on the surface to be perfectly reasonable. For example, many experienced practitioners may have more knowledge of Aboriginal issues than most Federal Court judges or ex&hyphen;judges. Judges are nearly all ruling class, middle&hyphen;aged, white men, and this is a paradigm which should be broken down. To select from such a select pool of people could be considered as inappropriate for the National Native Title Tribunal. To this end, there are no Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander judges or ex&hyphen;judges in Australia. A further argument that could be used is that currently the government is finding it difficult to find presidential members. We mentioned this when the bill was debated.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Justice French is on record as supporting the proposed changes, and he said as much in his submission on the proposed amendments in 1995. In his submission on section 110 in August 1996, Justice French said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The section as it presently stands sets out the categories of membership of the tribunal and the qualifications for appointment to those categories. The amendment extends the qualification of presidential members to include persons who have been legal practitioners for five years or more. If the amendment is supported, I will provide greater flexibility in the appointment of members to the tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However, Aboriginal people to whom I and people in my office have spoken, such as Mick Dodson, Social Justice Commissioner, and others from Aboriginal corporations, believe that the requirement that presidential members come from the judiciary should remain because, firstly, they believe the government is wanting to open up the field, not to appoint presidential members who are more appropriate but, on the contrary, to appoint members who will do the government's bidding. Secondly, they believe it will lower the stature of the Native Title Tribunal, which has come under considerable attack in recent times, and this will become just another area where Aboriginal peoples' forums are downgraded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, judges are less likely to be influenced by the government which has appointed them than a lawyer. Judges have the experience of working in an environment with a clear separation of powers. I know this is something the government quite frequently forgets, but it is important. That respects the need to remain independent. Mick Dodson in particular has much more trust and respect for the judiciary, it seems, than the government. In a conversation last Friday, he said that it was the judiciary which gave Aboriginal people native title and the government which is attempting to extinguish it. I think that is a reasonable indication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his 1995&hyphen;96 Native Title Act report, Commissioner Dodson wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This proposal may undermine the standing of the NNTT in the establishment and consolidation phase of a body. With the significant and unusual functions of the NNTT, it is vital that it be perceived 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9903"> as credible and impartial. This perception would be undermined if the president and deputy president of the NNTT were not required to have judicial experience. I therefore believe that the proposed amendment is inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The importance of Aboriginal people having faith in the independence and standing of the NNTT is absolutely crucial. Given the current attacks on Aboriginal people by this government, it would undermine the whole native title process if Aboriginal people felt the tribunal was stacked out by government lackeys.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why shouldn't we look at any changes the government makes with regard to the native title process with extreme scepticism? After all, it is this government which, in the words of the Deputy Prime Minister, is seeking to enact `bucketloads of extinguishment'; it is this government which is seeking to destroy the right to negotiate process; it is this government which is proposing to change the rules of evidence, so why should we believe this government when it says that it only wishes to remove the requirement for the president to be from the judiciary in order to open the field?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has created a climate of mistrust with regard to Aboriginal affairs which has not existed since the dark times when indigenous people were considered non&hyphen;citizens. It cannot expect us now to take it on good faith that this change is being enacted to enable the appointment of a more appropriate president. The fear is real and apparent that in fact this government is more likely to use this amendment to appoint someone far less appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now move to the ability to strike out native title applications covered in section 84C. Native title applicants should not face having their application being struck out in a Federal Court proceedings simply because they have made a mistake or circumstances have changed so as to make the information required for making applications under section 62 incomplete. There is a lot of information required under section 62(2), much of it very detailed. It includes examples covered from page 148 of the bill, but I would imagine that even the most dedicated lawyer could trip up in complying with this section.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is already a provision in section 190C(2) for the registrar to be satisfied that the application complies with sections 61 and 62. This is the appropriate stage for an application to come under this sort of scrutiny and be amended if necessary. I know that the ALP agrees with the National Indigenous Working Group's compromised amendments to allow the Federal Court more flexibility in considering such applications, but this does not eliminate the cost and anxiety that will be experienced by native title claimants when dragged through this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Importantly, this provision allows any party to the proceedings to apply for the claim to be struck out on the basis that it does not comply with section 62. What is likely to happen is that wealthy non-native title parties are going to have lawyers scrutinising every aspect of native title applications. If any mistakes are made in the very detailed requirements of section 62, they will drag the native title claimants into the Federal Court. In addition, section 85A requires that each party must bear their own costs in such proceedings. This will clearly favour miners and developers and any other affected persons allowed to bring such actions by virtue of section 84(3).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Non-compliance with section 61 is maintained as a trigger for strike&hyphen;out provisions under section 84C under the National Indigenous Working Group's proposals. That should be all, yet here is another example of the National Indigenous Working Group adopting a compromised position in allowing for other parties to seek that claims be struck out but simply asking that it be done on a fair and workable basis. That is not too much to ask.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 61A, as the ALP agree by virtue of their amendments, should not be a requirement simply because section 61A should not exist at all. Senator Harradine requested earlier that consideration of that section under amendment No. 229 be deferred. It relates to applications which must not be made because they cover lands and waters over which native title is proposed to be extinguished via the government's evil section 23, confirmation of extinguishment provisions. That includes crown to crown community purpose leases, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9904"> Defence lands, et cetera, et cetera&mdash;`bucketloads of extinguishment'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask the ALP to seriously consider supporting the National Indigenous Working Group's compromise to prevent what could well be a very unjust provision, especially if other ameliorating amendments of theirs do not gain support from Senator Harradine. I also signal to the ALP that there is no reason for us to support their amendment because their position on this clause is the same as the government's, except for the part referring to section 61A. If section 61A has any effect at the end of this amendment process, we are heading for so many years division and injustice that this strike&hyphen;out provision will be largely irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that Senator Bolkus will want to comment on this section. I indicate that it is my understanding that, although theoretically in conflict with Greens (WA) and Democrat amendment No. 214, opposition amendment No. 247 is virtually identical in its intent as Green and Democrat amendment No. 214. It should not matter which of those gets support, and I hope they do get support. I indicate that there is a conflict and a difference in the treatment of Greens (WA) and Democrat amendment No. 217 and opposition amendment No. 250. I indicate that, at this stage, I am unable to support ALP amendment No. 250.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I was saying, there are eight important areas where we differ from the government. I will make two points at the start. One is that the process is quite critical to the outcome. We need to acknowledge that in respect of the normal and general application of law making in this place. We really ought to acknowledge it in respect of this specific legislation. The other thing is, as has been evidenced in the last few minutes, that there is a difference between the opposition and some of the minor parties in respect of some of these provisions. It stems from the fact that we have actually tried to steer a course which, in some instances, we believe would be a bit more balanced, but that course would get us into trouble with the minor parties. This is one of those areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will turn to the areas of distinction between us and the government and the minor parties and the government. We have to recognise that one of those areas is in respect of determinations. The government's bill we believe quite strongly is quite inflexible when it comes to a one&hyphen;only determination of native title for an area of land. If one were to have a full and comprehensive understanding of Aboriginal customary law, one would realise that there can be coexistence of interests on a particular area of land.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9905">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we say in that respect is that there should be flexibility to allow for that coexistence. Our amendments do that. At the same time, we recognise that amendments later down the track will ensure that overlapping can be handled. Our amendments further down the track in respect of overlapping are a bit more comprehensive and effective than the government's, we would maintain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To force all different native title groups into one process at one particular time and not sufficiently recognise the capacity for coexistence of rights we think is quite inflexible. For instance, if you are really looking at it from the point that we are talking here about a right that a particular group would have, you cannot stop that claim at common law regardless of what the government is trying to seek here by ensuring a one&hyphen;only determination of native title. That will not be effective because groups that are not part of that process will still have a claim at common law&mdash;a claim that is either able to be compensated for or that goes to the validity of what the government is trying to do here. They are trying to rush an outcome when people's rights cannot be forced into one particular funnel. I think we need to look at that quite seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is, out of a real lack of understanding of the process or maybe a deliberate lack of understanding of the process, seeking to have a sunset clause. You cannot take away people's rights to claim. The government acknowledges that. It is basically a smokescreen that they are putting up in respect of the sunset clause. Quite honestly, we do not think you were ever serious about pursuing this particular proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this Native Title Act amendment process is all about is getting certainty of outcome and certainty of processes. If you terminate the operation of the Native Title Act after six years, who is going to miss out? Indigenous Australians can still pursue common law claims. Those in the industry, particularly miners, who want certain time lines and certain outcomes will not be able to have them because of your suspension of the act. Basically, it may be populist politics, but it does not give the certainty that is needed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important area, and one that has not really been focused on, is the evidentiary provisions. I think it is a quite insidious area of this legislation. What we have here is a deliberate intention to proceed to pare back the capacity of native title claimants to be successful in court. Were we to do this to any other group of Australians, there would be screams and so on. In this particular area, let us have a look at what we are doing. Let us have a look at what the government is proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is proposing a strict regime of evidentiary provisions. It is proposing a loosening of the compulsion to take into account cultural practices and so on. You might think that is a reasonable thing to do but, in essence, it is not. If you look at the history domestically and the history internationally, what has been shown, particularly in respect of the law affecting indigenous communities and indigenous people, is that there needs to be a degree of flexibility. The Canadian experience is that there needs to be a degree of flexibility. The Australian domestic experience is the same. What the government is trying to do now is terminate the development of the common law principles at an embryonic stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us face it: those principles are there to ensure that people have a capacity to put their case to the court and to do so despite rigid requirements emanating from things like laws of hearsay and so on. As I say, internationally the development of law has been along the lines of allowing flexibility in respect of rules of evidence. The government, by its amendment, now wants to ensure that the court is bound by them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of cultural and customary concerns, presently the court must take those concerns into account. One would have thought, in dealing with indigenous rights, that that would be something one would expect and should expect to happen. For some reason, the government wants to&mdash;and it has nothing to do with the Wik legislation; it is overreaching the bounds of the Wik legislation&mdash;loosen that compulsion on the court to take those cultural practices into account. You 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9906"> can in no way drive this particular provision back to the Wik legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of experience internationally and experience domestically, if one were to look at, for instance, the 20 years of experience of the Northern Territory Lands Rights Act, one would see that the best evidence has been able to be adduced via the non&hyphen;adversarial process. That is something that is important when it comes to people who are so alien to the court process that the rest of us are aware of. We have to get the balance right. We have to acknowledge that this does not emanate from Wik. In getting the balance right, let us give the courts and the tribunals the flexibilities that are necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Point 4 in dispute with the government is the government's provisions in respect of parties. If you really wanted to work out a motivation here&mdash;and be quite fair in that assessment&mdash;why would you reckon the government would want to leave the whole process open to anyone who might want to become a party to the proceedings? Why would you unless you thought there was some intention to do, with any other claim in the future, what has happened with the Yorta Yorta claim over recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to sabotage a process, if you want to delay it, if you want to drag it out, you have this sort of provision. This is something that the Senate ought to be aware of. It is not fair for those with limited resources to be pitted against anyone who might want to participate in the process. I ask the Senate to consider this seriously. With respect to who should be involved, we think, and we say, that anyone who has an interest should be involved. With respect to general public rights, let there be one public representative and let that person act as an agent on behalf of all those with a general interest in the proceedings. This Senate really has to consider here whether it wants the Yorta Yorta type of experience to keep going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of strike&hyphen;out provisions, Senator Margetts handled those quite well. In respect of the Native Title Tribunal's way of operating with respect to evidence and so on, as I said earlier, I think the cases there are quite compelling. Were we to adopt the govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment's provisions, we would be running contrary not just to developed practice in this country and elsewhere but also to research, advice and inquiries by such bodies as the Australian Law Reform Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the president of the tribunal and whether that person should be a Federal Court judge, once again Senator Margetts covered that, but we just discussed that by way of legislation in this place only in the last few weeks. We made it very clear then that we thought that, given the growing importance of this area and the tribunal, there needed to be a judge appointed. We made it clear that was the developed position of the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another government provision which I think is quite insidious. It has sneaked in only in the last few days. It is amendment No. 65. If you really want to get a fix on what this process is about, have a look at No. 65. This amendment would empower the tribunal to dismiss applications without any criteria being established. This is a new proposal, never before raised by the government. The present sections 147 and 149 in the act impose the usual discretionary criteria applicable to dismiss applications, but what do we have here? We want to give the tribunal a blank cheque to dismiss on no established, written down, defined criteria at all. That also is too much of an ask.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will go back to the point I made at the start. There are some eight areas, and those who have a passing interest in this particular debate might think, `These aren't as important as other factors in the debate. Maybe we should let these go through. The government, after all, wants to be able to manage its process, its affairs and whatever.' But, when you are talking about the rights of individuals, you cannot adequately protect those rights unless you give them a fair process under which to pursue them. This is about eight slices of the salami which would deprive indigenous Australians time and time again of an effective resolution of their problems in the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to some of them, they will go back to the common law or the High Court. But, if we really wanted certainty, if we were 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9907"> really dinkum about wanting certainty in this debate, we would allow the common law to develop and we would reject the sorts of proposals the government is putting up here. It is quite critical. These may not be as glamorous as some of the other areas, but we do have here a recipe which I think has as its main objective&mdash;and I deserve to be listened to here as much as anyone else because we made an analysis of these provisions&mdash;the intention of cutting back on claimants' capacity to pursue successfully their rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is almost as though this government got together a whole group of lawyers who have acted against native title claimants over the last three or four years, put them in a room and said, `Just think of extra hurdles we could put in the way of successful native title claims. Just think of them.' All these lawyers who, admittedly, have lost their cases over recent years&mdash;they have not been able to win those cases against native title claimants under ordinary laws, under the laws that have been developed for indigenous claims throughout the world&mdash;have come up with a recipe and this government has shunted it up. It really will reflect badly on us if we accept them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> much, I thought, the intent of the Keating Labor government when it designed the Native Title Act. I think it was originally designed on the presumption that before too long there would be a clear determination around the country of who held what native title and what it consisted of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our provisions are simply designed to encourage the capacity of the court to ensure that, in relation to particular areas of land over which there may be other titles, the native title issues relating to that land are dealt with at once. It does not in any way, as suggested by Senator Bolkus, prevent coexistence of rights as among ordinary titleholders or other leaseholders and native title holders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no restriction at all on the number of native title claimants who can be involved in the process. It simply says that, in relation to one area of land, you will deal with all the claims that are made and have the determination made; otherwise you will have the extraordinary uncertainty that is produced by the possibility of consequential claims going on forever, where the court goes through a process of making a determination that may involve three or four claimants, makes the determination and, if it is a pastoral lease, the pastoral lessee then knows whom he has to deal with, but then you find another claim is made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true of course that, as a matter of common law, subsequent claims can be made through the normal common law process, but clearly there is a great incentive to make claims through the Native Title Act and in the Federal Court. All we are seeking to do is encourage those claims to be made at the time the hearing is occurring so that all claims in relation to an area can be dealt with at once. Everybody would then know who has got what rights and how they interrelate with each other so life can go on. If you are serious about certainty, you will support these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the sunset clause has aroused a lot of emotion, but it is important to stress that we are not placing a sunset on native title claims per se. That is not the government's intention nor is that the effect of what we have before us. Native title claims as a matter 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9908"> of common law under our bill can go on being made forever. However, we do believe that, in terms of good public policy, it is not unreasonable to be encouraging native title claimants to lodge their claims through the Native Title Act and in the Federal Court within six years of this bill being passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do have a situation where, some four years after the Native Title Act came into effect, nearly 670 claims have already been made. Nearly 50 per cent of the country is under claim. Based on our current understanding of the extent of native title, only about a third of the total area is left to be claimed. In other words, two-thirds has been claimed in four years and we know that at least another third can be claimed. We are saying that, under this proposal, there should be another six years in which claims can be lodged. That means you have until five years and 364 days down the track to put your claim in&mdash;to simply lodge it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course that claim will then be dealt with through the system for however long it takes. The processes do not terminate and they can run-on so that all claims lodged within that time are dealt with under the processes of the bill. It is simply that after that six years&mdash;or 10 years after the act was first passed and 11&half; years after the original Mabo decision&mdash;claims that are proposed to be made under the auspices of this bill should be lodged, without in any way derogating from the common law right to make the claim at any time in the future. We do not think as a matter of public policy that is unreasonable, particularly as I say we are now dealing with an entirely different situation to that which the parliament thought it faced in 1993, when it thought it was dealing with claims over vacant crown land and Aboriginal land. We are now dealing with a whole new set of circumstances where claims can be made over the 42 per cent of Australia that is held by pastoral lessees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there are other interests at stake and they deserve to be heard and considered in the parliament's resolution of this very complex issue. It is not unreasonable or unfair to take account of those other title holders and their interest in knowing who is making claims on the land they lease and what rights they are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> seeking, and they can have those claims dealt with.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JX4">Senator MINCHIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. In terms of the rules of evidence, what we are simply proposing here is to recognise that we are dealing with a proper court&mdash;a proper court that is determining the people's rights. The practical fact is that there is a big difference for any current lessee as to whether a native title claim succeeds or not, and it is not unreasonable or unfair that common law claims should be dealt with as ordinary common law claims, although we do keep some proper exceptions in relation to native title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All our amendments say is that the Federal Court is bound by the rules of evidence&mdash;like in any normal civil matter&mdash;except to the extent that the court otherwise orders, so we give full flexibility to the court to determine that it wishes to adopt another procedure. The prima facie proposition is there that the rules of evidence should apply, but the full discretion is given to the court to do otherwise in our proposals. We make it quite clear that, in conducting its proceedings, the court can take account of the cultural and customary concerns of Aboriginal people, but there is a quite reasonable rider that, because we are now dealing with claims affecting other title holders, the court should not unduly prejudice the other parties to the proceedings, and of course there are other parties whose rights are also at stake and affected by these claims. So we think we have struck the right balance. It does pay proper regard to the particular cultural and customary concerns of Aboriginal people, but it gives the flexibility and the proper authority to the court to conduct the proceedings accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot say any more about the President of the tribunal. That matter has been fully debated. In relation to the accusation made against the government about amendment 65, I need to say that this suggestion was not one that came from within the government; it came from the Native Title Tribunal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to repeat what Senator Margetts and Senator Bolkus have said but I do want to make a couple of comments and this is the appropriate place to do it. We are dealing with the claims process and the sunset clause. The claims process sets up the machinery in which the Native Title Act facilitates the claiming and later the determination of native title. It could rightly be called the gatekeeper provisions of native title. The government amendments in part put in place what has come to be called the Brandy amendments. However, the amendments go too far.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the view of the Australian Democrats that the inclusion of a sunset clause underlines exactly what this government really thinks about native title. It really is an astounding statement to say to indigenous people that, after 209 years of dispossession, they should now effectively get their house in order because we consider them to be an annoyance and it would be good if we could just get rid of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After we threw them out of their houses, forcefully took their children from them and burned their spiritual beliefs to the ground, it became a case of out of sight and out of mind. A cartoon in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today summed it up by showing the Prime Minister with a bunch of British troopers saying, `Shoot them all and take the land.' But the Prime Minister intervenes and says, `Let's be reasonable. Just take the land.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sunset clause represents a turning back of the clock. Few senators would remember that it was the pictures of the abstract poverty of indigenous people that shocked much of middle Australia and brought forth their support for the 1967 referendum. Because we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> became conscious or shocked about the living conditions of our indigenous Australians, we voted that way overwhelmingly in the mid-1960s. Black Australia became visible in the life of the nation. To a large extent that has been the hallmark of indigenous and non-indigenous Australians&mdash;a form of forced visibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mabo decision in legal terms, at least, made Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people visible to our law. That is what getting rid of terra nullius was about. After only five years in the sun, the Australian Democrats will not allow indigenous people to be sunsetted, enforceable by this government. We expect that the Labor Party will help us keep a light on the hill for native title. I am pleased to see Senator Harradine has moved an identical amendment to the other amendments. I commend this amendment as a blow for justice to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government amendments Nos 63 to 65, which are about the members of the tribunal, seek to have another bite of the cherry with regard to amendments dealing with persons who may be appointed as presidential members of the National Native Title Tribunal. During the debate on the  Native Title Amendment (Tribunal Appointments) Bill 1997 , as recently as 29 October, only five weeks ago, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems to me that, if this is an indication of the government's attitude, then one must put some weight on the fact that the government wants to water down again the stature of the president of the tribunal and therefore to reduce its effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Democrats did not support this provision five weeks ago and we will not be supporting the government's attempt to bury it in this legislation. The Democrats oppose these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a couple of other comments on some of the Democrat-Greens (WA) amendments which the ALP supports, particularly amendments Nos 193, 195 and 208. These amendments deal with working out cross claims. It is important to note here that it is possible for native title rights to be overlapping. For example, some native title rights may include the right to conduct ceremony and others may include the right to fish or camp. This em 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9910"> powers the Federal Court to assist in making determinations that will facilitate the necessary flexibility to ensure that justice can be affected. The Democrats, of course, will support these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another amendment is No. 212, which the ALP supports. This amendment deals with expanding the flexibility of the court to deal with overlapping claims. It deals with the complexity of overlapping claims which in part have been caused by catastrophic events such as the stolen generations. In Queensland, the transportation of people for generations from one part of the state to another caused an incredibly complex mix of people, as did the forcing of people into communities. Most communities have an incredible complexity of ancestry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Marcia Langton, who gave evidence before the Joint Committee on Native Title in Darwin this year, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One finds in preparing land claims that a group of people who have been separated from all of that part of the customary group by enforced government removals will have been brought up over a number of generations to believe that they are the descendants of a certain person and that person only, while this group over here believes that they are the descendant of another person and that person only. They may come to find out later, from an anthropologist, say in a land claim&mdash;and this happens&mdash;that those two . . . ancestors were siblings. They were half siblings or full siblings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let us say that this group makes a claim and this group makes a claim before they find out about this historical fact of their ancestry from two siblings. It would be called an overlapping claim, in the present jargon used to describe these matters. But, because the Native Title Act does not permit the amendment of a claim before the Native Title Tribunal, it is not now possible to have a negotiation amongst claimant groups and to point out to them that they might in fact be related.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is very, very likely that, if groups are claiming in the one area and the claims overlap to some extent . . . they are related through some kind of ancestral connection. They may not know of their connection, and it might be a part of their present social identification of themselves as a particular named group to distinguish themselves from other people. This kind of differentiation on the basis of cultural history is very typically a part both of Aboriginal tradition and of the colonial impact. But it is possible to amalgamate claims on the basis of such anthropological or historical information, or 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> even that people might agree as claimants to conduct a unified claim on the basis of shared traditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The customary constitution of the group is a matter for the group, and it must always be. One cannot define culture. Thousands of anthropologists have tried to, unsuccessfully.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to enter this debate on every issue, but this sunset clause is a major issue. It is an issue that I want to take up. It is one that has been promised to the rural community by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It might be hard for people who do not understand native title to imagine the impact of it, but in the rural community a number of people have two or three or more claims on their property. Three years ago they were told there would be no native title claims on their property. Now they have been told there may be native title claims on their property. It is a nightmare for them because they do not know how they are going to get around it. At the end of every nightmare you wake up, and the nightmare goes away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we do not have a sunset clause in this, we are putting these people into uncertainty forever. They do not know when the next claim will come up or whether there will be another claim. If there are claims on their property, it is very difficult for them to borrow money. It is hard to diversify if you cannot borrow money. You cannot upgrade your property and you cannot move anywhere. So you are locked into a position forever with no certainty at all. You cannot plan anything and you cannot move anywhere if you do not have some sort of certainty. It is not as though we are saying that you cannot make a claim under common law or we are retracting that. That is not the case at all. Surely six years is long enough for the Aboriginal community to get their claims together and process them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand where Senator Woodley is coming from, and he is looking into the past. I accept the injustices that were caused a long time ago&mdash;I think everyone does&mdash;but we cannot dwell on the past forever. We have to move forward. If we live in the spiritual 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9911"> world, we are going to confine investment and the competitive environment beyond our borders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that every senator in this place wants to see young people get a job. They want to see people who spend six or seven years at university come out and be able to get a job. If we freeze mining and we freeze our rural industries and we freeze our primary industries, if we put such a handicap on them that they cannot move anywhere, the next process is that it is going to go down the line. This will be felt not only in the bush&mdash;they will have to live with it, and they will be affected worst of all&mdash;but right throughout Australia. Someone in my own family was trying to get a job, and I know how hard it was for him. I just want to warn the Senate and all of those senators who are voting that yes, there were things that did happen to the Aboriginals that none of us can be proud of, but if we try to live in the past we have no future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I say to the Senate that six years is a reasonable time. Do not condemn these people in rural Australia to uncertainty for the rest of their lives. If you do not put a sunset clause on it, they will never be able to say, `We're out of this nightmare.' You will confine them to this terrible position where they cannot move forward, they cannot borrow money on their property and they cannot upgrade their property because there is a native title claim on it. That will be there forever. Very few would have the mental fortitude to stay out there and cop it. So six years is a reasonable time. I am not certain of this, but I understand that when South Africa brought their land rights legislation in it was less than that. So let us give some sort of certainty to our job producing industries.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. Seventy-nine per cent of Australia may be available for native title claim. If there is a six-year limitation period on that, wouldn't it be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> incumbent upon those giving legal advice to urge native people to issue a claim? Otherwise the legal advisers themselves may face an action for negligence. It is the same sort of thing that happens in Victoria when there is an abolition of common law. As soon as there is a threat to a particular right of action, everybody has to take a right of action early. That is the history of these things. If we put a six-year period on native title claims, there is encouragement for there to be a lot more claims made than otherwise would be, because people just do not have the time and the ability to search this thing through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I say to Senator Boswell that, far from getting a clarification in six years, what you are going to get is a claim made to ensure that nobody overlooks native title that may be there. So everybody who may have a title has to claim. That is going to cause a lot of time to be taken up and a lot of expense to be incurred. If you doubt that, you can look at the history of where you take away a right of action after a particular period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on my feet, can I ask the minister how the rules of evidence in proposed section 82 fit in with proposed section 86? Proposed section 82(1) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Court is bound by the rules of evidence, except to the extent that the Court otherwise orders.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then proposed section 86 states that, subject to subsection 82(1), the Federal Court may receive a whole body of evidence which would otherwise not be acceptable. Those two sections need to be married together in a tidier fashion than they presently are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could I then ask about the strike-out application that must be heard before anything else is taken. Doesn't this enable strike-out applications to be made in a manner that is quite different from the way strike-out applications are normally made in court? In saying that strike&hyphen;out application must be made before anything else happens, you are treating these sorts of claims differently from other claims that you might treat because you give priority to an application to strike out. Proposed section 84C states, `If an application does not comply with section 61, 61A or 62'&mdash;that would be the basis of your claim&mdash;then:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9912">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Court must, before any other proceeding takes place in relation to the main application, consider the application made under subsection (1).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the court must hear the strike&hyphen;out application, no matter what the evidence and no matter what the situation. The final point is the issue of costs, where each side has to pay its own costs. Doesn't that clearly make the whole proceedings under this legislation much more available to those with deep pockets? I would be grateful if you could give me answers on those three points.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a couple of points, partly in response to Senator Cooney's remarks. I understand Senator Cooney's point of view in relation to the sunset clause, which we have heard quite a few times, but it is important for us to have a bit of commonsense here. The Native Title Act has already been in operation for some four years. We are going to add another six years in which claims can be made, making a total of 10 years. If you cannot get a claim to the stage where you lodge it within a period of 10 years, why should we assume that, at some date 40 years down the track, a person is going to be better able to prove the claim, especially when much of the evidence relies upon people who are in their 50s and 60s? So these people will not be around in 40 years time and it will be even harder to make a claim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the more important point is this: without a sunset clause on claims under the Native Title Act, we have a double jeopardy. What happens is that you subject a person to multiple claims. The law abhors double jeopardy. The sunset clause is in the existing legislation because it was intended that double jeopardy would work only against the Commonwealth; in other words, the only people who would be prejudicially affected would be the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has happened now is that we subject private individuals to double jeopardy because claims are being made against pastoral leases. That is unfair and unreasonable. It is contrary to the good principles of law in this country. So to vote against the sunset clause is to vote for double jeopardy. Claims under the act, as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opposed to claims under common law, attract particular advantages, such as the right to negotiate. It would be unreasonable to subject people to double jeopardy with a double right to negotiate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the point about competing and overlapping claims that Senator Woodley has made, but Senator Woodley forgets the fact that, as soon as one applicant has made a claim in relation to an area, other potential applicants are required to make their claims under the provisions of the act as it already stands. Importantly, efforts also have to be made to ascertain whether there are other potential claimants at that point in time. Although I understand Senator Woodley's argument, it is not an argument against the sunset clause over claims under this act. That is the important point we have to bear in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, while we understand all the points that have been made in relation to evidence, you also have to understand one other thing, which is that under the act as it currently stands the rules of evidence do not really apply. For example, the court would be forced to take uncorroborated hearsay evidence, and that again is not fair when private individuals are subjected to those rules. It is all right for the Crown to say, `We are happy to entertain these things'&mdash;and that is what was done under the previous government&mdash;but it is not all right to say that private individuals who fund their own defence, as opposed to claimants who are principally funded through land councils and hence from the government, should be made subject to uncorroborated hearsay evidence and some of the other problems that we get. That is why the amendments that the government has in this bill are necessary. That is why these sections of the bill should stand as printed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to comment on some of the statements made by Senator Boswell. He talked about the nightmare. I am hearing from various indigenous people who have been writing to me, ringing my office and visiting my office that the nightmare is theirs: the nightmare of the prospect of what might happen as a result of this legislation going 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9913"> through&mdash;even though it is not going anywhere except to the High Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no necessity for there to be a nightmare for the operation of pastoral leases. There is no need for the existence of the Wik High Court decision to influence the ability of pastoralists to borrow money. Banking representatives have stated quite clearly that the viability of pastoral leases is the main&mdash;and often the only&mdash;criterion which is necessary for banks to decide in determining whether or not to lend money to pastoral leaseholders. Many people are aware of the fact that when this excuse is gone&mdash;the government's excuse that the problems with the viability of pastoral leases is a problem of native title&mdash;by way of shovelling the bucket loads of extinguishment through this legislation, they will then have to explain to those remaining pastoralists why they are still unviable. They will not have the excuse any more of blaming indigenous Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nightmare, I contend, is not a nightmare of coexistence. The nightmare has been created by whipping up the fears and prejudice of people in Australia as a result of the way this bill has been written and presented to the Australian public. The nightmare must exist for those people in indigenous Australia who know that they may well only be in the process of setting up or trying to establish a corporation to deal with their land claims. We know that there are negotiations in the way if such land claims work in relation to rep bodies. There are models being worked out as to how these can work better within the rep body situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that many of the problems associated with the working out of claims are associated with the severe lack of resources that exist within rep bodies. If you listened to the minister, you would think there was lots of money available for rep bodies to run their cases. If you listened you would think there were resources rolling out of the doors in relation to rep bodies being able to represent the clans and the groups who want to be represented. Quite clearly, Senator Cooney is right: if you were to succeed in putting a sunset clause in this bill you would force many people who are not in a position to best 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> put their case to put an ill&hyphen;prepared case forward to the court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not a very wise way for anyone to go, especially if what you are seeing in this group of amendments is the government trying to pick off and strike out those people who may have made an error in putting together their case. It is a bit like Senator Newman boasting how many thousands of people she has knocked off social security this week for technical faults in their applications and so on&mdash;boasting that that is a great thing to do. It is not the right way to go about things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is, in fact, more than one sunset clause dealt with in this section&mdash;section 2(3) is one where there is a level of agreement. But I would also call your attention to the fact that the sunset clause is also mentioned in Democrats' and Greens (WA) amendment 192 as well. That involves the removal of the sunset clause on applications for compensation, so we are not going to be just dealing with one sunset clause in this group of amendments. It appears the majority of the Senate will move to remove the sunset clause on applications for a determination, but I do still urge that the majority of the Senate support either opposition amendment 225 or Democrats/Greens amendment 192 in relation to the sunset clause on applications for compensation as well, because the same kinds of issues relate also to sunset clauses for those issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many issues which will come up in relation to the debate on so&hyphen;called uncorroborated hearsay evidence that Senator O'Chee referred to. I think it is an indictment of the understanding of members of the opposition of how people speak for the land to say that there is a necessity for corroboration in relation to people's knowledge and spiritual understanding of the land for which they speak.</PARA></SPEECH>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9914"> the continuing claim that this bill is to deal with the issue of uncertainty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to draw Senator Boswell's attention to the Wik decision, which said that if there was conflict between what the pastoralist wanted to do under his or her lease and the native title claim, then the pastoral lease prevails. But it is not quite that simple because some pastoral leases apparently, particularly in Queensland, are not that clear. Indeed, my information is that in some of the early native title claims there were not even maps available when the claimants went to various departments looking for the lease map. People had to go back to square one and start looking. That was one of the major hold&hyphen;ups for some of the early claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would like to suggest to Senator Boswell is that he takes out some of this angst on state governments, particularly the Queensland government, and that state governments make it clear to their pastoralists exactly what their leases involve and allow them to do, because the amount of fear and concern whipped up, particularly in Queensland, over what can and cannot be done, can often be tracked back to what their entitlement actually is under their pastoral lease. It is much simpler in South Australia, so our people do not have so many worries but, certainly in Queensland, some of the whole sensitivity and hype over uncertainty goes back to administrative problems within departments. I would like to recommend to Senator Boswell that he looks a little bit more closely at what some of the problems are, particularly in his home state.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I respond to Senator Cooney's queries of a relatively technical nature in relation to the rules of evidence and the interrelationship between sections 82 and 86. It is as it states. The fact is that the court may take account of all this other evidence listed in 86 if it otherwise complies with the rules of evidence, but, of course, there remains the discretion to order otherwise in relation to the rules of evidence. We are simply saying that all those items can be considered if they comply with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the normal rules of evidence, but residual discretion remains upon the court, so the relationship is clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strike&hyphen;out provision: yes, it is government policy that, in relation to the question of someone seeking to exercise their right to ask the court to strike out a claim, then the court has got to hear that strike&hyphen;out. We do think that is essential so that, if any party believes a claim is not a valid or fair claim, they can bring their action and that should be heard. Once that is heard, then the claim can proceed. It is simply saying that we think it is appropriate that, where a party affected by a claim believes that the claim does not comply with the rules relating to claims, then that matter should be heard first before the claim proceeds. Once that is dealt with, then, of course, the claim can proceed. So it is a matter of clear government policy which we think is quite appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to costs, I am not quite sure of the tenor of the question, but basically our proposition is that each party shall bear their own costs. But, of course, again we leave the discretion with the court. The court can otherwise order. What we are on about here is giving discretion to the Federal Court to determine how it best should conduct these sorts of proceedings, taking proper account of their unique nature. We lay down some prima facie positions, but at the end of the day it is for the courts to decide&mdash;and we do give the courts the requisite discretion. Again, we think that appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I indicate to the committee that we could not agree with Democrat amendment 214. For reasons that we do not quite understand, it seeks to prevent local government bodies automatically being able to be parties to a claims process. I think if you have spent any time on the ground around Australia talking to communities affected by native title claims, you will very quickly realise how important local government is in this process&mdash;how it is affected, most particularly, by native title claims and why there is every reason local government should have the automatic right to be a party to a claims process if they so choose.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not really understand why there would be any attempt to make it harder for local government to be involved if they so desire.

I congratulate the local government bodies around the country for their very constructive role in helping educate the community on this issue and their constructive role in native title issues and in mediations. So I think that amendment 214 ought not to be supported and the government's proposal should stand.</PARA></SPEECH>

Hopefully the court will sort out a lot of the issues about evidence and striking out, but the court cannot sort out the sunset provisions. If you look at issues such as the removal of common law rights, the history is that once you put limitations on, taking away a right of action, you are going to have people issuing proceedings to make sure that they have got it covered, in any event, to protect themselves from negligence claims. If 79 per cent of Australia&mdash;according to the Prime Minister and Senator Boswell&mdash;may be subject to native title claims, isn't this a recipe to ensure that you are going to get claims made simply to protect the claimant's position and to protect the solicitor from copping&mdash;if I can use that word&mdash;a negligence action?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney, I stress that there is no negation or termination of common law rights involved in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this process. I think that has been acknowledged by the ALP. We are not, in any way, preventing common law claims for native title being brought ad infinitum to the end of history. But we do believe, as a public policy, it is appropriate that, 10 years after the Native Title Act came into effect, we set a deadline on the lodgment of claims made under the auspices of the Native Title Act per se. So there is no negation of the common law right; it is simply saying, effectively, administratively, that if you want to bring your claim under the auspices of this Commonwealth act then you should do so, and that you should effectively lodge that claim within 10 years after the act originally came into effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, if you look at what has happened in the four years since the act came into effect, 45 per cent of Australia is under claim. I think 667 is the latest number of claims&mdash;a huge number of claims individually. So two&hyphen;thirds of what we understand to be the area claimable has already been claimed in this four years. We are saying, `In another six years we would encourage you to bring your claims so that everybody knows what is being claimed, where and when.' The quite huge infrastructure that the nation has established to deal with these claims can then deal with them, for however long that takes. We are spending $40 million a year on representative bodies to bring claims and $20 million a year on the tribunal. I do not know how much money the Federal Court is going to spend on native title claims every year, but obviously that will be substantial. So there is a huge national investment in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not unreasonable, having set up that infrastructure and devoted those sorts of resources, that by the end of six years from the commencement of this act we know what claims are proposed under the auspices of this act. I think there is undue criticism of the government on this score because it is not in any way a termination of common law rights. As I say, people can go on bringing common law claims for native title for ever, but obviously there is an incentive to do so under the act and we wish to provide an incentive to do so within that six&hyphen;year period.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those in the chamber understand the situation about native title rights being common law rights and negotiation rights being statutory rights, but we also know that native title is not much good to anyone without the right to negotiate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this legislation, we are trying to make that statutorily certain and to make the procedures as economic and efficient as possible. If you kept the sunset clause, you could have claimants under common law after that date. Claimants could go to the High Court. Is it not a fact that the High Court could not only decide the issue, but it could also decide what flows from the issue&mdash;including how to determine the rights and interests of particular groups, how they should be balanced and what processes should be used?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I point out to Senator Boswell that we are trying to deal with the matter with as much certainty as possible. One of the major purposes of the native title regime, which was established under the Native Title Act of 1993, was to facilitate agreements about claims and about future acts and procedures. The alternative would have been a reliance on the common law, with a significant amount of cases ultimately put before the courts and a huge amount of litigation concerning future acts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ending the ability of native title holders to access a regime under the act would deny them certain statutory rights, including the right to negotiate concerning future acts. Despite the fact that under the government's proposed amendments the statutory right to negotiate will be diminished, it will remain a significant right where applicable. It recognises the special attachment of indigenous people to their country. As I said at the beginning, native title rights are worth very little without negotiation rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's proposed sunset clause of six years for native title applications is both unnecessary and beyond the pale. It is unnecessary because, as Senator Minchin suggested in evidence to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title, most, if not all, native title claims may have been lodged by the date of expiry of the sunset provision. He 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> indicated to the committee that most of them may well have been lodged by that date. Senator Minchin has emphasised to the committee here today that a very large number of claims have been lodged, covering substantial areas of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That being the case, this proposal would achieve very little, even were the option of resort to the common law unavailable. As Senator Cooney has indicated, resort to the common law will always be available, including for future acts. Senator Minchin confirmed that in evidence to the joint committee at page 201. In those circumstances, all parties to native title applications, including pastoralists and farmers, are inconvenienced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No good purpose is served by the sunset clause proposal that is currently before us. Not only would the sunset proposal achieve the undesirable goal of propelling new claims into the court processes, but it would offend native title holders. After more than 200 years of dispossession, we would in effect be saying to indigenous people that no provision will be made to allow claims to be submitted for mediation after an arbitrary date. In the name of reconciliation, I believe that is unjustifiable. The sunset clause, as far as I am concerned, will be opposed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This proposition was adopted by the previous Keating government in response to the fact that, contrary to the formulation originally proposed in the Native Title Act that the tribunal would be a determining body, Brandy made that impossible. In fact, that part of the Native Title Act was effectively unconstitutional&mdash;the tribunal could not make determinations. As agreed by the previous government and as set in place by our bill&mdash;and I think these parts are generally agreed&mdash;the tribunal is effectively a mediation service for native title claims and, with its ultimate arbitration role on the right to negotiate aspect, determinations are made by the court. So it is not a court; it is no longer a court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Justice French has publicly advocated the proposition before the Senate that it is much more appropriate, given the new role of the tribunal as essentially a mediation service, that governments should have more flexibility in appointing the presidential member. Indeed, there is an internal contradiction in what is being put to us. There is an argument for maximum informality, relaxation of rules and all that sort of thing, both in the court and in the tribunal but, on the other hand, there is an insistence that a Federal Court judge be the president of the tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our point is that the most appropriate person to run the tribunal&mdash;which now has this very significant role in the mediation of claims; that is its primary purpose&mdash;may well not be a judge. There is the practical issue of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the enormous pressure on the Federal Court in terms of finding a judge, taking a judge out of the system. In many respects, this job may well be better performed by someone who is not a judge and has much greater administrative experience&mdash;running the tribunal is a huge administrative task, if you have visited the tribunal and seen what is involved&mdash;and also much greater experience in mediation in the more informal way in which it is advocated and supported by other parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not think that doing this in any way lessens the status of the tribunal. Under the new arrangements, the Federal Court is responsible for determinations and supervises and oversees every claim. The tribunal works to the court as a mediation service and it is only sensible to provide any government with flexibility to ensure that it can get the best possible person for that job. The tribunal would still be a key part of the process and its status is in no way diminished by this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We rejected the proposition put from a range of sources that it ought be called the `Native Title Mediation Service'. We thought it would be more appropriate to keep the name `tribunal' to maintain that level of status. There are plenty of quite important bodies in the community which perform similar functions of equal importance where there is no requirement to have a judge at their head.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did think that this is an important provision and we are disappointed that that sort of ill&hyphen;motive is again being attributed to us in relation to it. There are some very fine people in Australia who would be able to serve well&mdash;and I would have thought would be supported by all parties&mdash;in doing this job who are not currently Federal Court judges.

You have to look at the nature of the job which&mdash;let's face it&mdash;is the hottest issue in town at the moment. It has been for some time and will continue to be into the future. Because of that, we have reconsidered the status of the position and who should be at the top of the tree in the tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, look at the most recent debate we had in the last week or so on whether native title can be claimed on someone's backyard. It was, amongst other things, the voice of reason of Justice French, together with the fact that he is a judge, which had a very telling effect on the public debate on that particular issue. Issues like that will continue to evolve as we go along. To have someone of that status&mdash;because of which they will be listened to in the community&mdash;is going to be extremely important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not the least of reasons why we have changed our position here is that the climate has changed. It has heated up enormously in the last two years and that is one of the reasons why we think someone at the top with the status of a judge would engender the sort of respect that will be needed for this important job, both in terms of certainty to the players and in terms of public education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the flexibility, that is important. I am glad you mentioned that, Senator Minchin. If you want to help the people involved in this debate, then you reject the government's rules on rules of evidence and the question about cultural evidence being a prerequisite. I think those two things are important. Let us also keep in mind that, while you have the person at the top, others in the tribunal are not judges.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason why we moved these amendments is that there is a regime already there, and I have talked about that at length. That regime allows a certain degree of discretion in respect of the rules of evidence, particularly the hearsay rule. That is in recognition of the fact that cultural practices are passed on from mouth to mouth over centuries and become part of the spirit and traditions of the groups. As a consequence, not only in Australia but also internationally, there has been a recognition that the rules of court need to be flexible, particularly in respect of the hearsay rule but also in respect of other rules.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the other point that Senator Harradine mentioned earlier. When you are talking about the sorts of people we are talking about here, the court process would be a particularly alien one to them and it is important to maintain flexibility for that. Tied in with that is the situation now where the court has been instructed by the parliament to take into account cultural practices. Though 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there might be an amendment in loose terms, if we were to move away from the current position in this debate, we would be sending a message to the court to say, `The parliament has had a rethink and you ought to be a bit more cautious. Drag it back in terms of how you apply the rules of evidence. Be a little bit more rigid is the message coming from the parliament.' In respect of the customary practices, we would be saying, `The compulsion that the parliament felt that it was important to place there before we do not now feel is as important.' Basically, through this legislation we are sending a message to the courts and the tribunals, and that is something we have to take into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of whether it affects the rights of others, the point here is that you have to get the balance right. To the extent that the voice, rights and practices of indigenous people cannot be heard under an inflexible regime, it is they who are missing out. The court and the tribunal will always balance a just result, but the impediment is the hurdles, and the way the indigenous Australians have their voice heard will be difficult to surmount if the changes take place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us take into account the Northern Territory situation. With this native title regime, over years they have developed fair and comprehensive rules of practice which are quite flexible but really do accommodate indigenous Australians. They take into account the rights of others who are not the claimants. Senator Harradine, we would be sending the wrong message if we were to wind back this legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I just add to that. I was making the point before the dinner break that it really is important to allow a degree of flexibility. One concern that the opposition does have is that this particular proposal of the government's has been around for some time but it is based on a real misunderstanding of how stories are passed down and how song lines are passed through communities, generations and so on. Any rigid rule or any message from the parliament that would impinge on that would very much impinge on the capacity to maintain the customs and traditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that this is based on a misconception, and the misconception was founded three or four years ago when the current Special Minister of State, Senator Minchin, attacked the particular provision in the Native Title Act. At the time, on 15 December, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the bill instructs the Federal Court to take account of the cultural and customary concerns of Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders and `is not bound by technicalities, legal forms or rules of evidence'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What an unbelievable instruction from the parliament to the judiciary. It is a most reprehensible undermining of a superior court of this country, and really is, at its essence, contrary to the whole principle of the separation of the executive, legislature and judiciary. As I say, it confirms that this bill is fundamentally based on race.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">My point is that I think the minister got it totally wrong in 1993&mdash;totally wrong as to his assessment of the provision, totally wrong as to the importance of it and totally wrong when he said it was a provision based on race. The provision in the act recognises the importance for the message to be given to the court. My concern is that, by taking any further step today, we would be unwinding that message and impinging heavily on the capacity for song lines as a basis of custom

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad my speech of four years ago is such a rich load of capital for the ALP. I never thought my words would live on in the way they have. Can I just say that the debate seems to be conducted on the basis that we are somehow ruling out the capacity of the court to consider the cultural and customary concerns of Aboriginal people, which is not what we are about. We are not about the application of some rigid rule, as Senator Bolkus suggested; we are about genuinely ensuring a proper discretion for the Federal Court in the hearing of native title claims, which you must remember now will, by definition as a result of the Wik decision, involve other title holders. These claims are being brought on land on which there are other title holders with their own interests that they wish to preserve, protect and defend in law, and the way in which these hearings are conducted must reflect that new fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not seeking to direct the court in the way in which the original act was drawn up&mdash;which may well have been appropriate, given that it was only ever contemplated that, effectively, claims would be brought on vacant crown land or Aboriginal land. We now have an entirely different situation. Our response to that is to give the court the discretion that it ought to have in the way it handles these matters and in the way it develops the law to appropriately accommodate the whole range of interests which will come before the court and which we are seeing in these hearings. Obviously, people will need to and want to come to court to defend what they see as their rights; also those native title claimants will come to court to proclaim their rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our proposed section 82, which is what we appear to be debating, does say that the court has that discretion. It states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9925">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Federal Court is bound by the rule of evidence, except to the extent that the Court otherwise orders.</PARA>

It was obvious that in 1993 the government had a view about what Mabo did. That view clearly was not that native title could coexist, as I hear it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must admit that I have a bit of trouble understanding the position there. Senator Harradine, you say it is a different ball game, but I do not know what you actually mean by that in the context of this debate. The different ball game is that we have had a few years to see the provision in operation, not just nationally but also, for instance, under the Northern Territory Land Rights Act. I think the common experience is: to the extent that you have a non-adversarial process, you maximise the capacity for people 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to be able to produce their claims. Otherwise it really unfairly impinges upon that capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My point in response to Senator Minchin was that we as a parliament would be sending a message to the tribunals and courts that we thought it was time for a bit of unwinding of the previous position. Senator Harradine, I wonder whether that is what you are saying&mdash;`We have a different ball game now, so let's unwind it.' If you are saying that, I think that is a matter of concern because there is no real evidence to lead to that conclusion. If you are not saying that, I think for us to accept the government's provisions in unwinding those two areas of the law which provide for total discretionary flexibility would be an unhealthy thing for this parliament to do.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the debate we had on the Hindmarsh Island bill we debated whether or not the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander natural heritage bill should be able to incorporate the ability to deal under law with the traditional law and practices of indigenous Australians. Interestingly enough, since that bill and in questioning the government, they found it all too difficult to even ask various people what they believed about Justice Elizabeth Evatt's report in dealing with the traditional law. They found it all too hard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ironically, in the meantime it was very easy for the government to come up snap with proposals that will limit even further the court's ability to deal with things like heritage issues in a way that acknowledges and honours traditional law in Australia. So it is quite clear that the government is saying these traditional practices are not legitimate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The words `may' and `must' are quite important in this process. If a court must take into consideration traditional law, then it is quite clear that it provides means of dealing with that. It is quite clear that it must provide the ability for people to express traditional law. It must be quite clear that it needs to provide people to translate so they can tell their stories in their own words. `Must' is important in the way the law operates if we are going to honour and value traditional law. It seems that this government has no honour or value for traditional law.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9926">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The word `may' means that somebody has to first fight the battle for the right of people to express their own words and values by their own methods. That is where the word `may' is most important. I urge the Senate to accept and value that there are more things than dreamt of in our heaven and earth. By this method we are saying that traditional law in Australia is not valued or that they must argue in advance that they can or should be able to use traditional law.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important to remember that in 82(2) we are talking about the conduct of proceedings. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It is our view that the legislature should give the court the appropriate discretion as to the way in which it conducts its proceedings. This is, of course, separate from the actual determination of native title. Because native title is the common law recognition of the traditional law and custom of Aboriginal people, in reaching a determination as to whether claimants hold native title, a court cannot avoid the inquiry as to the traditional law and custom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the conduct of its proceedings, we do believe, as a matter of proper balance as to the legislature and the executive and the judiciary, that the judiciary should be granted the appropriate discretion in this matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it really is from a point of principle about the relationship between the legislature and the judiciary. The legislature says, `We believe it is a matter for the court to use its discretion in the way in which it conducts its proceedings.' Obviously there should be discretion to take account of those cultural and customary concerns in the conduct of its proceedings, but it should not unduly prejudice others. That is separate and apart from all the issues which it would have to take into account in making its determination which by definition, in determining whether someone holds native title, will involve an inquiry into the traditional law and custom and the common law recognition of those in any particular case.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add further to the debate. It is important to the actual running of the proceedings that it occurs this way. We have to remember that we have already dealt with the application section. We asked questions and Senator Brown asked questions as to why spiritual values could not be included in the application as to what trips over the line, if you like, and we were told that that would come later. We were told that physical connection, not spiritual connection, was

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember, as has been pointed out, that the judges who are dealing with this issue are not indigenous Australians. There are no indigenous Australian judges. It may be too difficult for judges to deal with this. If there is no requirement or expectation that these must be taken into consideration, we will not necessarily get a situation where the court has with it the skills and resources to provide this service. Remember that the parliament's own Joint Committee on Native Title went to Broome and did not even think it was important enough to listen to the evidence given to them in the language of the people giving it. This is the kind of thing we are talking about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is not required, there will not be that mechanism. If we have that mechanism in the courts as a natural process, as a resource available to the courts, it will happen.

We now have land on which there are many other title holders and the Federal Court's rulings will have a significant legal effect. Therefore, prima facie, the normal way in which courts operate should operate, that is, the rules of evidence apply. But we do acknowledge that, because these are particular matters of a special nature, the court should be given a discretion by the legislature to otherwise order, in other words, to give it the discretion to set aside the normal rules of evidence. We think the wording in the section is the right balance, gives the right emphasis and the right relationship between the application of the normal rules of evidence, because you are dealing with the interests of whole range of other parties now, but that, again, the court should have a discretion.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9931">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The strike&hyphen;out mechanism is of course a normal part of the law. Any party in a democracy like ours has the right to go to court to ask a court to consider that it not hear the matter for a variety of reasons. This simply says that it is open to other parties to apply to the Federal Court in the normal way for a strike&hyphen;out of the application. The grounds are set out there. Basically, they are that the application does not comply with the pretty basic requirements that are set down in the application procedure. If the application does not meet the basic requirements then a claim can be amended so that it does meet the requirements prior to it being struck out. If it is struck out it can be redrawn and relodged so that it does comply with the basic requirements. This is a matter of ensuring that claims meet at least the basic requirements set down in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember, this is not the application of the registration test; it is the application of the application test, which is much more basic. These are, basically, quite mechanical requirements in terms of the description of the claim, the rights claimed and matters relating to where the claims are being made over land on which there is exclusive possession. So we do not think it at all unreasonable to enable parties to apply to a court and argue before a court that the application does not meet those minimal requirements. It is a matter for the court to make the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, claims can be amended in the course of the proceedings so that they do comply. If struck out, they can of course be corrected to ensure that they meet the basic requirements set down in the act and be resubmitted. We think this is entirely appropriate, sensible and fair, given that native title claims now affect a whole range of other interests. That the normal rules of law should apply seems only fair and reasonable. By definition, because these matters have to be submitted to a court and only a court can make a determination that there must be a strike&hyphen;out procedure&mdash;and there is general agreement on that&mdash;the mechanism by which such strike&hyphen;out applications are dealt with through 84C seems entirely appropriate.</PARA>

One of the most repeated concerns about the current arrangements is the number of claims that are now in the system which are frivolous claims, as Mr Robinson, the Deputy Chairman of ATSIC, has said. What is in this bill is ensuring that claims that receive the benefit of Federal Court adjudication and mediation through the Native Title Tribunal are dealt with in a way that ensures that, at the very basic level, there is some reasonable basis for the claim.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most widespread and universally accepted complaint about the current system, from Aborigines in particular, is the number of frivolous unsubstantiated claims in the system which are denying justice to those who are genuine, serious claimants who ought to have their claims heard as expeditiously as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this application stage, the application is dealt with on the face of it. The detail required is not methodically or judicially tested in any way. The claim technically has to meet them, but they are not tested. Having the information is all about ensuring that mediation of claims, which is the next stage, can succeed, in the hope that agreements can be reached and we do not have to spend five years in court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one of the problems. As those involved on both sides&mdash;including the Aboriginal side&mdash;will tell you, it is difficult to have effective mediation when it is not clear what land is being claimed, what rights are being claimed, et cetera. Given that there is effectively no rigorous test applied at the application stage, it is not unreasonable that there be the capacity to seek a strike&hyphen;out on the grounds that the basic requirements set down for applications have not been met&mdash;remembering, as I say, that claims can be amended in the process or, if they are struck out, they can be resubmitted in order that they comply with basic requirements.</PARA>

Native title claims are in pursuit of significant legal rights and attract the full force of the law when they are made because they are then eligible for the protection of the court and the full mediation arrangements which are provided by the people of Australia for native title claims.

That is the question I was asking. You are asking for extra, fairly onerous information on applications. I am wondering exactly what process you are talking about, whether or not you are giving extra funds to provide for the assistance that might be necessary to avoid a situation where a rep body puts in an application and is struck out.

<PARA STYLE="Para">We are dealing with the schedule of amendments under the heading `Registration test'. Generally speaking, I think there is support for an enhanced registration test. In light of the previous discussion we have had, what we are talking about here is the test to be applied to claims after they have been accepted by the court and sent to the registrar of the tribunal to determine whether they should be registered and, therefore, attract all the statutory benefits which flow from registration. This goes to the heart of dealing with what I think everybody acknowledged was the unintended consequence of the current Native Title Act, where we have a lot of multiple overlapping and competing claims which make dealing with native title extremely difficult, complex and expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have thought long and hard about the nature of the registration test. We first put forward amendments on this matter back in&mdash;believe it or not&mdash;June of last year; it has been a long saga. It has been subject to some alteration over that period but, essentially, we 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9936"> in the government have given much thought to the nature of that test. We believe the test that we have proposed is an appropriate test which will ensure that the register contains all legitimate claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All legitimate claims should have no difficulty in passing the test, but it will act as a filter to ensure that only those claims which have substance will be on the register and attract all the considerable statutory benefits that flow from registration, remembering that any claim that does not meet the registration test is not in any way affected in relation to the pursuit of a determination for native title. I repeat: this does not affect in any way the right of the claimants to seek a determination that they hold native title. The test relates to being on the register and the statutory benefits which flow from registration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To keep numerical sequence, and given that amendment 66, although moved by us, was apparently not on the running sheet before, I have moved amendment 66, which relates to this whole area, in this block. Amendment 66 clarifies that the Registrar of the Federal Court must advise the Native Title Registrar whenever an application is withdrawn, even if that application has not been registered. Again, this is a technical amendment to ensure the proper maintenance of the register and one that I would have thought was unexceptional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 67 seeks to insert a reference to subsection 64(4) into subsection 190A(1). The purpose is to ensure that the registrar is obliged to consider amended applications. To the extent that there was any doubt about that&mdash;we are not sure that there was&mdash;this will ensure that that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 68, new subsection 190A(5A), will allow the registrar to advise the claimant that the application can be amended under the Federal Court rules. For example, the registrar may wish to use this power when an application that is unlikely to satisfy the registration test would be able to satisfy that test if it were amended. This will give the claimant the option of amending the claim before the registrar makes a decision about registration. This is an amendment which I would have thought would meet with support.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government amendment 69 provides a new subsection, 190A(7), which explains that when the registrar is told that an application which has not been registered has been dismissed or otherwise finalised, the registrar is not to finish considering whether the claim should be registered if this consideration is under way.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment 69 explains that when the registrar is told that an application which has not been registered has been dismissed or otherwise finalised the registrar is not to finish considering whether the claim should be registered if this consideration was under way, or must not enter the details of the claim into the register if the consideration had been finalised. Again, it is a pretty technical amendment which I would not have thought would attract too much opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are the fairly simple government amendments to what we think is a reasonable registration test. The physical connection issue is one which I know attracts a great deal of angst and some opposition from some quarters. I remind you that all we are saying in relation to this question of physical connection is that part of the registration test&mdash;remembering this does not go to the right of the claimant to seek a determination but to participate and have the full benefit of the right to negotiate; that is what this is about&mdash;is whether one member of the claimant group has or has had at any time a traditional physical connection with the area claimed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you oppose that, you are saying that you should be able to get registered and therefore attract the right to negotiate and the considerable benefit of that right even though not one member of the claimant group has ever had any physical connection with the area 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9937"> claimed. That seems to us quite an extraordinary proposition. We think our test is quite minimal. It is not saying that all members of the group have to have a current physical connection. It does not say that. It simply says that just one member&mdash;and you can have a claimant group of any number; there is no limit on the numbers in the claimant group; it could be 300 or 400 or whatever you like&mdash;at some stage in their life has to have had a physical connection with the area claimed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To suggest that that should not be there is, as I say, to support the notion that you can be registered and attract the full right to negotiate even though no&hyphen;one in the claimant group has ever had in their life any connection with the area claimed. I would ask people to focus on what actually is in the bill in relation to the physical connection test, to see that it is not unreasonable and to contemplate what you are saying if there were no such test whatsoever.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The starting point for the opposition in this part of the debate is that changes are needed to the registration test. In that respect, we share the motivation of just about everyone in this chamber. We have identified a number of areas, particularly the question of overlapping native title claims, and also the fact that there has been some capacity for what may be called overly optimistic ambit type claims in the process. It is fair to say that they are the concerns the government has. They are the concerns other people have. They are also the concerns that indigenous Australians have to some extent. What we say is that our response is a fairer balance than the government's. We do not want to deny many genuine native title holders the right to register their claims. We contend that the government does in fact do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our response has three major features. We assign a clear role to the registrar. We ensure the registration process can pick up the false and fraudulent claims. We have special provisions which probably are a little more rigorous than the government's in respect of overlapping claims. The physical connection test is an issue that was mentioned. I will turn to that later on. In respect of multiple claims, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we believe the government is too rigid. The government's provision is that, if a member of the claimant group is also a member of a group whose application has been registered, the subsequent claim cannot be proceeded with. We think that is too rigorous and does not reflect the social organisation and traditional law that is important to so many groups in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of specific complaints, the time limits of the registration test are impractical. We have a situation where, if a section 29 notice is issued over a claimed area, the registrar must consider the claim before the four&hyphen;month notification period. Okay, the government has expanded that by one month, but it is still too rigorous. If the claim has not been registered by that time, the native title applicant cannot be a party to future applications and loses their right to negotiate. We say these are too tight and too inflexible. Given the fact that an application may be lodged late in the period, there is a real risk that registration may not be completed in time for the time lines to be satisfied. That registration may not be completed at no fault of the claimants. In respect of registration of claims covering previous exclusive and non&hyphen;exclusive possession acts, we had a debate about that the other day. I would like to go to that later on in this part of the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP's position in a broad sense is that we do have a capacity for certification by rep bodies. That is important. Given the recognition that Senator Minchin has given to the role of rep bodies, I think it is important to stress that they do have a particular role here as well. We also import through our amendments a capacity for the registrar to oversee the process in a fairly substantial way. The registrar is not to register the application unless he or she is satisfied that the certification was reasonably made by the rep body. We have a provision to ensure administrative review. We have a provision that would cover fraud in an application. That is an important aspect in our proposal. We also have a provision to ensure that the process is a fast moving one. Our new provision, one that the government does not have, is provision 190AC which enables challenges to be made 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9938"> in the Federal Court as to the truth of the sworn facts in an application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, we have mechanisms in place that will test against truth, against fraud and against whether a claim was reasonably made. We think it is important for priority to be given by the registrar to claims in relation to areas over which section 29 notices have been given. That is covered by our proposed section 190A. We also have a real concern with the test on which the registrar is required to make an assessment of applications. We believe it should be a strictly objective test. We claim that the phrase `the registrar must be satisfied that' should be replaced with the phrase `it must be the case that', to give certainty to all. That objective test is important. We also have picked up some of the concerns raised in previous debates. It may not be possible for a subject area to be defined with the degree of certainty that is required by the government. Our 190B(2) allows for reasonable certainty which gives us a degree of flexibility through which there will be no unfair dismissal of people's claims on the basis of maybe not a precise description of the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There needs to be, under our provisions, an identification and clarification of the native title rights and interests. As I mentioned earlier, the connection test is an important aspect of this particular registration process. We think the government goes too far in impinging upon common law rights. We can live with the traditional physical association test proposed by the government but only if it is an alternative to other tests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that you can have that physical association test. But if people cannot meet that, there needs to be a test to cover circumstances where the traditional physical association would reasonably have been expected to be maintained but for the actions of governments or third parties in, for instance, barring native titleholders or claimants access to the land. That happened quite a deal in the 1960s after the equal wage case. I think the government's provision is much too rigorous and does not pick up any such denial or barring of access or continual lock outs that happen consistently now.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think the government also cuts back on common law rights in that they do not have another leg to their connection test&mdash;a leg to pick up the common law test which was spelt out by Chief Justice Brennan, then Justice Brennan, in Mabo. He used&mdash;and it is important for us to fix on this&mdash;the common law test:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . where a clan or group has continued to acknowledge the laws and, so far as is practicable, observed the customs based on the traditions of the clan or group in question, whereby the traditional connection with the lands has been substantially maintained.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That broader test is based on a cultural, spiritual and customary connection&mdash;particularly a cultural and customary connection. Were we not to pick it up and reflect it in legislation we would be cutting away common law rights. It is the test; it is the words spelt out in Mabo. I think it is reasonable for the parliament to pick those words up. If we do not then we would not be going as far as the common law currently provides for the basis of a claim and we would be leaving the government and public open for taxpayer funded compensation. It is important for us to have those three test in the alternative in order to meet the necessary connection for registration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned about natural justice. Our amendment to 190B(7) and (8) picks up the point that where material is being considered by the registrar and that material is adverse to the applicants, natural justice dictates that they must have an opportunity to respond. There is a need for flexibility in the alternative. People should be allowed to claim for compensation in the alternative and our amendment to 190B(10) picks up on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned overlaps which is a particular problem. Everyone talks about the Kalgoorlie situation. The government has a number of tests that need to be met. We picked those up. We also believe that we need to be a bit more sensitive about the overlap situation. It could very well be quite justified that there be overlap, but let us make sure that there is a capacity to bring the cases together. In the case of overlapping applications, for instance, and claiming common rights, the later application under our test 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9939"> cannot be registered unless it asserts the common law rights are held jointly with the earlier applicants. That is important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that we have picked up something suggested in the process in recent weeks, providing for a process of amalgamation of overlapping applications. This is based on the transitional applications, which I will go to in a few moments. The power of amendment of application needs to have some flexibility. The powers of the Federal Court need to be clarified in terms of the range of material which they can have before them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have mentioned overlap. We do have some provisions relating to that which I mentioned. Part of the problem is what you do with the cases that are already there. How do you handle the transitional situation? We say you can do that in two ways. The government does it in one way, and that is to essentially have a retrospective test. We think that has some real constitutional problems, some real just terms problems as well as the retrospectivity problem and the fact that it is based on taking away the rights of one particular racial group in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say that you should have an amendment which applies the registration test to applications lodged after 27 June 1996, which was the original date upon which the government announced that the new registration test was to take effect. The process provides for the appropriate minister to request that the registrar apply the new registration test to applications lodged after 27 June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We say that, in the first instance, the registrar must give the registered claimants and rep bodies the opportunity to comply with the new test. If that does not occur within a short time, within 60 days, the registrar can then assess the applications as against the new test. It gives an important role for the rep bodies&mdash;a role that the rep bodies are well suited to cover. That takes you back to the middle of 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to see how we can go one step further&mdash;that is, to look at the applications lodged since 1 January 1994. Our process provides for rep bodies to seek the amalgamation of applications through conciliation, such that all common rights and interests are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> subject to one application. If the claimant groups are unable to reach a resolution within six months, then the tribunal or a recognised state or territory body will arbitrate the amalgamation of the applications such that there is only one application registered over an area of land. We think that process is much more constitutional and sustainable than the government's and is one that allows a certain degree of time, though not too long, for a conciliatory approach to this particular process and, in doing so, does away with some of the constitutional problems the government's provision would have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is concern in respect of registration of claims covering previous exclusive and non&hyphen;exclusive possession acts. The government, in the debate last week, alluded to sections 47(A) and (B). I probably will not have enough time to go through the problems we have with the regime suggested by the government. In short, we have identified the problems with the regime proposed by the government with respect to claims covering previous exclusive and non&hyphen;exclusive possession acts. That regime is not broad enough, it applies only to beneficial legislation and it does extinguish. Also, the right to negotiate, which applies in those circumstances, is nothing like a full blown right to negotiate which would be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suggest to the committee, in respect of this particular part of the government's amendments, that we defer this in the way that we deferred amendment No. 229 on Friday until we resolve the extinguishment regime. Once we do that we will be in a better position to proceed with the registration of claims covering previous exclusive and non-exclusive possession acts. If we are not to do that, I will need to canvass this issue at greater length. I have tried to go through these issues within the 15 minutes required, and in doing so I hope I have not missed too many out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a common purpose with respect to overlapping. We believe that our provisions are more workable in respect of the transition period. We also believe our provisions are much more constitutionally based. In fact, they are soundly constitutionally based when 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9940"> the government's are possibly not. With respect to the criteria, the benchmarks against which a claim is to be tested, we do have that wide benchmark covering false claims, fraud and a test of reasonableness of the evidence as opposed to the actual claims made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope the government looks at some of these amendments positively. There was an indication last week that it may very well do so but, in any event, I hope in this particular debate we have a little bit more flexibility from the government. We believe that the measures we are proposing are measures that should be very easily picked up by it and by the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This section of the bill introduces a registration test to ensure that only claims the government considers to have merit are registered on the register of native title claims. The government has moved three amendments to this section of the bill. These amendments, firstly, specify that the registrar must reconsider applications which have been amended; secondly, specify that the registrar can advise a claimant that their application would not meet the requirements of the registration test unless it is amended; and, thirdly, specify that the registrar does not have to continue considering an application if it has been dismissed or finalised by the Federal Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats and the Greens (WA) are seeking to amend this section of the bill to ensure that claims will not be registered unless they comply with strengthened criteria; introduce strengthened criteria which require representative bodies to certify that requirements in relation to the identification of the area, the identification of the claimants, the rights and the interests claimed and the factual basis for the claim are satisfied; and provide a mechanism for dealing with overlapping claims on the current register and for dealing with claims registered since 27 June 1996 which may not satisfy the new test. The majority of the opposition's amendments are identical to those of the Democrats and Greens (WA). However, in addition, the opposition will seek to assign a clear role for the registrar and representative bodies in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> registration process and to make provisions for challenges against false claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine will move an amendment which will require that native title claimants will have to prove not only that they have had an association with the land but also that they have had regular physical access to the land. While the ALP have indicated they will support Senator Harradine's amendment, the Democrats and Greens have indicated that they will oppose it. In moving this amendment, the Democrats do not believe that Senator Harradine has given enough consideration to issues such as those raised in the recent report on the stolen generation whereby many Aboriginal people were forcibly removed from their families and continuous physical relationship with the land was deemed impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is considerable support for the refining of the registration test. I think everyone agrees with that. But it cannot be so refined that it creates a situation where the registration test is so onerous that it effectively wipes out the accessibility to native title procedures. It really is an issue of access to justice. A harsh test is not the issue. The injustice flows from a harsh test in combination with unreasonably tight time frames from notices that will have the effect of impairing or extinguishing native title. The government is attempting to say to native title applicants, `Sure, you have native title. You even have native title procedures. Just use them.' It is very much a `let them eat cake' attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrat&hyphen;Greens (WA) amendments will ensure that there are no technical knockouts of native title. Professor Langton, whom I mentioned earlier in the debate, had this to say in response to a question from Senator Ferris on overlapping claims&mdash;the main excuse the government is using to substantiate such a massive high jump bar for indigenous people to access their rights:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, in answer to Senator Ferris's question, I wanted to explain the problem in this way. I spoke before about how one of the principles which anthropologists have identified in order to ascertain the workings of an Aboriginal land tenure system is the motion of descent from an apical ancestor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with all human cultures, the apical ancestor may be real or legendary, to use a lay term. For 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9941"> instance, British royalty had at one time its constitution in divinity and it was believed that the king, or the queen, was the divine representative on earth. That is why the monarch is the representative of the Church of England, because of the doctrine of the monarch as divinity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a similar way, most human cultures have a belief system about ancestry. These days with DNA and RNA testing, some of this can be affirmed or denied, but much of it still is not amenable to scientific inquiry. Belief systems are belief systems and as we know with racism, generally false propositions which operate on an illogic are not amenable to facts. So in the same way belief systems are simply belief systems and there is no point in taking blood tests and doing DNA tests because it is not relevant to the exercise. One would not do a DNA test on the queen to see if she were, in fact, a descendant of God.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She went on to say, and I feel it is necessary to read the whole text here because it is important to note:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of apical ancestry in Aboriginal belief systems is one of belief, particularly because of such things as, say, in some Aboriginal societies there is the taboo on speaking the names of the dead. Because of that you have very shallow genealogical information remembered by any particular generation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any particular generation will remember two or three generations back and then beyond that, the names of ancestors are somewhat mythologised because one is not allowed to speak their names. For instance, two brothers could be conflated into one person because of the details of their actual life histories not being remembered because of certain taboos.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that range of cultural factors which I have covered very briefly, you then have the impact of recent historical events such as the removal of children, the establishment of missions, the epidemics such as the Spanish flu following the First World War, labour legislation such as under the welfare ordinances in the Northern Territory, and various other impacts which disrupted populations. People have been separated across very wide distances by the practice, for instance, of locking up people who were perceived to be half castes or quarter castes and so forth in the Kahlin Compound and on Croker Island and the various other institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The memory then of who was related to who for an indigenous cultural grouping is lost sometimes with such impacts. People now are only starting to find out, with the records being opened, particularly the Commonwealth archives in the Northern Territory, and access being made more easy for Aboriginal people, that this person and this person 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are brother and sister. But you find this out 50 years after their birth, or you find out that that is the case 100 years after their birth. So the actual remembered constitution of local Aboriginal customary groups has been disrupted by these events. It is quite legitimate then to try to reconstruct, from historical sources, the constitution of these groups. But, at the same time, one again comes up against the problem of belief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One finds in preparing land claims that a group of people who have been separated from all of that part of the customary group by enforced government removals will have been brought up over a number of generations to believe that they are the descendants of a certain person and that person only, while this group over here believes that they are the descendant of another person and that person only. They may come to find out later, from an anthropologist, say in a land claim&mdash;and this happens&mdash;that those two apical ancestors were siblings. They were half siblings or full siblings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So you have this problem of overlapping claims and it is very difficult then to sort out those relationships and also to sort out how the connections to land can be established. Although Senator Minchin puts it as though it is just a simple matter&mdash;you have a physical test and there you are, it is decided&mdash;the evidence which we received shows that that is very misleading. It is very misleading to make a physical test one of the bases on which these claims can be knocked out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to give you some other illustrations from other cultures. The Jews were separated from the land of Palestine for about 1,500 years. One of the Jewish ceremonies which was held each year by Jews&mdash;who were certainly not in any way physically connected to the land of Israel&mdash;was that at the Passover they would say, `Next year, we will celebrate the Passover in Palestine.' Are we going to say to those Jewish people, `You have no right to return to Palestine because you have no physical connection; you have not had a physical connection for over a thousand years'? I am afraid you would find yourself in a very difficult position if you made that kind of statement. It is exactly the same when we say to Aboriginal people, `You cannot visit these areas because you have no physical connection that you can prove.' It is like saying to the Jews, `You cannot visit Palestine because you have no physical 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9942"> connection; you have not had a physical connection for over a thousand years.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you my own experience. My father was killed when I was 2&half; and I was raised by a Scottish grandmother. She often told us of Scotland. I certainly have no physical connection with Scotland, but I returned there last year and I discovered that one of the connections I had was to the Macgregor clan. I discovered in returning to Scotland that the name Macgregor was banned by the English for one hundred years. It was not even allowed to be used. I went to the grave of Rob Roy Macgregor and I saw an epitaph written, `Macgregor despite them'. I have to say to you that something very deep was touched in my soul, not because I had any physical connection to the place but because there was a very deep cultural and spiritual connection which for me was very real.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the same way, I stood on Culloden moor, where the English in 1745 slaughtered thousands of Scotsmen. I went around that battlefield and I saw headstones saying, `Here lie the bodies of 150 Macdonalds,' `Here lie the bodies of 150 Macleods,' and so on. I had no physical connection at all to that place&mdash;this was 1745, over 250 years ago&mdash;but I had a very real connection in a spiritual and cultural sense when I stood in that place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the problem when you say it must be a physical connection. How does one prove a physical connection, given all of the problems which Professor Langton has raised? How do you discount a cultural and spiritual connection to places like that? Are you going to say to the Catholics, `You may not visit the Vatican because you have no physical connection to the Vatican'? You can see the problem, I am sure. I do not think anyone in this place would be game to say that to a Catholic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we take into consideration the genocide that has happened to indigenous people, the provision of a physical connection test is an amendment that could have easily been drafted by the discredited historian David Irving. I appeal to the government and to the Senate to accept the Greens and Democrat amendments as fulfilling the need for a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> registration test which will sort out the various problems that have been enunciated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will in no way accept Senator Harradine's amendment because it is based on a false premise. Of course Senator Harradine's amendment does improve the government's registration test. But neither the government's registration test nor the improvement which Senator Harradine is moving fulfils the basic principle that I have enunciated&mdash;the principle that, in the end, there are spiritual and cultural connections to land which are far deeper than any physical connection and that sometimes those kinds of connections can last for 200, 500 or 1,000 years, as in the case of the Jewish people. I commend our amendments to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a considerable amount of agreement between the Democrats-Greens (WA) amendments and the opposition amendments on the registration test. Even where the amendments are not identical, there is so little difference as to not be significant. As has been mentioned, the government's amendments are technical and need not concern certainly the Democrats and the Greens in relation to dividing or opposing them, but within these amendments there is, if you like, a line or a degree of difference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators may remember that, in the 1993 native title debate, it was the Greens (WA) who argued that there should not be a threshold test. It is still our belief that that is the ideal. However, we do understand that it is the position of the National Indigenous Working Group that there should be some kind of small not onerous registration test that does not restrict bona fide claimants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the main point of issue among this group of amendments is the threshold test and that occurs around opposition amendment No. 267, the Greens-Democrats amendment No. 237 and Senator Harradine's amendment No. 2. It is my belief and the belief of the Greens (WA) that the requirement of physical connection should not be in the registration test. It is not necessarily essential to determine native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What native title is and where it remains are matters which should be left to the courts. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9943"> It will very often be a complicated question of fact. It is not a matter that should be pre&hyphen;empted by a registration test. Whether there is sufficient connection to land to support a native title claim will vary from case to case and may well depend on the laws and customs asserted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under 190B(5) claimants have to satisfy the factual basis for native title. According to the Greens-Democrats amendments it must be prima facie to be sufficient to support the assertion that native title rights and interests claimed exist. If physical connection is relevant, it no doubt will be included in the statement of a factual basis on which native title is asserted. It is our belief that there is no benefit in making it mandatory. It can have the potential to only disadvantage Aboriginal people from being able to establish their native title because of what in some cases may well be Eurocentric assumptions as to the nature of the connection on which those assumptions are based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to quote the minority report of the Joint Committee on Native Title in relation to the physical connection test. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The profound unfairness of this test will be apparent if it is "used in order to work injustice to Aborigines who have been locked out from the land".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was a quote by Father Frank Brennan in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  of 26 September 1997. The report then states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the common law test is not one of "traditional physical connection" but of maintenance of observance of laws and customs "so far as it is practicable to do so." There will be situations where a claimant has not had physical access to certain land but retains the stories and knowledge of traditional law relating to his or her traditional country.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a quote from the submission of Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation of 2 October 1997. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in the Bill are manifestly unjust because they fail to recognise the spiritual and cultural connection of Aboriginal people to land and prevent claimants obtaining the right to negotiate over their traditional country as an effect of being excluded by others.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is my opinion that the issue brought up in the minority report on page 147 is not fixed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by way of Senator Harradine's amendment. I would like to also quote the lead judgment in Mabo of Justices Brennan, Mason and McHugh that has been accepted as an accurate statement of the minimum rights available to native title holders. Regarding the physical connection they said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a clan or group has continued to acknowledge the laws and (so far as practicable) to observe the customs based on the traditions of that clan or group, whereby their traditional connexion with the land has been substantially maintained, the traditional community title of that clan or group can be said to remain in existence. The common law can, by reference to the traditional laws and customs of an indigenous people, identify and protect the native rights and interests to which they give rise. However, when the tide of history has washed away any real acknowledgment of traditional law and any real observance of traditional customs, the foundation of native title has disappeared. A native title which has ceased with the abandoning of laws and customs based on tradition cannot be revived for contemporary recognition. Australian law can protect the interests of members of an indigenous clan or group, whether communally or individually, only in conformity with the traditional laws and customs of the people to whom the clan or group belongs and only where members of the clan or group acknowledge those laws and observe those customs (so far as it is practicable to do so).</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This analysis goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The common law test is not one of "traditional physical connection" but of maintenance of observance of laws and customs "so far as it is practicable to do so".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would also like to quote briefly from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  of the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Fund, which is dated 24 September 1997. Mr Terry O'Shane said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consideration by government of the threshold test needs to be framed with the evidence that has been presented regarding the stolen generation. You need to take that into consideration, because you talk about a physical connection when the policy of past governments of this country has alienated our children from their parents and alienated people from their land. If people are going to sit in government and say to us that we have to have a physical connection, and really mean that, then there is something terribly wrong in this country&mdash;terribly, terribly wrong.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I put this to you. Remember, we have various elements that we have debated where the spiritual connection has been downgraded, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9944"> ignored, given a minor role or not even considered by this government so far. We have the situation where actions by non-indigenous Australia may well be denying on an ongoing basis the rights of indigenous Australians who have kept up the law, the knowledge and the stories of land to which they have been excluded through various means.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think this is acceptable. I think in this case it might be useful to clarify the situation of how we can address these amendments. I suggest that when we get to that section we might first deal with Senator Harradine's amendment No. 2, and then we will know whether there is any need to clarify further the difference between the amendments of the National Indigenous Working Group and those of the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></SPEECH>

The government has proposed that there be at least one person in the native title claimant group who has, or used to have, a traditional physical connection to the claimed area. That establishes a prima facie case. That weeds out a lot of claims that are ambit claims. It allows people on rural properties to know who they are dealing with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the native title legislation, farmers have to either arbitrate, negotiate or litigate. In the end, if they have to sit down and negotiate with people, the legislation that is before the Senate at the moment would allow them to negotiate with mainly people that they know. If the Labor Party's amendments are carried or the Greens' amendments are carried, that would allow anyone from anywhere to come in and make a claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not all of these claimants went of their own accord. They did not all go voluntarily. Some were moved, and some voluntary went to a better house in a better community, where there are schools and hospitals. But let us not get into who was pushed and who went.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because I do not think we will ever be able to find out who went voluntarily and who went unwillingly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This might have happened 50 or 60 years ago. The property may have changed hands four times since then. For instance, in Cunnamulla there was a 500,000 acre property cut up in 1954. These people then left and lived in the town. Let us say that, even before that, these properties that these people lived on could have changed hands three or four times. So the people who are now living on the property will have to be responsible for something that happened up to 40 or 50 years ago. That is not correct. When these actions happened, it was legal. It is most unfair to imply a penalty on someone 40 years after.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say that Sugar Ray Robinson said that the man on the moon could put a native title claim in now. If we pass these amendments, that will not change. What everyone is saying is that we have to reduce these ambit claims. These amendments will remove the chance of removing ambit claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Local people are prepared to sit down and hammer out agreements with the people that they know around the areas&mdash;people that they went to school with or that they have known in the local town. What is happening after they negotiate these agreements is that someone else then comes in and puts a claim right over the top of them. Some lawyer comes and assembles a claim with a couple of hundred people who do not even know where they came from or whether the claims are genuine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to the chamber that I think the government position is fair. Graziers and pastoralists would have preferred a tighter test but they will accept this particular test which is `has or previously had a traditional physical connection with the claimed area'. Their preferred position would have been `a current traditional physical connection to the whole of the land under claim', but they are prepared to accept the government's 10-point plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this physical connection is downgraded, then ambit claims are going to mount everywhere. We are going to see what we have seen with the 670 claims that have already been lodged and that is black claim on black 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9945"> claim on black claim. We have seen three black&hyphen;on&hyphen;black claims around the Charleville area. Unless you can get some physical connection test, then we are going to have ambit claims coming from everywhere. It is not going to be in the interests of Aboriginals or in the interests of pastoralists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to say to Senator Woodley that, when he made his visit back to the old country, he visited there. He did not go in and claim the land that his forefathers owned because he had some sort of physical connection; he went and visited the place and obviously had a pleasant time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a bit concerned about Senator Boswell's contribution that he made on behalf of his constituents. One of the things he said was that litigation will grow and costs will be incurred. I do not like hearing that argument either in this particular field or in other fields. In Victoria at the moment, for example, there has been an abolition of common law in cases where people are injured through the negligence of their employer. All sorts of restrictions have been placed on common law rights, based on the proposition that lawyers cost too much and that there is too much litigation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of great concern to this society if we are going to cut down the rights of people&mdash;whether they are indigenous people, whether they are workers, whether they are people who have been injured on the roads or whether they are people who have had their houses damaged around Albert Park. It is a very worrying trend that people are not able to exercise their rights. It has become a mantra&mdash;not only by this government but also by governments all around the place&mdash;that lawyers must not get money, that people's rights must be cut down, that people have fairly tenuous rights and therefore they should have them abolished. It is a very bad trend. It is a trend that is going on here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, if I could ask one question about the registration test and the fact that if a claim for registration is refused then that can be reviewed by the Federal Court. Does that mean reviewed both as to the facts and as to the law; is it a re&hyphen;hearing? If it is, then in effect the Federal Court is going to hear an application for registration in any event rather than the registrar. What would happen is that people would put their claim before the registrar and, if it was knocked back, they would then go to the Federal Court and have a full hearing anyhow. That would seem to me to be the effect of proposed section 190D.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I draw the committee's attention to sheet 810 which contains my proposed amendment to this schedule. Subsection (7) at the present moment says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Registrar must be satisfied that at least one member of the native title claim group currently 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9946"> has or previously had a traditional physical connection with the area covered by the application.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Then I am proposing to add:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If not so satisfied, the Registrar must be satisfied that the absence of traditional physical connection has been caused by conduct of a grantee of an interest in the land or by an act of government.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am not sure that I understood Senator Woodley, and he may be able to elaborate for me. Senator Woodley seems to indicate that this amendment would in fact exclude the children of the stolen generation. Clearly, that is not my intention and I cannot see for the life of me how it would do that because that clearly was an action by a government. I am putting it to Senator Woodley and other honourable senators that they should perhaps have a look at that and, if it does, perhaps we could clean it up along the way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee see this particular area as very important. The benefit of registration to native title claimants is, of course, that it enables them to exercise certain statutory rights. It is a trigger for the exercise of those rights between the time of registration and the determination of their native title claim. Specifically, it gives them the benefit of the right to negotiate and access to the National Native Title Tribunal and its mediation services, so registration is a critical issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think everybody in this chamber wished that certain things had not occurred at the time of the NTA debate in December of 1993, because the threshold at that time was far lower than the government at that stage wanted. It is a matter that has given considerable concern, as has been expressed around the chamber, to many of the Aboriginal groups who believe that this is a matter that should be rectified; that the threshold should be increased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going to the question itself, there have been many native title holders who have enjoyed continuing and unhindered access to their traditional country. Others, for a variety of reasons, have not. I refer to evidence to the joint committee at pages 995 to 999 of native title holders being denied physical access. A past history of locked gates and exclusion beyond the control of indigenous people must not count against them in the registration 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> process for the mediation of native title claims. Indeed, to require a physical connection criteria for registration of claims solely would discriminate between native title holders in this country in that they could register an application for mediation. Those who have unhindered physical access would possess a superior native title to those who have not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an intolerable distinction, especially when it is considered that it results from an injustice perpetrated against indigenous people. Accordingly, my proposed amendment provides that physical access is deemed to have been regular up to 23 December 1996 if native title holders have been denied access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come back to the point made by Senator Woodley. I fear that there may have been a misunderstanding because my previous sheet 810 did have under `Registration test' amendment No. 2, which really was to do with access and will be dealt with under topic No. 14 when we get to it. The proposed states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3A) For the purposes of paragraph (3)(a) physical access to land is deemed to have been regular up to 23 December 1996 if a government or the grantee of any interest in the land has regularly denied members of the native title claim group physical access to the land.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In fact, I will have a further amendment to delete the `regular' there because that could have been intermittently denied. This `regular test' is too high indeed. It may well have been as a result of looking at that particular amendment that the misunderstanding has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through you, Madam Chair, I would ask Senator Bolkus and also the minister about the Brennan Mabo test. If you look at that test&mdash;and you can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;it states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine, you should be glad you got in first with that question because I was going to ask you the reverse question. My question was going to be: you know the Brennan test in Mabo. How can you maintain that your proposal goes anywhere near that in the non&hyphen;physical sense? So take that on notice as I answer your question in respect of (6), (7), (8) and (9).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is a very important distinction, which I am sure you appreciate, between the government's proposals, your proposal and (a) and (b) of our proposal: they are all, in a sense, based on a physical connection. But what the High Court did say in Mabo was that it could be a little bit more broad than that and that there could be sufficient connection based, as Justice Brennan said, in the words that we use in leg three of our three&hyphen;legged connection test. Justice Brennan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a clan or group has continued to acknowledge the laws and (so far as  practicable) observe the customs based on the traditions of the clan or group in question, whereby their traditional connection with the land has been substantially maintained.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think `traditional connection' may sometimes not be a physical one; it may be an intermittent physical one. It may be that the land is of some customary and traditional significance. Access to it from time to time would be important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Obviously, under option three of our connection test the level of what is being claimed, sought, would differ in most circumstances from that which is being sought under (a) and (b). I think that is an important point to make there: that in those circumstances what is being claimed would be substantially different from circumstances where there has been a physical association. But I think we would be on dangerous ground if we were not to embrace something like the Mabo test. As I said at the start, (5), (6), (7) and (8) of the government's clause 190B on page 195 do not really pick up what the High Court thinks is necessary and what is reflected in Mabo by Justice Brennan.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, that is one concise reflection of what the common law is; it is not the only one. To the extent that we do not go as far as that, I think we are clearly taking away the common law rights of this particular Aboriginal race. The taxpayer may very well have to pay for something they would not have to pay for if we were being fair and careful. I just do not know why the government has not gone to the extent of the common law. They should. As a closing point, I ask you, Minister, why your provision does not pick that up or do you think it does pick it up?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My answer is also in response to Senator Harradine's question. Of course we must remember that what constitutes a traditional connection for the purposes of the Brennan test, presuming that remains the test that the High Court applies, is entirely a matter for the courts. Our bill leaves that entirely to the courts when it comes to a determination of native title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there was a lay presumption when the Mabo decision was handed down that what the court was basically talking about was physical connection. But because, obviously, in the case of the Mabo claim there was clearly demonstrably a physical connection, that word was not used in the test. I think there was, as I say, that lay presumption, but in each case it will be entirely a matter for the courts to determine what constitutes traditional connection and whether the claimants in each particular case can meet the court's test of traditional connection, whatever that may be in the particular case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our bill does not affect that in any way. We are talking here about the registration test for the registration of claims for the purposes of the statutory rights and benefits available under the Native Title Act. We are not talking about a claim being accepted by the Federal Court for the purposes of the determination of native title, which is entirely a matter for the court, as I say. There is no attempt by the bill to put in place any sort of threshold for the purposes of a determination of either a spiritual or physical connection. We are talking 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9948"> about registration and the considerable benefits that flow from registration per se.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, our test simply provides that just one member out of a claim group&mdash;that can be as big as the claimants like&mdash;must have had at some stage in their whole life some physical connection with the area. If you take the obvious, you are suggesting that claims should be registered and attract the benefits of registration even though not one member of the claim group has ever had, at any stage, any physical connection with the land in question. Therefore, on the reasonable person test we think what we are proposing is entirely reasonable. However, we have had a good look at Senator Harradine's amendment and we would be prepared to accept that amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the light of the comments that have been made around the chamber, we think that is a not inappropriate amendment. But I would remind you that the general lay assumption that there was at least some physical connection with land, even though we say that is entirely a matter for the courts, was at least in circulation. The clear presumption was that a lot of Aboriginal people would not be able to successfully claim native title because of dispossession. That is why the previous government set up the Indigenous Land Fund. We supported that Indigenous Land Fund. We continue to support that Indigenous Land Fund. It was and is about enabling Aboriginal people who have been dispossessed and will not be able to sustain a native title claim to buy the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are putting, out of the budget, $120 million a year into the fund so that it will reach $1.3 billion in seven years. It will then be able to be used to buy $45 million worth of land every year, for eternity. They can buy $45 million worth of land for ever. That is the arrangement that was entered into by the previous government, which we supported, in recognition of dispossession. We are supporting that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given that we are not affecting in any way the right of claimants to pursue their claim and prove whatever connection they believe meets the test&mdash;that is entirely up to them&mdash;we believe that the registration test is at a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> bare minimum: one member must, at some stage in their life, have had a previous physical connection. It is the most minimal test that you could put in place in this regard. If we accept Senator Harradine's amendment&mdash;which, as I indicated, the government is prepared to do&mdash;that is an entirely appropriate threshold to place on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of this understanding about physicality, I again draw your attention to the regulations of the current act and the native title determination applications, which refer in A9 to information about any physical connection that exists or existed between the applicants and the land. The regulations to the act passed by this parliament, which could have been disallowed, refer to physical connections. Let us not entirely rewrite history.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond to Senator Harradine's question to me some time ago. I should also apologise to Senator Boswell&mdash;he is not a dope. I know that he holds very sincerely the views that he puts; I just disagree with him. I probably disagreed a little too vigorously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was looking at Senator Harradine's earlier amendment, but we have now had a look at his subsequent amendment and, while it is an improvement on what the government is proposing, we still have problems with it. No physical connection test was mentioned in the Mabo judgment, so it is imposing an additional test, and I think a very rigorous one, which was never envisaged under Mabo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though the amendment is an improvement on the government's original proposal, the test puts the onus of proof on indigenous people to prove traditional physical connection and whether or not there has been conduct by a lessee which has prevented that physical connection. An act of government is much easier to define; it is much clearer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another reason why we believe there is still a big problem with Senator Harradine's amendment is that it may not have been the action of a grantee or a government; it could have been an action of the churches which removed people. Certainly, going back several generations, the churches were involved in the removal of people from their traditional lands. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9949"> The churches have apologised for that. I know that, in particular, the Uniting Church has been involved in a ceremony on Croker Island to say sorry. The churches were involved in removals, but they are neither grantees nor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, in some of my writings I have recorded the story of how the Reverend Alice Bramley took children from the Camooweal area to Brisbane, a couple of thousand kilometres away, during the Second World War, and some of those children never returned. These are the problems we have with Senator Harradine's amendment, even though we acknowledge that it is an improvement on what the government was originally proposing. The principle of physical connection is still the problem.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share the concerns that Senator Woodley has outlined in relation to Senator Harradine's proposed amendment. I agree that the registration should not be restricted to physical connection. We believe that spiritual and cultural connection is actually more important. It is ironic that the high jump for registration should actually be higher than the high jump for determination. That does not make any sense at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under Senator Harradine's amendment, the claimants would have to satisfy the registrar that absence of traditional physical connection has been caused by conduct of a grantee of an interest in land or by an act of government. This could be considered to be insulting to many indigenous people. There may well be circumstances in which absence of traditional physical connection is caused by parties other than a grantee of an interest in land or government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, as Senator Woodley pointed out, it could be the action of a church, or they could be driven off by people managing a pastoral lease, an if the word `grantee' is in the legislation, it becomes the law as is practised. I would like to share a couple of stories of people with restricted access which has not been caused by either grantee or government. One example is from chapter 1 of a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Recognising Native Title</EMPHASIS>. It gives an example of connection preserved 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> through long absence from country which was in the Kaititj Walpiri land claim of 1981. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the witnesses was a woman in her seventies who had survived the Coniston Massacre in 1927. After the massacre she had been taken away and did not return to her country until the preparation for the land claim in 1981. Rosie Nakamara was to give evidence about part of the claim area that was inaccessible by vehicle so she was taken in a helicopter to this place she hadn't been to for 50 years.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Neither the grantee nor the government was restricting that access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to another example of which I have been recently appraised, in Western Australia Robert Bropho from the Swan Valley fringe dwellers mentioned a story in which a particular site was one with which he had been familiar as a child, but he is the only member of his clan group who had physical connection and has memory of that area. The stories were known amongst the clan, the law was known amongst others in the group and the spiritual connection was strong, yet, because he has a heart problem, that may well be lost to the clan should he die before a claim is processed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there could be ongoing problems. It could be the death of the one person from a clan group who has had connection with that land. That person may well have passed on the law, the stories and the knowledge to other members of that group. I really do not think we are being realistic in making, as I say, the registration higher than the determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Minchin said, `Let the court decide.' He is not allowing the court to decide. He is saying that we will legislate away those rights for those people who the court may in fact decide to grant determination. So he is cutting them off at the pass and saying, `No, we'll stop you before you go any further.' I urge Senator Harradine to take into consideration those cases where there really is evidence that there are bodies other than those of a grantee or government who may have restricted access, and there may well be physical and spiritual connection to the land because of that.</PARA>

I come to the situation now of examining whether or not I ought to proceed with my amendment or whether I should support the opposition's amendment. As I see it, the opposition's amendment takes up the government's proposal in A(1).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am wondering whether that particular amendment would not expand the claims which were ambit type claims. Irrespective of what we do, my advice is that claimants could simply go through the courts if we do not include this in here. My proposed amendment relates specifically to the registration test set out in 190B. My advice is that traditional physical connection is not part of the common law test of the existence of native title and the test expressed by Brennan, as has been said around the place, is such. I will not go into all of this. I have had plenty of advice and a lot of legal advice on a number of things, but it is quite clear that claimants could proceed by way of interlocutory injunction seeking such. Therefore, we had best put something in the legislation which reflects the common law. I am now inclined to support the amendment that is put forward by Senator Bolkus.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I indicate the government's attitude to the ALP amendments and go through them one by one. At this stage, we have no objection to amendments 262 and 265. Our difficulty with amendment 257 is that its effect is to enable representative bodies to apply the registration test and to determine whether claims should be registered. We do not think that that is appropriate. We think that would amount to a conflict of interest. Our amendments go a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> long way to enhance the role of representative bodies in the process to enable them to facilitate the claims, but essentially they are the proponents and facilitators of claims. For the integrity of the system, it is essential that there be, and be seen to be, an independent assessment of the merits of a claim prior to its registration. So I do not think we can possibly support that particular amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That also goes to the question of challenges against claims. The other part of opposition amendment No. 257 is the issue of challenges to be made against claimant applications. I suppose at one level you can see the merits of such a proposition, but the problem is that it would really amount to enormous delays and uncertainty in the whole process. As I understand it, it would mean that the whole right to negotiate is put on hold while a Federal Court challenge is heard on the claimant application, which we think would be entirely unsatisfactory and not supportable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 258 relates to amendments we are bringing forward later in relation to the right to negotiate. I think you will appreciate what we are doing in relation to timing. Consideration of applications for registration is, as you know, to extend the time period to three months and allow another month in which claims can then be registered. So you would lodge a claim within three months, there would be another month for it to be registered and then a total of six months for the negotiation period&mdash;the same as is currently the case. We believe the amendments that we are moving under the right to negotiate process will deal with the problem that the opposition seeks to address in amendment 258.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 259 would limit the capacity of the registrar to have regard to information provided by the Commonwealth, a state or a territory when applying the registration test, notwithstanding that that information may be very relevant to deciding whether or not the application satisfied the registration test. We do not think that is appropriate at all either. We think that governments should be able to provide information relevant to the application for registration. There seems no 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9951"> earthly reason why you would seek to limit or prevent that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 267 guts the registration test by effectively removing four of the nine conditions. It waters down the registration test to a point where it will not achieve the purpose for which I thought the opposition joined us&mdash;that is, to ensure that only claims of real merit would be able to be registered through an objective process. If you have a test which really amounts to enabling an assertion that you hold native title to be sufficient to have it registered, that is no test at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 269 would not prevent separate claims being made by members of the same native title claim group. We think it is fundamental to a sensible registration test that you have a mechanism in it so that you do not have people in the same native title claim group making their own separate claims. If you talk to the Indigenous Working Group, ATSIC and the Aboriginal people, you will know that that is one of the big problems they have at the moment in terms of competing claims by members of the same claim groups. We do not think the procedure proposed by the opposition under which applicants can apply to the court for an order to amend or replace the application that has already been registered is going to work. It would produce considerable uncertainty if these registered applications can then be amended or replaced by subsequent applications. We think that is unworkable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have a problem with amendment No. 273. We have already set down in the bill a mechanism by which there can be judicial review of a decision of the registrar. But this seems to invoke a mechanism by which there can be a review of the actual merits as opposed to a judicial review and have the Federal Court remake the registrar's decision. We do not think it is appropriate to have what would amount to a review of the merits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 274 would enable applicants to apply to the Federal Court for an extension of time for registration after the issue of a section 29 notice. Again, we think that is completely unworkable. If you are allowed to go to the Federal Court and have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a hearing as to whether you get an extension of time for the registration of your claim, the whole right to negotiate process would be set back while that sort of claim was being heard. Then, subsequently, there may be an extension. As I have said, we have extended the time from three months and we are adding another month to enable claims to be registered, so that is four months. We think that is appropriate. The extension is there and it is clear. It is a definite time frame; it is one that should be supported. We should not be all back in the Federal Court waiting for court decisions as to whether and to what extent there should be extensions of time in response to a section 29 notice. We should not be subject to all the consequent delays that will ensue in relation to the right to negotiate process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those reasons, with the exception of amendments Nos 262 and 265, we find ourselves unable to accept the principal ALP amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously we are somewhat disappointed by that. I would like to take the opportunity to go through some of these amendments and maybe respond to Senator Minchin in respect of some of them. The minister says we give too much power in amendment 257 to the representative bodies in terms of a registration process. I ask the committee to keep in mind that what we do is allow a capacity for the rep bodies to certify and, of course, the government allows a capacity for the rep bodies in the process as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we say that the registrar has a role. Anyone can seek to pursue either the rep body route or, alternatively, go to the registrar. If anyone has a concern, they go to the registrar. It is very much within the alternative, and nothing forces them to go down the road of having the rep body do the certification. We say that, regardless of whatever route people take, in our proposal the registrar has a capacity to be satisfied that the certification was reasonably made. That gives the registrar a degree of latitude. The process then allows for a situation in cases of fraud, which is something that is quite necessary. I think 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9952"> we all agree that that is an area that should be focused upon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also, under our proposed section 190AC, enable challenges to be made in the Federal Court as to the truth of the sworn facts in the application. You have truth, reasonableness and fraud covered in different ways. Senator Minchin says, `Oh, well, if you've got these sorts of reviews and judicial review, then it extends the process for too long.' But under the government's proposal there is a capacity to go to the Federal Court in some circumstances. What we are saying is give people the choice and the alternative. Give the rep bodies a role&mdash;they are in a good position to satisfy that role&mdash;but ensure that, for anyone who may be concerned, there is a mechanism to go down the registrar route. We have three or four mechanisms in place that will ensure protection against bodgie claims. I do not think we can be fairer than that. If the concern is as to time, as I say, there is a capacity under your proposals to go to the Federal Court, and under ours as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of these things are quite reasonable. We spent a lot of hours trying to work them out and work them through to get the right words and whatever to try to get a process that flows and that does not have injustices. For instance, our proposal to make the registrar have to give priority to consideration of claims in relation to areas under section 29 notices is a pretty important one. Why shouldn't the registrar give priority to those processes? They are fairly important. They are ongoing. The need is to get an outcome. I do not know why the government is opposing that proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should have indicated earlier that we withdraw amendment No. 243. The test we propose in amendments 261, 263, 264, 266 and 267 as to having the registrar operate on strictly objective grounds is, I would have thought, a test which is in the interests of certainty. There is a bit of flexibility there that could have been picked up. In terms of the information provided, once again, I do not know whether Senator Minchin said he would pick this up, but it is hard for people to identify with 100 per cent precision a location 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or area subject to the claim. I think the words `reasonable certainty' are quite reasonable there. We are not in the business of unfairly bouncing people's claims when they substantially have a legitimate claim.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have discussed the connection test. We think it is important that natural justice applies. If there is material before the registrar on which he or she is going to rely which is adverse to the applicant, natural justice dictates that they should have an opportunity to respond. If there is a legal dispute thereafter, under Brandy that has to be considered by the court. What is wrong with that flow of information?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to overlaps, everyone expects that, in respect of an area of land, there may be in fact competing indigenous interests. To say that one has to be excluded by the other is a bit rigid. What we say is that there will be rare situations where rights claimed in a late application are different, but they have to be consistent with the ones in the prior application. That is a test which reduces the overlap. As I said earlier, we have a process to pick up the overlap and to bundle claims to ensure a speedy process. You will be meting out injustice to some people unless you give a degree of flexibility. As I say, they have to be consistent. When there are common rights claimed, the application cannot be registered unless it is agreed that those common rights are held jointly with the earlier application. What is the resistance to a capacity to amend an application? As to the powers of the Federal Court, once again, we have this reaction rather than assessment by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me finish with the transitional applications because I think it is important to look at what happens here. If you take your transitional regime back to before 27 June 1996&mdash;take it back to December 1994&mdash;you are going to have some pretty substantial constitutional problems. No matter what case you look at in recent years&mdash;Newcrest, Georgiardis, Mewett, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> cases and so on&mdash;there are existing rights. You have to be careful about retrospectively taking from a particular racial group the rights that they have. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9953">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we say is that it is important that we try to get a transitional arrangement in place which can bring applications together and which can reduce and eradicate the overlapping. What we say is: take your test back to 27 June 1996 when it was announced. It was fair cop from then on; it was prospective as to its application. Further back than that, give the registrar a capacity to get the rep bodies to try to amalgamate these applications to try to get conciliation of all the rights and interests into one application. Try to force it through the rep bodies. If they do not do that within six months&mdash;and let us face it, your process with a registrar with the resources they have is going to take longer than that to do&mdash;then get the tribunal or a recognised state or territory body to arbitrate the amalgamation on the applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said at the start, we have not just fallen upon this position. A lot of work has been done. A lot of precise discussions have taken place as to how we can provide a process which would not just eradicate overlapping but also sustain itself constitutionally. We have put a lot of thought into this. The font of all wisdom is not necessarily with the government on these matters, and we do not claim to have a monopoly on it either. But I would maintain that the suggestions that are embodied in our amendments are a really good balance, a constructive way through and a more certain way through because I think we have overcome the constitutionally related problems that the government has not overcome. It is disappointing that the government has not picked them up. I hope that, in the course of the voting, the Senate can pick up some more of these amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The structure of the bill is such that the question of applications for native title is dealt with separately from applications for compensation where native title has been extinguished. The sort of logic is that, if you are seeking to assert your native title, that is one process. If you are seeking compensation for the extinguishment or impairment of native title, that is a separate process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is simply the reason why in this case, when we are talking about registration claims in relation to claims made for native title, to seek determinations of native title you have to go to the register so that you have access to the statutory right to negotiate in relation to activity on land which you claim to be native title land. That is the whole gist of our registration test. There are, of course, all the provisions in the bill and in the act for making claims for compensation, and we just do not see the point in having this alternative procedure here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of registration is in relation to a claim for a determination that you hold native title and that you wish to have the appropriate statutory procedural rights relating to that claim on land on which you claim to hold native title. It is sort of a contradiction in terms to be registered where there has been extinguishment. If you are seeking compensation for extinguishment, obviously there are all the procedures available for that. It is a fairly technical point, but it just does not

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to direct some remarks to the observation of World 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> AIDS Day. Observed each 1 December, World AIDS Day is designed to encourage public support for programs to prevent the spread of HIV and provide education and awareness of issues surrounding HIV&hyphen;AIDS. This is the ninth observation of World AIDS Day. It was observed for the first time in 1988, after an international meeting of health ministers called for greater exchange of information on HIV&hyphen;AIDS. This year's World AIDS Day theme is `Give children hope in a world with AIDS'. It challenges people around the world to contemplate the long-term repercussions of the AIDS pandemic, without losing sight of the fact that AIDS affects everyone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through the 1997 campaign, UNAIDS and its partners aim to bring to the attention of the international community the many facets of the epidemic's impact on the lives of children. The campaign offers a platform for children and their communities to voice their concerns and aspirations in relation to the epidemic and to support the development of appropriate responses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">UNAIDS estimates that there are over 23 million persons infected with HIV. Of these, approximately 40 per cent are women. In some of the worst affected countries, up to 40 per cent of women attending antenatal clinics in urban areas are HIV affected. By the end of this year, an estimated one million children aged under 15 years are expected to be infected with HIV. Of these, approximately 90 per cent live in developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in the context of HIV&hyphen;AIDS has spelled out principles for reducing children's vulnerability to infection and for protecting children from discrimination because of their real or perceived HIV&hyphen;AIDS status. This human rights framework can be used by governments to ensure that the best interests of children with regard to AIDS are promoted and addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Herron said today in question time, there is still no cure or effective vaccine for HIV. It is worth noting the following statistics: in 1996 alone, 400,000 children under the age of 15 became infected with HIV, bringing the total number of children in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9960"> this age group living with HIV to 830,000 at the end of 1996. Since the beginning of the epidemic, according to UNAIDS and World Health Organisation estimates, well over two million HIV-infected children have been born to infected mothers and hundreds of thousands of children have acquired HIV from blood transfusions or through sex.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As HIV infection often progresses quickly to AIDS in children, most of the close to three million children under 15 who have been infected since the start of the epidemic have developed AIDS, and most of them are dead. Of the 1.5 million people who died of AIDS in 1996, 350,000 were children under the age of 15. The US Bureau of Census estimates that by the year 2010, if the spread of HIV is not contained, AIDS may increase infant mortality by as much as 75 per cent and mortality in children under five by more than 100 per cent in those regions most affected by the disease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Poverty is a key reason why children die more quickly of AIDS in developing countries. If children are sleeping three or four to a room, for example, which is common in poor households, they are far more likely to transmit and contract TB or other respiratory diseases if any one of them has those infections. If they are poorly nourished, their immune systems will weaken. If families do not have access to clean water, they are more vulnerable to waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Children with HIV commonly experience wasting and delayed development and are often killed by typical childhood diseases like diarrhoea, measles, TB and other respiratory infections. Because these diseases are often the same as those that kill other children, it is sometimes difficult for health workers in poor countries, without access to testing equipment, to distinguish HIV-positive children from others. This can have at least two important consequences. Firstly, children with HIV might not receive the special care they need and, secondly, a general apathy about child health can arise and that has consequences for all children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The dominant mode of transmission of HIV in newborn babies&mdash;in developing countries, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in particular&mdash;is so-called vertical transmission from their mothers. While in poorer countries some babies are still being infected through contaminated blood or medical equipment, virtually all HIV positive infants have acquired the virus from their positive mothers during pregnancy or delivery or acquired it through breastfeeding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The vexing issue is that, while breastfeeding can kill by transmitting HIV, bottle-feeding is also dangerous and increases risks to child health. In recent years, the World Health Organisation and UN health organisations have been heavily promoting and encouraging breastfeeding, and for good reasons. It affords vital protection against deadly childhood diseases. It is a natural, cost free method, whereas the cost of infant formula, and even the simple clean water and fuel needed to prepare it, are often beyond the means of poor families in developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So HIV-positive mothers of newborns face a difficult dilemma&mdash;choosing between breastfeeding and bottle-feeding. The context differs depending on the country and the woman's own socioeconomic status. The policy of UNAIDS and its co&hyphen;sponsors is to encourage HIV-positive mothers to be given as much information as possible on the relative risks so that they can decide whether to breastfeed or not. There is no universally valid recommendation on which way to go, but only women in possession of all the information are in a position to make fully informed choices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">UNAIDS has made one of its highest priorities improved access to all drugs needed for the treatment of HIV disease in the developing world. For this purpose, it is conducting a trial in five sites in South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of three simpler, shorter regimens for the prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV in populations where breastfeeding is the norm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one knows exactly how many children have been orphaned by AIDS worldwide, but UNAIDS estimates that, by mid-1996, nine million children under 15 years of age had lost their mother to AIDS, more than 90 per cent of whom were living in sub-Sahara 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9961"> African countries. The relationship between HIV, impoverishment and denial of human rights is apparent in the impact of the epidemic on children who have been orphaned by AIDS. Discrimination in accessing health care is a major form of social exclusion faced by orphans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidence suggests that AIDS orphans may be at a greater risk of dying of preventable diseases and infections because of the mistaken belief that, when they become ill, it must be due to AIDS and therefore there is no point in seeking medical help. The poverty and isolation that results create a vicious circle, placing AIDS orphans, particularly orphaned girls, at greater risk of contracting HIV themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An ever increasing incidence of sexual abuse also takes its toll upon young children in two forms: commercial sexual exploitation and sexual abuse in the home or the community. No&hyphen;one knows how many child sex workers there are in the world. Because of the nature of the trade, there are not precise figures. The belief that children are less likely to be infected has raised the demand for younger sex workers in recent years. Studies everywhere indicate that rates of HIV infection among child sex workers and street children are often very high. Surveys of Kenyan girls living on the street indicated that as many as 30 per cent were HIV positive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a world with AIDS, the injection of illicit drugs&mdash;always a risky behaviour&mdash;carries the additional danger of HIV infection. When people of whatever age share needles and syringes to inject, microtransfusions of blood occur and these are relatively efficient for transmitting HIV and other microbes. Drug injecting is thus a phenomenon that policy makers, educators and HIV prevention workers concerned with child protection cannot afford to neglect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">AIDS has changed the world for children. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child provides a framework to protect and promote their rights which can minimise the impact of the epidemic on them. Yet despite its almost universal ratification, the response to infected, affected and vulnerable children remains inconsistent. Internationally programs 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for children have been ad hoc and fragmented and have lagged far behind those for adults. In many developing countries, poverty and other factors, such as wars and the resulting social break down of many communities, worsen this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a world with AIDS, children must become everybody's responsibility. In Australia we have to look at the importance of our regional approach. In east Asia and the Pacific there were an estimated 100,000 people living with HIV&hyphen;AIDS by the end of 1996. In south and South-East Asia, that number was 5.2 million. Between two and five million people are now infected with HIV in India. In Bombay, HIV prevalence has reached 50 per cent in sex workers, 36 per cent in other STD patients and 2.5 per cent in pregnant women attending clinics for prenatal care. In China, there has been an estimated tenfold growth in the number of HIV infected people between 1993 and 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My visit to Vietnam earlier this year only confirmed my concerns about the importance of Australia's regional role, with an increase in the HIV rate from nine to 38 per cent in the sex worker population in Vietnam in fewer than five years. Today Minister Downer announced that Australia is hosting a meeting of Australian and other HIV&hyphen;AIDS experts in Bangkok to develop coordinated solutions to the escalating problem of HIV&hyphen;AIDS in the Mekong subregion of Asia. This and other initiatives are the most important ones for Australia to take. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9961"><TITLE>Northern Territory: Legislation</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in the adjournment debate to address the issue of crime and punishment in the Northern Territory. Tomorrow the Australian Democrats will be moving a motion condemning mandatory sentencing. Now that the Democrats have removed the paragraph from that motion calling on intervention by the federal parliament to overturn the Northern Territory's laws, I hope that all honourable senators will support that motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As honourable senators may recall, I outlined a number of my concerns in this regard to the Senate on 28 October. At that time I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9962"> informed the Senate that the Country Liberal Party government's mandatory sentencing laws for property offences had totally skewed the scales of justice in the Northern Territory. Senators may recall I outlined a number of cases that had been determined already under these laws. They included a 23-year-old single mother who had been sentenced to 14 days gaol for unlawful entry and stealing a can of beer valued at $2.50 and a 20-year-old man sentenced to 14 days imprisonment for stealing fuel worth $9 from a car. Magistrate James Hannon told the court that he intended to fine the man until the police prosecutor pointed out that he no longer had any discretion to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The mandatory sentencing laws continue to be an onerous burden on Northern Territory magistrates and, I might add, taxpayers. Since I last addressed this issue, a one-legged pensioner with no prior convictions has been sent to prison for 14 days after being convicted of trespass and causing $200 worth of damage to a fence. Magistrate Dick Wallace told the court last week, that 23-year-old Trinity Hudson was not the sort of person he would normally send to gaol, but the mandatory sentencing laws removed his discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been estimated that it will cost territory taxpayers up to $2,500 a day to keep this man in prison. So instead of making a contribution to the community by way of a fine or community service, the mandatory sentencing laws will cost the community up to $35,000 for a $200 offence. I have also had the opportunity to read the recently released report from the Australian Law Reform Commission entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Seen and heard: priority for children in the legal process</EMPHASIS>. It is a damning indictment of the treatment of young offenders in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report shows that, at the beginning of this year, there were 717 children aged from 10 to 17 in juvenile corrective institutions in Australia. The Northern Territory rate is more than double the national average. It has a detention rate of 68.8 per 100,000 of the child population compared with the national average of 35.5. That comparison is alarming enough, but the bells really start ringing when 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you compare it with Victoria's figure of 14.9, which is the lowest figure of any of the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory is the only state or territory jurisdiction, other than Western Australia, that has introduced such laws. But the Territory laws are even tougher than those in Western Australia. In the Territory, the regime for juveniles is two strikes on a property offence and you are in. A magistrate must impose a period of detention on a juvenile, defined as anyone who is 15 or 16 years of age, who has been found guilty of one of a list of prescribed property offences and has at least one prior conviction for a similar offence. These provisions apply regardless of how minor the second property offence may be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For adults, it is one strike and you are in. This is whether you have committed a previous offence or not. One offence against this mandatory sentencing act in the Northern Territory and you are in prison. A first offence is met with an automatic 14 days imprisonment, an automatic 90 days gaol for a second offence and a minimum of 12 months in prison for repeat offences. In Western Australia, it is three strikes and you are in for both adults and juveniles convicted of home burglary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The schedule of offences in the Territory runs to car theft, criminal damage, breaking and entering, and stealing. The Law Reform Commission report says that the mandatory sentencing laws in the Northern Territory and Western Australia breach a number of international human rights standards and common law principles. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They violate the principle of proportionality which requires the facts of the offence and the circumstances of the offender to be taken into account in accordance with Article 40 of CROC.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">CROC stands for the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They also breach the requirement that in the case of children detention should be a last resort and for the shortest appropriate period, as required by Article 37 of CROC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mandatory detention violates a number of provisions in the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights, including the prohibition on arbitrary detention in Article 9. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9963">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both CROC and ICCPR require that sentences should be reviewable by a higher court or appellate court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By definition a mandatory sentence cannot be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry considers these violations of international and common law norms so serious that it recommends federal legislation to override the laws unless the parliaments of Western Australia and the Northern Territory repeal them.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have stated before in relation to another matter that I do not believe this parliament should be used to override the laws of any state or territory, but I certainly do believe that the Northern Territory parliament should repeal these mandatory sentencing laws and the continuing injustice they are causing, particularly for young offenders&mdash;and the sooner, the better.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9963"><TITLE>World AIDS Day</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join Senator Payne this evening in rising to talk about World AIDS Day. Its focus this year is on giving children hope in a world with AIDS. It is estimated that, by the end of this year, one million children under 15 will have AIDS. A very large number of these will be in sub-Saharan Africa. For instance, eight per cent of all children in Zimbabwe have lost their mothers to AIDS, and three in every 10 children whose mothers have AIDS will die from the disease.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The United Nations AIDS program estimates that nine million children have been orphaned worldwide by AIDS and that this figure will reach 40 million by the year 2010. More than one million children worldwide enter the sex trade every year. In Bombay, the average age for the 250,000 sex workers is 15. Of course, AIDS is the reason why the clients of sex workers are demanding younger women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have some other shocking statistics. In Botswana, 18 per cent of the adult population has HIV. In Zimbabwe and Zambia, 17 per cent of the adult population has HIV, and the infection rate is increasing at more than 25 per cent every year. Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos are expecting an explosion of incidents of HIV&hyphen;AIDS. These countries 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> are amongst the poorest in the world. The impossibility of coping with such large numbers of people in the public hospitals means that ambulatory and home care systems must be developed with great urgency. Ninety per cent of HIV infections are concentrated in the developing world, yet in 1991 only six per cent of the $2.2 billion spent on AIDS was used in developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This morning Senator Herron made much of Australia's contribution to fighting AIDS overseas. It is certainly true that the work being done in Thailand and Vietnam&mdash;where a party of members and senators visited during July this year, courtesy of the Rockefeller Foundation&mdash;is making a very small difference to a problem of devastating magnitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should come as no surprise to anyone that AIDS and extreme poverty go hand in hand. In Australia we have AIDS under control. Senator Herron reminded me this morning that there were only 500 new cases Australia wide this year. Australia has had massive education campaigns, ready access to condoms and the money with which to pay for them. Needle exchange programs and the like have kept our problem to manageable levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people diagnosed with HIV in Australia go on to live for many years with good health care, good diets and drug treatment. Of course, this is not the case in the poorest countries of Africa and now Asia. Thailand has 60,000 new infections each year, and more than two per cent of its population is HIV positive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point I want to stress tonight is that AIDS prevention and family planning go hand in hand, particularly in populous countries. Vietnam's current population is around 70 million. By the year 2010, the population is expected to stabilise at more than 120 million. Vietnam will only limit its population to that 120 million if the so-called replacement rate is just over two children per family. This is a major shift for a country in which large families were the norm until very recent times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To feed another 50 million, it is likely that Vietnam will have to import enormous quantities of food some time in the future. Forty per 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9964"> cent of children are malnourished in Vietnam, as are a high proportion of adults. The country is making headway in improving the nutrition of their children, but malnutrition is linked to poverty, and seventy per cent of the population is rural and extremely poor. The poorer families are, the higher the likelihood that children will be forced into prostitution. The lower the status of women in these countries, the less likely they will be able to plan their families and care for their children. So the cycle of poverty continues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Poverty drives men from rural areas and into the cities in search of work for long periods of time. In most Asian countries, there is an unstated acceptance of prostitution, at least by the male population. AIDS is often brought back to the village and the family by these men. The first case of AIDS in Vietnam was in the army in 1995. AIDS in Asian countries is spreading into the general population at an alarming rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Thailand there is a saying: family planning is death planning&mdash;and this does not just relate to HIV&hyphen;AIDS. Vietnamese and Thai people understand the relationship between large families and the inability of those families to properly care for their children. Since 1992, Australia has provided around $2 million to Vietnam's HIV&hyphen;AIDS program. International aid to Vietnam for this purpose totals $US32 million. Most of the AusAID money goes to non-government organisations for research, development of literature pitched at young people, and making the connection between family planning and HIV prevention. It also pays for curriculum development in secondary schools, communication skills and education for women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's aid projects in both Vietnam and Thailand take on a holistic approach to assistance. We have said there is little point in providing microcredit schemes without assisting to elevate the status of women. There is no point in providing only one form of contraception when it suits only some women. There is no point in chastising women for relying on abortion, when they do not have access to better methods of contraception and when men take no responsibility for family planning.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not too long ago that 60 per cent of all pregnancies ended up in abortion in Vietnam. The toll this takes on women's bodies in a country where health services are seriously under&hyphen;resourced is enormous. There is no point in promoting vasectomies or IUDs, when people are contracting AIDS because they lack the education, the power or the money to protect themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Vietnam people who are HIV positive in particular face discrimination in their families and in the community, and support in the form of social services is very limited indeed. By February this year, Vietnam had recorded 5,113 cases of HIV infection, and the highest rates were among injecting drug users. More than 80 per cent of these were males, but the rates among women continue to rise and several cases of mother-to-child transmission have already been identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very low screening rates, however, obscure the real figures, and 68 per cent of the Vietnamese government's budget for AIDS is now being spent on testing. More than 60,000 people are estimated to be HIV positive in Vietnam and, in just two years, this figure is expected to rise to around 350,000. That is a tragic waste of human life and human suffering on an enormous scale.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Current Australian AIDS specific projects include:</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">an integrated English language program at the Red Cross to facilitate access to the global body of knowledge on AIDS prevention, counselling and care; assertiveness training skills for women from a variety of walks of life for protection from AIDS; 10 pilot projects to enhance STD and AIDS prevention and to enhance family planning knowledge, particularly for youths, women in child&hyphen;bearing age, sex workers and drugs users; a pilot project for sexuality education and HIV&hyphen;AIDS prevention, particularly for youth leaders; and an AIDS education and awareness project to reduce high risk behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of these projects operate in a very small number of provinces alongside agricultural, sanitation, microcredit, primary health care and family planning projects. Our delegation travelled out to one of these provinces to visit communes, to talk directly with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9965"> women and to discuss family planning, women's reproductive health services and awareness of AIDS. Open dialogue about such matters with foreigners&mdash;let alone strangers&mdash;would have been very difficult for those with whom we met not so long ago. The people of Vietnam and Thailand realise that openness within their communities and more broadly is essential, and sensibilities have been put aside in the interests of saving human lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AIDS pandemic is shifting to the South East Asian and Pacific region and to our nearest neighbours. The effects on our region do not stop at health impacts. AIDS has huge economic implications as well. Australia's contribution to overseas HIV&hyphen;AIDS programs is just $17 million this year. I suggest that if we seriously cared about our neighbours and the long&hyphen;term prospects of children in the poorest countries in our region, we would give much more and we would do much more.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9965"><TITLE>Racism</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems appropriate as we near the end of the parliamentary year to raise a subject which has dominated the headlines throughout the year&mdash;a topic of much consternation both domestically and internationally; an issue that has been bandied around in private discussions and public forums, usually accompanied by rhetoric, raw emotion and inflammatory language; a concept which largely remains too difficult to challenge and too sensitive to touch; and a single word which all too readily evokes division, disagreement and alienation&mdash;I talk, no less, of racism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the words of Jacques Santer, racism is `more than the denial of differences, it is the denial of a fellow human being because of those differences'. Historically, Australia has struggled to come to terms with allegations of systemic racism. The First Fleet brought to these shores 160,000 convicts and their guardians. Grants of lands were made to new settlers on the assumption that the land did not belong to anyone&mdash;an assumption which 200 years after it was constitutionalised as the basis of Australia's land tenure system was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rightly rejected as a legal fiction by the High Court in 1992 in the now famous Mabo (No. 2) decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against the background of a mosaic of laws, legal precedents and existing land grants, the by-product of what is essentially a debate about land tenure management has turned into an ugly and derogatory name throwing exercise that we are witnessing in the current Wik debate. This is not an isolated incidence. Every time the size and make-up of the immigration program is questioned, the legacy of the White Australia Policy is regurgitated&mdash;a policy enacted in 1901 and incrementally disassembled from 1949 when 800 non-European refugees were granted residency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia met overwhelmingly the postwar challenge of `populate or perish'. Since 1945, almost 5.6 million people have come to Australia as new settlers. Today, the migrant program is global, using one set of criteria for applicants anywhere in the world, with migrants originating from more than 170 countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last financial year over 85,700 new settlers arrived in Australia. Of these, nearly 12,000 came under the humanitarian program. An additional 90,500 people received visas allowing them to take up temporary residence. As well, 3.1 million visitor visas and over 68,600 student visas were granted. Today, nearly one in four of Australia's 18.3 million people were born overseas. Is this a policy of a racially intolerant nation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet every boatload of illegal entrants arriving upon our northern coastline gives way to a baseless fear that the floodgates have opened and tide of human flotsam will be never ending. The reality is that, since the collection of data of on-shore refugee applicants commenced in 1989, 72 boats have landed upon our shores carrying a total of 2,916 illegal entrants. Despite the perpetuation of the fear of the `yellow peril' flooding Australia, the number of boat people arrivals equates to around one per day, with the success rate of individuals being granted refugee status at around 20 per cent&mdash;hardly an alarming figure.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9966">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, on 10 September 1996, the independent member for Oxley, Pauline Hanson, burst on to the political stage claiming, amongst other things, that Aboriginal people receive privileges that other people do not receive because they are Aboriginal; that it is false to assume that Aboriginals are the most disadvantaged people in Australia; and that Australia is in danger of being swamped by Asians. Whilst we have long been curious about her tactics, her relentless attacks on immigration, foreign aid and indigenous people, the recent publication of her videoed last will and testament did irreparable damage to her credibility. If the opinion polls are accurate, there is every indication that voters have deserted One Nation. News polls suggest that since the party's launch in April support for One Nation has more than halved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But while support for One Nation is languishing domestically, her politics remain central to international perceptions of Australia. That tourists, exporters and other representatives overseas are judged according to her discriminatory brand of politics is grossly unfair; that all Australians are tarnished as racists personally offensive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what does this tell us about ourselves? Visiting anti-discrimination crusader Jane Elliott says she knows what a racist looks like because she is one.

In trying to explain to her all&hyphen;white, all&hyphen;Christian students the extent to which discrimination was responsible for the death of King, Elliott developed a behavioural exercise separating the students on the basis of their eye colour. Elliott chose to separate the children by a physical characteristic over which they had no control and to which were attributed negative elements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Elliott told the brown eyed students that they were smarter, nicer, cleaner and deserved 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more privileges than students with blue eyes. Those with brown eyes were decreed as being superior, more intelligent, and quicker learners than the blue eyed. They also had complete power. To emphasise their inferiority, the blue eyed children had to wear a coloured sash around their neck. Elliott chose eye colour because during World War II the Nazi regime used it as the distinguishing physical characteristic to determine whether or not one went to the gas chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The outcomes of the Blue Eyes exercise were dramatic and long lasting. On the positive side, even her students with dyslexia achieved and surpassed academic milestones. On the negative side, Elliott's own four children were taunted and harassed by their teachers, classmates and community members and her father's business was boycotted because his daughter was labelled a `nigger lover'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blue Eyes</EMPHASIS> program is powerful because it lets people experience discrimination first hand. The program acknowledges  that most people do not notice racism because it does not happen to them. On the effects of racism, Elliott says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But as well as crushing other people's talents, it ruins your own humanness. You are limiting yourself, your experiences, your education. It really cripples everyone. Racism is a handicap. It keeps you from being what you could be.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">After delivering the seminar around the globe, Elliott has seen white executives temporarily deprived of power over others turn into people who can barely speak, read and cannot make decisions, and there is no doubt that the audience was left speechless after SBS televised the program last night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Regardless of whether or not the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blue Eyes</EMPHASIS> program can be directly applied to the Australian experience or whether it needs changes at the margin to accommodate cultural differences, there is no doubt that Jane Elliott has a lot to teach. Her visit to Australia is timely. Whilst she did not join in the current debate in this country on native title, nor comment in depth at the recent, but now waning, wave of Hansonism, she did leave us with the following thought, which I want to share with the Senate:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9967">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ghandi said "civilisation is the encouragement of differences." We really need to wonder whether our country&mdash;yours and mine&mdash;are becoming more civilised or less.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Jane Elliott said that her anti-discrimination crusade was inspired by a Sioux Indian prayer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Oh great spirit, keep me from ever judging a man until I have walked a mile in his moccasins.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator Alston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport and Regional Development has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1 and 2) The Rail Reform Transition Program's objective is to support measures which will create real and enduring jobs through economic development of the regions most adversely affected by the restructure and subsequent sale of Australian National. Support is available for a wide range of initiatives provided that they are capable of creating long term jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Lenah Game Meats proposal met all the Program's assessment criteria; in particular the expansion of Lenah Game Meats is projected by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the proponent to create 19 full time jobs in Launceston where most of the Tasrail employees are located.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Yes. The export of wallabies will be subject to Federal Government approval of a Game Management Plan which is currently being prepared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) A draft Game Management Plan for Wallaby which appears to meet the Federal Government's requirements has been prepared. Public consultation on Flinders Island has shown that there is broad community support for the draft plan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is expected that the draft plan will be submitted, within the next few weeks, to the Federal Government for its approval.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Lenah Game Meats proposal does not envisage exporting wallaby harvested from the mainland of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Possums are harvested under the stringent guidelines of the Game Management Plan for Brushtail Possum, which allows the harvesting of up to 250,000 possums per year, and is supervised by the Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Game Management Plan for Wallaby, once approved, would similarly be subject to Tasmanian National Parks and Wildlife Service supervision and management, and would ensure that the number of wallabies harvested was environmentally sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) (a) The Minister for Transport and Regional Development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) No. The export of indigenous species must be covered by a Federally approved Game Management Plan which ensures that the harvest of the species will be sustainable. Permits would also need to be issued under the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances, further assessment under the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 was not considered warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7 and 8) All meat processed by Lenah Game Meats is in accordance with Australian Quarantine Inspection Service requirements. The company is also seeking accreditation to export its produce into the European Community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) Is it a fact that in the 11 weeks subsequent to the enforced closure and transfer of patients from Derwent Court Nursing Home, 10 of those patients have died; and (b) how many had died in the 10 weeks preceding the closure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Have the causes of death of patients transferred from Derwent Court been assessed; if so, have the following been identified as contributory factors in any case: (a) the trauma of being suddenly relocated from the environment and carers they were familiar with; and (b) lack of sensitivity and support afforded to patients during their sudden relocation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) (a) How was Rosary Gardens in a position to apply for a 40 per cent increase in its number of bed licences; (b) had Rosary Gardens previously applied for such an increase and been refused; (c) what kinds of process allowed the additional 51 licences to be granted within 48 hours of application; and (d) was the allocation contingent on the notice of intention to revoke the licences at Derwent Court being implemented or was it independent of that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) Is the Minister satisfied that: (a) the sudden closure of Derwent Court was in the patients' interests; (b) the rapidity with which the transfer took place did not have a detrimental effect on patients' health; and (c) the decision to transfer all beds, without tender, to one institution was made fairly in accordance with due process.</PARA></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator Herron</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Family Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) 9 former Derwent Court residents have died in the period since 6 August 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) 4 residents died in the 10 weeks preceding the closure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The cause of death is not a matter on which the Department collects information. It is assessed and noted by the attending medical practitioner.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Commonwealth offered assistance to Southern Cross Homes Inc through an acquittable advance of $90,000 from Aged Care Program Support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the advance was made to defray costs associated with physically moving the residents, supporting the Advocacy Service, and carrying out minor alterations to meet safety requirements at the Carruthers wing;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the advance was made on 23 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Commonwealth provided an advance of $250,000 in the form of recurrent benefit repayable over 3 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the advance was made to enable Southern Cross Homes Inc to obtain additional furnishings such as new beds and services such as a dementia consultant and training for staff in response to the sudden influx of residents from Derwent Court Nursing Home;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the advance was made on 31 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) (a) The allocation of approved places to ensure continuity of care for residents from Derwent Court was not done through a select tender or 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9971"> other public process. Discussions were held with Aged Care Tasmania, the State branch of the Association of Nursing Homes and Extended Care Australia, the State Department of Community and Health Services and Advocacy Tasmania to identify facilities with the capacity to take all of the residents of Derwent Court Nursing Home on the basis that there was a risk that the approval of Derwent Court Nursing Home would be revoked. As a result of these discussions, staff of the Department inspected a number of facilities and spoke with a number of individual service providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) All of these service providers had evidence of providing a better quality of care for residents than that being provided at Derwent Court but none, apart from Rosary Gardens Nursing Home, had the potential capacity to take all of the residents from Derwent Court Nursing Home at very short notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) (a) Southern Cross Homes Inc had surplus space within the Rosary Gardens facility and the opportunity to lease part of the Carruthers wing from the State Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) No, Southern Cross Homes had never applied for additional nursing home approved places at Rosary Gardens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The approval process was set out in the National Health Act 1953. Although the approval process was conducted within 48 hours it was made following a series of discussions between February and July 1997. These discussions were conducted on the basis that there was a risk that the approval of Derwent Court Nursing Home would be revoked. Neither Mr Dellar, State Manager, Department of Health and Family Services, Tasmania, or Southern Cross Homes could do anything further until such time as a decision (if any) had been made. Once the decision was made, there was a need to act swiftly to ensure that those residents whose families had indicated a desire to move could be accommodated without delay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) The notice of intention to revoke the approval of the nursing home was made by the Minister's delegate Ms Halton and served on the proprietor on 21 July 1997. The Minister's delegate, Mr Dellar, decided to allocate 20 places to Southern Cross Homes on 24 July 1997. The allocation was therefore made subsequent to the decision to give notice of intention to revoke the approval of the nursing home. The process of deciding on a response to the very poor quality of care at Derwent Court was conducted independently of Mr Dellar's consideration of allocating places given the risk that Derwent Court's approval might be revoked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) (a) I am satisfied that the Minister's delegates' decision to revoke the approval of Derwent Court Nursing Home was in the patients' 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> interests. The evidence from the Standards Review Panel of Tasmania, chaired by Dr Penelope Flett, was clear&mdash;the quality of care at the home was unacceptable and there was nothing to suggest that the proprietor understood what was required to address the problems. I note that the delegate's decision has since been affirmed following a review of the decision. Southern Cross Homes Inc. have a demonstrated record in providing a better quality of care for residents than that which was being provided at Derwent Court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Any change of circumstance for frail aged nursing home residents is stressful. The Acting Director of Nursing at Derwent Court Nursing Home as well as staff from Rosary Gardens worked together to minimise that stress. I am satisfied that the rapidity of the transfer did not have any more of a detrimental affect than any transfer at a later date would have had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) I am satisfied that the delegate's decision to transfer all of the beds outside of the annual approval round normally conducted by the Department was made fairly and struck a reasonable balance between the need to investigate available options and ensure that continuity of care for residents could be maintained in possibly urgent circumstances.</PARA>
