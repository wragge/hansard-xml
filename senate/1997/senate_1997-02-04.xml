<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on Friday, 31 January 1997, of Senator John Horace Panizza, a Senator for the State of Western Australia since 1987, a member of a number of Senate committees, Deputy Opposition Whip from 1993 to 1995, Opposition Whip from 1995 to 1996, and Government Whip since 1996, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">John Panizza was born on 24 March 1931 at Southern Cross in Western Australia. He was a farmer and property developer in Western 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia before entering federal politics. He came to the Senate with an impressive background in local government. He was a councillor of the Yilgarn Shire Council from 1975 to 1987, and shire president from 1982 to 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was elected as a senator for Western Australia in 1987. In his maiden speech John referred to his election as the realisation of an ambition that he had held since he was 20 years of age. He spoke on the many issues facing primary industries in Western Australia and displayed a wide knowledge of them, ranging from wheat growing and meat production to mining&mdash;including the gold and diamond industries&mdash;and fishing. Above all he declared his commitment to the needs and concerns of rural Western Australia&mdash;to its people as well as to its industries. He touched on important rural issues such as access to all levels of education by country children, and adequate water supplies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Significantly, John concluded his maiden speech by referring to his Italian parentage and paid special tribute to the hardships and achievements of migrants in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John's work on Senate committees was acknowledged on all sides of politics. In his 9&half; years in the Senate he served on numerous committees. At the time of his death he 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="2"> was a serving member of the Senate Economics References Committee, the House Committee, the Privileges Committee and the Selection of Bills Committee, as well as the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. He was in Cairns with the Privileges Committee at the time of his death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the last four years he has worked as, first, deputy opposition whip and then opposition whip in the Senate and, since the election, as government whip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Reflecting on the life of John Panizza: he was a very successful man in his business and in his politics, whether it be local politics, agricultural politics or national politics. His success was built on a set of very basic values: a gritty determination and a preparedness to work hard and to be honest and straightforward. Without having known his late father and without knowing his mother, I suspect these were values he inherited. He was very proud of his Italian heritage; proud that he and his family were also a demonstration that you could do well in Australia starting with little&mdash;and perhaps with disadvantages&mdash;and, with determination, hard work and fair play, achieve great success. He was a proud Australian&mdash;as Aussie as they come&mdash;but proud to be an Australian of Italian parentage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite his success he remained reasonably modest in his lifestyle&mdash;not one to waste a dollar, but also not seeing a need to parade his wealth and success. He was a decent bloke. I dealt with him daily. There was always a mischievous smile, some say somewhat contrasting with his image as a tough man. I always thought there was a touch of theatre in that image; he rather liked to be portrayed that way. He was actually quite caring. I remember a few years ago, when he thought I was fading away, he got Coral to rustle me up a large bowl of lasagne&mdash;which some might think a little beyond the usual responsibilities of a whip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also tells you a little about how he saw family roles. He was very much a traditionalist. But, in seeing a traditional role for his wife, he accepted the traditional responsibility of the husband in the very best sense. He 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> thought the world of Coral and, as we all know, was very proud of his children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite national politics tending to be dominated these days by the tertiary educated and professionally trained, John was a good example that you can come out of a different school, a practical school of hard knocks, and do just as well, if not better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was never shy to make a point in this place. He might have expressed it differently from some others but it always came from the heart, moulded by a lifetime of practical life experience and with the confidence of a successful man, and it was always worth listening to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his contributions, Madam President, you so often saw John's love of the soil and his commitment to those who worked the soil&mdash;in fact his passion for family, which is probably associated with his love of the bush. John was comfortable anywhere but, when he was in the bush he was at home, and it showed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, we will miss John. But what is more important is that we should celebrate his life and the contribution which he made in his own unique way to our public life. On behalf of the government, I extend to his mother Mrs Caterina Panizza, his wife Coral and his children Frank, Janine, Stephen and Linda and their families our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="2" TIME="2.08 p.m." SPEAKER="Faulkner, Sen John" NAMEID="5K4" ELECTORATE="NSW" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME><STATE> (New South Wales&mdash;</STATE><ROLE>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(2.08 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, on behalf of the opposition I support the condolence motion that has been moved by Senator Hill. This is a very sad day for all senators and for many other people who work in this building. It is not often that we in the Senate farewell one of our serving colleagues. John Panizza's death comes as a real blow to all of us. It was sudden, it was untimely and it was shocking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Panizza's background was very unusual for a member of the federal parliament. He was the son of Italian migrants; in fact he did not speak English until he was nine years of age. But, as we have heard, he was&mdash;rightly&mdash;intensely proud of his heritage and of the fact that he was the first person of Italian parentage to serve in the Senate.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="3">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair to say that John was a man of not inconsiderable means who had obviously come from a very underprivileged background. He was able to use those life experiences very effectively in this place to really make a unique mark. He became a senator in 1987 following an earlier political career in local government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On this side of the chamber, Madam President, we viewed John Panizza as a very hardworking and straightforward politician. Whilst obviously we did not often agree&mdash;and on the tough issues we were almost always opponents&mdash;we respected the fact that John Panizza was someone who never shied away from a debate. I think he was very courageous in the way he was always willing to take up the ball and run with it in the chamber. I can even recall one or two of his frontbench colleagues on a couple of occasions perhaps even being a bit wary of his enthusiasm for the fray.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 1993 when John became deputy opposition whip and then from mid&hyphen;1995, firstly as opposition whip and then as government whip, we on this side of the chamber worked closely with him. In a chamber such as ours where no political party has a majority, where there are a significant number of minor party and independent senators, our whips have very substantial responsibilities. I think the role and the importance of the whips is not well understood outside this building. Because of John's responsibilities we got to know him very well. We knew that he could be relied upon when he was negotiating on behalf of the coalition. He was direct, but he was honourable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us in this place know that John Panizza took his committee responsibilities seriously. He was a committed and diligent member of a number of Senate committees. I think the perspective that he brought to that work was very important for the Senate. He was a tireless advocate for rural Australia and he always defended those interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Panizza was a man with no pretensions. He was a farmer and, I might say, a good one at that. What you saw was what you got with John Panizza. Anyone who listened to him in the Senate over the years or was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> familiar with the many contributions he made to parliamentary debate could not mistake him for other than what he was. He was a loyal member of his party, he was a devoted Western Australian and he was a very decent human being.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, we will miss him. On behalf of the opposition I offer our sincere condolences to his wife, his mother, his family and his many friends.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="3" TIME="2.14 p.m." SPEAKER="Boswell, Sen Ronald" NAMEID="YE4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="NP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME><STATE> (Queensland&mdash;</STATE><ROLE>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(2.14 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I too, on behalf of National Party senators, would like to join with my colleagues in the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill). It was indeed a shock to me when Senator Bill O'Chee rang me on Friday morning and passed on the very bad news that John Panizza had passed away that night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was shocked because, although we had our differences from time to time, we had enjoyed good communication on the occasions when I sat in his office and talked to him about his farm and some of his other interests, particularly photography. On the wall in his office he had a magnificent photo of his farm which had been taken as a big storm was coming across.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John had also played football for the local team. After his playing days were over he participated in the sport as an umpire, and I think he thought he was a bit of an umpire around this place too where he always used to try to keep us in line. He was elected to the Senate in May 1987 and served as Deputy Opposition Whip in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was Shire President of the Yilgarn Shire Council, to which he was very committed. He used to talk often about his shire council presidency. The hallmark of his term in office was the provision of sporting infrastructure and other community service projects that he got behind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As mentioned by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill) and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Faulkner), whatever John attacked he attacked with enthusiasm and vigour. He was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4"> one of the most successful farmers in Australia and had a lifetime involvement in the family farming property. The eldest son, he took over the farm started by his father and ran it with his two brothers, Bob and Horace. The farming operation expanded and expanded. They went from Marvel Loch to more reliable areas in Western Australia in the shires of Williams and Wahroonga.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John's father was a miner in Mount Isa and in Broken Hill, as I recollect the story, in pretty tough days. He moved across to Kalgoorlie to work in the mines in Western Australia. But somewhere in between he selected a very small block in very marginal country, from which the Panizza farming operation grew to where it was, I think, one of the 10 biggest wheat farms in Australia. John was always proud that his father was a battler who had come out to Australia with absolutely nothing and that Australia had given him the ability to make such a huge contribution to the farming community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was a staunch Catholic, and I know that he did have some problems with some of the legislation a couple of years ago. He was an active member of the Western Australian Farmers Federation and a strong advocate for equity in a number of agricultural issues, such as grain freight rates, grain marketing and the Wheat Board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his maiden speech, he emphasised the importance and the future needs of Western Australian country areas and the people involved in agriculture, mining and fishing in our great state. John was always up on his feet defending and promoting rural Australia, and he was a great advocate for the Western Australian farming community and for primary industry overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was a former National, having lost a preselection. That was our loss and the Liberal Party's gain. It was always said in Western Australia that that was one of the preselections that went wrong. But the Liberals were the winners and it was our loss. In his first foray into politics he stood for the Liberal Party against the National Party for the Western Australian Upper House seat and came within 115 votes of defeating the sitting National Party member. A quote from his 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> maiden speech 10 years ago illustrates the fact that he was a man of the moment and his influence on political debate. He said in that speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have to solve our own problems. Alleviation of upward pressures on import costs is a top priority. We should remove such impositions as all duties on fuel and farm production and transport of produce. Let Australia buy superphosphate at world prices and remove tariffs from imported chemicals and items of plant that are not manufactured in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A lot of those things that John said 10 years ago have now come in and are now part of Australia's farming community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John also promoted income equalisation deposits and said that they had been lost over a period of time. Again, I know that this is going to be a feature of the government's rural comeback. He was a great success in managing his farm and his other business interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was a great success here in the parliament. He is survived by his wife, Coral, and four children. He was immensely proud of them and particularly his one grandchild, Emily. I know that he will be sadly missed amongst all of us today and in the future, and I extend my sympathy to his family and friends in Western Australia.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="4" TIME="2.21 p.m." SPEAKER="Kernot, Sen Cheryl" NAMEID="XW4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="AD" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME><STATE> (Queensland&mdash;</STATE><ROLE>Leader of the Australian Democrats)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(2.21 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to associate the Democrats with the condolence motion for former Senator John Panizza. I think his parliamentary career and background have been very appropriately recalled for us already this afternoon, and I thought I would speak briefly on what the Democrats know of John Panizza the man.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our daily lives as senators I think lots of personal interactions take place which are never recorded: courtesies, thoughtfulness, the bailing up and haggling over unfinished businesses in corridors and lobbies. Although it is part and parcel of our daily lives, it is glimpses of us which are denied to our family. That is why I thought I would spend a few minutes on some of these glimpses for John Panizza's family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think his epitaph should be: I didn't intend to speak in this debate, but I feel I've been 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="5"> provoked by Senator X&mdash;I would have to say often a Democrat and often me. What was intended to be a brief contribution would usually, with the help of interjections, swell to fill the 20 or previously 30 minutes. And it was a very regular occurrence. That is why I think there is a such a delicious irony in John Panizza's becoming whip for his party in the Senate and becoming responsible for making others adhere to strict speaking arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am told he was a tough whip, particularly on leave requests particularly for the Prime Minister's XI cricket match just down the road. I know I had to negotiate that one with him. But his natural determination to put his side of the argument, usually based on practical personal experience, was one of John Panizza's strengths, and parliaments need plenty of men and women with those qualities to add balance and an injection of practicality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If John Panizza did not get you verbally in the chamber, then he would pursue you outside it as well. Many is the time he has bailed me with up the words, `I thought I heard you say,' or `I saw you said in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . . . what did you mean by that because if you meant such and such, I think you're wrong.' Usually said, I might add, without any anger or rancour&mdash;just searching out for clarification purposes. After continued sparring he would usually say, `That's all right then,' and you would feel like you had permission to leave. But you would know that the matter was then very tidily stored away in a very long memory bank. In fact, he pursued me for well over 18 months on our disagreement on terms of reference for an ATSIC inquiry. I think he got his way in the end with a change of government, but I do not think I have been pursued over terms of reference for quite that length of time by anyone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two qualities he certainly possessed were determination and tenacity&mdash;qualities which obviously were fundamental to his success as a farmer and a businessman. Added to that was his unquestioned capacity for hard work, and it is not surprising or unfair that that view informed his views on the rest of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Among his many kindnesses were his offer of the services of his office to Senator Murray 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to help him find his feet as a newly elected senator and the hospitality extended regularly to Senator Lyn Allison in the member's dining room. In fact, I think he may single&hyphen;handedly have extended the boundaries of the demilitarised zone up there in the interests of better cross-party relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former Democrat Senator Karin Sowada has asked to be associated with this motion in memory of the pleasant times she enjoyed as a colleague of Senator Panizza. For my part, I will not see John Panizza carrying out his threat to invite me to his club for lunch during committee hearings in Perth&mdash;although with John Panizza you usually found invitations had strings attached and the string on this one was that I was meant to reciprocate in Brisbane. I remember telling him that I did not belong to any such clubs and neither did I have any desire to, but that I would take him down to the bay and take him to a very basic cafe for the best mud crab and seafood feed he would ever have, and a cheap one as well. He said he would consider it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Although each one of us is unique and senators are no more special than anybody else by virtue of our public office, some I think are more noticeable in their uniqueness and their contribution than others. We will miss John Panizza in this place. We are deeply saddened by his sudden death. On behalf of the Democrats, I extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Coral and to his family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;John Panizza was a unique individual. I had the pleasure of sitting next to him when he first arrived in the Senate and for about the next 18 months I got regular lectures on a whole range of subjects. He was not averse to telling me that I had to remember who the battlers were; what the ordinary people thought on a whole range of issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we all know, he was a fearless and proud advocate of so many causes that were close to his heart. He was passionate. As Senator Kernot said, he was very tenacious. He was irrepressible. You had that sense of infectious enthusiasm when you were with him that made you realise that he was a very special human being. I can recall asking him 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="6"> whether his name was pronounced `Panizza' or `Panitza' because there seemed to be some debate in the chamber and he basically said he could not care less, which I thought was fairly typical of the man&mdash;no airs and graces, happy to get on with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some senators might recall a time last year when I happened to miss a division. I got the usual sergeant major's call, `Oy, Dick! Want a word with you.' He had started calling me Dick some months earlier and I had discovered that his nickname at school was Oscar so I usually said, `All right, Oscar, out we go.' So I went out the back with him and explained to him that I had actually been working on the Telstra partial&hyphen;privatisation case and these were very delicate negotiations and I hoped he understood. He just looked at me and said, `Nothing special about you. I'm here to make sure you blokes get there on time. Right, got it, out!' And that was that. Again it was entirely characteristic of him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I had a room much closer to the chamber than I do now he was a very regular visitor. He would wander in any hour of the day or night and he had such a range of interests. He would talk to me about the farm, how it was going, what the crop was like, and I did my best to effect close attention. But when he started to get on to sport he really did fire and I could follow him then. He had a great recollection of the stars of yesteryear whom he remembered&mdash;Western Australian footballers like Graham Moss, Jack Clark and, of course, Polly Farmer. He would be constantly ribbing me when I would come here on a Monday to find that yet again Collingwood had lost and the Eagles had won, and he was very keen to transfer his allegiance to Fremantle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John loved sport. He understood it well. He was never shy of offering opinions on why a batsman had got out or why players could play better. He had relatives who had played at the highest level in Perth. Again, he was very proud of then. He was proud of so many things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember staying at his home one night at Southern Cross. I had been there once before. He had asked me to come out and address a little meeting of some farmers. I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> think it was to do with wheat. I knew very little about wheat. I got out there to find about 400 of them all crammed into this shed where he had been the shire president of Yilgarn for a number of years. He had them eating out of the palm of his hand. He kept saying, `Now go easy on him. He's a mate of mine, right. Understand?' Fortunately, I was able to get a reasonable hearing, but only because John was so concerned to ensure that everyone understood he was on his home ground and I was not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I went to his home, again, it was utterly typical. There were no frills and graces. It struck me as probably a soldier settler's block. As we all know, he had the financial capacity to have done almost anything to the home, yet it would never have occurred to him to do so. I do not think they had even airconditioning. Certainly he was up at the crack of dawn. He brought me a cup of tea, and then it was the usual, `Come on. Get on with it. We've got work to do.' That drove him. He was someone who identified the work ethic as a large part of the secret of success. But he never lost sight of the things that really mattered; certainly that was his family, of whom he was inordinately proud. He once drove me to Aquinas College, his old school, and showed me around. He pointed to the noticeboards and honour boards. He was very proud of the fact that he had had the opportunity to go there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can well remember in April last year that I did an interview with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper. I was asked about people in parliament and whether you manage to actually have friends in this place. I made the point then that there are a number of unforgettable characters in this business and that some of them are people you really can warm to. What I said to this journalist was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You can be quite fascinated by somebody like John Panizza, for example. He is from the back blocks of Western Australia and not the usual academic type by a long shot. But he is a fascinating bloke.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A few days after that was published, John came up, tapped me on the shoulder and said, `Oy, you said something in a newspaper article about me.' I said, `Yes. I think I did actually.' He said, `We've been having an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7"> argument in the office about whether it was good or bad.' I said, `I was doing my best to talk in favourable terms.' He said, `But you said something about me not being an academic.' I said, hedging my bets, `I was trying to make the point that, whilst you were no doubt very good academically, you were even better at a range of other things.' He said, `Didn't you realise I was in the top 20 in the state?' I said, `No.' He said, `Well, that's all right. As long as you understand these things. I suppose it wasn't a bad article anyway.' So in his usual gruff manner, which I thought was a bit of a front, the human being came through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly remember John very fondly. I remember that a number of us were up at Mount Isa once. He was very proud of the fact that his father had been there and, as he would say, worked like a dog. He was also proud of the fact that they went to the west and started up in what was clearly then the middle of nowhere. I remember him taking me up north to places such as Port Hedland. I still have a pair of running shorts with `Broome' written on them. I will wear them as long as I can to remind me of John, because he thought that they were an absolute extravagance. He said, `You don't need to buy another pair of shorts just because you're up here. Haven't you got a pair already?' I said, `Well, yes. But I thought it'd be nice to have a reminder of the place.' Again, he grumped at me. You could tell that he was proud. He did very much appreciate the fact that people identified with his interests. He was very keen for me to understand what it must have been like to work at Tom Price in the sort of searing temperatures that people face in the bush.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was an extraordinary human being. I had a lot to do with him over the years. I always thought of him as someone very special. I know that none of us here will ever forget him. He was unique. I think he was a great Australian. I extend my commiserations to his family. I know how much he thought of Coral and the four children. He often told me about their progress. Again, it is a measure of the human being that his real interests were very close to his family. He was not one 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to flaunt material success. He knew what the real values in life were. We are much the poorer for his passing.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On occasions like this, it is very hard to say anything that is adequate. I feel from walking around and talking to people in the last day or two that a sense of shock pervades the place. That will turn into sadness and grief; if it has not already, it certainly has for me. I wanted to say some words because John and I both came from the Western Australian Liberal Party. I have worked with John over many years, although not as closely as I have in the last few months. We worked together very closely when I assumed the job of Assistant Manager of Government Business in the Senate, when Senator Kemp was promoted to the ministry, and then as manager over those last few hectic weeks, which few of us have forgotten. I became very close to John, working together as we did hour in and hour out for those very long days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John had the job of whip. If you designed the perfect whip for the 1990s in the Senate, where the politics of Australia is played out with only a vote or two in every vote, I do not think your management consultant would design John Panizza to do that job. He was not a great diplomat, but he did get the job done. Senator Kernot made some very good points in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John, as Senator Faulkner has said, was entirely trustworthy. Many deals are made around this table and in the corridors of this place in trying to manage what the Senate does. Cooperation and being able to trust the person you are dealing with are important. John certainly was trustworthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did meet John initially through commercial property and that was one of a number of interests we shared. On the long flights backwards and forwards across the Nullarbor at 35,000 feet in ministerial jets, when we were lucky enough to snaffle them on Sundays, or in other commercial aircraft, we would always talk politics. We would also have the opportunity to talk commercial property, which we both had a strong interest 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="8"> in. In my very early years, I used to lease property for John.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I met John in politics initially at the election Senator Boswell referred to&mdash;when he came so close to knocking off a Nat in the upper house election of early 1986. The preselection might have been in 1985. I had known John very closely ever since then. Indeed, he was a win for the Western Australian Liberal Party because he showed so clearly that the WA party does represent all interests and that it particularly represents rural interests very well in that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was very impressed by what John felt about being a senator. He said to me once, as we got to know each other more closely when I joined the Senate, that he was so proud of being a senator that he compared it to being chosen in the first eleven or the Sheffield Shield side. That stuck in my mind. When I decided to speak today I thought I would mention that for the benefit of his colleagues. I presume he said that to others of us. He was very proud to be in this place. As Senator Alston said, John was a great supporter of West Australian cricket and football teams. He did very earnestly see himself as having made the Sheffield Shield side of politics by representing Western Australia in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads me to the next point I would like to make. He was very much a West Australian. In many respects, he stuck up for the interests of the farming community, the mining community and the pastoral community because he stuck up for Western Australia. Of course, the great bulk of our economy is from the primary industries of farming and mining. There were no issues that had anything to do with Western Australia that John was not at the forefront of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you, Madam President, would know, John dealt with people, be they a car driver, a taxidriver or a farmhand, or anybody else with whom he came into contact, in the same way as he dealt with leaders of the opposition or prime ministers when it came to confronting them about something in which he believed&mdash;and even leaders of the Democrats, I might say, Senator Kernot. When he had a point to make, he would stand up in our party room and confront whoever was the leader at 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the time&mdash;be it John Hewson or Andrew Peacock or the present Prime Minister, Mr Howard&mdash;with very solid and succinct, if not perfect Queen's, English. The Prime Minister or the Leader of the Democrats would know exactly where John Panizza was coming from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As other people have said, John was a straightshooter. Many of the tributes paid in the obituaries in the papers around Australia in recent days have said that he was an honest, straightforward, hardworking, tireless senator. Indeed, he was a straightshooter. You had no doubt where John stood on something like the FBT and how that and the fly&hyphen;in fly&hyphen;out policies affected our northern mining towns. John was at the forefront of the gold tax issue. Native title was clearly something that John perceived very early would affect Western Australia quite specially, quite adversely. He was at the forefront of that debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The diesel fuel rebate might have been a recent issue that John held strong views on. He certainly let the Prime Minister and others know very strongly where he stood and how that would affect his state. I think Senator Boswell referred to isolated children&mdash;to people with children living far from capital cities. John was always there on all of those issues. He was a very proud Western Australian, a true believer in federalism. If I may use a term that most people can relate to, John was a states righter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He believed in these things not because he had studied some textbook or political work or philosophy. But he believed in many principles enshrined in Liberal Party policy and philosophy because of his experiences, starting from nothing and realising that only the private sector and private initiative can build wealth, that governments do not create wealth, that the larger government is the more it takes away from the resources and choices of individuals. He did not believe these things because he had done a political science course or because he had a read on political philosophy by Adam Smith or anybody else. He may have though, Senator Alston. I did not know that he was in the top 20 of Western Australia. That is a big achievement&mdash;there are a lot of very intelligent people in the West.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These were principles that were learnt through his own experiences. He espoused those principles very effectively and he was able to speak. People like Abraham Lincoln have said that you do not address your rhetoric to the top two per cent of the intellectual population because they will probably understand the arguments. In politics you need to try to use language that everyone can understand. John Panizza had the benefit of putting political principles and philosophies in language that could be understood by all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was living proof of what can be achieved in Australia by all Australians. He would have hoped that by joining the Liberal Party, by entering the Senate, by coming into federal politics, he would in his own way contribute to making a nation where more people could achieve what he achieved, where more people would have the freedom to start with nothing and become self&hyphen;sufficient, independent people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There can be no doubt that John's contribution in this place, his contribution within the Liberal Party of Australia, his contribution within the WA Liberal Party, his contribution to Senate committees, his contribution to Liberal Party policy in opposition and his contribution as government whip in this place for all too short a time, have helped make Australia a better place and have helped change the lives of, and build opportunities for, so many Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Panizza was a rough diamond but, as a number of other senators have said, when you scratched below the surface&mdash;if you can do that to a diamond&mdash;you found he had an interest in some of the gentler things in life, as the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating, might have referred to them. If you went into John's office, you would see that not only was he a photographer but he was a photographer with incredible flair for beauty and the ability to catch beautiful things in a lens, which is an incredibly important form of art. That was a great talent of John's. The photograph that Senator Boswell referred to is really an outstanding piece of Australian art and captures the majesty of that part of the world where John spent his entire life.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to conclude these remarks by passing on my own condolences and commiserations to Coral, who was a great supporter of John's. She will be grieving deeply. We share that grief. I also pass on my condolences to his children, whom I did not know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that one of the thoughts I had as the news filtered through last week was of John's mother, who I think is aged 87. I thought how she must be very saddened by this, but what incredible pride I am sure she will feel, and should feel, at bringing John into this world and seeing him grow into a very proud Australian and a very fine Australian who reached the very top of public life. But she must feel sad to have seen him pass away before she did, which is probably a unique event. I am sure that, when the sadness and grief fade away, she will be immensely proud to have seen that great life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also give my commiserations and condolences to Carolyn, John's staffer who is in the Senate at the moment and who served John for just under 10 years, and to Claire, who has been acting with John in the role of secretary to the government whip. I know both of you will feel this loss very hard. I share that sense.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was in Cairns serving on the privileges committee with John Panizza when he passed away. It is perhaps of some consolation that his wife, Coral, was with him at the time. The two of them were due to celebrate their 39th wedding anniversary this week. During their time together, they successfully raised four children&mdash;Frank, Janine, Stephen and Linda. It is indeed a great tribute to them both that they have done this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The family has asked me to convey on their behalf the following brief message and, with the Senate's indulgence, I will read it:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would like to offer thanks and sincere gratitude to Ms Anne Lynch, Deputy Clerk of the Senate, Senator Helen Coonan, Senator Chris Ellison, and Senator Bill O'Chee for their care and compassion extended to our mother on the sudden and tragic passing of our father, Senator John Panizza, in Cairns on 31 January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We greatly appreciate the effort of the Australian Government to expediently unite our family in this time of grief. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="10">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We also thank the senators and members for the messages of condolence and offers of assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our father held the Senate in the highest regard. The fact that his fellow senators and parliamentarians have offered his family such kindness would have been the source of immense pride.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Panizza Family</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">May I add to that my thanks to Anne Lynch, the Deputy Clerk of the Senate, and to my colleague Senator Helen Coonan for their assistance and particularly for the consolation they provided to John's widow, Coral, during what was a most difficult time. I also wish to thank Senator O'Chee, who provided local resources and knowledge in helping sort out matters that needed attending to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">May I also extend my appreciation to those opposition members of the committee&mdash;Senator Ray, Senator Cooney and Senator Childs&mdash;for their cooperation in this matter. In particular, I wish to thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Ray, who assisted in resolving certain matters which needed to be done this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I knew John Panizza from his involvement in the Liberal Party in Western Australia. Indeed, I sat on his selection committee over 10 years ago. John Panizza has been described by both the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Premier of Western Australia as an outstanding advocate for his state. I wish to associate myself with those remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, John Panizza represented vigorously the interests of people living in the remote and regional areas of that state. He was continually involved in such issues as diesel fuel rebate, road funding, native title and all manners of rural issues. He was a multifaceted man&mdash;not only was he a strong family man, he also had an involvement with the Italian community and the Catholic church and he took a keen interest in his old school, the Aquinas College.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John spent many years in local government, and he ran a successful farm in Southern Cross which he loved so much. It was only this week that I learnt that John Panizza was born in Southern Cross&mdash;I believe on the veranda of his homestead. He was very proud of his farm. In an interchange with Senator Murphy, Senator Murphy made some com 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ments on the rural sector. John said, `Senator Murphy is entitled to look over my farm any time.' He went on to say, `Senator Murphy should judge me on my farm and not anyone else's.' That was a typical Panizza remark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might also say that there were other aspects to the man which were not readily appreciated. During a debate, he was wrongly accused of a bias against Aboriginal people, and he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know a lot of Aborigines. I count quite a few Aboriginal families in Western Australia as my friends&mdash;and they have been since school days.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In fact, for over 20 years, he had an Aboriginal man work with him on the farm, a Mr Jack Wobb. Jack became part of the family and even had his meals at the house. I think that is an aspect not readily understood by many.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another aspect to John Panizza which I only learnt from Coral last week and that was his strong desire to buy a Harley&hyphen;Davidson motorbike. One can only speculate about the sight of a government whip&mdash;as he was&mdash;astride a Harley&hyphen;Davidson motorbike. Nonetheless, that says something about the man and, perhaps, about his sense of fun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a previous speaker said, there is not enough time to go into all the aspects of such a man as John Panizza. He knew about issues in the bush. He could mix with anyone. He was a good man and a trusted colleague whom I will miss. The Liberal Party in Western Australia will also miss his contribution on all issues affecting Western Australia. He was very proud of his family, and, equally, he was a man of whom his family could be proud. With my wife, Caroline, I extend my sympathy to John's wife, Coral, to his children, Frank, Janine, Stephen and Linda, and also to his mother, Caterina, and brothers, Horace and Robert.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I started working reasonably closely with John Panizza when he became deputy opposition whip in 1993. He did not strike me as the most obvious choice for deputy opposition whip at the time, and I must admit to asking myself why on earth he had been put into that position. But he did learn fast and when I asked him about it, he 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="11"> credited you, Madam President, with teaching him extremely well when he took over from you as the opposition whip in, I think, 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He took the job of whip extremely seriously, as we have heard already. I remember arriving in my office towards the end of last year at about 7.30 one morning, and the direct line between the Democrat whip and the government whip was ringing. I picked it up and said, `Yes, John, you are up early.' He said, `Up early! I have been ringing you for half an hour&mdash;where have you been?' This was 7.30 in the morning. So I commiserate with Claire, his whip's clerk, who probably had to get in at about 6.30 in the morning to be there before him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was an early riser. He believed he got a lot more done that way. I remember at many whips meetings we would have discussions about when we should have the next whips meeting, and he would say, `What about 8 o'clock, what about 7.30, what about 7 a.m?' People would be tearing their hair out, saying, `No, no, no, 8.30 is quite early enough for one of these, thank you very much.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned John in an interview on ABC radio in Sydney last year, and I said that I was impressed by the way he had grown in the job as whip, and that I thought he was doing a good job as government whip&mdash;and I did. He heard about those comments and he asked me to get a copy of the interview on tape, so he could play it to his children. I am sorry to say that I did not get around to doing that&mdash;it was quite late last year. But I say it again now, for the benefit of his children and for his grandchildren, both Emily and any further that are born, so that they can read it in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>: he was, I believe, a decent and an honourable man, he was a good whip, I enjoyed working with him&mdash;especially since he became government whip&mdash;and I shall miss him.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to enter today's debate. Politics&mdash;the profession that we have all entered&mdash;is terribly adversarial. We all develop our likes and dislikes, but I think the most important thing in this chamber is whether a senator has respect, and there is absolutely no 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> doubt that, for the 10 years that John served here, he had the respect of all senators. He was an enthusiast about everything. He was an optimist. In particular, he followed issues with a great passion. Thank goodness they were issues that I always had lowest on my priorities, so that I never had to come into conflict with him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Faulkner betrayed a bit of ignorance today, when he said that John Panizza used to pick up the ball and run with it. Well, as Senator Alston indicated, John would not have understood that term at all. John Panizza saw his role as running into packs and getting the ball out. Incidentally, sometimes in his enthusiasm to get the ball, he would knock his own down. But he was a great enthusiast, he loved jumping into debates&mdash;he occasionally murdered the English language.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the thing I am going to miss most is sitting during divisions and watching him peer to try to work out which senator was where; not taking offence at our gentle teasing of him as the division interminably went on. It is going to be very sad the next time we sit in a division in this place, and do not have his assistance. I am going to find that very hard to take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was a member of the privileges committee; it is the first and only committee I have served on with him. Those on the other side of the chamber should be particularly proud of the efforts put in by Senator Helen Coonan, Senator Ellison and Senator O'Chee in stepping into the breach on that very sad Friday morning, and providing full support to the family. It was terrific. There was not much we could do on this side of the chamber, I must say, but they stepped in, and all senators can be proud of that. Our assistant clerk, Anne Lynch, also assisted enormously, of course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So to his family&mdash;and it came through that he was a great family man&mdash;we extend our condolences from this side of the chamber. To the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party, we know what this loss will mean to you. To his staff sitting in the chamber, we know what a sad day this must be, and we will all feel with you over the next few weeks. But, in such circumstances, it is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="12"> always best to remember the bright side, to remember what an ebullient personality he was, what a forceful personality he was and how much he enjoyed this chamber. We will miss him.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have all extended our sympathy today, and we are feeling our sense of loss. As far as John is concerned, I was not just a colleague, I think I was a friend. We had so many things in common: we both arrived here on the same day, we both left school when we were 15, we were both farmers, we were both in Junior Farmers and so it went on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the whip's office at the moment there is one big hole. The door is open, but there is no one there. Every now and again, we expect John to come flying out, telling us what to do or telling the staff what to do. I know that when Ian expressed his sympathy to Carolyn and Claire, he would, of course, have extended that to the staff in Perth, who are probably listening to this. I think we all extend our thanks to Yvonne, Ann and Matthew in the Perth office, for the wonderful support they gave to John.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was expecting John to jump this morning in the party meeting. He usually did. He usually had something to say. As we have seen in some of the reports that have appeared in the media and from what has already been said here today, there was no doubt that you always knew where you stood as far as John was concerned. It did not matter whether you were a backbencher, someone who worked for him or even a prime minister. On the odd occasion, he has even told the Prime Minister, `Hang on a minute!'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oy!</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oy! As has already been said, he had very strong views on most issues and in particular the ones that both he and I had basic backgrounds in&mdash;that is, local government. I remember he fought very hard for and had very strong views about funding for roads. He always believed that road funding should be tied because he did not trust the members of shires, his shire in particular, because he thought they would spend all the money on something else. He 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> had more than a passing interest in taxation, as we all remember. He was most adamant about taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I thought I first met John when I came to this place in 1987. We had offices opposite each other. When we were talking to each other about what our backgrounds were, he asked me if I had ever been to Western Australia. I said, `Yes, I've been to Western Australia. I've been to a few places you've probably never heard of, John.' He said, `Try me.' So I mentioned Mukinbudin. `Yes, I've been there.' Moorine Rock. `Yes, been there.' I said, `Southern Cross?' and he said, `That's where I live.' I went home that weekend and searched through some old files and some photos that I had taken and, sure enough, at a Junior Farmers field day in Southern Cross in 1958 there was John Panizza standing up behind me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot has been said about some of John's hobbies. I remember staying with him in Perth one weekend down at South Perth. He had more than a passing interest in everything Australian, particularly early Holden cars. Underneath one of the apartment houses he owned there were more than one or two early model Holdens, including a black FX Holden that he used to like to take for a run around the block every Sunday morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just happened to be there one Sunday morning and John said he had to go and mow his mother's lawns and could I look after his phone for him because he had advertised Linda's GTX Torana. I had been for a drive in the GTX Torana and had to use my shoulder to get out of the car because the door would not open properly. I said, `If someone rings up, how much is it worth?' He said, `Seven thousand dollars.' I said, `You've got to be joking!' He said, `This is a collector's item and I'm not going to take 1c less than $7,000.' I thought he was joking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While he was away, I had at least a dozen phone calls. I could not believe that anyone would be interested in a GTX Torana, but they were. I was very proud when he came back. I said, `I've got the car sold for you, John.' He said, `Did you get $7,000?' and I said, `No, but I got a cash offer of $6&half; thousand.' He said, `No, ring them back and tell 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="13"> them I don't want it.' As it transpired, he sold the car for $7,000. He had much pleasure in coming back here the next week and telling me that he had sold it for $7,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was always one to offer me a lot of advice, and at times I wish I had taken some of it. For instance, one day he came and told Shorty and me to buy some shares. As it turned out, they were 30c at the time. By the time I remembered to buy them, they were $1.50 and they are now 50c. For those people on that side of the house, when you thought he was reading the whips pairs book for the day, I can assure you he was just checking to see what the price of Helix shares were on that particular day. In fact, he was very successful with those, so much so that Ian Campbell suggested that J. H. Panizza stood for John Helix Panizza.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, he advised me on most things, including how I should have conducted my daughter's wedding earlier this year. It worked out very well, thanks to his advice. He was a close friend. I certainly will always miss him because he was a unique character who was so proud of everything he did. He was so proud of his family. He was proud of Coral's scones. He was always talking to me about his sons and his daughters, and particularly the farm.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to remember that in his lifetime he became the head of a rural empire that was quite unique. I know for a fact from being with him that there was always someone ringing from Western Australia. Whether it was about political matters or not I am not sure, but a few of us had suspicions about whether in fact he was the head of the Italian family of Western Australia. But he certainly was head of his own family, if not others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was very proud of the land he still owned in Italy. I know that last year on a study tour he went to America for one reason only: to go to the John Deere factory because that was another one of his loves. He loved John Deere tractors and headers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He expected a lot from all of us, but no more than what he expected from himself. Underneath that tough exterior, as has already been said, was a very soft and caring side that we got to learn and know. There are a couple 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of sayings or pieces of advice that will always stick in my mind. One day one of my staff put a little scratch on my car and when I told John he said, `There's one thing I don't do. I'll never lend my car, my camera or my wife.' So I will remember that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will remember some of the sayings from some of the whips meetings. There is one I will never forget. One day there was a lot of toing&hyphen;and&hyphen;froing between Chris and Vicki and he said, `Quiet for a minute, I want to know where we stand on landmines.' While ever there is a whip in this place, I do not think we will ever forget John Panizza. His life was summed up very well in many of the obituaries that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>. One in particular that I noted said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John, a friend from football in the 60s through to politics in the 90s. A good bloke.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You could not say anything better than that. Another one said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mindful of the fact that John used to like to keep debates in this place as brief as possible, something that was sometimes enforced rather bluntly on this side of the chamber, I shall not take long, but I do want to say a couple of things about John. I suppose now that he has passed away I can share a secret, which is what used to happen to John Panizza's wallet. I note Senator Calvert is checking the drawer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John used to carry his wallet in the back pocket of his trousers. Of course, as honourable senators will know, that is very uncomfortable when you are sitting on these benches. So when he came in to do duty he would take his wallet out of his back pocket and place it in the drawer of his desk. When you came in to relieve John on duty he was always very keen to tell you exactly what was happening and get out of the chamber as soon as possible. Sometimes, of course, he would forget the wallet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the first thing you did when you replaced John on duty was to open up the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="14"> drawer of his desk and see if the wallet was there. If it was, you would remove it and you would place it on your person, give it to Senator Calvert or put it underneath the bench. After about five or 10 minutes, a very vexed John Panizza would come in saying, `Where have I put my wallet? Where have I put my wallet?' He would open up the drawer and he would say, `Oh, it's not in here. Claire must have it.' He would march out and demand to know where his wallet was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that point you would remove the wallet from wherever you had hidden it and put it back in the drawer underneath his copy of the standing orders or many of the innumerable papers that were in the drawer and wait for him to come back and check it a second time, about 10 minutes later. Then of course he would find his wallet was under the paper and it would give you an opportunity to say, `Look, John, you must be going senile. It has been in there all the time. If you cleaned out the drawer you would actually be able to find something in this place.' It was a joke that was played on him innumerable times. I think towards the end, Senator Calvert, he was starting to cotton on to what was happening, because he did not quite trust us when he checked the drawer the second time, but he never had the evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing about John was that he could take a bit of a stirring and he usually gave you one back. Those of us down this end were frequent recipients of comments about `Cockies Corner'. He would come down, ask if you wanted to take note of answers and disappear before you could stick your hand up. That was the way he liked to run the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people have commented on John's passions in politics, and he was a very passionate politician. But his greatest passion was undoubtedly his family. We would frequently be in the chamber. You would come in to relieve him or he would come in to relieve you and he would tell you the latest development in the family, what one of his sons had done or what one of his daughters had done. He was immensely proud of them in a way that was very touching and very moving.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of you who know or have come in contact with John's children will understand part of the reason why he was so proud of them&mdash;he brought them up to be very fine people indeed, very fine Australians and very fine members of his family. He was proud of them because they were his children. He was proud of his wife because she was his wife. He saw it as his responsibility to look after them, but he was also very proud of their achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suspect that he demanded of them the very same high standards that he demanded of himself. That view was reinforced when his son Stephen came over and we spoke with him in Cairns when Stephen made some arrangements in relation to the funeral. Stephen stopped and said, `You know, on Boxing Day last year I had come back home and all of a sudden Dad decided that one of the silos up on the hill needed to be moved down to the house. So Dad, Frank and I went up. We cut the silo down. We moved it down. We remounted it, fixed it all up and were still back at home in time for dinner.' Stephen was very proud of that because it was the way in which John lived his life and the way in which he expected his children to live their lives&mdash;with hard work, with honesty and doing what had to be done when it had to be done. I note Senator Crane, who has a very long experience with John, is&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was probably 45 degrees Centigrade as well, but Stephen did not say anything about that, and I expect that that would not come into the calculations in the Panizza household. When a job had to be done, it had to be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing I want to say is that John took a paternal interest in some of us and would frequently give us advice. I was on the receiving end of some of John's advice, both welcome advice and sometimes unwelcome advice, particularly during the taking of divisions. During the taking of a division John would stand over the top of you and tell you how to take the division, how to count it and what you had to do. That was par for the course, but John also gave a lot of good 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="15"> advice on how you live your life, how you run a farm and other matters like that. It was just something he did out of the goodness of his heart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was immensely shocked when Anne Lynch phoned me on Friday morning to say that John had passed away during the night in Cairns, particularly as John had come up for a reference for the Privileges Committee which I had requested. So I felt really very upset at the whole thing. John passed away in the service of the parliament. He was always attending to parliamentary business and always attending to his duties, and that is what made him a very fine senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us in the National Party will miss John. We pay our respects to his wife, his mother and his children. I am asked to associate with this motion the Leader of the National Party in WA and the Deputy Premier, Mr Hendy Cowan, who had a fine respect for John and wishes that to be placed on the record. I do pass on my greatest sympathies to his family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with other senators, on the death of John Panizza, in passing on my condolences to his family and friends. I am loath to usually speak in a condolence debate. It is not something that I enjoy or feel comfortable with. I must say, if it were not for the fact that I had such a high regard for John, I would not have entered today's debate. However, as someone who, in the last year, has been John's his chief adversary as a fellow whip, I have no difficulty at all in joining today's debate. I have no difficulty at all in saying good things about John Panizza.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Paul Calvert referred to him as a good bloke. I would use the same words. It sounds awfully inadequate when you are trying to describe somebody, but I think that is a good way of describing John. He was a real bush character; he was honest, hard working, forthright&mdash;all those qualities that are easy to admire in someone. Despite the sort of grumpy exterior he sometimes adopted, I always found him to be a very soft and caring person who was very easy to work with. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite our supposedly adversarial role, we ended up having what I thought was a very good relationship. That is largely because John was such a straight character. As others have said, what you saw was what you got. I did not have to worry about any connivance or airs. John told you where he stood and you were able to deal directly with one other. It was a very good relationship and he was a very good person to do business with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things that I would say to reflect the respect I had for John was that I always enjoyed sitting next to him on a plane. It is not always the case that you enjoy sitting next to someone on the plane when travelling from Perth to Canberra. If you get the wrong companion it can be a very long trip. I will not name those about whom I have that reaction. This is a cross&hyphen;party comment, I might add. I am not being at all political.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I always looked forward to sitting next to John on the plane. We always had a good discussion about everything from football to politics to farming. I learnt a lot about his family, as others have said they did. We would discuss our respective families. John had immense pride in his family. I got to know quite a lot about them, given that across the chamber we do not generally know a lot about each other's personal lives. I got to know a fair bit about John. My respect for him only increased the better I got to know him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I understand it he had a reputation among Liberal senators as a tough whip, which always surprised me as I always thought he was a real softie towards them. He was forever asking me for extended pairs and special arrangements to suit them. I used to make him suffer for it, I hasten to add. I regarded him as quite a softie. I suppose I used to see the other side of him. He was a very good man to deal with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wanted to briefly say something about some of the fierce debates we had with John in this chamber about subjects like multiculturalism, and particularly Aboriginal affairs. I think Senator Kernot referred to that. On occasions we have had some quite heated and emotional debates about those issues in this chamber. But I always thought&mdash;even though 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="16"> I often disagreed very strongly with John on the position that he adopted&mdash;that he came from a good hearted position, a very genuine position on those issues. He was a person that I always gave total respect to, confident that he would actually be treating everyone he dealt with as he found them. One could not ever make the suggestion that he was at all racist or held any negative attitudes like that. I always thought he was someone, as others have said, who treated people as he found them and treated everyone equally and fairly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that I wanted to say about John was that on a number of occasions he brought home to me what a privilege it was to serve as a senator. If I thought I had lost sight of that sometimes, John's remarks would bring home to me how proud he was of being a senator, of the privilege of serving Western Australians in this chamber. On a number of occasions it caused me to reflect on that privilege that we all have that someone like John took so seriously the duties and the honour bestowed upon him of representing people in this chamber. I thought that was one of his endearing qualities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Boswell referred briefly to how the National Party let him slip. I remember him telling me the tale&mdash;and I had heard of it from others. Although I think that on many issues&mdash;particularly some of those farming issues&mdash;he was a National at heart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His standing in the community was so great that the Labor Party was not beyond approaching him in the mid&hyphen;1980s about standing for the Labor Party. I think he was the President of the National Party branch at the time, but unfortunately the Liberal Party snared him first. As people would be aware, his philosophy probably was not that closely aligned to ours, but in the days of a very pragmatic Labor administration, they knew that John had a tremendous standing in the community and that he would make an excellent candidate. If the National Party did not have the sense to use him properly, we were prepared to consider him. Unfortunately, as I understand from former President and former Senator Beahan, that approach was rejected, and he went on to serve with distinction as a Liberal senator.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;John Panizza, this man of unchallenged integrity, profound principle and deep compassion for the battlers&mdash;because he had been there and done that&mdash;will be sorely missed. He will be missed by the whole of the parliament, I believe, particularly members of this Senate; he will be missed by the local community in Western Australia; he will be missed by his many friends and most particularly he will be missed by his family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John spoke to me about his family. He was obviously very passionate&mdash;as somebody said&mdash;about his family. I suppose you could say he was proud of his family, too, of what they meant to him and what they had achieved. I believe the general public, when they come to know his contribution to politics, to Western Australia, to the farming industry and to other areas will see that his death is a sad loss to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He has passed on now after all those years of service. Looking at him, one would have said that hard work and dedicated public service do not necessarily mean grey hairs. Actually, I thought John was younger than I. I was surprised when I read that he was 65 years of age. On one or two occasions he seemed to defer to me and I thought it might be my age&mdash;or my vote&mdash;but, as somebody else has said, he was no respecter of status, so I could exclude that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Visitors to this place asked who he was. I would say, `That is Senator John Panizza; he is the government whip.' A number of people who do not know much about parliament wonder what a whip is. I do not think there is anything in the standing orders, Madam President, about whips; they are not specifically mentioned as far as I can see but, without them, the place would not run. There is no doubt about that. Incidentally, the derivation of the word is from fox hunting where the term whip&hyphen;ins or whips corral the hounds both before and during the hunt. The hounds in the government unfortunately will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="17"> not be hearing the voice of that whip any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The duties of the whip include arranging speakers, making sure senators are there during quorums and divisions and the like, and arranging the pairs, as Senator Evans said. It is a difficult job. It also includes second&hyphen;guessing what the opposition is going to do and what their tactics might be, and second&hyphen;guessing what the Australian Democrats, the Greens or, even harder still, various independents might do. All of that is in a day's work for the whips. I apologise to John if sometimes he didn't know where I was going but I think he had a fair idea on a number of occasions when others didn't because he was a very perceptive man. He could second&hyphen;guess what was going on and very often he would outfox a lot of other people. I would like to extend my personal sympathy to his wife, his family, his mother and all his friends&mdash;and also his staff. May he rest in peace.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to be associated with the  motion of condolence moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill). It is not my practice to speak at length on condolence motions and today will be no exception. I would however stress that my brevity should not be regarded as an indication that I am not deeply shocked and saddened at John's passing. In extending my condolences to John's family, I would emphasise that the opposite is in fact the case. My sorrow is deeply and genuinely felt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I first came to know John well when he served on the agricultural and veterinary chemicals committee of which I was chairman. John's extensive experience in the rural sector proved to be of invaluable assistance to the committee during the public hearings and in the report writing stage. Indeed, it was gratifying that the committee travelled to and took evidence in an area close to where John lived. Little did we suspect then that, as government whip, he would in the future be taken from us without having the chance to say goodbye.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In some ways, the Senate chamber is like a large family. From time to time we have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> differing opinions but we are saddened when one of our number passes on. This is especially so with John Panizza who was so well liked by members on all sides of the chamber. I understand the grief that John's family is currently experiencing but, in time, they may be able to draw some comfort from the fact that their grief is also shared by John's former colleagues. We will miss him but he will live on in our fond memories.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our friend&mdash;my friend&mdash;John Panizza was a very great and proud Australian. He was a person I very genuinely admired. I tried to learn from him and adopt some of his strengths and, for me, trying to emulate those strengths is perhaps the greatest form of respect that I could express to John. We shared a number of particular political beliefs; we also shared a number of political prejudices&mdash;but today is perhaps not the day to talk about those.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was, as other speakers have mentioned, very proud of his Italian heritage. I was always very happy to have him up my way in North Queensland, particularly at election time, because he had a rapport with the large Italian community up there, the farmers up my way, and he had an easy goingness that changed a lot of people's opinions about politicians. For that reason it was always tremendous to be campaigning with John in the bush and regional Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was always happy to relate that he had a connection with the north of Queensland. His father, when he first came out from Italy, cut cane in Ingham, not far from where I live. As Senator Alston has mentioned, he also worked in Mount Isa. I was out there at the time Senator Alston mentioned when Senator Panizza spoke at length about his father's days in Mount Isa in his very early times in Australia. They were very obviously very difficult times for his father&mdash;and John felt very much for him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is perhaps not well known&mdash;it certainly was not something John went around patting himself on the back about&mdash;but during the Second World War there were a lot of injustices done to Australians of Italian origin and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="18"> for many years those injustices continued. John made it one of his goals in his time in the Senate to overcome those injustices and he did succeed in doing that in the last couple of years. It is perhaps to his credit more than anyone else's that those injustices were resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a time for politics but I must say&mdash;and John would like me to say, I am sure&mdash;that I was very proud to have him as a fellow Liberal. For me, he epitomised all the qualities that attracted me, and I am sure others, to the Liberal Party. He was not tertiary educated. He started life with nothing. He worked his guts out for his family and to make progress in life. He really proved that you can start with nothing and that if you have the commitment and the drive and the energy you can certainly make it. He was a farmer, he was a businessman, he was a local leader and, above all, he was a very compassionate man. He was, as others have mentioned, very proud of his rural and farming background and of his local government experience.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ellison mentioned Senator Panizza in connection with the Aboriginal community. Having looked through some of John's speeches, I know that some people at times may have called him a redneck&mdash;or he thought people were calling him a redneck&mdash;particularly when it came to debates on Aborigines. But, in addition to what Senator Ellison has said, I remember John telling me&mdash;I thought it was in the chamber, although it may have been privately&mdash;that he was closer to Aborigines than most people were. He related the story of a young Aboriginal girl living in his community. He was so very proud that when she was being married and could not find her father or whatever she asked John if he would give her away as her father. He was very proud of that. It demonstrated his very great compassion and the regard he had for the Aboriginal race.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was very proud of and committed to Coral and his family. Because of my interest in the law he used to talk to me about one of his children who had married a lawyer. He would say, jokingly, `I won't have to go to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> you or the other lawyers here to get free legal advice any more. I will have it within the family.' He would make the joke that it would not cost him anything any more. But I know from talking to John and from his great success in business that he probably knew more about law and business than any lawyer could ever tell him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John's family and his staff, who were really part of his family, will miss him tremendously&mdash;as we all will. Certainly my wife, Lesley, and I will. I am very happy to be able to be associated with this motion of condolence and I again pass on to Coral and the family my sincere sympathy at John's passing.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to be associated with the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill. I first came across John in 1986 when he was endorsed for the 1987 election. I was left in no doubt whatsoever that we were to have a senator join us who was a go&hyphen;getter and a very successful man.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not knowing the man, travelling at that time with John was an experience and a half for me. He was a real mixture of a character: he had a sense of humour, he had dedication, he had drive, he had energy, he had enthusiasm; but most of all he had a great understanding and a knowledge of the things that were going on in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember the first trip that I had with John was from Esperance, down the south&hyphen;east corner and weaving our way back up through to Kalgoorlie. We stopped at every little byway along the way and there was hardly a person that he did not know all the way through there; he knew someone whether it was through the agricultural profession, or mining, or this and that. It was just an amazing education about someone who had obviously been part of a community so actively for so long.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought it was interesting when I was reading back over his maiden speech given in 1987 where he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before I got here I had a lot of other missions to carry out along the way: helping to consolidate a family business; an extensive interest in industry affairs; raising a family; educating a family; and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="19"> being involved in local government for 12 years. I also believe that a man must show that he can manage his own affairs and preferably risk his own dollar before offering himself for higher office and thereby shaping the future of other people.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that that, being a quote from his maiden speech, encapsulates what Senator John Panizza was all about. He was a man who was dedicated to success in everything that he undertook.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said today about his enormous success in business and farming. It is, in many cases in this country, unparalleled. If he was not the largest wheat farmer in Australia, he would be jolly close to it. But, while much has been said about his great business and political achievements, probably the greatest success and obvious love of his life was his family. I am pleased to know that he spoke to so many people about his family because I have spent many an hour travelling backwards and forwards to Canberra with John when we have had a laugh and a joke and told many stories. But, gee, he spoke so warmly about his mother, the work that he did for her and how much he cared for her. And, of course, he spoke so much about his ever loving wife, Coral. He would joke about getting the missus over here to bake the scones for our morning tea. Whilst he would talk about Coral in that way, you knew that there was such warmth, love and affection shared between the two of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My first parliamentary office was on a floor that was shared with an accounting firm where John's eldest son Frank worked. I got to know Frank sooner than I got to know John. But it was interesting that, by knowing Frank, I had someone to relate to when JP, as they used to call him, talked so lovingly about his four children, all of whom are adults today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But his new granddaughter, Emily, was the apple of his eye. It was terrific to go into John's office as he was always wanting to show the most recent photographs of the family wedding and to make sure that you knew all about Emily from front to back and upside down and inside out. He was enormously proud. I thought it rather sad to read in today's paper the death notice from Emily and her parents because clearly Emily loved 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> her grandad and was looking forward to spending much more time with him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, John and I had a lot of laughs together. He had a quite quiet but wicked sense of humour. He was a tough character and, where work was concerned, he was certainly a no&hyphen;nonsense man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When John took over from me as deputy opposition whip in the Senate after the 1993 election, he was never reluctant to ask people for advice on what he should be doing and on how he should be doing it. I found it interesting that, with all his experience of parliamentary life, a man who was so rich with knowledge was never afraid to ask for advice or help. He not only wanted to do the job well, he also wanted to do it really well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of us know that John did his job very well because as sure as heck he put the fear of lightning strike into many of us when we sought leave from this place. Last year Senator Patterson and I were fortunate enough to be granted a week's leave from the sitting of the Senate to embark on a trip to Antarctica. During the course of that trip it appeared from time to time, when the fast ice got thicker and the trip got slower, that we may in fact have been late getting back. I said half&hyphen;jokingly&mdash;and I say half&hyphen;jokingly because I was terrified at the time&mdash;to the Director of the Antarctic Division, Rex Moncur, that if we got back late he could be the one to phone the whip, John Panizza, to tell him that two of his senators would be missing from today's sitting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Little did I realise, Madam President, what we would be debating here on this very day. But Senator Patterson and I had a bit of a laugh about the fear that our whip put into us. He had been good enough to give us a week's leave at the end of last year's sitting, but to have come back and asked for a week's leave at the beginning of the year would have been just too much.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John earned the respect and admiration of everyone he had contact with. People in the branches of the Liberal Party in the length and breadth of the huge state of Western Australia knew and understood John and admired the fight that he took to the federal parliament for and on their behalf. The people 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="20"> in mining, in agriculture, in fishing, in local government and in business in general all valued the contribution of good old JP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another one of John's great loves was his cherished East Fremantle Football Club of which I think he was a patron. I am a vice&hyphen;patron of the Claremont Football Club in the Western Australian Football League so you can imagine the rounds of the kitchen that I would get when Claremont beat East Fremantle. But John was always quick to track me down on a Monday morning if East Fremantle had beaten Claremont.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, last year John really had some mixed feelings because my cherished Claremont Football Club happens to be coached by a long&hyphen;time and greatly honoured star of the Claremont Football Club, one Darrell Panizza, one of John's nephews. John had a bit of a conflict there. Dare I say it, but I think East Fremantle beat us in every game in the qualifying round last year, so boy, did I cop it! But when Claremont came through and won the Western Australian Football League premiership last year he was really torn between the devil and the deep blue sea because his relative, one Darrell Panizza, was the coach of the victorious team. So his great pride for his family extended way beyond his immediate family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst mentioning the Claremont Football Club, on behalf of John O'Connell, the committee and members of the Claremont Football Club, I would like to extend the club's condolences to Coral and to John's entire family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will always remember good old JP as a person of honesty, integrity, pride in his heritage and pride in his family. He was enormously energetic in everything that he did. When a division or quorum is called I think I will expect to see him striding at a rate of knots into this chamber for a long time to come. My heartfelt condolences are extended to Mrs Panizza senior, to dear Coral, to all his immediate family, to his very large and extended family and, of course, to his staff. Rest in peace, John.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Merredin is half&hyphen;way between Perth and Kalgoorlie&mdash;which is about as far as you can get from the monuments and acronyms of Canberra. We chose to start at Merredin because our preliminary information indicated that this little town and its environs in many ways epitomises what is happening in adult and community education around this vast country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Out there in the heart of the wheatlands they produce 15% of Australia's wheat crop and lately times have been hard. But they came to the school hall that day because they do not take education for granted. There is a self&hyphen;reliance there, and a capacity to improvise. TAFE, the local high school, agricultural officers and the shire council all seem to work together. The local needs are met first and foremost. Computer and accounting courses for farming families, retailing courses for school leavers, machine workshop programs, and a liberal sprinkling of arts and crafts, languages, fitness, cooking and other practical skills&mdash;it's all there.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Fellow senators, that is Panizza country. In making this contribution today, I point out that there is a story behind all of that. I am sure that Senator Ellison and Senator Campbell would<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> remember that one of the things I said at my preselection in 1989&mdash;because I had appeared previously through my farmers federation connections&mdash;was that I wanted to make sure that some of the senate inquiries got out of the capital cities and out into the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Panizza heard about that and pursued me relentlessly to insist that the first place that I should go out to on a committee was Merredin, which, as I have said, is Panizza country. Hence we ended up in Merredin. The above words that I quoted were signed by former Senator Terry Aulich, but I can remember sitting down to construct those words. What we saw in that country really reflected what can be done by individuals when they are driven by the likes of Senator Panizza.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="21">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As the basis of my contribution I thought I would talk more about the pre&hyphen;Senate days of John&mdash;or `Panizz'&mdash;because I knew him for a long time. I probably first met John Panizza in the late 1950s or early 1960s in the days of the wheat quota, the collapse of the wool industry and other things that we are familiar with today. We went through very many interesting experiences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that we need to recognise about where Senator Panizza came from is that he lived in an area that was highly politically charged. He was very closely connected, as has already been said, with the shire councils but also with the farmers union of those days. It is worth noting that during those experiences there were three zones: the Esperance zone, which was to the south&hyphen;east and one of the furthest away; the Merredin zone, which covered Southern Cross and the Yilgarn, which was about as far east as you go could go without getting into South Australia; and the northern zone, which was really the political parts of the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Merredin was particularly political. There was a Panizza&hyphen;Patroni camp, who lived in the Southern Cross&hyphen;Yilgarn area. Hendy Cowan from Narembeen has already been mentioned and, of course, down at Doodlakine just a few miles down the road we had the Walsh&hyphen;Chance clan. A meeting in Merredin was quite amazing. The forefathers foresaw that Merredin was going to be the centre of many hot, political, agricultural debates so they built a huge hall that could seat about 600 people and stand another 200, 300 or 400 if need be. On top of that, they also had loudspeakers so you could listen outside.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of people in the Senate today who have attended meetings in Merredin. Senator McKiernan is one who has been up there in a chock&hyphen;a&hyphen;block full hall, and I remember Senator Alston and former Senator Austin Lewis coming up one day with us. On that occasion, David Hawker from the other place and a number of other people, including Hendy Cowan, Peter Walsh and Wilson Tuckey, were also present at what was  quite an interesting afternoon, let me tell you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I relate all this to describe the politics that existed there. They would all sit in their well 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> organised places around the hall: the Patroni&hyphen;Panizza clan all fitting on one side, Hendy Cowan and his people on another and the Walsh-Chance down the end. I can see Senator McKiernan laughing because he remembers it well. One of the remarkable things about it was that you would get up on the stage and, invariably, whoever got the nod from the chairman for the first go would absolutely slip into you in no uncertain manner and give you a really tough time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the rest of the afternoon the other two groups would tick off the other lot because they had been so rude to the guest speaker they had invited up there. So you would sit there and listen to this enormous debate. If you had done something which was not quite liked&mdash;which was really the only reason you got an invitation up there, I might add&mdash;if it was not a social occasion, you were sat on an old bench stool with a couple of mallee sticks on the end. I think there was a salmon gum split under that and you would sit there without a back very comfortably&mdash;with no table for any notes. So they made sure you got your round but that was it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is very important to recognise in John's political background that he did live in probably the most highly charged political environment that I have seen anywhere in Western Australia. The debates would cross the full political spectrum. I wanted to relate that to the Senate and to the people here because it gives an insight into the man and into his fierceness and directness in debate. If you were not direct in the environment I have described, you were overrun; you never got a second chance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the wheat quota days were on I can remember turning up as one of the visitors from `down the south,' because in Merredin you were called a southerner&mdash;even though there was no state boundary like Queensland and New South Wales have. After I got up and made some comments, somebody came up from the Patroni&hyphen;Panizza side of the hall and said, `He is from the south. Tell him to get back down there. They can't grow wheat.' While those words were not from `Panizz' I am sure they had been well worked out before we got there.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. It has been very hard to grow over the last few years&mdash;although I am told that in Southern Cross this year it has been one of their best years ever, and that is worth noting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a long story and one cannot go into all of it now, but during the wheat quota days those of us down south were new land farmers, and we are still called new land farmers even though it is 30&hyphen;odd years later; I am not sure when we are going to become farmers. Out of that debate came what was known as the top cuts. The top cut was utilised to top up the quotas of those down south. We got a 48 ton wheat quota and that was going to be the end of us all. A lot of human thought went into that and fairness did prevail in the end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The other thing I wish to raise is the enormous contribution Panizz made to the debate that has taken place on rail and road, in this chamber and in the hearings we have had in the last week on AN and the National Rail Corporation. Some of my colleagues, including Senator Ferris, have been with us. We had this debate in Western Australia 20 years ago. I think the best way to sum up that debate on the modernisation of the rail system, the deregulation of the transport industry, getting rid of the franchise arrangements that were in place and replacing them with a tender system, is to say that to this day those of us who are still in agriculture are still only paying about 70 per cent of the freight rates we were paying before those actions were taken. Panizz played an enormous role in that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, in the political scenario, one can never leave out the influence of Wilson Tuckey. Also, one must mention Mick Gayfer. Mick was the person whom John went so very close to defeating for election to the upper house at that time. There is no doubt in the minds of Western Australian grain growers that the continuing surveillance, scrutiny, analysis and work that Panizz did as far as CBH is concerned was instrumental in the modernisation of the grain handling facilities in Western Australia and in keeping 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the grain handling charges down very significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Last week I was fortunate enough to be invited by Sarah Knight of the ABC to give an obituary to Panizz. After thinking about it, I have to say I do not believe there are very many people, in this place or across the full community, who would have the intricate knowledge that John had of the mining industry, particularly prospecting in the gold industry, of wheat, beef, wool, real estate, the Stock Exchange&mdash;which has already been mentioned here&mdash;the machinery industry, and chemicals, particularly glyphosphate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Two or three weeks ago, Panizz phoned me. The conversation went something like this: `Have you been in touch with Prosser yet? I don't think he understands this glyphosphate issue. Make sure he understands it. We mustn't have any dumping duties on glyphosphate.' That really epitomises the way that he drove things and kept you on your toes and made sure that the message got through. I have spoken to Geoff Prosser, but we will be speaking some more to make sure the message has got through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Today we have discussed some of the humanitarian issues John was involved in, and there has been mention already of Aboriginals. In his maiden speech in this place he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do have an understanding or a sympathy with Aboriginal people with regard to discrimination because I know what discrimination is. I have experienced it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that really highlighted one aspect of John's character. After we had spoken about some of these matters, Sarah Knight said to me, `Do you mean what you are saying? He was in favour of giving a man not a fish, but a fishing line so that he could catch many fish.' I think that comment really summed up that side of Panizz. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things I will miss enormously&mdash;and I am sure Western Australians on both sides of this chamber will remember this&mdash;is that when we used to get to the top of our flight path from Canberra to Perth we would say, `Panizza country down there.' Then, when we were going the other way, he would say, `Shut up. You're not going to say it.' But 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="23"> we would say, `We're just getting out of Panizza country.' We will miss that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another other matter I wish to raise which I do not think has been mentioned was his very close involvement not only with the Italian community but also with a broad spectrum of ethnic communities. I can remember that when I was first elected to the Senate he said to me, `I'll get you round the various ethnic clubs in Western Australia.' There were quite a number of these&mdash;the Italian club, the Portuguese club, the Croatian club, the Chinese club. It always used to go extremely well for the first five or 10 minutes. He would introduce you and would be talking slowly so you could understand the words. Then, all of a sudden somebody would say something that did not fit the bill and John would burst into half&hyphen;Italian and half&hyphen;English, and for the next hour and a half you had to make your own way around the club. Nonetheless, I will always be grateful for that opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I say in concluding my comments that John Panizza was a friend. He was more of an industry or a business friend than a social friend. We worked on many issues for many years on many things and his contribution was always strong, it was always sound and it was always well thought out. But above all, he was consistent, he was reliable, he was true. He was true to himself, true to those around him and incredibly true to his family. My condolences to Coral, his mother, his family, his friends, including those in his office&mdash;I know Yvonne is here today and Claire has been in here. They can all be proud of the life and contribution of John Panizza. May he rest in peace.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Greens (WA) and my colleague Senator Brown from the Australian Greens, I rise in support of the condolence motion today for Senator John Panizza. Senator Boswell today said that whatever John attacked he attacked with enthusiasm and vigour. As with the Democrats, that was me from time to time. My first encounter with Senator Panizza was before I had met him. I had been visiting Esperance, where there had been media coverage of some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concerns there. Senator Panizza got to the media and said that I should butt out. I did not, and neither did he.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were frequently occasions when, in my electorate work, I went to various parts of Western Australia, such as the north-west or Geraldton. Usually on an annual basis there was an invitation to Newman college in Geraldton for an open day. Often on those kind of occasions, the only other politician from Western Australia present was Senator Panizza. I remember having a robust discussion with him some time later, when he said, `Hey, but I thought we were mates.' That came as a bit of a surprise to me. I think it was partly because we would often end up in the same place. I am not sure that after working as the government whip he still considered me a mate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that Senator Panizza worked hard. I know that he worked hard in his electorate. I know that he worked hard in the chamber. Obviously I am in the chamber quite a lot, so I know how often he was here and speaking.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that Senator Panizza was a non-smoker and a non-drinker. We would quite frequently see Senator Panizza in the parliamentary cafeteria, where I would often eat dinner. He would order a salad and reach into his pocket and bring out a can of sardines. I am not sure whether it was his desire for a healthy lifestyle or partly non-conspicuous consumption that exemplified Senator Panizza. He certainly did seem to live a lean and healthy lifestyle. He worked very hard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He had obviously wanted to be a parliamentarian for a long time. He was in politics for a long time. I also believe that local government is politics. He fought very hard. I would like to extend my sympathy to Senator Panizza's family and friends and pass with that the Greens' deepest sympathy to those people who were close to him.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am on the Privileges Committee. I first heard about the death of Senator Panizza when Senator Coonan rang me early Friday morning and told me about it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following that, some words from a great assessor of human character came to me. This great assessor of human character once said about another, `There is a true Israelite in whom there is nothing false.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with much sadness that I support this motion of condolence for our departed friend and colleague John Panizza. Like most senators, I was completely stunned by the news of his death, which we received last week. I found it extremely hard to believe that he could have passed away so suddenly and without any warning. He is a man who I guess we all thought was fit and healthy and would be on this earth for many years to come. It certainly made me and all of us, including, I gather, Bob Woods, very much aware of both our mortality and the stresses and strains of life in the parliament. We do sometimes forget how difficult a lifestyle this is and the strains it can put on people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think in the case of John Panizza that a particular sadness is the loss of an older member of the Senate. With due respect to Natasha and Bill, the younger members, I am one who thinks that sometimes in Australian politics there is an undue emphasis on youth, sometimes to the expense of having older and wiser members of our parliaments available to express their views on legislation and issues of the day. I know in my party that if you are 50 or over, people start talking about when you are going to leave. If you try for preselection, you are in trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed when I went on a delegation to Europe that a number of European parliaments have a minimum entry age of 35 for their upper houses. In Europe, there is certain 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ly a focus on having older and, presumably but not necessarily, wiser people in their upper houses in particular. It is very sad for that reason to lose someone of John's age and certainly wisdom from this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">January was not a very good month. Those of us who were close to and good friends of Bert Kelly were very saddened by his death. That was shockingly followed by John's. At least in Bert's case he was 84. He had been out of parliament for 20 years. He had led a long and productive life. We were able to  celebrate his life at his funeral in Adelaide. But in the case of John, we all thought&mdash;no doubt he thought it&mdash;that he would have at least another 20 years on this earth and be able to continue to contribute to the Senate, his family and his country. It is tragic that his contribution has been cut short in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I first heard of John Panizza about 10 years ago when I was the state director of the South Australian Liberal Party. My secretary said that a new Western Australian Liberal senator called John Panizza was on the phone and was very angry. I wondered about that. I thought it was very enlightened of the Western Australian Liberal Party to have elected a senator called Panizza. The Western Australian Liberal Party is a very enlightened division.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John came on the phone extremely upset about the fact that he had bought a ticket in a raffle run by a branch of the Liberal Party in South Australia. John had been fortunate enough to win first prize. The first prize was a houseboat holiday on the Murray but, unfortunately, the company that had donated this prize to the Liberal Party branch that ran the raffle had gone bankrupt and John could not collect on his prize. He wanted me to do something about it. `What are you going to do about it, Minchin?' I said, `Well, Senator Panizza, I am not sure,'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought this must have been some poor, impoverished Italian farmer who was desperate to have a holiday on the Murray and obviously could not afford it. So I did my utmost but, unfortunately, I was not able to procure the funds or get this company out of bankruptcy. I think he held it against me since then. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="25">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, I then learnt that he was not such an impoverished farmer that he could not afford a houseboat holiday on the Murray. It was certainly an example of the financial acumen that John brought to most issues and his determination to see things through. It was an interesting introduction to John and it was a great pleasure for me to become a Senate colleague of John in 1993, some six years after that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I feel a great sense of loss. Our time together in the Senate was only 3&half; years. It has been cut short by his very sudden death. I will miss his unique character very much. He was one of the real characters of this parliament and that has been evident from the comments from everybody around the chamber. I, too, extend my regards to his family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following Senator Minchin, as someone who is older but not necessarily wiser, I would like to associate myself with this condolence motion to the former senator Panizza. I well remember my first day in this place because that is the day I met John Panizza. An increasing number of us who enter this place filling casual vacancies realise what a daunting day it is when you are the only new person in the place and you walk in to be sworn in, having probably flown to Canberra the night before, as I did, and having only been in Parliament House once in my life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That morning I did the usual things. I went and saw the whip, who gave me a brief overview of what I could expect and said, `If you listen for a while, you will probably learn as things go along.' I met President Sibraa and then spent an hour with then opposition whip, our now President. As I left her, she said, `You will be sitting with Panizza. He is a good man. I think you will like him.' I still remember the hour that followed. Then I came in to be sworn in and was led back to sit next Senator Panizza&mdash;the seat where Senator Gibbs now sits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most of the things of that day are a bit of a haze. I have always said your first day in here is a bit like having been a spectator at a league footy match for about 20 years and at half time being told, `Go and put the boots 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on. You're in.' The first day is a bit of a haze. But I well remember many of the things that John Panizza said to me that day and, by the time question time had finished, he knew everything about me and I still knew very little about him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I do remember one thing. He said, `I hear you have been a farmer.' I said, `Yes, well I have.' Trying to help the conversation along, because it was June, I said, `We are in the middle of seeding.' He said, `How much do you crop?' I said, `About 900 acres.' I said, `How much do you crop?' He said, `Oh, about 14.' I said, `What&mdash;1,400 acres?' He said, `No, no, no&mdash;14,000.' From that day on, I knew that we were dealing with a very successful man who had made a major contribution to primary industry in Western Australia and was making a major contribution to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have lost the best weather forecaster we ever had. When I used to arrive on a Sunday night at the Adelaide airport, Panizza would often be sitting in the chairman's lounge and he would say, `Is it raining over your way yet?' I would say, `No,' and he would say, `But it will be Tuesday.' For those of you who know the weather patterns of Australia, the rain comes across Yorke Peninsula in South Australia about two days after they get it in Southern Cross. So he provided me with a very accurate weather forecast. The only thing I did not know was how much we were going to get because often that depended on how much was dropped on Southern Cross.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that in recent times John was very proud of his farming record and particularly the way in which yields had increased on his place. During November and December there would be a daily harvest report. John used to ring every day. Then he would come and see whether we had started&mdash;he usually started a week or two before in his country. I still vividly remember him saying to me in November last year, `Well, Ferg, this morning we just delivered the most grain we have ever reaped off our property in our life.' I said, `You must be nearly finished, John.' He said, `No, no. We have another 4,000 acres left yet.' </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="26">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That was the sort of farmer that John was. He always showed interest in what was happening on his own farm and his own place. He shared in the plight of farmers in general throughout the whole of Australia. Although he did not feel the pinch as much as many people on smaller holdings, he understood because he had started from fairly humble beginnings himself. It was only through sheer hard work that he achieved the standing that he had in the rural community and certainly in the wheat industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also remember going to his home in Perth and how proud he was of it. As you walked in the drive, on the side of the building he had a beautiful stained glass window on which was an old windmill&mdash;naturally, a Southern Cross windmill because Southern Cross used to make the old windmills. As well there were heads of grain, which was he had particularly wanted on his house. He was very proud of his place there which had been designed especially to fit on the block he had bought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I knew John particularly well from committee work. I had the good fortune to chair a rather illustrious committee known as industry, science, technology, transport, telecommunications and infrastructure, which is now more suitably called economics. My friend Senator Childs was chair when I first went on the committee. John Panizza came onto that committee and I know that he never at any stage allowed anything to overrule his Western Australian interests. Whenever we had an inquiry or a reference on anything, whether it be telecommunications in remote areas or the CSIRO, John always said, `You will have to come to Western Australia. I can take you to some places where you will really see what is needed.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember during the telecommunications inquiry, John said, `They've just chopped out our transmitter in north&hyphen;west Western Australia, so we're going to have to go up and find out about it.' So we found ourselves in Cue and the Murchison Shire, which I think has a grand total of 26 ratepayers. John made sure that every person in Western Australia was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> catered for. He was going to make sure that he represented them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John made a particular contribution to committee work. You could never accuse him of beating around the bush. He was very direct with his questioning. He was very direct with his comments. If you were writing a report and there was something in it that he did not agree with, you knew before you ever got past the final draft.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John had a tremendous influence on me in this place. I sat next to him until he became deputy whip and have served on committees with him ever since I arrived in parliament. I certainly appreciated his capacity for work, his straightforwardness and his friendliness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember at one hearing in Sydney how proud John was to have present his son Stephen, who works with a merchant bank. He said, `We're going to have Stephen come out with us. I'm going to have a feed with the lad tonight.' John was always very proud of the achievements of Stephen and of Frank&mdash;his other son, who is an accountant and who I believe is now home on the farm&mdash;and of his daughters, one of whom I met when staying in Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Panizza will be remembered for many things. It has all been said this afternoon, so I will not repeat those things. He was the consummate family man. He will be remembered for many things in this place, particularly as a real Australian, as a person who was dedicated to his family, to his work and to this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I certainly extend my sympathies to Coral. We will miss those scones; they were nearly as good as my mother used to make. I extend my sympathies to Coral and to the rest of the family. We will certainly miss John Panizza.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Panizza had a great sense of government being about providing for people on the basis of what was right and what was wrong.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On at least two issues, I saw John very torn between what he saw was the correct course and what our position was when in opposition. The first issue was the native title amendments proposed by the previous government that would have clearly entrenched the then government's aim to extinguish native title on pastoral leases. The Senate will recall that we in opposition took the view that the native title legislation was bad and we would oppose it in total. John, I believe, would have preferred to have been more circumspect in that approach, but he was always a team player. He kept the solidarity of the coalition, but I think he would have been more comfortable not doing so. He was a very dependable team player.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue over which John anguished was the sexual privacy legislation. Again, he supported the coalition because he felt it was important to take that view, but I think he would have been happier being in a position not to have been so strict in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John always liked the National Party. I think he would have probably said that he liked the members of the National Party. He would come down here during question time&mdash;I used to say he would strut down here&mdash;and ask, `Any of you blokes taking note of a question?' Before we could put our 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hands up, he had disappeared back towards his seat. I had a little standing joke with him. I used to say, `Permission to speak, Mr Whip?'&mdash;just like out of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Dad's Army</EMPHASIS>&mdash;but, before I had finished, he would say, `No, you can't have leave.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Political debate requires life's experience, and few people had the experience that John Panizza had and brought to this place. From his extraordinary background, he derived immense tenacity and perseverance. Much has been said today about how proud John Panizza was. I guess he had a lot of things to be proud of, but he was also a uniquely humble man. He certainly could walk with kings and keep the common touch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been said already that John was proud of his Italian heritage, and he was. That extended to all things Italian, including what was going on in modern Italy. He was at the same time a typical Aussie and, as has been said, he loved his cricket and he loved his Aussie Rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was very much proud to be his own man. No-one bullied John Panizza. He took a stand and stuck to it. He was loyal to his friends. He was loyal to his beliefs. He was loyal to his ideals. He was loyal to his religion. John was proud of his farming life. He clearly felt lucky. He clearly felt very fortunate to have been a farmer and to have made his living as a farmer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Panizza, probably in the true traditions of that very famous Western Australian story, had a fortunate life. This parliament and this country have been fortunate to have been served by him. Rest in peace, John Panizza.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza was a committed and decent man who brought to the Senate a perspective that was coloured by his own unique experiences and his ability to listen to his constituency. As a senator and government whip he worked hard to promote the interests of rural industry and regional development and spread the message of his party. From the time he entered the Senate almost 10 years ago Senator Panizza consistently raised the issues of concern to the people he represented. Western Australia has certainly lost a good spokesperson and citizen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="28">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has already been stated, Senator Panizza was proud of his Italian parentage and also proud of the significant contribution made to this nation by migrants. I worked closely with Senator Panizza during his time as deputy opposition whip, and more recently while he served as opposition whip and government whip. I was always struck by his honest and fair approach to the dealings with other parties. He was good humoured and truly interested in ensuring that the Senate, first and foremost, served the interests of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Panizza was a tireless, active and effective advocate for the citizens of rural Western Australia and for the national rural industry. He utilised opportunities in the public domain, in the Senate and in the parliamentary committees, to raise the issues important to him and question those who made them. With his vast knowledge and experience of primary industry, mining and property development, Senator Panizza was able to offer an insight into the way government policy can impact on regional communities. His service as a councillor and shire president over many years showed his commitment to the community was a long&hyphen;term one. He believed that local government played a major role in country areas and had an important impact on the lives of people who live in regional communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But his major political contribution was to be in the federal domain. As he stated in his first speech, he had wanted to be in the Senate since he was 20 years of age. In the Senate, John Panizza was always ensuring that his contribution was relevant and practical. Although we on this side did not always agree with his position, I think that most of us recognised the sincerity of his words and deeds. There are, no doubt, many individual Western Australians who recall meeting Senator Panizza and talking to him about the problems they were facing, or the experiences that they had had. He always gave the perspective of those people with whom he kept in regular contact&mdash;regional mining and farming communities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a personal feeling of grief that I join in speaking to this condolence motion to say farewell to our colleague and close friend John Panizza. When I heard the news of John's sudden death I had a sense of shock and disbelief. Let me say that I still have that sense of disbelief. I will not recount his many achievements in life; I think they have been covered by others. They, of course, were many.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have known John for 10 years, since he first came into this place, and we developed a close bond for two reasons. One was his consummate interest in the mining industry and the other one was a long&hyphen;term friendship that I and my wife have had with his cousin, Mary Panizza, who lives in Brisbane, and her husband, who, curiously, is also John Panizza. The two Johns have both been great achievers on the Australian scene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was a man who could best be described as earthy, in the real sense of the word. He was a man, as so many speakers have said, totally devoted to his family, devoted to his land and his beloved property in the semi&hyphen;arid land of Western Australia, and of course devoted to Australia. He was our whip, a task he carried out in a tough but totally fair way, irrespective, I might say, of one's station in the parliament or relationship with him. Everyone got the same rough treatment. I can well recall the last days of a hectic session when he cancelled pairs on me three times in the final two weeks. It was, however, typical of John's character and his totally egalitarian approach to life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Panizza was a man of many virtues. He had a passion for hard work, rural issues in Western Australia and, of course, as I mentioned, his family. He was a man of the soil in the finest of the old traditions on which our great country was built. What you saw with John was exactly what you got. He was not pretentious, and this we know from his words and actions. From the day he entered this house he showed a great propen 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="29"> sity to work hard and demonstrated pride in our great nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a man who came from modest beginnings, to which he always paid homage. I think every speaker has mentioned the fact that he was a proud son of an Italian migrant and he paid tribute to those who came before him, contributing to the great place Australia has grown to become. He particularly had respect for the men and women who came to work in the outback, those that came, to use his words, to cut sleepers in Queensland, clear bush in the wheat belts of Australia and work in a range of jobs, in the harsh conditions that Australia is known and revered for. Just as his parents worked in the outback to start a new life and give their children an opportunity to make it in this country, so John Panizza strove to provide for his own family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The land of the Southern Cross was a land of opportunity, but he also knew that in life it is what you make of it and what you bring to it which will determine the rewards you will reap. So John set about his task, toiling with his hands in the wheat fields of Western Australia while also devoting his time to his family and the community at large. He was a tireless worker, a successful husband, father, local businessman, shire councillor and, finally, a representative of the nation as a senator in this house; something, as almost every speaker has said, of which he was extraordinarily proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John's great hope was that Australia would be united as one nation, as one people under the same flag which, among other things, carries the emblem of his beloved Southern Cross. John was a great Australian who was proud to have been born at Southern Cross under the Southern Cross. One of John's favourite passions&mdash;and Senator Boswell has referred to this and Senator Campbell may well have also&mdash;which he had in his office, was a blown up photograph of a major thunderstorm over his own property, which he took himself. I always believed, apart from his natural ability with a camera, that it reflected truly John's love of the land and the forces of nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A hard worker all his life, he spent his time in this place not only for the benefit of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people, the party and the state which put him here but also in the hope that the work he did in this place would ensure the Senate was a true house of review and a protector of the states so as to preserve the integrity and security of our nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a personal note, I have lost a good friend whom I greatly admired because of his total commitment and his achievements. This down&hyphen;to&hyphen;earth and, on the surface, gruff individual, who underneath it had a wry sense of humour, was able to take with amusement the ribbing which a few of us had the courage to give him, not many. I recall before the last parliament rose his wife Coral came over here and she tended to do a little bit more after he became the government whip and I said to him, `John, it's the wheat season. Why isn't Coral on the header?' and he replied to me quick as a flash, `Someone has to paint the unit in Canberra.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John will be sadly missed. His departure will be of great loss to the parliament, to Western Australia and to the coalition. They do not come any better than John Panizza, but by far the greater sense of loss will be to his family. I would like to extend to his mother, to Coral and to his four children&mdash;Frank, Janine, Stephen and Linda&mdash;and to other members of the Panizza family on behalf of my wife and me our deepest sympathy on this very sad bereavement.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to pay tribute to Senator John Panizza. Although I have been in this place for only 3&half; years, like many others the first meeting with Senator Panizza made an indelible impression on me, and I am sure it is one that will remain with me for the rest of my life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a great senator. He was a great representative for the state of Western Australia, and many others have mentioned his achievements in that state before he arrived in this place. Certainly this morning when I sat down to look at his maiden speech, which was given on 21 October 1987, there were already indications of the senator that John Panizza would become. I note in the very first paragraph he invites:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="30">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . those senators on the other side of the chamber to feel free to interject.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Surely, something which he was to do a great deal of during the rest of his career. As Senator Knowles has remarked, he felt that a man must show that he can manage his own affairs and preferably risk his own dollar, and the free enterprise tradition was something that he worked very hard at during his entire life. Even though he managed a very successful parliamentary career, he carried on those private enterprise commitments for the rest of his life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He spent most of his life in the town of Southern Cross. As Senator Parer so aptly remarked, in many ways the Southern Cross is the overarching symbol of Australia and it was a very good omen for John that that was where his home was. Although his home was in Southern Cross, his home was also in Western Australia. He was a true representative of Australia, and I think that name probably had a particular meaning for John. At the very end of his first speech, he thanked the members of his family:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . both immediate and extended, for the help and encouragement they gave me to get here.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He says there is much give and take in a large family partnership in order to let each partner achieve his or her ambitions. As many people remarked, although some people would condemn his seemingly outward attitude to his family as patriarchal in the modern politically incorrect sense of the word, no-one was a prouder father, husband or family member than John. You would no sooner arrive in his office, as others have remarked, than you would be shown the picture of his grandchild, of whom he was extremely proud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, I have only known John for the last 3&half; years. At my very first party meeting as a senator, on my first day in the Senate, a vote was taken on a party position and John, as deputy whip, asked me if I would help him count the votes. On my very first day in the Senate I thought it was quite something to be asked to help count the votes, but as I stood next to John as we were looking at the votes John said to me, `Do you know the reason you've been chosen?' and I said, `No.' He said, `It's because you don't 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> know anyone else's handwriting.' So I was immediately cut down to size and shown my true position in the Senate, which was very lowly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Probably my greatest work with John in the sense of acting with him on a committee was on the coalition primary industry committee. Even though John often had to arrive late and leave early because of his whips commitments during the last three years, you would nevertheless know that, when the door opened and Senator Panizza walked in with a beetle&hyphen;brow, immediately the most incisive questions of the whole meeting would be asked and, to his preference, answered. If he did not get the answer he wanted, he would immediately ask more questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Underneath that very gruff exterior was an extremely kind heart, and I have certainly found that during my time in the Senate, although I think we all suffered under leave cancelled, leave withdrawn, leave not given in the first place. It was for the greater good of the party that those things always happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Western Australia has lost a great senator. Australia has lost a great parliamentarian. On behalf of me and my husband, Russell, I would like to pass on our deepest sympathy to Coral and the Panizza family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to join with many of the honourable senators here this afternoon who have extended their deepest sympathy to the Panizza family and record my sadness at the untimely passing of Senator John Panizza. I must say it is a sad occasion when anyone passes, but when it is someone who is clearly in the prime of their political life, serving actively as a whip in this place and doing a good job at it, there is, if you like, a double sense of frustration not only at their passing but that they had a career stretching out before them in which they would have realised more than they have thus far achieved. I think that is true of Senator Panizza. It is not only a sad but also a frustrating occasion when a career is nipped in the bud.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that I did not serve on any of the committees with Senator Panizza. Our paths, despite the fact that we were both from the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="31"> same state, did not cross very often and I never developed any close personal relationship with him. But my constituency is the state of Western Australia; that was his constituency too. You cannot live in that state without knowing how the other senators stand in the public mind and how they conduct themselves both professionally and privately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no compunction at all in saying that I regard Senator Panizza as an outstanding representative of the state of Western Australia. He did not represent the political point of view that I do but, nonetheless, he was respected by all. He was someone who argued strongly on behalf of rural Australia and stood up for the state of Western Australia at every opportunity. He was well known in the sporting community and he has played a role in which he has recognised his somewhat humble beginnings as the son of Italian immigrants. He grew to be a successful farmer in Western Australia without forgetting those roots, passing on and sharing his experiences with the ethnic community in Western Australia as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I knew Senator Panizza, as many here have said of him today, as direct and frank to the point of almost bluntness&mdash;I might say qualities that are all too often lacking in politicians and qualities that we should celebrate. I believe strongly that he was an honest man with great integrity who had that no-frills forthrightness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that on a personal level he and I got off on the wrong foot. It was one of those silly parliamentary things in which he thought I was impugning him. I did not believe I was. I regret that I may have, on that occasion, offended him personally. I never meant to do it, but I never actually settled the score with him either. Now I will not have an opportunity to do so. I pass on to his family my regrets at that loss of opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The two vignettes of Senator Panizza that I recall most warmly were after October 1992 when the West Coast Eagles won the AFL grand final and when the AFL trophy, for the first time ever in the history of Australian Rules football, left the state of Victoria and went to Western Australia. Senator Walsh, as

I never got, I have to say, to my regret, to all of these screenings&mdash;I got to one or two of them&mdash;but Senator Panizza was always there. It seemed to me that Senator Walsh and Senator Panizza had a great deal in common, not only as wheat farmers from the Western Australian wheat belt and not only as football enthusiasts, but as personalities too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I always thought that Walsh was a bit too direct, a bit too blunt and sometimes a bit too searching for some of my colleagues. I often had the impression that the bluntness, directness and forthrightness of Senator Panizza had a similar effect on some of the more doctrinaire members of his own party. It seemed to me that here were two rough diamonds finding commonality of view from a similar heritage and background, but both were well supported, well respected and basically admired by their own parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other vignette I have of him is from when I was a new minister coming on to parliamentary chamber duty. I was told by the advisers in the box, `We have a couple of tax bills that we would like to put through as you come on duty.' I said, `But I don't know anything about them.' They said, `That's all right. The only two people in the chamber that are appearing for the opposition are Senator Shirley Walters and Senator Panizza.' You would say, `Oh, well, this will be an easy run.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone who knows those senators knows what would happen at the end of your duty. You would get an hour into it and some other innocent minister would come trundling along. By this time you would have an idea about what the bills were about and you would have to say to them, `Look, just leave it with me, will you. There is no point in you 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="32"> trying to pick up something on the fly like this.' You would have John Panizza and Shirley Walters on the other side, asking questions. Sometimes you would be struggling to try to understand what the bill was about and what the point of the question was and wondering what the hidden trick in it was. This would go on forever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think no-one in the then opposition, now government, would appreciate the impact Senator Panizza had on the minds of the Hawke-Keating government whenever he was in the chamber, particularly in the committee stages of a bill, because you had to be damn sure that you knew everything about what that legislation contained because you were going to be asked questions on all of it. If you did not give the right answer, the issue would be persisted in until you either felt foolish or you discovered the truth.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just want to say how much I admired and respected John Panizza as a person and as a parliamentary colleague. He showed throughout his life that hard work, determination, courage, the ability to speak and act frankly and the will to succeed will bring its rewards, regardless of one's background or origin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Panizza, as has been said many times today, did not come from a privileged background. Quite the contrary. He was in fact the quintessential self&hyphen;made man. He succeeded wonderfully in farming, in other business interests, in rural organisations, in local government and other community involvements and, of course, since 1987, in federal politics. In doing so, he never lost touch with his roots, with his origins, with the primacy that he attached to his family and with his basic human values.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John's achievements in Canberra were significant, although I guess to many people he was not as well known outside his state as he might have been. He worked very hard and effectively on behalf of Western Australia, particularly his farming and mining constituency. His voice was frequently heard in the party room and in coalition and parliamentary committees, as well as in this chamber. As we can all attest, once in full flight, John's voice and mannerisms were wonders to hear and to behold as he laid about him with passion and vigour, but never in a vindictive or spiteful way. I do not think John Panizza had a vindictive bone in his body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was always totally loyal to and supportive of his colleagues in this chamber and elsewhere. I remember with very deep gratitude that when I was under heavy personal attack in this place late last year, John Panizza was one of the first to defend me&mdash;and very stoutly. I might say that I am not sure that his contribution was as helpful as it might have been, but it was certainly from the heart and it was forged in loyalty. That was typical of his approach with all his colleagues. The fact that senators from all sides of politics today are speaking from the heart about John Panizza is eloquent testimony to the admiration and affection in which he was held by us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, may I say to the Italo&hyphen;Australian community how much we will miss your compatriot. John Panizza was intensely and rightly proud of his Italian background. His parents, particularly his mother, had been in Australia for only a short time before John was born. He was, as has been said, the first person of Italian parentage to be elected to the Senate. Throughout his life he remained deeply committed to his Italian origins whilst at the same time being fiercely, totally and proudly Australian. Might I say that that is a pretty great combination to have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To his wife, Coral, and to all his family, I join other senators in saying that we will miss John Panizza very much indeed. We give thanks for the privilege of having known him and we hope&mdash;I say this to his family&mdash;that the sentiments being expressed today in this chamber will at least in small measure ease

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to add my thoughts to the condolence motion before the chamber today for the late Senator John Panizza. I first met John on new boys' and girls' day in 1987. I think Senator Calvert, Senator Panizza and I were sharing that feeling that Senator Ferguson had of absolute confusion. When Senator Coonan first came in she described it to me as feeling like everyone was on the football field while you were still trying to struggle into your socks and boots; the game was on and you were not quite sure what was happening. For a tyro senator, a new senator, there is that feeling of bewilderment, when the action is happening and you have to catch up with it all. I remember from the very beginning often talking with John about those feelings of sometimes overwhelming inadequacy when you first come in. There was also that feeling of great pride in representing your state, especially for John in representing the state of Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John hated pretension. I think people have said that a number of times. There is a story that I have dined out on at dinner parties that I will not share with the Senate; it was a perfect example of his absolute distaste for pretension. My colleagues who know the story are laughing. It was an example of John not only rejecting the things of the world in the sense of worldly possessions and the status those might give him. He also rejected that in others. I think that was a sign of the fact that John was a simple person in the real sense of the word `simple'. He valued the simple things of life&mdash;the elements and the fact that you could not control them. He valued the land. He valued his family. He valued nature and the beauty that he captured with photography. He valued the things that money could not buy. Of all people, I think John was an example of the fact that those things are very important and that money is not important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to disagree with every colleague on this side of the chamber when they say they found difficulty in getting John to grant leave. I never found difficulty in getting John to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> grant me leave. That may say something about my friendship with John, or it may say that I do not ask for leave very often. I remember going to him when I wanted to go to the Antarctic just before Christmas. At that stage it meant having two weeks leave. I did go with a little fear and trepidation because I had heard stories about other people going and asking for leave. When I asked John, I said, `It will require two weeks leave.' He said, `Sure, I can fix that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It transpired that not only did he want to own a Harley Davidson but also, from his early years&mdash;I think when he was 20&mdash;he wanted to go to the Antarctic. That was something else I did not know about John. He had apparently approached his father saying that he would like to do this. I think his father's response was, `If you come back after a year in the Antarctic, do not expect to come back onto the farm.' John had never fulfilled that wish. He said to me that he hoped that he would be able to do that at some stage. Obviously I have a sadness that he did not experience the wonder and beauty that Senator Knowles and I, along with other colleagues, experienced on that recent trip. I know that he would have had much better skills and more success than I had in capturing that beauty through photography. I am grateful I had that opportunity. It is something that I know John really wanted to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was a man of action, as people here have said. He also brought to this Senate something of an individual nature that does not often come in this day and age of politics. Milk has become homogenised and pasteurised and everything else, and I think the Senate and the parliament has become a bit homogenised. We do not get those characters being thrown up like we used to in the days of old. I think we would have to say that John was a character. The fact that so many people have spoken today and the fact that so many people have coalesced in what they have said about him indicates that he was a character.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was saddened and shocked to hear about John's death on Friday. All of us would wish to have a peaceful death&mdash;it is not given to all of us&mdash;but his was untimely. He was still a man of action, a man with a lot of things 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="34"> left to do. It seems hard to understand why he would have been taken from us so early. It must be very difficult for his family to accept that, too, but they ought to take great comfort in the knowledge that he served his community well; he served it with honesty and he served at different levels, at local government and the federal level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned that he served with honesty and I have to say that he gave me some advice&mdash;many of us received financial advice from John. He was always agitating to me that I should buy somewhere to live here in Canberra, rather than rent. When I decided last year that I was going to buy a property, I was having a bit of difficulty negotiating with the real estate agent and he said he would go and do the deal for me. I wish I had let him because I am sure he would have got it for less, just as he sold the Torana for more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had a discussion with him about arrangement of finances and he said to me at one point when I discussed some advice that I had been given, `Kay, that would be above board, but it wouldn't be cricket and I wouldn't arrange my finances in that way.' So I threw that advice out the window. I think that shows something about John's honest approach and the way he undertook his dealings&mdash;and I took his advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, John hated pretension. He had a great sense of humour and he could laugh at himself. We often took the mickey out of him especially about the fact that he would eat only steak or lasagne when we wanted to go out to other restaurants. We used to often joke with him&mdash;and people have talked about the fact that he had a wry sense of humour. Someone who can take a joke against himself has a special sort of sense of humour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today, people have talked about the fierce commitment John had about the things in which he believed and the fact that he didn't waiver in those beliefs, and other people have talked about the fact that he did not beat about the bush. He was a direct and decent human being. He was a strong man but that strength was tempered with a softness which was obvious in his love for his family and his concern for his colleagues and friends. I must say that the parliament has lost a contributor 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and a character; his family have lost a loving son, husband and father; and we have lost a friend and colleague. I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife, Coral; his mother, Caterina; his four children, Frank, Janine, Stephen and Linda; and his extended family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support the statements of others and associate myself with the condolence motion. I think John Panizza's contribution in local government, in farming and in the Senate have been well described. I was in the hotel in Cairns when Senator Coonan rang me, giving me the shocking news of his death. I would like, with my other colleagues on the Privileges Committee, to thank Senator Coonan, Senator Ellison, Senator O'Chee and Anne Lynch for the assistance they rendered to his family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My mind went back, as I lay there in the hotel, to the last session of parliament when, after a meeting of the economics committee&mdash;you will recall that last year we had an inquiry into the outworking industry&mdash;where we had heard about a lot of pretty bad things going on, John belted me on the shoulder as we left and said, `Well, I have learnt something about your workers.' As I lay in the motel in Cairns I thought that I should have said to John&mdash;and I regretted that I had not&mdash;`I am indebted to you, John Panizza, for your knowledge of farming that I have learnt from, and for the constant reminders to city slickers like me of what the problems of isolated people are, particularly in that vast state of Western Australia.' As Senator Alan Ferguson said, John's voice on the committees we have been on with him has always been to make sure that we easterners do not forget the state of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thank John for the insights I have had from him on all those issues about rural problems in this country. You do learn from people on both sides of the chamber in this parliament. You could not have two more different types of people: I am your leftie trade union official and John has been well described by everybody who has spoken&mdash;it is a comprehensive description&mdash;as a farmer and a natural leader of people. Yet time after time in committee work in this Senate I have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="35"> found that I have been able to reach agreement with John Panizza. Indeed, to be successful one had to reach agreement with him because he was not a slob and he was not soft. He had actually thought through his position on most things. That is a compliment you cannot pay to a lot of people in politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a characteristic of John that has not been mentioned yet. It strikes me that everybody has said everything but that John Panizza was a very intelligent man. We have said almost that but we have not said that he was also an emotionally intelligent man. Those people who are up with the current discussion on intelligence will understand what I mean when I say he was an extremely emotionally intelligent person. He was a stubborn person, yes, but very fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lest my endorsement worry people, I should also point out that we all know that, in the partisan struggle in the chamber or where the party line was on the line, he was just as firm as I hope I have always been when the chips are down. Nevertheless, if you are inducting yet another MA or PhD student to work out what politics is all about or how the parliamentary system works&mdash;and they are coming to us all the time&mdash;surely the best epitaph we could give to John would be to show that student this tribute to John as an example of what you require in a member of parliament or a senator and, of course, to show what he achieved in practice in such a comprehensive way, impacting on our country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was going to go into some detail to describe some of the things that he did on various committees, but Senator Alan Ferguson has sufficiently indicated that. I want to conclude by saying that I will certainly miss the jousting that we engaged in and I would like to pass on my condolences to the members of his family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME><STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.01 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed a  mark of respect for a truly great man that so many of us on all sides of politics today have chosen to put on the public record our respect for John and some shared experiences with John, whether it be through family connections, politics, sport, investments, rural issues, mining, local 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government, idiosyncrasies&mdash;so the list goes on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like all others, I was extremely shocked and saddened at the death of John Panizza; we have indeed lost a great friend and colleague. As well as sharing the burden of the plight of rural and regional Australians, John and I had a common interest in taxation matters. I came to have a very profound respect for his knowledge and judgment in this area although he was never a practising accountant. He, like me, had a genuine concern for the way in which government taxation measures affect ordinary Australians, and I always admired his opinions in this field, particularly knowing that they were based on sound judgment and close and contemporary contact with his constituents. One of his sons, of whom he was immensely proud, was an accountant in Perth. He also provided an invaluable avenue for John to keep in touch with people, particularly in relation to taxation issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> So that some of the issues that John raised in tax do not get forgotten, I will raise but three of them&mdash;there were literally hundreds over the years. Firstly, in 1988 he predicted that many primary industries and small business people would suffer due to the changes in the deductibility of prepaid lease expenses and that they could well be faced with bankruptcy. He claimed that these businesses would not be able to claim their full upfront rental or lease costs in the first year. That observation, and so many of the observations that John made, was for those in the rural sector who were involved in legitimate leasing arrangements such as farming, transport, earth moving and mining for whom he had special concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the budget in the following year he drew attention to the way in which the budget surplus had been calculated. This surplus had been derived from taxation secured from salary and wage earners through bracket creep and via fast forwarding of company taxes. He pointed out that this revenue for the year 1990&hyphen;91 had been brought into the Treasurer's calculation and that the Treasurer had delayed the true recording in government books so 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="36"> that it could be included in his second surplus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, John was a consistent proponent of simplifying the taxation system. He said that there was a desperate need to simplify the taxation system, which was beyond a workable comprehension by sections of the small business community. If we really wish to honour the memory of John Panizza, I suggest that all of us, each in our own way, should expedite the reform of the taxation system&mdash;more than by a mere rewriting of the taxation act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although he spent much of his time in Canberra or in travelling between that distant state of Western Australia and Canberra since his election to the Senate in 1987, John kept strong links with his community and had a very strong community consciousness. He was one of a diminishing line of independently minded self&hyphen;made business people to enter this parliament. Despite being outspoken on issues of concern, John was, as we have all said, unerringly loyal, and for those attributes he was very highly respected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His capacity for hard work was nurtured early in life. As the son of Italian migrants he knew what it was to make sacrifices and to toil incessantly. We heard very little from his lips about that hard work in oppressive heat in those early years. He was to be rewarded for those labours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His father had set him a fine example. Arriving penniless in 1921, his father was one of many migrants whose first taste of Australia was in underground mines, firstly Broken Hill and then Mount Isa. With his savings he, together with his two brothers&mdash;John Panizza's uncles&mdash;was able to buy a farm in Western Australia which was to become one of Australia's largest producers of wheat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was proud of his Italian heritage and of the contribution Italian newcomers have made to Australian development. In fact, it was he who confronted the Hobart branch of the RSL over their refusal to allow a group of former Alpini Association soldiers to participate in an Anzac Day march in 1988. He pointed out that his father had served in the Alpini division and that it was a highly respected and distinguished division based in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the far north of Italy during World War I when Italy was a member of the allies. He explained that many sons of those Alpini soldiers of World War I had fought and died with the Australian forces in World War II.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Panizza was a self&hyphen;made man. As others have said, he believed that one's ability to manage one's own affairs should be demonstrated before seeking a parliamentary position where one has the awesome responsibility to manage the nation's finances. He believed in practising the art of, and learning to succeed in, taking risks with one's own resources before becoming responsible for those of other people. For him this meant taking on the challenges of a primary producer, harnessing the natural, human and economic forces in order to gain optimum benefit. His success in agriculture was well known before he entered politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his maiden speech, he indicated that his interest in the Senate was first inspired by studies in Latin at his alma mater, Perth's Aquinas College. It was here that he became fascinated with the role of the senators of early Rome. He maintained his association with the Christian Brothers throughout his life, and defended them at all times. The values that he learnt from them had an everlasting influence on him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join with my colleagues in expressing my deepest sympathy to his wife, Coral, and to other members of his family. The rural people of Western Australia particularly will miss his energetic and reliable representation, and I myself will miss a friend, as we all do in this Senate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is sad indeed that we stand in this place today to mourn the passing of a colleague. It gets to those of us who come from the state from which the colleague came&mdash;it hits us that much harder. The grief 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="37"> of the Panizza family is shared not only by them but also by his colleagues on this side of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even though one would have thought, after so many contributions, that it had all been said&mdash;I do not believe it has&mdash;I want to say on the record now that John Panizza was a very generous man. He would appreciate me putting his generosity on the public record after his passing. Indeed, he was very pleased at one point last year that I did not take up his interjection in the chamber when he offered to pay for another Western Australian colleague of mine&mdash;Senator Christabel Chamarette&mdash;to have a holiday in the Pacific, or somewhere else, using his Amex card. He did express his appreciation to me that I did not do something to pick up that interjection to get it on the record. From time to time John was prone to leap in, open his mouth, make commitments and then have to live with the consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been made of John's contribution as a politician, as a parent and as a farmer. I found his intervention on one particular issue to be very noteworthy, even though he did get criticised for that intervention. The abuse of children in Catholic institutions is something that is shameful within the Catholic church. Many individuals through Australia, those in public life and in other places, have spoken out against it and have sought to bring justice to the victims. John was one of the very few elected politicians who entered into that debate and who, because he did not go as far as some people wanted, got some criticism. I defended John because I felt his intervention brought more benefit, in order to bring about justice for the individuals, than that of many of the more strident critics had done. He had some knowledge of the issue and I said, because of the standing he had within the Catholic church and the fact that he was prepared to speak out and call for justice for the individuals, that he ought to have been commended and supported. Indeed, he ought to have been applauded for his intervention. I believe now that his intervention did pay dividends for the individuals, although I do not believe 100 per cent justice has been given to the victims at this time.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Much has been said about his many interventions in this place and the fact that he rose to speak on many occasions when he had not meant to speak. Indeed, one of the earlier contributors to the debate made the point that he would not understand the term `pick up the ball and run with it'. I would dispute that with Senator Robert Ray, who I believe made that comment. On many occasions on a Saturday morning back in Perth while listening to an ABC radio program called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sports Talk</EMPHASIS> with George Grljusich one would hear the interventions of Senator Panizza, who would come in to offer advice on Australian Rules football games which he had attended in the past. He remembered the various moves and was able to assist the debate on that radio show. I am sure that not only will his family be saddened by his loss and miss him dearly but his staff&mdash;I notice Carolyn and Claire in the chamber and I would also include his Perth electorate office staff&mdash;will miss him dearly too. Also, there are many avid listeners to that show on Saturday morning on 6WF in Perth who will miss John Panizza's contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to conclude by mentioning when I first met John Panizza. I was a very new senator elected to represent Western Australia in parliament. I was actually very pleased to get my very first invitation to attend one of those meetings that Senator Winston Crane so graphically painted a picture of in his contribution earlier. I was very pleased to get the invitation but I was also very worried about going over to an area of Western Australia which is somewhat tiger country for Labor Party politicians. Notwithstanding the fact that people like Peter Walsh&mdash;and indeed, the Walsh family&mdash;come from that region, it is not a region where we attract 50 per cent of the votes. I was happy to go, but I went with some trepidation. I actually received quite a good reception for my contribution to the debate, because on that occasion the knives were not out for the Labor Party or for the Labor Party government; the knives were out for the Western Australia Farmers Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The president of the WAFF on that occasion was the now Senator Winston Crane. I did not have to leave town very quickly after 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="38"> the meeting. It was a very large and uncomfortable meeting. After sitting late on the Thursday night in Canberra, flying out on the first plane out of here on the Friday morning and then getting a charter over to Merredin, I had the fortune of getting my photograph taken. Unfortunately, the representatives of the Western Australia Farmers Federation had already left. They had gone back down south and I got my picture taken with one John Panizza.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who had invited me to the meeting were actually very pleased with this and felt that it was a victory for the meeting because as the Labor Party in government we had actually been able to align ourselves with a family that was not necessarily associated with the Labor government. Indeed, for me to get a photograph taken with John Panizza and for it to be published was something of merit. In his time here in the chamber John used to joke with me from time to time about the fact that he had his photograph taken with me and that it was an honour for him. It was something that we lived with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been very fortunate to have served in the parliament of Australia with the son of a migrant. His contribution helped me in turn to understand the needs of migrants from a different perspective from that which I experienced for myself. He has made a contribution to Western Australia and to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think his children and his grandchild&mdash;something that I empathise with&mdash;and future grandchildren will be very proud that they bear the name of Panizza and have had an association with John Panizza.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having come to this place only relatively recently I cannot speak with the same authenticity as my colleagues about longstanding friendships, wonderful stories and sincere regard they have for Senator John Panizza.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember that shortly after I arrived I was slightly disconcerted on one occasion when I came into the chamber. I think it was Senator Faulkner who was on his feet saying in a rhetorical vein, `Where are all these coalition women? Where are they? Why aren't they speaking on this topic?' I knew Senator 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Panizza knew I was in the chamber because he pointed over to me and said, `There she is. There's one of them.' I found myself responding unexpectedly when I had come in to get a pen or something like that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I can speak about that is unique and authentic, I believe, is the extraordinary courage and dignity shown by Senator Panizza's wife, Coral, at the time of his death. So, Coral, this is for you. The reason I can speak of this is that I was there very soon after Senator Panizza died. In the remaining hours of that fateful morning and during much of the next day I was able to observe what a remarkable woman Coral Panizza is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just after 2 a.m. on 31 January 1997 I received an emergency telephone call from the receptionist of the hotel in Cairns where we were due to sit for the hearing of the Privileges Committee the following morning. She asked me to come urgently to the Panizzas' hotel room, having told me that my colleague Senator Panizza had just passed away and that Mrs Panizza was in need of some assistance. I went immediately of course and found Coral Panizza with paramedics. She was disbelieving and distraught that all efforts to revive her husband had failed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we sat through those early hours of the morning, I was able to gain some insight into what an accomplished woman Coral is. With composure under those dreadful circumstances, she made those telephone calls to Western Australia to tell each of her four children the tragic news. Interspersed with formalities, we talked through the long history of her marriage to John, her pride in her children and her delight in her granddaughter, Emily. Coral's 39 years of marriage to John produced a strong and enduring partnership, as we have attested to this afternoon. It was one that was able to withstand the long absences and rigours imposed by one partner being in political office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I gleaned something of Coral's strength as a woman who has spent a lot of her time on the land. I recognise that strength. It is in so many women of the land as they battle for their families and a way of life that has become an Australian tradition and a tradition that John Panizza valued so highly.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="39">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I felt very privileged, I must say, to be with Coral in this most intense and poignant moment. I felt privileged to be given some understanding of the bonds between John and Coral Panizza. Coral has lost her husband and friend of 39 years, and the loss must be unbearable for her, as indeed John is so sadly missed by all of us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As she said to me&mdash;and this is a quote: `Few men die having achieved what they wanted to achieve and loved every minute of it.' She really relished saying that John had loved every minute of it. John Panizza was such a man&mdash;a man who had achieved what he wanted to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My tribute to John this afternoon is a tribute to his wonderful wife. I know that the Deputy Clerk, Anne Lynch, would wish to be associated with these remarks because she kept the vigil too through that night. The following day, Senator Ellison and Senator O'Chee brought their energy and compassion to bear in myriad arrangements that had to be made. I also would like to record my gratitude to Senators Ray, Childs and Cooney for their immediate cooperation and understanding. That cooperation was unstinting and freely given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coral, I will never forget those hours together on 31 January 1997. My thoughts and prayers are with you and with your family&mdash;that you have the strength to celebrate the life of this good man, as we celebrate the life and service of this distinguished Australian.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say I was knocked over last Friday morning when Paul Calvert told us of John Panizza's death. We were at the rail inquiry in Launceston. I wanted to speak this afternoon because I regarded John Panizza as a remarkable person and as a friend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were two major influences in his life, and I want to talk about my own personal connection with him. One point of real contact between us is that most of my relations on my mother's side live in Ingham in North Queensland and have married Italians, because it is almost completely an Italian town. John also had relatives in Ingham and he visited there on a number of occasions. So we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> compared notes to see whether or not we might be related by marriage, but could never make a connection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another connection we had is that my father also worked in Mount Isa Mines in the early days and around the same time as John Panizza's father. Another occasion which underlined his Italianness was in his answer to my comment to him one day, `Of course you'd be a monarchist.' You can imagine the strength of his reply when he let me know that he was a republican, being an Italian. His Italian Catholic background also came out on another occasion one day when he had been giving Cheryl Kernot a hiding. Afterwards I met him and said, `You've never picked on me, John.' He said, `Oh, no, you're a priest.' I assured him that my former role should not inhibit him in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As well as his Italian background, John, as everyone has said, was from the bush, was independent, self-made and, I thought, sometimes solitary. I remember on one occasion at a dinner in the Great Hall that he seemed to be on his own. I was with my daughter and we invited him to sit with us, and I was very taken that he spent a couple of hours talking seriously with my daughter about the things she was interested in. I wondered then about the rough, tough exterior which he so often presented. On another occasion my wife and I spent the day, when I was driving my car, with John Panizza on an inquiry into Eastlink and my wife was really taken with his personality and his courtesy. He was an interesting man.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Boswell referred to the fact that John had left the National Party and joined the Liberal Party. He also told me one day about some of the reasons for that, and I am certainly not going to dwell on those today. But on one occasion John did lobby me because I was on the rural and regional affairs committee and he wanted to set up an inquiry into the Australian Wheat Board. I cannot remember the details but I thought I had better check with Senator Boswell, which I did. When I talked to Ron about it, he exploded and said, `Don't you listen to that Panizza. He's representing the Western Australian farmers. The Queensland wheat 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="40"> farmers will never forgive you.' So, you see, on some occasions the Senate does work as a states house. My wife, Marie, and daughter, Lesley, I am sure would join with me in offering our condolences to his family on this very sad occasion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join other senators in paying tribute to John Panizza. I had great respect for John Panizza, and he was a man of great sincerity and great integrity. He was, as Senator Woodley has just revealed, a man who believed we should have an Australian institution for our head of state. I respect him not only for that but also because John, more importantly, was a hard working senator who well represented the people of Western Australia and his particular constituents&mdash;agriculture, the ethnic community and local government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As has been said, the Panizza family history is that of a classic migrant success story. John's father and family came to Australia as poor Italian migrants who worked hard and during the Depression purchased large wheat farms around the town of Southern Cross to which were added over the years properties in Waroona and in Geraldton so that the Panizza family today is one of the largest landowners in Western Australia and, it seems, one of the largest wheat growing farmers in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In keeping with the tradition of migrant families, John's children have gone on to university and the professions. Like all Italian families, the Panizza family was very close and their family ties were very strong. John had great respect and love for his wife, Coral, and he was very proud of his children and their achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I first met John in 1987 in the Senate preselection of that year to replace Reg Withers. I had been a WA state vice-president for four years at that time and stood for preselection. However, there was a rural crisis on and as I rang around the state I kept hearing the then unfamiliar name of John Panizza, who I was told was a major wheat farmer and president of the shire of Yilgarn at Southern Cross. In the event, John Panizza was placed No. 3 on the ticket and I was No. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 4. That order was reconfirmed when the preselection was re&hyphen;run for the double dissolution of that year and, as they say, the rest is history. John Panizza came into the Senate while I went into local government for the next eight or nine years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As I said in my introduction, John represented WA farming and rural interests and did so very well. He also took something of an interest in the north of Western Australia and the members of the Liberal Party in the Pilbara and Kimberley always felt that he was someone they could turn to when concerned about federal issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Local government was another particular interest of John's, his having spent 12 years in the shire of Yilgarn and as shire president for much of that time. When I was in local government as mayor of Port Hedland, John Panizza was always regarded as the senator to turn to when there was a federal dimension to a local government issue. I must say that John always told me he thought local government was excellent training and background for a parliamentary career.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other great constituency he represented in Western Australia was the ethnic community. He represented not only the Italian community but the ethnic community in general in Western Australia. As with Senator Crane, I had the experience of being taken around many of the ethnic clubs in Perth and, in the end, left to fend for myself. John Panizza, in representing the ethnic community, played a very valuable role in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to tell a little story. I have a friend called Norman Marinovich, whom I am sure Senator Evans knows, who is a physician at Fremantle hospital and a leader in the Slav community in the Fremantle area. He has also been a player in the ALP in the Fremantle area. At the time of Senator Panizza's endorsement, Norman Marinovich said that he greatly admired the Liberal Party for endorsing Senator Panizza because all ethnic people in Western Australia would relate to him. He thought that the Liberal Party had been very clever in endorsing somebody who was held in such high regard throughout the ethnic community of Western Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="41">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I remember most about John Panizza is his wry smile as he told me some story about something that was going on either in the Western Australian Liberal Party or in Western Australia in general. Like Senator Harradine, I was always struck by his often perceptive assessment of events. In fact, I would have to say that John Panizza was what he was: an Italian farmer. All those who have ever read Don Camillo books will understand what that implies in terms of humour, intelligence, commitment to the Catholic Church and political skills honed in village politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Panizza, as I said at the beginning, was a very sincere man. He was a great family man. I have great respect for John Panizza. His passing is a sad loss to the Senate and to the state of Western Australia. I join all my colleagues in extending my condolences to the Panizza family.</PARA></SPEECH>

Primarily, he was an advocate for the interests of remote Australians, rural Australians, and primary industry. When I was primary industry minister, John was a regular and welcome visitor to my office. On a number of occasions, he brought delegations of people who wanted to see me about this,

I substantially agreed with the position that John Panizza took on most of the matters connected with primary industry in Australia. If he were alive today to tell you, he would tell that you most of his concerns were satisfied in terms of those visits to my office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a man that I had absolute respect for. I very rarely speak on condolence motions in this House. I prayerfully hope&mdash;and I have said it this on more than one occasion&mdash;that nobody speaks on mine. I would be pathetically grateful if nobody spoke on my condolence motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But John Panizza is one of the members of this parliament that nobody has to tell any lies about in condolence motions. The John Panizza I knew was a man with a complete absence of malice. That is not common in this business. We would all like to claim that we are not malicious people. In his role here in the Senate, and I knew him for the whole of the 10 years he was here, he was not malicious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like a number of people on this side of the Senate, I do not think I would be taking a liberty in saying that I regarded John Panizza as a friend. He certainly was to me. We never had a cross word in the whole 10 years that he was in here. We did have a lot of funny ones. Everyone shared a number, and rightly, of John Panizza's stories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Being an Irishman myself, there is nothing I love more than a wake. Death comes to us all. Wakes are important and reminiscences about the positive things in people's lives are extremely important after their death. I recognised most of the stories that I heard told today about John Panizza. I am pathetically grateful also that many of the stories I know were not told today in debate about John 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Panizza because there are some even funnier ones that you could not tell in here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I belong to that little group of people on both sides of the chamber who regularly gathered, when parliament sat, in the airport lounge at Adelaide airport. Senator Hill was one of those before he reached the dizzy heights of being the Minister for the Environment. We do not see him often these days now he is in the land of the VIPs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The regular track for me was Darwin&hyphen;Adelaide and then Adelaide&hyphen;Canberra. In Adelaide we picked up the Perth&hyphen;Adelaide&hyphen;Canberra flight. Before the schedules were changed just recently, there was often an hour or more at Adelaide airport, and I looked forward to meeting John, Senator Crane and various others who would gather in the airport and swap stories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never forgotten, and never will forget, that on one of those occasions John said to me&mdash;and I am sure Senator Abetz will not mind if I tell this story&mdash;`Mate, have you met this new Liberal senator from Tasmania.' I said, `No, I haven't, John.' He said, `I just met him the other day.' I said, `Oh.' He said, `I thought he was a sheila, but he turned out to be a bloke.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John, of course, was from that generation of Australians that still used words like that. I actually haven't heard anyone use the word `sheila' for a lot of years. John was not politically correct at all. I said, `What do you mean?' He was genuinely amazed at this. He said, `I was told this new senator was called Erica Betz.' He was expecting to meet this Senator Betz, whose first name was Erica. Instead of that he met Senator Eric Abetz from Tasmania.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just on a personal note&mdash;and this has been mentioned by a number of people&mdash;I also want to say that I was off on another Senate committee when I got news last week of his death and was shocked and saddened by it. It was funny&mdash;I was talking to other senators afterwards: you had a real colleague feeling. Here I was in one part of Australia on a Senate committee and another senator, a friend of us all, had actually died somewhere else in Australia on Senate business. As a remote Australian, I was really distressed a lot. I rang my wife immediately from Alice Springs, where I was on the way back to Darwin, because she had met John, and said `Isn't it awful and very sad that he has died so far away from his family on the other side of Australia. It must be extraordinarily distressing for them.' I must say it was of some comfort to me, as others have mentioned, to find out afterwards that his wife had been with him when that happened. I am sure that is of great comfort to the family.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon a number of our colleagues have spoken in detail about the farming and political career of our late colleague, John Panizza. They have also given their insights into John through relating their own personal experiences with him. I simply want to associate myself with those comments that have been made and record my own admiration for the achievements of John 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which have been detailed by so many this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I first met John Panizza after we were both elected to the Senate in 1987. It wasn't long after that that we both began serving together on what was then the Senate transport, communications and infrastructure committee. We both during that period shared a passionate interest in rural issues relating to the responsibilities of that committee and the work of that committee. Subsequently, that committee became the Senate industry, science and technology committee and, more recently, the Senate economics committee. Senator Panizza and I both continued as members of each of those committees and so worked closely together on a number of inquiries and issues before them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess our other formal association was through his job as deputy opposition whip, opposition whip and, over the last almost 12 months, that of government whip. As has been already said, he certainly applied a very firm hand as the whip and was sometimes quite blunt and gruff in his manner in fulfilling those responsibilities. This may well be a characteristic that is required of all whips because I seem to recall, during my days in the House of Representatives, that the then government whip, John Bouchier, exhibited similar characteristics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair to say that underneath all of that gruff exterior&mdash;and I think Senator Evans mentioned this earlier&mdash;there really was softie. Certainly, if you had a legitimate pressing reason for which leave might be granted from this place, then John would certainly do his level best to negotiate&mdash;particularly recently with Senator Evans as the opposition whip&mdash;to try and get, if necessary, an extension of the pairings to provide that leave for you. On occasions it was not possible, but certainly he would do his level best to achieve that for anyone who had a genuine need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the more informal, personal aspects of our relationships with John are probably what each of us remembers. A number of those have been commented on this afternoon, and that is what I briefly want to mention, before 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="44"> concluding in support of this condolence motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John and I often discussed football, cricket and farming. Or perhaps it is more accurate to say, we jocularly argued about the first two, particularly in comparing the form and merits of the Adelaide Crows as against the West Coast Eagles and, more latterly, the Fremantle Dockers. Similarly, we would regularly compare the form and fortunes of the South Australian and Western Australian Sheffield Shield cricket teams, as they performed throughout each succeeding season. It is in this regard that my wife, Sally, remembers with particular fondness a call that she took from John during the Sheffield Shield final at Adelaide Oval last year, when John was chasing me up on a matter. I was not at the phone at the time, and instead of me, he got Sally.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CRANE" NAMEID="UW4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You were at the cricket.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was actually at the cricket. Yes, I have got to admit that, Senator Crane. I was down there, watching those last precious hours of the Sheffield Shield final. John chortled to Sally about what he regarded as the virtually unstoppable imminent success of the Western Australian cricket team in yet again winning the Sheffield Shield. At that time, late in the afternoon, as I am sure Western Australian and South Australian colleagues at least will remember, South Australia was in a very parlous situation, with not many wickets left and still quite a long time to play. However, Sally said to John, `John, the fat lady hasn't sung yet.' John retorted, `It won't be long before she does.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the event, history records that South Australia's last two batsmen batted for a considerable length of time, ensuring a draw. As a result of that, South Australia&mdash;being at the top of the table&mdash;won the Sheffield Shield. Later that night, returning John's call, I was able to tell him that, indeed, the fat lady did not sing. John replied, quite ruefully, `No, she didn't sing, but wait until next year.' On several occasions over the last eight or nine months, I have been able to remind John of that and tease him about that occasion, and he has always taken it in good humour. This story, like the stories that other senators have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> related this afternoon, shows again the personal relationships which each of us, in different ways, were able to develop with John Panizza.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a great shock to me on Friday morning to hear of his death. I was very sad to hear it, because we have lost a hardworking expert on rural matters, and a person who really was one of the real characters of the Senate. In the federal parliamentary sphere, it seems that the number of real characters diminishes as the years go by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will certainly miss him greatly. I will miss his friendship, I will miss our association, and I offer my sympathy to Coral, his children and his wider family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Youngish. He was someone who represented the Liberal Party; I represented the Labor Party. He came from a rural area; I came from the urban fringe. Despite these differences, John was often able to seek out areas where there was contact, and to recognise the similarities that brought us together, rather than always concentrating on those things that drew us apart. I was never on a committee with John, and the major part of our contact was probably in this chamber and in the corridors. But, as people have emphasised, it seems that members of the coalition saw a gruffer side of John than maybe even we did here in the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is amusing in itself because I saw John as being a particularly sensitive person. He often saw things from the other side that maybe those who were superficially closer did not see. I remember early on in my time here, one of the coalition members who I was less fond of&mdash;he has now left&mdash;was making a fairly substantial issue about my husband. It 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="45"> had been quite a difficult week: I think he had raised it two or three times, and it is often very difficult to respond in those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At one point, John Panizza wandered over to me and said, `I have just been reading a book about the history of Italian families in my local area, and I have seen that there is a family called Della Bosca&mdash;would you like to read the book?' He dutifully passed it over, and I took it home to John. He found out that it included the history of a branch of the Della Bosca family that had feuded with the branch of the Della Bosca family in New South Wales&mdash;as Italian communities and brothers are wont to do&mdash;and had headed off to the opposite end of Australia. It was interesting that John Panizza saw the opportunity to come over and make some human contact, ignoring the greater differences that were involved because of our different political positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subsequently&mdash;over this break&mdash;I have discovered that John Panizza's family came from Lombardia, the same area in northern Italy that my husband's family came from. We only discovered that in the last few weeks. It was something I was going to tell him when we came back, but obviously the opportunity has not come about because of what, unfortunately, has happened.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had a lot of regard for John for two parts of his nature. One that has been mentioned before was his honesty&mdash;not just honesty about what he said, but honesty about himself, about what he represented and what he was. He certainly never tried to pretend that he was anything but who he was. He was proud of that. He was proud of himself, of his family and of the life he had built for himself. I suppose that that sort of pride is based on the fact that you have a set of principles, and you have managed to abide by them. I think that is a very good sort of pride.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, despite politics and how cynical it can make you, he still retained the capacity to show concern for other people in that sort of very fundamental way. I do take great pleasure in sharing in this condolence debate, though I obviously take no pleasure at all in what has brought the debate on. I do share in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="46"> a very real way the difficult time that his wife Coral, his four children, and his mother, Caterina, must be going through. I extend to them my greatest sympathy.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too wish to join in this condolence motion for former Senator John Panizza. John's policy interests and mine did not closely coincide at all, so I very rarely had debates with him on policy issues relating to wheat, road funding and a variety of other things in which he was particularly interested. Although, whenever he was interested in something that I had said or was doing, he would bail me up in a very similar way to which Senator Kernot said she had been bailed up on occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He said, `Oy! I'd just like to have a chat with you for a minute.' He wanted to know about Australian students being able to buy a place at university and what did I have to say about that. He said it in his usual, perhaps sometimes gruff sounding, manner when really it was just a direct manner. I said, `I think it's a good idea. Students should be able to buy places if they're lucky enough to afford it or, in years to come, if they've put the money aside. We let international students, so why shouldn't we let Australian students.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He let me go on with all the policy arguments&mdash;and I will not rehearse them here because this is not a policy debate&mdash;he let me finish all of them and then came to his point and said, `Yes, but why won't you allow people to buy a place in medicine?' and I said, `That's really a policy thing you might take up with Dr Wooldridge because it basically relates to health policy more than education policy.' `That's all right then,' he said&mdash;pretty much the same as he used to say to Senator Kernot&mdash;`it's not you I have to deal with.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said, `Why do you want to know?' I thought the last thing John would want to do would be to enrol in a medical degree at this time in his life, but he said, `One of my kids wants to do that and it just annoys me that she can't. I was very pleased to hear that we were going to allow Australian students to buy a place and then I found out that you cut medical students out. So I'll speak to Wooldridge about that. Thanks a lot. Off you go.' and I was dispatched.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did have a common interest in the Italian language. He originally said to me that he did not speak the classical Italian, but he certainly spoke far more than I did. He was very helpful to me on a number of occasions when I wanted to know how to phrase this or that, and I suspect occasionally I might have got a pair more often than I otherwise would have because I was able to ask for it in Italian and explain what I wanted in Italian.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had to work at it before. I am not showing off. I had to plan this; it did not come naturally off the tongue, Senator Neal. I had to work at thinking, `How will I approach him on this?' If there were a way to get under his guard, that was it. I suspect that it did not actually get under his guard, but he was very helpful to me in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two qualities, amongst others, that I would select as to why I admired him and they are qualities for good politicians. The first is that he was fearless. Plenty of people have spoken and said how they have heard him say to people, `Now, just hold on a minute!' putting up his hand, as he always would. He did that to anybody. I have seen him do it to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and previous leaders of our party, not giving a damn what their particular view was. I have seen him do it when a very strong view in the party was being put in what you guys opposite would call a caucus room which was opposed to his view. He would nonetheless confidently stand there and say, `That's all right for you, but I am elected here and I'm entitled to have my say,' and he would say it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John was not someone who was ever cowered down by a mere majority of numbers in putting his view. As many people have said, he was very proud to be here and understood that his job was to put his view. He never made the mistake, as some people do, of believing that you can lead by following.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He had, I believe, a healthy disrespect for lawyers, despite the fact that legal advice had moved into his family. I do recall on one occasion one of the clerks, deputy clerks or assistant clerks&mdash;I cannot quite remember at this point&mdash;saying to me that it could be considered a bad thing for people coming into parliament to have legal training because it makes them more cautious. If that is true, it is a disadvantage to have a legal training if it makes you more cautious. Fearlessness in representing the people you represent, if that is the position you are taking at a particular time, as John often did in representing rural constituents, or in representing your own views, I think is one of the quintessential qualities we should all seek to have, and we all know that it is not always easy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second quality that I would pick out as being one that is of particular value to politicians, if they can manage it&mdash;and John managed it every minute of the day&mdash;is to be unpretentious. I think some reference was made earlier to this story in this motion&mdash;and I have had this story recounted to me on numerous occasions. There was a dinner for new senators with the then Leader of the Opposition, Fred Chaney. As they were leaving the dinner, Senator Panizza turned to another and said something along the lines of, `Could you hear above all the clanging?' and this person said, `Clanging? What are you talking about?' He said, `All that name dropping, wasn't that shocking?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The person who was doing all the name dropping is no longer with us either, but it is just relevant that John had a very easy way of spotting someone who was going to climb up the ladder one way or another, going to try to butter him up in one way or another, a name dropper, or whatever. He had an absolute disdain for people who did that because he was a very unpretentious person. If we could all manage that every minute of the day, perhaps politics would be held in a higher esteem than it is at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Panizza was, as people have noted, a very successful man. When people have noted that, they have generally been referring to his success as a farmer and sometimes judged that by the size of the crop. He was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="47"> successful in all other respects of his life as well. But he was nonetheless careful with his pennies. While Senator Minchin and I might have different views on a range of things, we have quite a few things in common, not the least of which is being attacked about the houseboat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Panizza bought a lottery ticket. He actually cornered me about this matter and said, `Hey, what do you know about your administration?' I was not sure what it was that he was on about. He said, `I bought this lottery ticket. One of your people wrote around and said, "Support your marginal seat." I did the right thing. If we all wrote around and asked everybody to support every marginal seat we would all be buying raffle tickets every day. But I did the right thing and I won this raffle.' I said, `That is a good thing.' He said, `Yes, but the company has gone broke,' or whatever it was that happened. I do not think, as Senator Minchin recounted, he ever got his houseboat holiday. Nonetheless, I wanted to join in this debate to point out those two particular qualities&mdash;not the only ones by a long shot&mdash;of fearlessness and unpretentiousness that John had from which we could all learn.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish briefly to join with my colleagues in this condolence motion. All the great attributes of the character of John Panizza have  been amply covered this afternoon. I had enormous respect for John and admiration for him. He was intelligent. He was a very shrewd judge of people and events. He was hardworking. He was indeed a blunt personality, absolutely devoid of any deception or any artefact. That is a rather rare quality about this place. He also had impeccable integrity. His word, literally, was his bond. Many people have attested to that. That, again, is not a common characteristic around this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I extend my deepest sympathy to his family and to his staff here. He supported both his family and his staff loyally and, in turn, they supported him with unswerving loyalty. The Senate was enriched immeasurably by his presence here. We are all the poorer for his passing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to join my colleagues in the condolence motion for John Panizza. Most of us spoke about the shock that we all felt when the news was conveyed to us. It did seem a shock because he seemed to be such a healthy, robust character. To think that he could be cut down at this stage in his life was a shock to a lot of people. Equally, there was the fact that he seemed to have so much to contribute to this place and to the wider Australian community. A lot of colleagues have of course mentioned his family and appropriately dwelt on the great love and affection that he had for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In many ways he was a paradoxical character. He was tough&mdash;and I for one have had a number of arguments with John Panizza&mdash;but he was a kindly person. He was a man who was enormously ambitious, and that has been mentioned during the condolence motion debate today. He was also a very modest man. He was a man of considerable wealth and yet that was never apparent in his demeanour and the modesty with which he conducted himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another paradox with him. It came through to me very strongly in the debate today. In many ways he embodied the traditional Australia&mdash;what we think of as the traditional Australia. It is the bloke from the country. It is the bloke who loves the bush, who loves his sport. A number of colleagues have dwelt on his love of football and cricket. Many aspects of his character, it seems to me, relate to the traditional Aussie, and yet the other aspect of the paradox was that he was of Italian extraction and, it was mentioned, spoke Italian until the age of nine. He was enormously proud of that connection as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can well remember him offering to come down to Victoria to help with a state election, particularly in the north&hyphen;west suburbs of Melbourne where there are very substantial Italian communities. John spent a number of days out there with the Italian communities and he was enormously well received. They were very proud of John and his photo was on the front page of the papers that were published. The image that he conveyed of the Liberal Party was a very powerful and important one and helped broaden our party into 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="48"> areas where we had not been particularly strong. That is just one of the many reasons that we can be grateful for the life of John Panizza.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the coalition coming to government, John became government whip and I was appointed the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. We had to work closely not only on a daily but almost on an hourly basis. It is again perhaps a strange paradox that John, in one of the end of year parties, was awarded the prize for the senator who spoke most in the chamber. I came second for that prize. For the prize for the number of recorded interjections in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, John came first and I came second.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On coming to government the task was to try to stop our colleagues from talking&mdash;and for me to try to stop John from talking and for John to try to stop me from talking&mdash;so we would get some business through the chamber. Ian Campbell, as the current very distinguished Manager of Government Business in the Senate, will endorse these remarks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are times, as people know, when bills are being debated and we are trying to get the business through, when we are trying to put pressure on our colleagues not to talk or, if they talk, to talk very briefly. John Panizza, Senator Calvert and I would go around and put as much pressure as we could on colleagues. Having achieved, one hopes, some success in this endeavour, you would turn around and the next person on his feet would be John Panizza. The temptation to speak was too great and so often it was John who, with our backs turned, would be on his feet making a few brief contributions to the debate. That was also a source of some amusement and comment amongst our colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He will be greatly missed in this chamber. He contributed a lot. I think all of us felt that he had a great deal to contribute further. For those reasons and for all the other reasons which have been mentioned today, John Panizza will be sorely missed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with my col 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> leagues on this condolence motion to John Panizza. I extend my sympathy and my wife's sympathy to Coral and all the family, to John's mother and his children and grandchildren. I believe the passing of JP has left a big void in everyone's life in this place. I also extend sympathy to his staff, both here and in Western Australia, because I think they held him in the highest regard as well. I sometimes wondered, because he was pretty strict or quite brittle with them sometimes, but they still loved him. They must not be forgotten either.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John and I shared a love of farming. We used to have many conversations about price fluctuations and crops and how he was growing. He seemed to harvest from one end of the year to the other; it was never ending. I thought I was a reasonable wheat farmer but he left me well behind in the dust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I served with him on committees in this place including the ag and vet chemical inquiry, which Senator Colston talked about earlier in this condolence motion. John was always very forthright in his views and he always made his point very clear. He also made his point very clear in the coalition primary industries committee. We often had heated debates there, not always agreeing. John was a Western Australian and Western Australia is a little bit different from other parts of Australia. He always made the point about what was best for his state. I think that was very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was much easier when John agreed with you on an issue. We did agree on the income equalisation deposits and the farm management bonds, for example. I make a commitment to him that I will continue to fight for what he wanted done with them to make them much more applicable and better for the farming communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My strongest memories of John are from the last few months of last year, with John acting as the government whip and approving or declining leave. Representing a couple of ministers, I find that I have to apply for leave quite often to get out to go to a function for them. He was not always easy to get along with, I must say. Quite often he used to keep me waiting. He would say, `I am just going 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="49"> to go and ring home before I tell you what is going to happen.' He would go away and make a phone call to home before he did so. I would say, `But I have got to do this on behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister.' He would say, `I wouldn't care about the Deputy Prime Minister. I am the whip here. I am the one that is running this place. That is more important than anything else.' He was so right. I did not always agree, but he was always right. Seeing that I got the award for getting the most leave last year, I agree with the point made earlier by some people opposite that he was always a very soft touch.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thing that I will miss as much as anything else is John counting the number of senators during divisions. If you were half turned around and not looking at the whip while the division was going on, he would walk halfway down here, looking over his glasses and make a big signal for you to turn around. He appeared to do so in a very gruff way, but it was not as gruff as we all thought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think everything has been said about John Panizza. Nobody could have had as many nice things said about them as he has had said about him today. He was a good bloke. All of us are going to be much the poorer for his passing. I again extend my sympathy to his wife and all his family.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to join in speaking to this condolence motion as it relates to the loss of a friend to all of us, particularly those of us that joined John Panizza in this place in 1987. I would like to put into perspective the representation of northern Australia. I have always found it a particular privilege to work with the other five Liberal senators from Western Australia and also Senator Ian Macdonald and Senator Bill O'Chee, who take a very special interest in representing the geographic location of North Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Panizza worked very closely and very well in partnership with all of us in that regard. If you recount the stories that have been told here this afternoon relating to the mining industry, the pastoral industry, and the transport industry, you will see that all those 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issues impact on us. John Panizza took a very close interest in the debate several years ago with regard to the territories law reform legislation that went through the federal parliament that related to the Indian Ocean territories. I think that was a very important period, because there is a community of interest between the Northern Territory, which represents both Cocos and Christmas Islands, and Western Australia, with the fact that Western Australian law was picked up in that regard. I was pleased to work with John Panizza in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we concentrate on the issues facing northern Australia it always comes back to looking at the export potential and economics, and John was certainly a champion for the areas of the North West Shelf, for mining&hyphen;prospecting in that area. Very importantly, it was a matter of underpinning the peculiar and very different lifestyles of families who live in remote areas, the conditions under which they live and the very high costs of living. John Panizza keenly took an interest in all of those debates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also had the privilege of sharing that great border between Western Australia and the Northern Territory. There were a number of issues that John Panizza and I worked closely together on, particularly as they impacted on the Aboriginal communities of both the Kimberleys and the Western Desert areas of Western Australia. There were times when John used to cross that border, particularly in the area of Docker River, northern South Australia, and coming into Alice Springs. He took a very keen interest in the area of Aboriginal aged care and health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure that there are many people in those forgotten places and forgotten communities who will remember his charter visits and his very genuine and particular concern in that area. I acknowledge that it has been a privilege for all of us to work in partnership&mdash;so many different forms of partnership&mdash;with John Panizza in the decade that he was with us here and I am very proud of both the example and the strength of character that we could all rely upon in knowing that he was there as our colleague.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we have spent a little over four hours on this motion&mdash;and I guess most of us still, at this stage, cannot believe that the seat just over there will not be occupied by John Panizza again, that he will never again walk into this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Luckily I did not receive the call on Friday morning. My husband answered the phone and he conveyed to me what had occurred. Today we have heard about the talents, the interests, the attributes, the passions and the humour of the man that we knew so well and whom we will miss so badly. What comes out of it all are the values that he stood for and for which he was always prepared to fight and challenge whoever stood in the way of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I enjoyed working with John when he was the deputy whip. I had frequently to tell him that being on duty as whip did not mean that you were next on the speaking list. He would usually say, `What, what?' to that. I tried to tell him on occasions that being the whip on duty did not mean that you had a licence to interject freely, but I got as far with that as well. But there was absolutely no guile about the man. You always knew exactly where you stood and it was easy to talk to him and share the things that you were perhaps disagreeing about at the time&mdash;no pretence, no guile and he was good company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I particularly liked the photographs of the Southern Cross in his room. The first time I learnt that they were photographs taken by him I was amazed. I had not detected that artistic touch within him before but, having 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> seen them and looked at them and seen other photographs, I realised that there was an enormous talent there as well. He spoke often of his hope that Tom and I would come and stay at Southern Cross some time and what he would show us when we did. I find it hard to believe that he will never show us these things. I may still see them, but not in quite the same way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One other thing that I particularly noticed throughout the time that he was here was the very special relationship that he had with Peter Walsh, for reasons that have become apparent from the stories that we have heard today. There was an enormous respect between these two characters of the Senate&mdash;both very strong characters, both very forthright, but always this delightful respect between them on any issue. I certainly noticed that and felt that it was significant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was mentioned earlier that there were three things that he would never lend&mdash;and his car was one of them. I well recall the day when my car was being serviced and I did not have another one here and needed to go out somewhere into my electorate. I went to him and said, `Where are your car keys? I need to borrow the car.' I wondered what had happened because I was met with silence&mdash;just this blank look of amazement that anyone should dare to ask for his vehicle. He recovered and lent it to me, and several times after that. I always felt very honoured to be allowed to drive it and when I had brought it back, I told him where I had put the keys and that it was returned with everything in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also remember discussing the register of senators' interests, including that bit which talked about dependants. `What are dependants?' he said. `Gosh, where do you stop? Where do you start?' It reflects the patriarch stories we have heard. I knew the ages of his children and I said, `John, apart from Coral, there may not be any dependants.' We had a bit of a chat about these forms and things of that nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We often had a cup of coffee or lunch together and would have a chat. I enjoyed those occasions&mdash;they were all too infrequent&mdash;and he would always insist on buying the coffee, the sandwich and coffee or the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="51"> salad, or whatever it was. One day I took the determined view that I was going to pay for lunch&mdash;and I can tell you that is an experience, especially if you are a woman. I did pay for the lunch. We went to Aussies to get a sandwich and coffee and he stood carefully to one side so it was not apparent that some woman was buying his lunch. We sat outside and talked and as we came to the end I said, `Would you like another cup of coffee?' `No, no,' he said. He was not going to be embarrassed a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will leave here shortly, having stood in silence to remember our colleague and we will all think of the things that we have not recounted today that we wished we had thought of at the time. They will be our own special memories that we will live on with as we adjust to our lives without him in this place. The electors of Western Australia will miss him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find it hard to contemplate how a woman of 87 comes to terms with burying her son aged 65 and, so, for Mrs Caterina Panizza, I really do feel quite deeply. I want to mention those who were with Coral the other day. I was so pleased to know that she was there because she did not travel with him a lot. It was just so good that she was in Cairns at the time. I thank you, Senator Ray, for the way you and your committee reacted to the situation&mdash;Senator Cooney and Senator Childs; Senator Coonan, in particular, with Mrs Panizza; Senator Ellison and Senator O'Chee. Anne Lynch has been mentioned and June Nelson was there also. They all became  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> involved and provided the comfort that was necessary at that particular time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is worth mentioning the hotel itself, the Tradewinds Esplanade. I gather they responded magnificently as well to a crisis in a family, by seeing that the things that had to be done were done with a minimum of fuss.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To Coral and the children we do send our deepest sympathy: Frank, Janine, Stephen and Linda; and to Emily. And I guess we all think particularly of the grandchildren yet to come who will not have the privilege and pleasure of knowing their grandfather other than through what they are told by the rest of the family. Perhaps at some time they may even read what has been said here today. It seems such a shame that he should leave us at the age of 65 and that we are all deprived of his company, especially, as I said, the unborn grandchildren who will not know him.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Between 1992 and 1994 a former locally engaged cashier stole public monies from the Australian High Commission in Nairobi by writing official cheques in his own name and cashing them in collusion with a bank employee.

Some of the money was recovered, and the amount finally written off as a result of the fraud is AUD40,198.50.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)(a) The Department referred the matter relating to the former locally engaged cashier to the Kenyan Police.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An investigation into the circumstances surrounding the fraud was undertaken in accordance with the disciplinary provisions of the Public Service Act 1922. These require appointment of an authorised officer to determine whether any Australia&hyphen;based officer may have failed to fulfil his or her duty as an officer, and if so whether charges should be laid or the officer should be counselled. If charges are laid, the Act requires the Secretary to decide, or appoint an inquiry officer to decide, whether charges are sustained and, if they are, what disciplinary action or counselling is appropriate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)(a) The investigation revealed that only one locally engaged staff member had been involved in the fraud. No Australia&hyphen;based High Commission staff were found to have perpetrated or benefited from the fraud.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided me with the following response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) By the end of financial year 1995&hyphen;96, 4,320.47 tonnes of U3O8 (uranium concentrate) had been sold to France, all to Electricite de France (EdF). Details of annual supply under contracts by individual companies are not publicly available for France or other countries for commercial in confidence reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Sales are directly to EdF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Cogema is the largest commercial reprocessing company and is therefore currently the world's largest producer of separated plutonium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) and (5) The two light water reactor (LWR) fuel reprocessing plants (UP2 and UP3) in operation at Cogema's La Hague complex are designed to reprocess 1,600 tonnes of heavy metal (HM) per annum, although design capacity has yet to be reached. Annual plutonium production depends on available reprocessing capacity; operation at full capacity represents the separation of approximately 16 tonnes of plutonium per year although precise figures at the facility level are not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Earlier this year the French Government published for the first time the quantity of civil plutonium (Pu) in France; 231.9 tonnes at the end of 1995. They revealed, in the same document, that this was an increase of 17 tonnes over the total at the end of 1994. The 1995 figure comprises the following categories in separated and unseparated forms:  36.1 tonnes of separated Pu held in storage at reprocessing plants (presumably mostly La Hague and Marcoule); 5.5 tonnes of separated Pu stored elsewhere; 10.1 tonnes of Pu contained in unirradiated mixed&hyphen;oxide (MOX) fuels or in the MOX fabrication process; 3.6 tonnes of Pu in unirradiated MOX fuel at reactors; and a further 25.7 tonnes of Pu in the above categories belonging to foreign organisations plus 0.2 tonnes of French Pu being held at a foreign installation. The quantity of Pu contained in spent fuel in reactor pools was estimated at 63.6 tonnes while 87.1 tonnes of Pu were contained in spent fuel being stored at reprocessing plants, or in the process of being separated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1995, the La Hague complex reprocessed some 1,550 tonnes HM, the first time it has approached its design capacity. In 1994, UP2 and UP3 reprocessed 1,276 tonnes HM; in 1993, 950 tonnes; in 1992, 672 tonnes and in 1989, 460 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="57"> tonnes, including the first 30 tonnes at UP3. In 1988, UP2 reprocessed 346 tonnes, in 1987, 425 tonnes of LWR fuel; in 1986, 333 tonnes of LWR fuel; and in 1985, 351 tonnes of LWR fuel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since LWR fuel reprocessing began at La Hague in 1976, over 8,000 tonnes of spent LWR fuel has been reprocessed&mdash;approximately 5,000 tonnes in the past 5 years and 3,000 tonnes in the previous 15 years. In addition, 4,900 tonnes of spent gas/graphite reactor fuel were reprocessed at La Hague between 1966 and 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) From commissioning in 1958 to the end of 1990, a total of 4,000 tonnes of spent gas/graphite reactor fuel had been reprocessed at UP1, Cogema's 400 tonnes HM per year Marcoule reprocessing plant. Reports of throughput in the early 1990s indicate that the plant was working at or near capacity. In both 1993 and 1994, 330 tonnes of spent gas/graphite fuel were reprocessed at UP1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) Yes. The plant is scheduled to close by the end of 1997 when gas/graphite reactor fuel reprocessing has been completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) Production from some gas/graphite reactors was used for military purposes in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) No. Superphenix, owned by a European consortium and used for electricity production and research, is still using its original core and therefore no spent fuel has been reprocessed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) As noted in (8) weapons&hyphen;grade plutonium has been produced at Marcoule. The quantity of weapons&hyphen;related plutonium production is classified by the French Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(12) The `freeing&hyphen;up' argument used for many years by some community groups could only be shown to have some validity if uranium were a commodity in short supply. This has not been the case for many decades. France has had no shortage of uranium sources, including from its own domestic production which at times has exceeded Australia's entire uranium production. In some years France has also exported uranium. In the past, Australia has supplied only about 3% of total French civil uranium consumption. President Chirac's announcement in February 1996 that France would no longer produce fissile material for nuclear weapons purposes means that regardless of source,  uranium will not be used by France to produce material for nuclear weapons&hyphen;related purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(13) None.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(14) Not applicable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(15) ASO's counterpart in France, as with other bilateral partners, provides detailed information for each category of Australian obligated nuclear material (AONM) covered by the relevant agree 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment. These categories of nuclear material are:  depleted uranium, natural uranium, low enriched uranium, uranium in enrichment plants and plutonium. Any specific queries by ASO to its French counterpart have always been answered promptly and totally satisfactorily.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(16) The quotation contained in the question contains minor transcription inaccuracies, but is essentially correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(17) France, in common with a number of Australia's other bilateral partners, regards such information as confidential on physical protection (security) and commercial grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(18) In the past ASO has raised with each of its counterpart organisations the desirability of making such information public and continues to pursue this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(19) The question of confidentiality relates only to making the relevant information available to the public. Detailed information on AONM is available to ASO from our bilateral partners and from other sources. The Government is confident that all AONM is satisfactorily accounted for and makes no contribution to nuclear weapons programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(20) The Director of Safeguards has statutory responsibilities in this area:  the Director of Safeguards is accountable to Parliament through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and prepares a detailed Annual Report which is tabled in Parliament. The Government has a strong commitment to transparency in nuclear matters which is reflected in ASO's practice of being as forthcoming as possible bearing in mind prudent considerations in relation to physical security and commercial confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(21) The Annual Report of the Director of Safeguards already contains a considerable degree of detail on relevant matters&mdash;there is a large amount of descriptive material in addition to the figures referred to. To keep the Report within manageable proportions, it is not practicable to anticipate every aspect of detail which may be of interest to a particular reader.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(22) AONM is not converted from U3O8 to UF6 at the Pierrelatte facility. AONM is first converted from U3O8 to UF4 at the Malvesi facility, which in turn is presented as feed to the Pierrelatte facility to produce UF6. The conversion process used is the so&hyphen;called `wet' process, under which the U3O8 is dissolved in nitric acid to produce a uranyl solution, purified, and reacted with ammonium to produce ammonium diuranate (ADU). The ADU is transformed into UO3. Reduction&hyphen;hydrofluoridation is then carried out to produce UF4. At Pierrelatte, the UF4 is processed with gaseous fluorine (F2) to produce UF6, which is the feed material for uranium enrichment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(23) Chemically and physically, atoms regardless of source are indistinguishable from each other and all uranium going through these facilities is treated by the abovementioned process. Australian Obligated Nuclear Material (AONM), though, is an accounting identity which allows an amount of Australian origin material equivalent to that which initially entered the conversion process to be accounted for throughout the conversion process. As noted below (in answer to question 24), however, uranium for military use was kept separate from civil uranium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(24) In the past, the Pierrelatte conversion facility has been used to process both military and civil nuclear materials. French officials have confirmed that civil and military material was kept separate by processing on a `campaign' basis, i.e. military material was processed in separate batches between civil batches. As noted in the answer to question 12, France is no longer producing fissile material for nuclear weapons purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Eurodif enrichment plant at Tricastin, where AONM is enriched, is a dedicated civil enrichment facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(25) These figures are confidential for the reasons noted in answer to question 17.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(26) None. No AONM has been used for any military purpose, in France or elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(27) No record can be found of a press release by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy dated 7 June 1988. On 2 June 1988, however, the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr John Kerin, issued a press release which spoke of `obligated' and `unobligated' nuclear material only in the context of the Eurodif plant at Tricastin. Referring to that plant he said: `The ASO has advised that the plant, in producing low&hyphen;enriched uranium, does process both obligated nuclear material, which remains in civil use, and unobligated material, which can&mdash;after further enrichment at another facility&mdash;be used for military purposes.' It is important to note however, that in the same press release Mr Kerin also said `France has separate facilities and processes&mdash;including those at Pierrelatte&mdash;for the production from low enriched uranium of highly enriched uranium for military purposes.'  He also said `For operational reasons including those of nuclear criticality, it is not possible to produce highly enriched uranium in the Eurodif plant at Tricastin.'  No reference can be found to a further statement by Mr Kerin on 4 June 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It remains the case, as Mr Kerin said in his 2 June 1988 media release, that `The Australian obligated nuclear material which passes through the facility at Tricastin, however, remains confined to exclusively peaceful non&hyphen;explosive use, that is there is a quantity of low&hyphen;enriched uranium and depleted 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tails, equivalent to the Australian obligated nuclear material which entered the plant, which is designated Australian obligated nuclear material and which may only be used for peaceful, non&hyphen;explosive purposes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(28) The Government does not agree with the alleged statement in question (27). Australia's safeguards arrangements ensure that AONM does not contribute to any military purpose. In any event, as explained in the answer to question (24), uranium converted for military purposes at the Pierrelatte conversion plant was kept physically separate from civil uranium.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(29) The Government is satisfied that all Australian uranium supplied to France will be used for exclusively peaceful purposes. New uranium contracts are a matter for negotiation between the commercial parties involved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable Senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1), (2) and (3) The Council of Australian Governments (COAG) has agreed to negotiate a reform to housing assistance which would involve the State and Territory Governments (the `States') being responsible for the public housing system, and the Commonwealth becoming responsible for rental subsidy delivery to people on low incomes 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in both private and public rental housing. The States have accepted the Prime Minister's recommendation that a taskforce be formed to examine and develop options for housing reform, which would subsequently be considered by COAG.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key topic for the housing reform taskforce to consider is the clarification of government housing roles and responsibilities. Significant reform of roles and responsibilities would involve a move away from input controls, towards improved accountability through outcome measurement and reporting. Thus a new agreement will be less focused on what stock can be sold or on ensuring reinvestment of funds, and more focused on determining the outcomes that each level of government is responsible for and on measuring and reporting on performance in delivering these outcomes. Such outcomes could include maintaining a level of public housing which is well located and meets community expectations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must emphasise that no decisions have been made on the final model of housing reform. However, the Commonwealth enters these negotiations with the view that it is important that the States maintain an adequate supply of public housing stock which is well located and meets community expectations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has proposed to State Governments that there be wide consultations on the development of housing reform. The topic of future public supply will be an important issue in

The Environment Minister directed that the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) prepare a public environment report (PER) to make the public aware of the transportation of the shipment, which was proposed for 1996. The draft PER was released by ANSTO for public comment towards the end of 1995, and its availability was advertised in newspapers in all capital cities.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator Parer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) assesses proposals to import exotic plants into Australia for arthropod pests, diseases and weed potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since 1989 weed potential of live plant imports has been assessed using an objective scoring system called the Hazard scheme. This scheme was developed and endorsed by the Australian Weeds Committee (AWC), which reports to the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Resource Management (SCARM), with representatives from the parallel standing committees on forestry and conservation issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Greater controls on imported seeds have been applied since June 1995. These controls were 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> phased in to avoid unnecessary disruption to trade and AQIS is satisfied that the importation of all new plant species is now subject to assessment for weed potential. Prior to these changes in policy, seeds were not individually assessed for weed risks and management of these risks relied on reference to a list of prohibited plants proclaimed under the Quarantine Act 1908.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to diseases and arthropod pests, pest risks and management procedures are determined using pest risk analysis methodology in accordance with standards developed within the framework of the International Plant Protection Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) It is AQIS's understanding that proposals to import exotic plants are not individually assessed for weed risk by its counterparts in countries with similar plant health infrastructure. In general, the systems in place in these countries rely on reference to lists of prohibited plants. The United States uses similar methodology to Australia to develop its prohibited list. AQIS is not aware of how lists in other countries are prepared; however, they are thought to rely on published records of weediness where the plants occur. All similar countries rely on pest risk analysis for assessing the pest and disease risks of proposed imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Species which are prohibited must undergo a pest risk analysis before being permitted entry. This analysis involves public consultation. Quarantine decisions are made under the Quarantine Act (1908) and are subject to the provisions of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act (1977). In the first instance however, if substantive concerns over a decision are raised with AQIS it will review its decision. For example, there is currently a moratorium on the importation of all Salix species (willows) which results directly from concerns raised by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation over increasing weed problems with willows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) A recent report commissioned by the Australian Weeds Committee (AWC) shows that the Hazard scheme can predict 99% of potentially serious environmental weeds and 96% of potentially minor environmental weeds. This report was based on retrospective studies of the small proportion of all imported plants which have already become weeds in Australia. The report indicates that this scheme is marginally more accurate at predicting environmental weed potential than agricultural weed potential. The Hazard scheme does not differentiate between agricultural and environmental weeds and AQIS does exclude environmental weeds; however, this is due to concerns about agricultural weed potential.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since June 1995 and pending a consultancy project to investigate the agricultural and environmental risks of new plant introductions, AQIS has assessed the majority of new species imported as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="66"> seed using a modified version of the Hazard scheme. The AWC report shows that the accuracy of this modified scheme is approximately 89% for all serious weeds. The weed risk assessment process carried out on all new species imported as live plants or as seed includes an environmental assessment component.</PARA>

The licence was for the export of 500,000 tonnes of hardwood woodchips per annum, for the period 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1999.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) I am aware that it is possible that the application fee may be considered in some cases. The Freedom of Information (Fees and Charges) Regulations provide that application fees and other charges are not applicable where the documents sought relate to claims concerning a prescribed income support benefit such as a pension, allowance or benefit payable to the applicant. This applies to the majority of requests received by my Department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exemption applies to requests where the documents sought contain information relevant to a claim for or a decision in relation to the payment to the applicant of a prescribed benefit.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a person is already in receipt of a disability pension at the T&amp;PI rate it is unlikely that any documents being requested would be relevant to a claim because the individuals are already in receipt of the maximum pension payable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to Senator Brown's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The environmental performance of the Freeport Mine in Irian Jaya was audited in 1995 by Dames and Moore. The findings of the Dames and Moore Audit Report were released in March 1996 and endorsed by a subsequent verification study undertaken by BAPEDAL, the Indonesian Environmental Protection Agency.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on the information in the Audit Report, it is unlikely that, beyond the immediate vicinity of the mouth of the Ajkwa River system, marine life in the Arafura Sea and Australian territorial waters are being significantly affected by operations at the Freeport Mine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Regulation and monitoring of Freeport's operations in Irian Jaya, including its environmental regime, is primarily a responsibility of the Indonesian Government and its agencies and is undertaken through cooperation between the Indonesian Government and the company concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government takes a close interest in developments in Irian Jaya. Irian Jaya was among the issues discussed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, during his visit to Indonesia in April 1996. The Australian Ambassador to Indonesia and other Embassy officers regularly visit the province. The Government takes a particular interest in the situation in and around the Freeport mine at Timika, and has been concerned about the number of reported incidents of violence which have occurred in that area in recent years, including abuses of human rights by some members of the Indonesian Armed Forces, the taking of hostages by elements of the Organisasi Papua Merdeka (OPM) in January 1996, and instances of rioting in Timika, Abepura and Tembagapura in March 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is aware of two reports released in 1995 ("Trouble in Freeport", issued by the Australian Council For Overseas Aid, and a report under the name of the Catholic Bishop of Jayapura) which alleged human rights abuses by ABRI in the Timika area (around the Freeport mine concession). I understand that all of the evidence available to the previous Government, including from the visit to the province by the Australian Ambassador in July 1995, tended to confirm that in the period June 1994&mdash;July 1995 there were serious human rights violations in the area, including the deaths of at least 22 people. The previous Government expressed at the time Australia's concerns about this serious situation to the Indonesian Government. On 22 September 1995, Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission subsequently investigated the allegations and released a report which reported 16 deaths and 4 disappearances and set out a series of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> recommendations. In early 1996, three Indonesian soldiers and one junior officer were sentenced to goal for their actions in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is aware that, apart from commissioning an environmental audit of the mine's operations, Freeport's senior management and the Indonesian authorities have been discussing issues of concern, including environment issues, with the local people. The Government will continue to take an interest in that consultation process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Embassy in Jakarta will continue to monitor the human rights and environmental situation in and around the area of Freeport's operations, including through regular visits and liaison with relevant Indonesian Government and non&hyphen;government agencies and organisations and Freeport's management.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator Newman</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The RAAF is aware of eight incidents involving military and commercial aircraft in the past 5 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) RAAF Base Darwin is not being expanded by the proposed works, which are totally contained within the existing base perimeter. The works will increase the safety on the base by providing dedicated explosive ordnance loading areas with approved safety distances from facilities and personnel. The ground support for military aircraft will become less complex with use of the proposed facilities and greater safety will result. Therefore, the proposed works will not increase risk of collision or mishap at Darwin Airport. Darwin Airport is not one of the fastest growing airports in Australia, with a reduction in aircraft movements of over 10% between the years 1994 and 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)(a) and (b) On 7 June 1995, a USMC FA&hyphen;18 sustained a collapsed undercarriage on landing. This required a displaced threshold (denoting the start of the serviceable portion of the runway) to be laid. The Federal Airports Commission (FAC) has responsibility for this, and on that day laid the displaced threshold. The displaced threshold was marked in accordance with Civil Aviation Authority procedures. A Qantas 737 landed inside the displaced threshold on one of the specified unserviceability cross markers placed on the section of the runway which should not have been used. The aircraft came to a halt before a line of cones that had been placed across the runway to signify the start of the useable part of the runway. Two flat cross markers of wire mesh and material had been laid on the unserviceable runway to visually warn aircraft of the displaced threshold. No chicken wire or other material had been placed around the disabled aircraft, which was off the side of the runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) It is normal and necessary for aircraft taking off or landing to be at low altitude. The authorised flight path profile for take off is a sector diverging laterally from the end of the runway at an angle of 8.1 degrees either side of the runway centre line extending out 2 nautical miles (3.71 km). Aircraft are required to remain within this sector when departing. No permanent dwellings or business establishments are permitted under the authorised flight path profile. The Juninga Special Care Unit is over half a kilometre to the north of the extended runway centre line and over 250 metres outside the authorised flight path profile. There is no record of aircraft flying directly over the Juninga Special Care Unit.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)(a) The location of Lululuk is over half a kilometre to the south of the extended runway centre line and over 250 metres outside the authorised flight path.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The Australian Noise Exposure Forecast system (ANEF) is a measure of noise impact around airfields and is based on the findings of the Australian National Acoustics Laboratories (NAL), which published the results of extensive studies in a report entitled `Aircraft Noise in Australia: A Survey of Community Reaction'. The ANEF defines a means of determining a scientific measure of the aircraft noise exposure levels over a 12 month period taking into account the following factors:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An ANEI for operations at RAAF Base Darwin based on aircraft movements for 1994 shows that the areas of Ludmilla and Bagot at the western end of the 11/29 runway are subject to significant noise impact. The 40 ANEF contour in this area extends</PARA>

The 2005 ANEF contour plan which was prepared for RAAF Base Darwin in 1995 and distributed to the NT Government, shows that the extent of the noise contours has slightly decreased, thereby indicating that there will be no increase in the noise impact on the local community as a result of development of facilities on the Base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The parameters of the term `Environmental Noise Criteria' are not known. Accordingly, no such assurance can be given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6)(a) and (b) Although no direct threat currently exists, the Australian Defence Force is required to undertake a number of key roles, including:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for the Environment, upon notice, on 25 November 1996:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With reference to the proposal by Danpork to develop a piggery, abattoir and feedmill near Warwick on the banks of the Condamine River in Queensland:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Is the Minister aware that a New South Wales Commission of Inquiry severely restricted the size of a similar development proposed by Danpork, promoting a Danpork representative to say that the New South Wales conditions were too stringent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Will the same environmental conditions imposed on Danpork in New South Wales be required of the Danpork project near Warwick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) What is the nature and extent of public consultation held with residents affected by the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)(a) Did Danpork originally reject the Warwick Shire as having no site suitable for a piggery; and (b) at whose invitation was Danpork invited back to Warwick to reconsider the proposed piggery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Has the Danpork development near Warwick been: (a) assessed under environmental conditions not available to other pork producers in Queensland; (b) assessed under International ISO14000 environmental standards; (c) promised, or has it received, financial assistance from the Federal or State governments or the local shire council; and (d) offered water allocations not offered to other primary producers in the Warwick Shire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Are the International ISO14000 standards in the form of draft guidelines only and therefore unable to be effectively enforced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7)(a) Is the Minister aware of any plans for a weir to be built on the Condamine River to supply the Danpork piggery with water; (b) is any federal funding being provided for the building of such a weir; and (c) will the water from such a weir be for the exclusive use of Danpork.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) What assurances can the Minister give that underground water supplies will not be affected by leaching of the effluent from the Danpork piggery into the aquifer. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) With reference to a letter dated 23 August 1996 by Mr Andrew Campbell, Assistant Secretary of the Sustainable Land and Water Use Branch, written in reply to a letter to the Minister by Mr A Hancock of Killarney, in which it was stated that `the Minister has asked the Environmental Protection Agency to take into account the type of concerns you raise in your letter in its examination of the proposal': do the types of concerns raised include those outlined above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10)(a) Is the Minister aware of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) document Effluent Irrigated Plantations: Design and Management which states on page 12, `Heavy clay soils are susceptible to clogging by sediments and to sodicity&hyphen;related structural damage' and that local advice is that the soil type in the area to be irrigated is `Heavy clay soil. . . '; and (b) is the Minister concerned that this may mean that the effluent will not be contained on site by broadcasting on to the irrigation site but may find its way into the Condamine River and thus into the Murray&hyphen;Darling River system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) Is the Minister aware that the Regional Director of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and staff of the CSIRO have raised at least 20 concerns regarding the Environmental Impact Study (EIS) into the piggery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(12)(a) Is the Minister concerned that the public health risk was not addressed in the EIS, although required in the consultation section of the terms of reference, viz `The Division of Environment and Occupational Health in the Department of Health in respect of environmental issues'; (b) given inquiries to various sections of the Queensland Department of Health have revealed that this issue has not been addressed, why is this the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(13) Is the Minister concerned that such disease as Ross River Fever, Meningitis, E Coli, and Erysipelas may be associated with pig waste.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(14) Given that photographs of the proposed irrigation area on the Condamine River flood plain taken 3 weeks after rain show the area to be severely waterlogged: (a) would the Minister or the Environmental Protection Agency accept these photographs as evidence of the unsuitable nature of this flood plain to receive effluent from the development; and (b) what arrangements will be made for the disposal of effluent during the periods when the irrigation area is flooded, given local advice that this can be up to 3 or 4 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(15) (a) Is the Minister concerned that effluent from the piggery and abattoir may flow into the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin; (b) does this not contradict the Government's commitment to improving the quality of the Murray&hyphen;Darling River Basin; and (c) is it not better policy to prevent damaging inputs

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) I am aware that DanPork previously applied to develop a site near Scone in New South Wales and that the appropriate authorities regarded the site as inappropriate for the full scale proposal. I am not aware of what, if any, comments were made by a DanPork representative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) The proposal has been subject to environmental assessment under Queensland legislation and is subject to environmental conditions required by that State. These requirements are specific to the Pratten site and the attendant natural environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Public consultation was undertaken in accordance with the Queensland Local Government (Planning and Environment) Act 1990. This included press advertisements, public display of the Environmental Impact Statement, notices displayed on the affected property and written notice to adjacent landholders. In addition, DanPork's consultant wrote to residences within a 10 kilometre radius explaining the proposal and inviting comments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) (a) I am advised by my Department that this is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) In light of my previous answer, this is not a relevant question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) (a) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) There is no Commonwealth financial assistance for the proposal nor promise of such. I am not privy to any arrangements proposed by the State or local Governments, although I understand DanPork may be eligible for State programs which offers incentives for industrial development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) Warwick Shire does not make water allocations to primary producers, although it does supply water to industrial and commercial premises in addition to residences. I am advised that DanPork, whose primary business is an abattoir, will have water supplied to it by the Shire which also supplies water to other abattoirs in the Shire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) ISO14000 is an international standard which sets out the general principles for the development, content and review of Environmental Management Systems. It does not set the standards to be met in terms of environmental performance as would appear to be implied by this question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7)(a) I understand that the Queensland Department of Natural Resources is investigating the development of such a weir, which would be subject to assessment in accordance with Queensland legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) I am not aware of any Federal funding. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) I am advised that DanPork would be allocated the extra water yield provided by any weir.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) I am advised that detailed assessment of the groundwater and the overlying strata were examined in the Queensland assessment. The assessment concluded that the depth and type of the overlying aquitard, together with irrigation application rates limited to crop uptake rates of nutrient, should ensure no risk of effluent leaching into the underground water supplies. A network of bores has been established which will be used to monitor groundwater quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) Yes. The Environment Protection Group of my Department concluded its assessment of the proposal and I determined on 6 December 1996 that neither an Environmental Impact Statement nor a Public Environment Report was required for the proposal under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. This was in view of the assessment under Queensland legislation which satisfied the object of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10)(a) As far as can be ascertained, this report relates to an irrigated plantation near Wagga Wagga where treated municipal sewerage was used to irrigate fast growing gum trees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Site specific surveys and analyses were undertaken for water quality, salinity, sodicity, infiltration and drainage for the Pratten site during the Queensland assessment process. These surveys and analyses were reported in the Environmental Impact Statement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(11) My Department has informed me that the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industries and Energy had no concerns regarding the Environmental Impact Statement. However, I understand that the Queensland Department of Primary Industries had some concerns which were addressed to that Department's satisfaction during the Queensland assessment process. I am not aware of any concerns raised by staff of the CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(12)(a) and (b) I am advised that the regional environmental health officer in the Department of Health was consulted during the Queensland assessment process and did not consider that the proposal would constitute a risk to environmental health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(13) See (12).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(14)(a) I understand that the existing alluvium flats will be graded and properly drained so that significant surface waterlogging will not occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The effluent treatment dams will have a freeboard of 2 metres above their normal operating levels. This allows for temporary storage of effluent during periods when irrigation is not appropriate for up to ten weeks at maximum operation capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(15)(a), (b) and (c) The environmental assessment process undertaken by Queensland should

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) This question was answered in Ms Sullivan's response to questions asked at the Senate Estimates hearing of 17 September 1996 which was delivered to the Senate Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee secretariat on 10 October 1996. That response was "Mr Cadman contributed a chapter, called<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Biology</EMPHASIS> , to a publication, not a submission, prepared by the Tasmanian Conservation Trust and funded by National Estate Grants in 1989 and 1990. The grants were specifically to<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Survey Norfolk Range</EMPHASIS> , and to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Study National Estate Values in North West Tasmania.</EMPHASIS>  This material was eventually published in 1992 in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Forgotten Wilderness: North West Tasmania.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) The assessment process did not involve any person `sitting in review of his own study'.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="79"> Richardson. Further papers in the "Forgotten Wilderness", by Anthony Moscal (joint author of the botany chapter which refers to work by Kirkpatrick et al., Duncan &amp; Brown) and Dr Alastair Richardson were also referred to in the assessment of the nomination. In summary the work of three panel members was used in the assessment. This situation results from Tasmania having a relatively small pool of expert biologists and earth scientists, and the Commission's policy of choosing panel members for their scientific expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10)(a) The name Tarkine was given by the Australian Heritage Commission to an area entered into the Interim List in May 1995. The name was selected to avoid confusion relating to the fact that the large area in the north west Tasmanian region incorporated several already Registered areas, Pieman River State Reserve, listed in 1978, Sumac River Region, listed in 1988, and Norfolk Range and Savage River Region, both listed in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The name is derived from one of a number of Aboriginal bands forming the North&hyphen;west people prior to European occupation of Tasmania. At the time of Interim listing the name was in common usage to indicate the larger area then under consideration by the Commission. The name Tarkine was proposed by Commission staff to the Commission at meeting AHC 107 as an appropriate name for the amalgamated and extended area in north west Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tasmanian Aboriginal Land Council itself suggested the name of Tarkine, as being the name of one of the groups who used the area, and consented to its use.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Commonwealth Government is aiming for a target date of 1 July 1997 for corporatisation of the Snowy Mountains Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Government is aware that the Snowy River community and other interest groups have identified economic, social and environmental 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="80"> benefits of increasing flows in the Snowy River. The Government is also aware that the resulting reduction in diversions to the Murray-Darling basin would have economic, social and environmental costs, particularly for irrigators, and that the reduction in hydro-electric generation would have greenhouse implications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) The Commonwealth Government's policy with respect to environmental flows is in accordance with the Council of Australian Governments' agenda for the reform of water arrangements, under which, along with urban and rural water supply, the environment is recognised as a legitimate user of water. In relation to the Snowy River, as part of the corporatisation of the Snowy Scheme, the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian Governments have agreed to undertake an inquiry into measures through which the allocation of water stored within the Scheme might enhance the ecological sustainability of the rivers affected by the Scheme, including the Snowy River.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry will have regard to all relevant technical, economic, financial, environmental, agricultural and social considerations. It will also provide the opportunity to ascertain the broader impacts of any reduction in diversions to the Murray-Darling Basin resulting from environmental releases from the Scheme.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Government is aware that Ministers of the New South Wales and Victorian Governments responsible for water and environmental matters have made a number of statements in relation to environmental flows in the Snowy River. In my statement of 13 August this year, I welcomed the State Ministers' support for my call for a three-Government approach to examining environmental flows, including the impact on irrigation interests and broader impacts on the health of the Murray-Darling basin. The issues raised in these statements will be canvassed in the forthcoming inquiry. (See (4))</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) Yes, during the corporatisation process the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian Governments have maintained a continuing dialogue on water arrangements for the Snowy Scheme, which has included correspondence on the issue of environmental flows in the Snowy River.
