<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These amendments relate to rental assistance, and we spoke at some length about them on the last occasion that we were in the Senate. Essentially, the argument was that those people who are living with families within public housing, where their income is taken into account for the purpose of determining the rent, should still be entitled to rental assistance; that to take away rental assistance, while also taking into account their income for the purpose of assessing their rent under the state's assessment of their rent, would be inequitable.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the adjournment of the debate on Thursday, Senator Neal asked me a question about the proposition which I raised in debate: that those who are subletting in public housing often pay more than the total rent that is payable. You asked me some questions about that, if you recall, Senator Neal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My statement was based on anecdotal evidence that my department has gathered across its network that this is a fairly common occurrence, but it is not the only basis on which that statement was made. I understand 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from my department that the information that many subtenants pay more rent than the main tenant pays to the state housing authority comes from pilot review activity. In preparation for the introduction of measures such as these, the department does preparatory work, pilot studies and reviews. This review found that 100 per cent of those claiming rent assistance claimed more than the rent which would be paid to the state housing authority by a couple on a social security payment with a dependent child or would be paid by a sole parent with a dependent child.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to understand that, irrespective of whether the subtenant pays more or pays less than the total rent that is payable on the house, that household is receiving a double subsidy if they receive rent assistance at all. Some people will not be paying any rent to the head tenant and they will not be getting any rent assistance, so there is only one subsidy there. They may be paying only a very small amount of rent, and there will be no entitlement to rent assistance there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can give some examples which I think indicate the people who will be caught by this measure and the rationale for their being caught up in it. If you have a single, unemployed social security customer who is over 21 living with a parent in public housing, she will be receiving a maximum newstart allowance of $160.75 a week. As a result of declaring the daughter's income, the parents' rent would increase by an amount depending on the different rules in each state. I understand that my department has circulated to the parties a table which demonstrates&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="NEAL" NAMEID="B36">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="B36">Senator Neal</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I haven't received anything yet.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understood that it had been circulated. I am sorry if you have not received it, but I can give you the information that I wanted you to have. In New South Wales, Victoria and the Northern Territory, the rent will increase by 20 per cent of the daughter's income, if it is declared, of course. If the state housing authority have the increased income declared to them, the rent will increase by 20 per cent of the daughter's income in New South Wales, Victoria and the Northern Territory. In Western Australia, it is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7060"> 25 per cent, but in Queensland, South Australia and the ACT it is only 10 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, for example, parents were charging their daughter $70 a week, which is not an unusual amount, certainly in several states, for the rent of a room, the maximum rent assistance of $24.90 per week is payable. The household will be receiving a subsidised rent, but the daughter will also be receiving $24.90 a week. So there are the two subsidies. In Queensland, South Australia and the ACT, the rent assistance of $24.90 which the daughter receives exceeds the increase in rent that they will be charged of $16 a week. So the household will get $9 more a week in rent assistance than they are asked to pay in additional rent. That surely is inequitable to the taxpayers, and it is inequitable to renters because renters in the private market receive no subsidised rent and then only receive a percentage of their rent in rent assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I gave an example in which $70 a week might have been charged. If the daughter pays $60 a week in rent, she will get $18 a week in rent assistance. Parents living in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia would pay $32.15 in extra rent and, therefore, the family rent would go up by a net $14. But, in the same case in Queensland, South Australia and the ACT, the family rent would in fact go down by a net $2, and that is the difference between the extra rent and the rent assistance. I am trying to demonstrate why it is an equitable and a reasonable measure&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The circumstances in which these changes were proposed by the government in its most recent budget are fair and equitable as between taxpayers and those who receive 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> taxpayer's assistance, and as between tenants in private and public rental. It is surely not unreasonable that two subsidies should not be payable into the same household for the same purpose&mdash;namely, housing.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I really find it quite extraordinary that the minister was scratching around last week unable to find supporting evidence and so used the term `anecdotal'. Any of us can race out and claim that someone said to us that this was the situation. But that certainly is not evidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister now claims to have made this second pilot study available but, despite having had the whole weekend to make it available to the opposition for proper scrutiny, she has not done so. Certainly, I would like to examine the methodology of this survey: what it really shows, where it was taken, what the sample was, whether it indicates isolated examples which support the minister's particular prejudiced view or whether it shows that this is the case as a more general rule. I must say that the failure of this minister to provide that survey for examination or scrutiny in any reasonable time scale seems to indicate that it may not hold up under any sort of scrutiny. I would suggest that it really does not bode well for the democratic processes of this chamber to see this occur in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking briefly at the example which the minister provided, it seems quite extraordinary that, having searched all the possible examples of these types of circumstances, the worst example which the minister can come up with is one that shows this unemployed young person living in a family where people are either on social security or are in very low income situations, and who could be potentially $8 worse off.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="B36">Senator NEAL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right; that is what you alleged. I really feel that the minister, for all the evidence that she claims she had last time, is not building a very good argument if all she can show is that, on a worst case analysis, a person could be $9 better off. I suppose it does allow us to look at the opposite view. If the reverse were true then, by my 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7061"> calculations, the whole household will be $9 better off but, in a situation where this comes into effect, it appears to me&mdash;and maybe the department could confirm this&mdash;that the household would in fact be approximately $16 worse off. Is that correct?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clearly, I had better read them out again. In the case where a daughter pays $50 a week to her parents, the rent assistance payable will be $10.50 a week. If she pays $60 a week, the rent assistance payable will be $18 a week. If she pays $70 a week, the maximum rent assistance of $24.90 a week is payable. In Queensland, South Australia and the ACT, the rent assistance of $24.90 which the daughter receives exceeds the increase in rent of $16 a week. So, the household receives $9 a week more in rent assistance than they are being asked to pay in additional rent.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You support exactly my argument. Under your example, because that daughter was living in the household, it would have to pay an additional $16 rental. But if this proposed amendment put by the government is carried, she would no longer receive rental assistance. So, as a result of this change, a low income family living in public housing&mdash;hardly the high fliers of the Australian community&mdash;would be $16 worse off under your example.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course that is right, because we do not believe that it is equitable that people should be receiving subsidies from the taxpayer for the same housing twice over, and they do not get twice over in private rental. The majority of people on low incomes&mdash;people on social security&mdash;are renting in the private sector. So if the same daughter was paying that amount of money to the same parents in private rental and all the circumstances were the same, there would not be that second subsidy. Why should it be payable when they happen to be renting a public house?</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the ALP, I am not convinced by the figures that have been put before us. I find it extremely unlikely that somebody on newstart would be contributing $70 a week rent to a household under those circumstances. I can imagine that that $70 might be handed over to the family for board and other matters but I think it is extremely unlikely that it would be a contribution to rent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My question to the minister is: how many people were part of the pilot review which was conducted? Is it possible to provide the Senate with details of the findings of that review? Also, has there been a chance now for the government to re&hyphen;examine what I understand were savings of $57 million associated with this change? I have been talking with a number of housing advocacy groups who say that, at most, they think this is likely to be worth at least $4 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One again, as I said in my speech on the second reading, this seems like a sledgehammer approach to matters. It is by no means clear that what is turning out to be a bit of a witch&hyphen;hunt is actually going to expose any rorting at all. I just ask the minister if she could perhaps confirm some details about that pilot review and let the Senate know what was in it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to run through this example again because, even though the minister went through the example, she does not really seem to appreciate the impact of it. The example that you have given was of a young woman aged 21 living at home and receiving an income of $160. Because she is living in that household in public housing, the family is required to pay an additional $32 in rent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In some states.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="B36">Senator NEAL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In New South Wales, where most public housing tenants would come from. Bearing in mind that she only earns $160, it would probably be pretty difficult to earn much from rental assistance. If she paid $70&mdash;that is, almost half her income&mdash;she would receive a maximum of $24.90 rental assistance. That means that, even on your example, that household would be receiving less in rental assistance than they are paying&mdash;$7.10 less.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have to look at the reverse side of the coin. That is what I was trying to emphasise earlier, Minister. If you achieve the measure that you are proposing, a family in the example that you have provided would still be paying an additional $32 in public rental housing and would not be receiving any rental assistance. So they would be $24.90 worse off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is where the sting in the tail is of all this. It does bring about budget savings. We save $57 million by what is proposed to be done by this government, but that $57 million comes straight out of the pockets of low income families who are struggling to keep their families together and who usually have young people with them who are struggling to get work, so they can provide them with moral support, and to some extent financial support as well. That is a pretty poor proposition. I think it is reasonable, where they are losing money and paying additional rent because of their income, that they also receive rental assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am on my feet I would like to deal with one other issue that was raised by the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7063"> minister late in debate last week. This was the view that this measure was justified because some people acted fraudulently and did not declare the income that they were earning. I must confess that my view is very much that, if there is fraud occurring, fraud should be pursued and rooted out. But I do not believe that people who honestly apply for the benefits that they are entitled to should be punished because of the minister's anecdotal view that there are people committing fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure there are some people who commit fraud. You can always find some in the system. But I do not believe that the way to deal with fraud is to punish those who are acting honestly, which is exactly what this measure does. I certainly am of the strong view that we should not be double punishing those people who stay together in families, even in a situation where older children are living at home and the total rent payable by the family has increased. I believe that they are still entitled to rental assistance and that to take away this measure would be totally unfair and un&hyphen;Australian.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the review found that 24 per cent of people in public housing dwellings were receiving rent assistance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose we have a basic disagreement with the opposition because they propose an amendment which would continue what we believe is an inequitable situation. It is inequitable that two amounts of public subsidy should go to somebody who is fortunate enough to be able to access public housing. The three times as many people who are renting on low incomes but who pay high rents in the private sector have no opportunity for the taxpayer to call twice with their subsidy. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our proposal is fair because it ensures that all low income renters receive

We do not believe it is equitable that public tenants should get the benefits of two subsidies on their housing. We do not think it is fair to the taxpayer to be paying two subsidies on the one house. Therefore, I commend the government's direction. I have tried to provide the extra information that was required. If Senator Allison still requires further information I will try to get it but it would mean adjourning the debate.

I think you put your finger on this whole debate in what you have just said, and that is that somehow there is an unfair advantage going to people who are in public housing. This kind of thinking has driven this whole debate about housing so far. It is most unfortunate. It suggests that housing in this country should be along the welfare lines approach&mdash;that only those who are the most desperate should have access to public housing and that somehow they have to be punished for the fact that there is not enough to go around for those in the private sector.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As honourable senators would probably be aware, there are four categories of audit in division 2. The first, in section 15, gives the Auditor&hyphen;General the ability to conduct a performance audit of an agency at any time. The second and third categories relate to Commonwealth authorities and subsidiaries and Commonwealth companies and subsidiaries. Sections 16 and 17 outline the Auditor&hyphen;General's power with regard to performance audit of these bodies. Whilst there is an exclusion in subsection (1) of both sections preventing the Auditor&hyphen;General from conducting a performance audit of a government business enterprise at any time, subclause (2) in both sections gives the responsible minister, the Minister for Finance or the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit the ability to request such an audit. As indicated in my speech on the second reading, I will be

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth category of audit relates to a review or examination of a particular aspect of the operations of the whole or a part of the Commonwealth public sector. Unfortunately, the definition of Commonwealth public sector excludes government business enterprises, and I think this is totally inappropriate.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment refers to the assessment of commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence claims. As Labor senators well know from the committees on which they have had a very active participation, the whole area of outsourcing, privatisation, contracting out and tendering is starting to worry parliament and its committees, the Senate and its committees, very much. Questioning at various committees and hearings has indicated an alarming and unnecessary increase, in our view, in the exclusion of government expenditure and contracts from parliamentary scrutiny through the device of commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence claims. Government agencies are now adopting the practice of automatically offering commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence protection without even being requested to do so by tenderers and contractors. It is a process and protection that is extravagantly used and widely abused.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Members of the Senate may know that I have considerable business experience and considerable negotiating experience, and it is profoundly foolish for anybody in that situation to offer up something which gives away something on your side when it is unnecessary to do so. Persons in the public sector, some of them quite senior, are, in all innocence sometimes, thinking that they are being helpful in the process of generating interest and responsiveness in this area when in fact what they are doing is severely curtailing the ability of the parliament to examine commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lundy and I were absolutely astonished to hear at a committee hearing the persons responsible for putting out indications of interest on computer matters saying that they had automatically sent out a notice that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7068"> those responding could get commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence and that they would be protected across the whole range of things. This is an extremely dangerous process that is starting to become a practice, and this amendment is designed to deal with it. The amendment of clause 23A will set in place a system whereby the Auditor&hyphen;General, who is the important public accountability agent of the parliament, will be responsible for determining whether or not information should be subject to public release.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this amendment the Auditor&hyphen;General and not the Attorney&hyphen;General, who is a politician as well as a legal officer, will be responsible for determining either that information not be disclosed in order to protect the commercial interests of any body or person or that the information is in the public interest and must be publicly released and presented to parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment clause also requires that the Auditor&hyphen;General give reasons for his or her decision in their report. This is consistent with administrative principles well established under the previous government, which requires that reasons for decisions be provided. It also acts as a check on the Auditor&hyphen;General's actions as it demands that the auditor focuses his or her mind on the basis for their decision and that their decision must be backed by the requirement set out in the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My amendment refers to all audits done by the Auditor&hyphen;General under part IV but excludes reports under section 20, where the Auditor&hyphen;General may enter into an arrangement on a fee for service basis. Where the Auditor&hyphen;General encounters a commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence clause in any arrangement between a Commonwealth entity and any other body or person, including another Commonwealth entity for the provision of goods and services to or on behalf of that entity, the Auditor&hyphen;General must include in the report an assessment of the commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence requirement. We as a Senate must have that information. We as a parliament must have that information on behalf of the people. We cannot be locked out in the process of private

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Government business enterprises are included among the bodies whose arrangements may be scrutinised under this clause. There is no power in my amendment provisions for the Auditor&hyphen;General to make recommendations about how parliament might deal with commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence material. It is up to parliament to determine its procedures, and that is quite proper. We have, within parliament, the ability to hear matters in confidence, in camera and in a manner which protects people, institutions, companies and persons appropriately. There are arguments about commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence which are frequently pitted against an individual's rights once competitive tender arrangements come into play. But, frankly, we as a Senate must err on the side of the public. We must err on the side of public interest, not on the side of private interest, mateship and persons who benefit from exclusion, secrecy and connivance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that there is a broader transparency of the service standards expected from the contractor. The New Zealand experience also provides a useful precedent in contracting out in commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence clauses. In 1989, when their state owned enterprises, which are the equivalent of our government business enterprises, were established, the administrative package of the ombudsman, freedom of information, privacy and the Auditor&hyphen;General was extended to cover activities of these new enterprises. The New Zealand experience has shown this to be important in the maintenance of public confidence in and the probity of these activities. Significantly in New Zealand, all contracts are public documents with only the detail of the schedule of costs being omitted. The operator must be able to prove commercial prejudice if it does not wish to disclose such details.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public interest in transparency is primary. Our role as a Senate is to protect the public interest; that is what this is about. It is fundamental that the public are given worthwhile information about how the public's money is being used and its affairs conducted,

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence is becoming the mantra of the 1990s. It is going to be tried on more and more as more and more government services are outsourced and government goods and services are produced by private enterprise. As I mentioned before, that should mean more accountability rather than less. The amendments put by Senator Murray are helpful in this regard. In the end it means that if there were a challenge to the ruling it would fall back perhaps to the Australian Administrative Appeals Tribunal and that is probably an appropriate way for that to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the way things are operating now, private companies providing services and business entities associated with government simply have to throw up the words `commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence' and it is not challenged. In reality the definition that is accepted by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is quite specific and many of the throwaway lines and statements not just by companies and by government business enterprises but also by government when they do not want to give information to the Senate would well be challengeable under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We simply cannot have a situation where we are moving in one direction, where much more of taxpayers' money is being allocated to the private sector to provide services and where those simple words, commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence, are stopping the accountability of how that money is being spent. It is simply not enough to suggest that waiting to perhaps review a contract is going to be good enough; it is not. It is not clear and it is not accountable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment of Senator Murray touches on an important issue in accountability: that of commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence information associated with government activity. There has been, as Senator Murray has referred to, a significant increase over the years in the practice of governments claiming that information cannot be provided, for example to Senate estimates committees, due to its commercial nature. While this is no doubt necessary and proper in many cases, it can lead to the impression that full disclosure has not been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment proposes that, where the AG is aware of an arrangement between the Commonwealth and a commercial body and that arrangement includes a requirement that some information must be treated as commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence, the AG must make a decision about whether or not the information should be treated as commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence and include such information in the relevant audit report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again the amendment which covers an important area imposes strict conditions on the AG we note without any concrete outcome. The amendment forces the AG to come to an opinion about whether information should have been considered to be commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence, but not granting the AG any additional powers into whether or not the information should be published.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have come to the conclusion that this provision may impose a massive workload on the AG without actually securing any increase in public disclosure of information. Therefore, we will not be supporting the amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (1.31 p.m.)&mdash;The coalition will not be supporting the amendment. I think Senator Sherry has raised the concern that we have that this requires that, if the Auditor-General becomes aware of such an arrangement, then he has no alternative but to spend time considering that arrangement, even if the arrange

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may well be an unintended consequence of what Senator Murray is seeking to do, but it is worth pointing out that the Auditor-General already has an unfettered access to all of these accounts and records. So, if he finds such an arrangement, it will not be hidden from him and he even has the right to use that sort of analysis that he might find in these arrangements as the basis of parts of his report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt in the government's mind that, should the Auditor&hyphen;General be required to do this by the legislation, it would create an enormous burden which, as Senator Sherry has quite rightly said, is unlikely to improve the outcome from the parliament's point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know Senator Murray is thorough in these things, but I am not sure whether he has discussed it with the Auditor-General. I would imagine that he may have. If he has not, I would be fairly certain that the Auditor&hyphen;General would regard this as not a way to increase his powers or increase the information he is able to provide to the parliament. In fact, quite the contrary; that it would adversely affect the implementation of his duties and would create an enormous burden upon what are necessarily restricted resources.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very convenient excuse. The reason I say that is that often governments and the executive of government makes that decision.

The chamber cannot do it because it will involve commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would think that these amendments are seeking to remove that excuse so that you will not have somebody who does not go through that process making that decision, as has happened with ANL and other government business enterprises during the term of the previous government. The executive government off the top of its head, and without going through this process, made the decision. They threw back to the chamber that

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might be one of few people in the chamber today&mdash;although there may be persons outside&mdash;who has actually had experience as an auditor. Amongst the many things I have done, this is one of them. I was an auditor for the government, although not this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should have a look at the fallaciousness of the arguments against this amendment proposed so far and perhaps proposed in a little bit of ignorance, rather than through any desire to score points. The amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If, in preparing a report under this Part&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What happens with any auditing process is that very few auditors anywhere, because of sheer volume of work to be examined, do a complete and thorough audit of every single aspect of the entity under the microscope. They do a sample, indicative or test audit in those areas in which they think there may be a concern or a need to have a look at the information before them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7071">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The auditors are doing that and, as a matter of course, they will then come across contracts, arrangements, memorandums of understanding or any other form of commercial agreement between the government and the private sector as an example. They are going to report on that. In other words, they have already looked at that contract. This is not a new exercise. This is not going out and examining every single contract there is. They have looked at the contract. In doing so they will have formed an opinion, because that is what auditors have to do; they have to form an opinion.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What the amendment says is that if, in reporting a report&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Auditor-General becomes aware of an arrangement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">in other words, they have looked at a document and become aware of an arrangement and&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the arrangement includes a requirement that any information in connection with the arrangement be treated as commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence information;&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">in other words, in the normal carrying&hyphen;out of their duties they have identified the contract and within the contract they have identified that there is a commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence clause&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Auditor-General must determine whether in his or her opinion, the requirement that information be treated as commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence information is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">appropriate in the circumstances;</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So they have been doing the normal audit; they have seen the contract; they have looked in the contract and seen the commercial-in-confidence clause; and they say to themselves that it is or is not appropriate, that it is or is not necessary to prevent unfairly prejudicing the commercial interests of any body or person and that it is or is not in the public interest. There is no extra work, Senator Sherry; no extra work, Senator Campbell. That is what auditing is. I see the parliamentary secretary shaking his head. I am fairly certain that, in his varied background, he has not been an auditor, and I have. The amendment goes on:</PARA>

We are not requiring them through this process to examine every single contract and every single piece of paper between government and the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I concede that Labor has already declared its hand here and I understand what the parliamentary secretary has said. Generally speaking, I expect government to reject automatically just about everything that comes before it. But it is a great shame that the government has not thought through this process and has not accepted its responsibility for the public interest, which I believe is being abrogated as a result of new practices which are emerging from the intensified focus on tendering, on contracting&hyphen;out, on privatisation and on all the additional interactions with the private sector that have been occurring over the last few years.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Greens (WA) amendment 3 on sheet 659 deals with what we believe is one of the most fundamental elements of this package of bills. It is my belief that clause 37, subclause (3), is a major challenge to the independence of parliament and the ability of parliament and parliamentary committees to determine how sensitive issues are handled. This is a challenge to the parliament's ability to effectively scrutinise activities of government and to keep them accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular subclause also implies that the parliament cannot be trusted. You have to understand that we are entrusted to make laws. We are entrusted to change the way 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> companies operate in Australia, the way resources are dealt with and the way education, and so on, is dealt with. Somehow or other, that subclause is saying that parliament cannot be entrusted to deal with issues that deal with accountability where that accountability moves into the company sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When read in conjunction with subclause (2) of clause 37, subclause (3) becomes extraordinarily broad. It means that sensitive information such as issues of national security, cabinet deliberations, Commonwealth-state relations, or commercial interest, or issues associated with possible judicial proceedings&mdash;let us face it, it could be anything&mdash;can be withheld from the parliament by the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that we had this debate a very short while ago on Senator Murray's amendment. Suddenly we said, `The Auditor-General can't be forced to do this.'

However, to then take that question one step further by incorporating a clause that says that the Auditor-General cannot be required, and is not permitted, to disclose to the parliament or to a parliamentary committee information that is prohibited from being included in public reports is a major attack on the rights of parliament to scrutinise the executive, and it displays a major lack of trust in the ability of parliamentary committees in particular to be able to handle such information in a sensitive manner.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the reasons why this is of particular interest to me right at this stage in the debate is that, in the previous amendment, when we talked about whether or not the Auditor-General could make decisions in a clear process about what needed to be kept back from parliamentary or public purview, it was the minister who stood and said, `What Senator Margetts is not acknowledging is that the Auditor-General has the right to access all of the documents once they get access to the audit.' This is exactly why I believe it was necessary to at least have this debate. Here we have what puts the shackles on the ability of that information going out to be in the public arena in any way, including through parliamentary process in confidence, if that is necessary. </PARA></TALK.START>

That really puts quite a conflict in relation to this, if the Auditor-General cannot be required and is not permitted to disclose to the parliament or to a parliamentary committee information that is prohibited from being included in public reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, we are saying that you do not want the Auditor-General to make the decision based on a clear set of guidelines; you do not want to leave it to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; you would like to keep it with executive decision making&mdash;and not only would you like to keep it with executive decision making but so would the ALP. The ALP are looking at their watches, tapping their feet and thinking, `Well, who knows what will happen with an election.' If there is an election, due to whatever reason&mdash;double dissolution or whatever&mdash;they might find themselves in the same position of wanting executive government to be able to restrict that kind of information not just from going out to the public, but even from going into the parliamentary processes by which we can know whether or not we can exclude perhaps misappropriation from a process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is all very well for the government to say, `Everything is aboveboard, trust us, but we can't show you because there are certain elements to it'&mdash;and they would include just about anything, as I say, including cabinet deliberations. All I can say is that it is a real problem and it will be an ongoing problem with those people who truly do believe that parliament should not be able to have accountability with the expenditure of public money and that executive privilege, if you like, is suitable in deciding whether or not such issues should, in fact, ever get to the parliamentary process for parliamentary scrutiny in any way, shape or form.</PARA>

As all senators will know, Senator Watson has a very longstanding interest in the superannuation industry and possesses a great deal of knowledge. I can report that it has been a super year for super both in terms of asset growth and growth in contributions. This has been one of our best years for superannuation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Total superannuation assets grew by some 20 per cent during 1996&hyphen;97 or a very impressive $1 billion per week. Superannuation assets have crashed through the $300 billion mark for the first time&mdash;a very dramatic figure indeed and a very dramatic achievement. Contributions rose by 12 per cent to about $29.5 billion and, on average, I am advised that Australians put more than $500 million into superannuation every week during 1996-97. Member contributions rose 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by 17 per cent and employer contributions rose by 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These statistics that I have indicated verify the feedback that I have been getting from the industry and funds during my contact with them in recent months. I generally ask how the year has been, and the answer from these practitioners always ranges from `good' to `very good' to `excellent'. I am aware that there have been accusations that government policy has damaged confidence in superannuation. For example, I think one of the most extreme and probably silly comments in this regard came from Senator Sherry, who is on record as saying that every action the government has taken has had the effect of wrecking confidence.</PARA>

Senator Sherry went on to say, `He has been cutting my hair for 18 years.' I do not know who it was, whether it was Stefan or Johann or whoever, but Senator Sherry said that his hairdresser's confidence in the superannuation system was undermined. Clearly, Senator Sherry should go further afield to get his advice. I think we can say, Senator Sherry, that they may have given you a nice haircut, but they gave you lousy advice on superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry talked about `wrecking confidence'. Surely, in the light of the statistics which have come out today, even Senator Sherry could not believe those words. Since this government came into office in March 1996, superannuation assets have grown by some $58 billion or virtually 25 per cent. Senator Sherry was wrong, and is wrong again.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to answer the interjection I heard to the question, the fires largely result, as I understand it, from Indonesia making available rather more than usual degraded forest to be converted into plantations this year.

Can I say that the price range for the Telstra share offer was set after long and detailed consideration by the government. The consideration was based on the comprehensive professional advice of global coordinators for the float and endorsed by the government's financial adviser to the sale. The government has accepted the recommendations, I am advised by the Minister for Finance, of the global coordinators. The price range itself is entirely consistent with the overwhelming majority of market valuations of Telstra undertaken by the world's leading investment analysts.

Earlier this year I attended the launch of the Jawoyn's five&hyphen;year plan. This mining policy is another step in their moves towards self&hyphen;empowerment and it marks a new approach to the mining industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Crane for his question. I am aware of these concerns and indeed I met with the Plastics and Chemicals Industries Association and the Australian Toy Association last Friday and discussed this matter with them. This matter has been around for some time. There is concern that phthalates could be linked to endocrine disruption or interference with the human hormonal system. It is believed that endocrine disruptors could be linked to problems with organs such as kidneys and, because of this concern, the government will assess developments very carefully. When the issue was first drawn to my attention some weeks ago I immediately referred the matter to the relevant specialist federal government agencies. In the case of PVC products, including toys, I made a referral to the therapeutic goods administration in the Department of Health and Family Services. I also made a reference to WorkSafe Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that research into human endocrine disruptors, including phthalates, is internationally at a developmental stage and as yet there are no generally accepted testing measures for this group of chemicals. Efforts are currently under way at an international level to coordinate research efforts and to define the extent of any possible impact that endocrine disruptors might have on human 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7086"> and environmental health. I can assure the Senate and consumers that the therapeutic goods administration is monitoring the developmental research work which is taking place overseas into endocrine disruptors and will continue to keep me informed as information comes to hand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Government Analytical Laboratory have advised that they do not have a standard test for phthalates in PVC products and they are not aware of any other laboratories in Australia having such a test. I understand that this matter is also on the agenda for discussion at the annual conference of endocrinologists in Australia later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This matter has gained some publicity over recent days due to a media campaign by Greenpeace both here in Australia and in the United Kingdom and the United States. I understand that Greenpeace has suggested that the dominant phthalate in toys has been shown to be toxic when ingested by animals. A study published this year entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The oestrogenic activity of phthalate esters in in&hyphen;vitro environmental health perspectives</EMPHASIS> was quoted by Greenpeace in support of its concerns. I should point out to the Senate that the study went on to make some comments that Greenpeace did not include in its statements last week, and I quote:</PARA>

Over the past 3&half; years I have claimed an average of just over three nights TA in Hobart for carrying out my duties and responsibilities, first as Parliamentary Secretary to the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and now as the shadow finance minister in this country. It is not unreasonable that, as a senator who owns a house in Burnie, I should spend three nights in Hobart in Tasmania, the capital of the state. Why would I spend three nights every month in the state capital of Tasmania? That is not an unreasonable position. Hobart is the capital. The statewide media are located there and most of the major organisations are located in Hobart, the capital. Why wouldn't I have been in Hobart carrying out my responsibilities as shadow finance minister and as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The year 1995-96&mdash;and my Tasmanian colleagues know this&mdash;was a particularly busy year. Have you forgotten the forestry industry dispute?

Anything my minister, Bob Collins, asked me to do, I did for him, no matter what it required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the requirements of a minister for primary industries and energy. Let us have a look at Senator Brownhill. He has very similar responsibilities to those I had.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7088"> state capital, from 11 March last year to 28 February this year. That is more nights than I spent on average in the last 3&half; years. Senator Brownhill clocked up 213 nights in his first year. I clocked up 192 nights. Senator Brownhill has exactly the same sorts of responsibilities and duties as I had.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have here is a spineless and gutless government that go up to the press gallery and put out dirt sheets but not making any specific allegation.

Have a listen to this: for the entire executive, only ministers Kim Beazley and Senator Bolkus claimed more in travel allowance than Senator Sherry. He even claimed more than the minister he was representing, Senator Bob Collins. Does that mean he was overclaiming or does that mean the minister he was representing was underperforming?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Something we should put on the record for everyone to listen to is that some members and senators around here want to get reaudited five times because they have made a great profit out of it.

It is only when there is a repeated pattern, an absolute pattern of mistakes going into the 20s, 30s and 40s, that the believability of inadvertence has to be questioned and tested. We should at least put that benchmark down before we all get too carried away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to debate Senator Sherry or anyone on this side or anyone on your side, it has to be on the basis of evidence, not on the basis of the sorts of cowardly assertions that have been made.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For instance, they said that Senator Sherry had attended the Gold Coast on nine occasions. Did anyone ask him to check his diary? He has checked it. The fact is that nine apple and pear grower conferences and all those sorts of official functions were in the diary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that on the surface if Senator Ray, as defence minister, went up to the Gold Coast four times it would be suspicious. But if you knew that the Canungra base was there and that I would naturally go there for the various staff get-togethers once a year you would understand it.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, the cover-up was in the Prime Minister's office. The fix was in the Prime Minister's office. Mr Sutherland said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Isn't this marvellous? We have a motion to suspend standing orders to deal with a notice of motion which, if adopted, will result in our being accused of agreeing to gross violations of human rights. We had Senator Lees saying that she wants this motion to be taken as formal so it can be voted upon without discussing it at all. Now she wants us to suspend standing orders. The motion to suspend standing orders has to be sustained on the basis of the urgent necessity of the business for which the suspension should be held. What is that business? That business is, according to Senators Lees, Payne, Schacht, Allison and Crowley, that the Senate recognises the dedication of the Thai and Vietnamese governments as they work towards achieving their&mdash;that is, the governments'&mdash;population and community development goals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The target&hyphen;driven population control program in Vietnam is almost as bad as that in the PRC, where there are forced abortions and sterilisations. Let me refer to some of those. It has been suggested that we deal with this matter. If we do, we would be accused of supporting the violations of women's rights in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have here a recent report relating to Vietnam's population control program. It says that women who give birth to a third child were fined an average of 10 months income in rice. They were also denied land to grow crops and the child was not registered. We are being asked by these people to endorse that sort of policy and program. Yes, they were denied crops and the child was not registered, which would exclude it from any later privileges offered by government, including education and land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is plenty more. If you look at the resolution on population and family planning of the Communist Party of Vietnam's central committee&mdash;I am speaking from an original document&mdash;you will see that there are targets

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are being asked to deal with this particular motion as a formal motion without debate.

This is an effort to stall a legitimate motion from being debated in the Senate today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion is as legitimate as others that get the nod for debate in here. The truth of the matter is that Senator Harradine does not endorse the content of this motion, which is supportive of the programs of family planning in countries to our north, because he does not believe in family planning programs. He does 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7100"> not believe in education programs which allow people to plan families of their own liking, to have some self-determination of their destiny, to have some control in their lives, and allow women, in particular, to have access to education and contraceptive advice so that they can reshape their future. The best thing to do is to put it under the carpet, suppress it, not debate it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lees is simply saying that here is an opportunity to endorse a different point of view in this place. For goodness sake, this motion talks about supporting the preventative measures in Thailand against the scourge of HIV. On the last figures I saw, three million people in that country are carrying the virus. It is an enormous cause of death and suffering, not least among young people and not least among young women in Thailand. `But let us not debate it,' says Senator Harradine, `Let us put it off.' He does not agree with the process here. This is an urgent matter if you are in Thailand and it is an urgent matter if you are one of the three million people there carrying the virus. This is a matter where you should expect some support from a nation like Australia, which has had some success in turning around the scourge of this virus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a legitimate debate. It is a proper process that Senator Lees is following. Let us have the debate. If not&mdash;and Senator Harradine has had his opportunity&mdash;what is the alternative he gives to Senator Lees? When does he want it debated? He simply wants to put it off into the wild blue yonder so that the matter does not get a fair airing here. We know what his program is. It is suppress, ignore, turn your back on the horrendous population problems that exist to the north of this country. This is an entirely legitimate procedure. I would expect as a Democrat that Senator Harradine will support the suspension of standing orders so that we can have a debate in this chamber on this motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the Public Service Bill is a very significant piece of legislation, because it introduces new public service legislation after 75 years; it redefines the nature of public service legislation, and it embodies a new conceptual framework for public sector management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the JCPA supports the need for the 1922 Act to be replaced, and favours simplification, modernisation and the more accessible format of the Bill, the review has identified a number of areas where improvements can be made. Madam President, I will briefly highlight some of those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, Madam President, let me say that the Committee strongly agrees with the commitment given by Minister Reith in his second reading speech that merit will remain a cornerstone of public service employment. In support of this, the Committee believes that the definition of `merit' should not be relegated to subordinate legislation as is proposed, but should be enshrined in the Bill itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the Committee is pleased to see that APS Values have been spelt out in the bill. In some cases, however, the values do not go far enough.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the Values require that advice given by APS employees will be timely. The Committee believes that advice needs to be more than timely. It needs to be frank, honest, comprehensive and accurate, as well as timely. The Committee therefore recommends that reference to these qualities be included in the Values clause.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the issue of workplace diversity programs, Madam President, the Committee has made a number of recommendations about the reporting requirements for workplace diversity programs, which we believe will ensure that the programs fulfil their goals of ensuring that the APS is free from discrimination, and recognises the diverse backgrounds of APS employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, on the issue of protection for whistleblowers, the Committee believes that there are considerable limitations to any whistleblowers protection scheme being based within the Public Service Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is concerned that APS employees may not be prepared to make reports if they believe that adequate protection is not available. The Committee has therefore recommended that the Government should consider introducing whistleblowers protection along similar lines to that which already exists for the public sector in other Australian jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Were such legislation to be introduced, the whistleblowers clause should be removed from the Public Service Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps the most contentious clause in the Bill, Madam President, was clause 33, which entitles an APS employee to a review of any APS action which relates to his or her employment. The Committee found a high level of dissatisfaction with the proposed regulations as set out in draft subordinate legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This dissatisfaction stemmed partly from the very detailed nature of the draft Regulations, which were considered by many witnesses to be confusing, and partly from the role given to the Public Service Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a perception the Commissioner lacks independence in reviewing APS employment decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, a review mechanism which builds on the current model of a separate statutory officer within the structure of the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission may offer a more independent review process than is proposed. In the JCPA's view, such a separation seems a sensible solution to a complex issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should mention that the review revealed a number of issues on which JCPA members have not been able to agree. These differences of opinion, which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7102"> were the result of fundamentally divergent policy approaches, are highlighted in the report for the information of Senators and Members.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An advisory Report on the Public Service Bill 1997 and the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997</EMPHASIS>  is a slap in the face for the government. Mr Reith took the initiative to refer the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R269">Public Service Bill 1997</XREF>  and its accompanying <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R270">Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in the expectation, I am sure, that the committee on which the government has the numbers would give it a big tick. To its credit the committee has not given the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R269">Public Service Bill 1997</XREF>  a big tick. It has given it a big question mark. The committee members were persuaded by the vast majority of witnesses who appeared before it that there were serious defects in the bill that must be remedied if the Public Service is not to be irreparably damaged. The committee made 20 recommendations going to these defects. Regrettably, a number of them are rather minimalist. I signal now that the opposition will be going much further than the committee recommendations in the amendments that we will be moving to the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Public Service Bill 1997  seeks to simplify the Public Service Act 1922 and incorporate into the public sector the government's industrial relations changes. But it goes much further. It is, in fact, radical reform in the guise of evolutionary change. The committee was rightly concerned that many of the government's proposals carried with them a high degree of risk of undermining the qualities and traditions that have made the Public Service one of our great national institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Public Service is very well regarded nationally and internationally. It has served governments of both political colours exceptionally and equally well. But most 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> importantly, for a public service, it has served the country well. It has a fine tradition of apolitical professionalism. It is not as though it is in need of a radical shake&hyphen;up. It is an institution that a government tampers with not only at its own peril but also at the nation's peril.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concerns that emerged so strongly through the submissions that were made to the committee and from the many witness that appeared before it were not surprising. These concerns are identified in the committee's report on page 17, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Bill would:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> significantly <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">weaken the parliament</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The committee's recommendations are aimed at limiting the risk of these consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has recommended that the bill explicitly recognise the Public Service's accountability to government, parliament and the public. It is recommended that the values include not just timely advice but frank, honest, comprehensive and accurate advice. It is recommended that employment decisions in the Public Service continue to be based on merit and that merit be defined in the bill itself. It is also recommended that agency heads not be required to advertise all positions openly but to have some discretion in this regard. It is proposed that the provisions relating to workplace diversity programs be strengthened and that the remuneration of agency heads and the Public Service Commissioner continue to be subject to public scrutiny. It is recommended that mobility between the Public Service and the parliamentary 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7103"> service and between the Public Service and employment with ministers and members of parliament be encouraged rather than discouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the most contentious area of the bill and the one which drew almost universal criticism is that relating to the review of employment decisions, which the committee deals with in chapter 9. The  Public Service Bill 1997  repeals the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act and with it all of the current mechanisms for review of employment decisions affecting APS employees. The government is proposing to replace them with procedures that are basically in&hyphen;house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee concluded that, on the basis of the evidence to its review, there is a clear need for a revision of the current grievance and appeal mechanisms which exist under the 1922 act. But it expressed concern about the level of dissatisfaction with the proposed new procedures. That concern focused in particular on the absence of an external, independent, binding appeal mechanism. The committee observed that the Public Service Commissioner is not well placed to exercise independence in reviewing APS employment decisions and noted that a review mechanism which builds on the current model of a separate statutory officer within the structure of the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission may offer a more independent review process than is proposed in the current version of the regulations. Independent external and binding appeal mechanisms are important in their own right, but they assume even more importance in the light of the changes to the Public Service which the government is proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is seeking to create a public service that is more responsive and beholden to government. Agency heads will rely on the ministers not only for their employment but also for their salary and conditions. SES officers will have a similar dependence on their agency heads and will not even have recourse to the unfair dismissal provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. Agency heads will also have the power to hire and fire and set salary and conditions for agency employees.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding the government's protestations to the contrary, these changes will encourage patronage, favouritism and politicisation. If the government is serious about not wanting to move in this direction, and I doubt its sincerity, it must at the very least allow APS employees to appeal to an independent, external arbiter with the power to reverse an unfair employment decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say the committee was not persuaded by the rationale for the proposed changes, which was put forward by some of the government witnesses&mdash;that is, that the Public Service is suffering from a grievance mentality. The committee's recommendation in regard to review of actions is disappointing, and I regret that the committee was not prepared to go further than just recommend that the government re&hyphen;draft the regulations in a way that is at least simple, clear and concise. The re&hyphen;drafting needs to achieve a lot more than that. The opposition will await the re&hyphen;draft of regulations with interest but, if they fail to provide for an appeal mechanism that is truly independent and binding, we will seek to achieve this through amendment to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, while I doubted the minister's motives at the time of the bill's referral to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and I also had doubts about the thoroughness of the scrutiny that the bill was likely to receive, my doubts on the latter at least have been dispelled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I congratulate the committee on the comprehensive and professional way that it went about its work. I want to record my appreciation for the work of the committee's secretariat. It was certainly not an easy task to produce a report that accurately reflected the concerns that were brought to our attention and which translated those concerns into concrete recommendations that both government and opposition members could sign off. I am sure that the government members would have wanted less remedial action while the opposition members certainly wanted more, but in the end we have a report that we are all able to support. I hope that fact adds to the impact of the report and causes the government to give this report its very serious

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill implements one of the Government's important reforms to the review of immigration decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions of the bill comprise measures relating to judicial review of immigration decision&hyphen;making. The bill gives legislative effect to the Government's pre&hyphen;election policy commitment that we would restrict access to judicial review in migration matters in all but exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That commitment was given in light of the extensive merits review rights in the migration area and arose from concerns about the growing cost and incidence of, and delays resulting from, migration litigation. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7105">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill introduces a new judicial review scheme to cover decisions under the Migration Act relating to the ability of non&hyphen;citizens to enter and remain in Australia. The key mechanism in the new scheme is the privative clause provision at new section 474.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The privative clause, and the related provisions, will replace the existing judicial review scheme at Part 8 of the Migration Act. Unlike the existing scheme, the new judicial review scheme will also apply to the High Court and not just the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Minister's Second Reading Speech on Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1997, the Government set out how the need for the new judicial review scheme had been clearly demonstrated. The Minister looked at the history of the existing scheme, how it was operating today and what would happen in the future if it were left untouched.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the key points that the Minister made were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the current judicial review scheme for visa decisions introduced by the previous Government in 1994 has not met that Government's intention of reducing the volume of cases before the courts&mdash;<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> in fact, recourse to the courts is trending upwards despite full and open access by many applicants to heavily subsidised independent merits review by tribunals;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. the high level of litigation, particularly by twice refused asylum claimants, cannot remain unchecked&mdash;increased litigation leads to increased costs and delays, and, for those in detention, to a significantly longer period of detention; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. it is hard not to conclude that there is a substantial number of individuals who are using the legal process primarily in order to extend their stay in Australia, especially given that just less than half of all applicants withdraw from legal proceedings before hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Minister stated in the other place, in the migration area litigation can be an end in itself. There is a high incentive for applicants refused permanent residence to delay removal from Australia for as long as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some may seek to gain time to establish ties within the community which they may hope will yield entitlement to a visa through another pathway. The incentive to delay removal from Australia is increased if the refused applicants are enjoying privileges such as work rights and access to Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advice the Minister received about achieving the Government's policy objective of restricting access to judicial review was that the only workable option was a privative clause. That advice was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> obtained from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department and eminent lawyers in the private sphere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As senators are aware, section 75 of the Commonwealth Constitution gives the High Court original jurisdiction to consider challenges to the actions and decisions of Commonwealth officers. As a result, access to the High Court cannot be legislatively restricted without a constitutional amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While access to the Federal Court, and the scope of judicial review it can exercise, can be changed by legislation, to simply restrict access to the Federal Court in migration legislation matters, would in practice deflect many cases to the High Court. That would have the potential to erode the proper role and purpose of the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legal advice the Minister received was that a privative clause would have the effect of narrowing the scope of judicial review by the High Court, and of course the Federal Court. That advice was largely based on the High Court's own interpretation of such clauses in cases such as in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hickman's case</EMPHASIS> , as long ago as 1945, and more recently in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Richard Walter case</EMPHASIS>  in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators may be aware that the effect of a privative clause such as that used in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hickman's case</EMPHASIS>  is to expand the legal validity of the acts done and the decisions made by decision&hyphen;makers. The result is to give decision-makers wider lawful operation for their decisions and this means that the grounds on which those decisions can be challenged in the Federal and High Courts are narrower than currently available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In practice, the decision is lawful provided the decision-maker:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is acting in good faith;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">had been given the authority to make the decision concerned (for example, had the authority delegated to him or her by the Minister, or had been properly appointed as a tribunal member); and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">did not exceed constitutional limits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The options available to the Government were very much shaped by the Constitution. Whilst the Minister accepts that the precise limits of privative clauses may need examination by the High Court, there is no other practical option open to the Government to achieve its policy objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the measures in this bill will limit judicial review, it does not affect the existing access to independent merits review by the Immigration Review Tribunal, its successor the Migration Review Tribunal, the Refugee Review Tribunal and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT (FOREIGN INCOME MEASURES) BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income Measures) Bill 1997 will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to give effect to proposed changes to the rules for taxing foreign source income that were announced in the 1997&hyphen;98 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Creation of a new list</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Government considers that the broad structure of the system for taxing foreign source income is appropriate, it has become evident that there are problems with the list of countries used for providing exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These problems have arisen because the current list of countries has been used for two distinct purposes that would have been best served by separate lists. The list has been used for the purpose of determining when income should be exempt from accruals taxation under the controlled foreign company and transferor trust measures. The list has also been used to determine when dividends and branch profits derived by resident companies should be exempt under the foreign tax credit system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current list, comprising over fifty countries, is unsuitable for the purpose of providing exemptions from accruals taxation because there are many countries on the list that do not consistently levy tax on a comparable basis to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A more robust list of closely comparable tax countries is required for the purpose of providing exemptions from accruals taxation. The accruals taxation rules apply to amounts derived from investments that are likely to be significantly influenced by taxation considerations. Amounts derived from these types of investments are treated as "tainted" and include interest income, royalties and certain amounts derived from arrangements involving related parties. Accruals taxation of these tainted amounts is crucial to ensure investments offshore are not favoured over similar investments in Australia for purely taxation reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To address the problems with the current list, the bill will create a new list of seven "broad&hyphen;exemption countries" for the purposes of providing exemptions from accruals taxation under the controlled foreign company and transferor trust measures. The list will comprise Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. These countries will be designated in the Income Tax Regulations as broad&hyphen;exemption listed countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A shorter list will also make the task of designating tax concessions more manageable. Efforts to designate tax deferral opportunities in listed countries have had only limited success and are made more difficult by the large number of countries that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> must be monitored. The risks to the revenue associated with not designating a tax deferral opportunity are significant because tainted income by its nature can be diverted to take advantage of the opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current list of countries is also to be updated and will continue to be used for the purposes of exemptions under the foreign tax credit system. The current list is still considered suitable for the purposes of providing exemptions under the foreign tax credit system because the exemptions apply to amounts derived from investments that are less sensitive to taxation considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Countries that are listed for the purposes of the foreign tax credit system and not for accruals taxation purposes will be designated in the Income Tax Regulations as "limited&hyphen;exemption listed countries". Countries on either the limited&hyphen;exemption list or the broad&hyphen;exemption list will be treated as listed for the purposes of the foreign tax credit system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Branch profits exemption</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also modify the existing exemption under the foreign tax credit system for amounts derived by a branch in a listed country so that it can continue to apply to amounts derived through a branch in a limited&hyphen;exemption listed country. The exemption will generally continue to be available for branch income other than tainted income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An active income test will be provided for branches in limited&hyphen;exemption listed countries to help reduce compliance costs. The test will allow branches in these countries to derive up to 5 per cent of gross turnover as tainted income and still receive a full exemption for branch income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An exclusion from tainted income will also be provided for banking income derived by branches of Australian financial institutions in limited&hyphen;exemption countries. This exemption is broadly consistent with the exclusion from tainted income provided under the controlled foreign company measures for subsidiaries of Australian financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be no changes to the treatment of branches in broad&hyphen;exemption listed countries. These branches will continue to be generally exempt on amounts that have been taxed at full rates in those countries.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another feature of the bill are amendments to help reduce compliance costs under the controlled foreign company measures.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7107">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will make the following changes to help reduce compliance costs:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other amendments made by the bill are required for the general maintenance of the system for taxing foreign source income.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also repeal the exemption in the foreign investment fund measures for approved country funds. The exemption was originally provided to allow portfolio diversification in emerging markets that do not allow direct investment by Australian residents.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new two list approach will generally apply from 1 July 1997 for the purposes of exemptions under the foreign tax credit system. To avoid the need to calculate attributable income for a part period, the two list approach will first apply for statutory accounting periods of controlled foreign companies and years of income of transferor trusts commencing after 30 June 1997. In some cases this will defer revenue collected from the changes by up to twelve months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures to help reduce compliance costs under the controlled foreign company measures 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which are made possible or are required because of the creation of a short list for accruals taxation purposes will apply for statutory accounting periods of controlled foreign companies commencing after 30 June 1997.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transitional rules dealing with uncertainty arising from the dissolution of a number of listed countries will generally apply from the time of dissolution of the countries.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Consultation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been two rounds of public consultation on the proposed changes.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The views expressed in submissions on the information paper were taken into account in settling the changes announced in the 1997&hyphen;98 Budget. The measures in this bill for reducing compliance costs under the controlled foreign company measures were adopted following consideration of the submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second round of consultation was on legislation giving effect to the changes that was released in draft form on 1 July 1997. The bill currently before the House is essentially the same as the draft bill.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">We are dealing again with clause 37 of the Auditor&hyphen;General Bill. Clause 37 runs from page 22 to page 24 of the bill and is headed `Sensitive information not to be included in public reports'. It depends, of course, whose definition of sensitivity that is. The Auditor&hyphen;General, in our opinion, has always taken care with sensitive information and will continue to do so. The amendments I have put before the committee in fact require the Auditor&hyphen;General not to include particular information in a public report if the Auditor&hyphen;General is of the opinion that disclosure of the information would be contrary to the public interest, for any of the reasons set out in subclause (2) of the original bill. The original bill said that the reasons were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) it would prejudice the security, defence or international relations of the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) it would involve the disclosure of deliberations or decisions of the Cabinet or a Committee of the Cabinet;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) it would prejudice relations between the Commonwealth and a State;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) it would divulge any information or matter that was communicated in confidence by the Commonwealth to a State, or by a State to the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) it would unfairly prejudice the commercial interests of any body or person&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">note that one, please; it is extremely dangerous&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) any other reason that could form the basis of a claim by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth in a judicial proceeding that the information should not be disclosed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So we have accepted right at the outset that the Auditor&hyphen;General should not disclose particular information if it would be contrary to the public interest, but the choice is by the person in that office. The Auditor&hyphen;General is not political; the Auditor&hyphen;General is not partisan; the Auditor&hyphen;General is not subject to potentially improper benefit as a result of the exercise of executive or government power. The Auditor&hyphen;General is the watchdog, the person who protects, on behalf of this parliament, on behalf of the people, our institutions 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7109"> of accountability and democracy, particularly with relation to financial affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our proposed amendments to clause 37 of the bill are unashamedly intended to reduce the extension of the powers of the executive, as provided under the bill in its current form. By passing clause 37 unamended, parliament will seriously erode the powers and privileges granted to it under the constitution. Passing clause 37 unamended will permanently&mdash;for those of you out there listening&mdash;weaken parliament and its powers of review. Clause 37 is a serious threat by the executive to overrule parliament in an important respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite welcome improvements to many aspects of the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General under the new bill, the auditor will remain, by virtue of clause 37, subject to the directions of the Attorney&hyphen;General, who in turn is subject to the dictate of the cabinet. That is the nub of the problem: that the Auditor&hyphen;General will be subject to the directions of a political person who is in turn subject to the dictates of a cabinet. All the good that has been done by this improved bill will be undone by that one single act. This is the sort of issue that members of the government should cross the floor for. This is the sort of issue that divides those who believe in accountability, democracy and the people from those who believe in the dominance of our parliamentary and democratic processes by the executive&mdash;by those in power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear from the evidence which was given to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee that no set of events provokes a need for the executive to assume this power. The Auditor&hyphen;General should have the power to decide to omit sensitive information from his reports in the public interest but the Auditor&hyphen;General must be protected by parliament from government interference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that both the department and the minister and, no doubt, the government will shortly argue that this kind of provision has been hidden in the Audit Act, section 48, since 1979. But such a provision was forced through a compliant parliament which buckled under an executive. It was brought through in an era when accountability was not the feature that it is today. It was brought through in an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> era that preceded the huge privatisation, contracting out and tendering that go on today&mdash;the huge interaction between private and public interests. It was brought through in an era when our administration, our bureaucracy, was identifiably more independent than it is today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian assault on the Auditor&hyphen;General is an example of a style of ideology which pursues executive power to the detriment of the people. The question before us today is whether the parties other than those in the government will choose public accountability over executive power. Passing clause 37 unamended will mean that the government will be responsible for diminishing the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General and the ability of that office to act as an effective public accountability agent. In our system of government, the Auditor&hyphen;General's responsibilities relate directly to protecting the public purse and therefore the Auditor&hyphen;General must remain outside the control of government and be answerable only to parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in the interests of protecting parliament's most powerful accountability agency that these amendments be agreed to in this place. My amendments do preserve the Attorney&hyphen;General's right to influence the Auditor&hyphen;General where appropriate, but not to direct him or her. We have not said that the government may not speak to the Auditor&hyphen;General about issues in the public interest. Item 2, which would be clause 37(4)(b), says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of the Auditor&hyphen;General forming an opinion under subsection 1 the Auditor&hyphen;General may consult with the Attorney&hyphen;General and the Attorney&hyphen;General may make a submission or provide advice to the Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A non&hyphen;partisan, independent Auditor&hyphen;General appointed in the public interest will not act against the interests of Australia. Such a person will be sensitive to the interests of Australia but they will be sensitive on a non&hyphen;partisan and independent basis, not on a partisan and political basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We object to the nature of clause 37 because it jars with the rest of the bill. Under subclause 37(1)(a), as it is at present, the Auditor&hyphen;General must not include particular information in a report to the parliament if the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7110"> Auditor&hyphen;General is of the opinion that disclosure of the information would be contrary to the public interest as set out in subclause 37(2). Under subclause 37(1)(b) the Auditor&hyphen;General must not include particular information in a report to the parliament if the Attorney&hyphen;General issues a certificate to the Auditor&hyphen;General stating that, in the opinion of the Attorney&hyphen;General, disclosure of the information would be contrary to the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me repeat, the Attorney&hyphen;General in this government is a junior cabinet minister. The Attorney&hyphen;General is subject to the dictates of the cabinet. The Attorney&hyphen;General is a political officer before he is a law officer. It is not something that the Senate and the parliament should permit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We note the consistent and persistent comments of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills that, by passing this clause unamended, parliament will seriously erode the powers and privileges granted to it by the constitution. I sit on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. I believe I am privileged to sit on that committee. The people I have spoken to who have sat on that committee in the past all feel a pride in having sat on that committee because that committee attempts to pay attention to the fundamental issues of rights and liberties, and it attempts consistently to do so on a non&hyphen;partisan basis. My understanding is it has an excellent record in this place for fulfilling that duty. I tell the Senate here today that that committee has, seven times under different governments, said that this kind of clause should not go through this parliament unamended. This kind of clause, they have said, seriously erodes the powers and privileges granted to the parliament under this constitution.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I should state the opposition's position on this amendment. May I just provide a brief preamble to our position and that is to pay regard and respect to Senator Murray. He has espoused an obviously passionately held and strongly reasoned case in support of his own amendment. Unfortunately, while I respect his opinion and have great admiration for his integrity, this is not an occasion when I actually agree with the argument that he has put. I want to state my argument in opposition, while not in any way reflecting on him or the approach that he has taken on this occasion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are debating here quite an important issue. There is no question about that. There is a collision of two principles. There is the principle of an independent auditor and the fearless auditing of the books of the Commonwealth of Australia so that the citizens of this nation can be sure that public moneys raised by taxation are spent as they were intended to be spent and are efficiently spent. The auditor's report comes out in order to establish that, and it is open to the scrutiny of this parliament or any citizen of this nation. Principle one: that should be done fearlessly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Principle two&mdash;and this is where the collision of the second principle with the first occurs&mdash;is that nations have secrets and if you endanger those secrets you may endanger the nation. Public exposure of those secrets by way of an auditor's report may carry with it the greater danger of endangering the nation. Which of the two principles do you follow: the endangerment one or the right to know one? When you have a clash of two substantial principles like this, you have to find a sensible way of reconciling the issue so that the principles can both stand. One should not dominate the other. What this bill does&mdash;and what we support is the bill and not the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7111"> amendment&mdash;is to enable both principles to stand in a reasonable way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I say `nations have secrets' let me give you an example of what I mean. I have to say that this is not a true example, it is a fictional one, because I am talking about national secrets. If Australia had a spy in Baghdad spying on Saddam Hussein's regime making nuclear weapons, should that spy be required to submit his overnight TA for auditing so we know where that spy stayed and who he had dinner with, for the sake of getting down a true and accurate accounting of the expenditure of public moneys raised by taxation? Or would publishing where that spy stayed and who he had dinner with endanger the national interest and inhibit us in discovering whether or not Saddam Hussein was preparing an attack with nuclear weapons? It is a fictitious example, I know, but that is the sort of problem we get into here, and it needs to be approached carefully because there has to be a reconciliation about the importance of both.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the bill does&mdash;and this is the reason we support it&mdash;is essentially to say to the Auditor&hyphen;General, `Go for your life. Go and audit everything,' except if the Attorney&hyphen;General&mdash;in this case representing the national interest&mdash;says, `Excuse me, Auditor&hyphen;General, I don't want you to audit this specific thing' and issues a statement requiring him not to. The Democrat amendment would prevent the Attorney from doing that. The first law officer of the Commonwealth would be prevented from issuing that certificate in those circumstances and, in my fictitious example, the TA, potentially, of the spy staying at the Baghdad Hilton, looking at the nuclear weapons issue, would be revealed and his or her role compromised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that is a slightly exaggerated example, but the issue is: there is still public scrutiny here because the parliament calls the Attorney to account. The issue is not that something has been prevented from being audited by the Attorney; that has occurred, but the Attorney is still under scrutiny by this parliament for his or her actions in so issuing that order.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This parliament has a committee structure which would enable sensitive information to be passed in certain circumstances&mdash;I have to say immediately, not in all. This parliament has an informal structure where, as happened in the Gulf War, the Prime Minister may call in the Leader of the Opposition and brief him in advance as to what is going to happen, because you want a national response and not a party political response. So you get that type of interchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, as the shadow Minister for Trade, I have been invited to the office of the Minister for Trade tomorrow to talk about a sensitive national issue concerning the United States and a challenge that they are going to make in the World Trade Organisation against Australia. The opposition and the government may well have a common view here, but I am being briefed by the trade minister at his initiative&mdash;and I acknowledge that&mdash;in order that I may be aware. If I then, as the opposition, disagree with him, I will take the argument publicly, but there may well be a national interest issue where I do not do that and actually support the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, in matters of national security, there is a case where the informal mechanisms of consultation also work as some sort of brake. That is imperfect. It is not set down who says what to whom nor whether it is the whole story or part of the story&mdash;all those things are open for scrutiny and debate, of course. Nonetheless, I note there is that informal, practical and very useful interchange that goes on which, in an adversarial system of parliamentary democracy, does not seem to occur on the surface but, in fact, is one of the glues that hold the institution together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I say to the Democrats on this occasion that I understand exactly what they are proposing. I have sympathy to a point but I cannot extend my sympathy the whole distance, because there are such things as national secrets and, by their very definition, national secrets need to be protected. But there has to be a reconciliation as to how we deal with national secrets that affect public expenditure. I think this bill effectively does that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> My concern is not so much that the bill provides a way of reconciling them sensibly&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7112"> because I think it does&mdash;my concern is the concern that you have on all occasions where an event like this occurs. The most common rejoinder is: what happens in the event of abuse? Sure, this may run smoothly on the surface among well-conducted people with honest intent and integrity concerned only about the national interest, but what happens if a roughie comes along who wants to invoke national security protection for something that clearly is not? Is there sufficient means of balancing against that type of wrongful behaviour?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at this bill further. Under clause 37 headed `Sensitive information not to be included in public reports', which is the section we are debating, subclause (2) sets out a series of definitions of what national security or nationally guarded material should be. I am grateful that Senator Murray read that subclause. The one he seemed to raise most concern about&mdash;and I acknowledge that he did not address himself to each one of these items but raised that one as a question mark in parentheses on his way through&mdash;was paragraph (e) of clause 37(2), which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it would unfairly prejudice the commercial interests of any body or person.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We do have a rule of commercial-in-confidence such that, if information is given to the government which is commercially sensitive&mdash;that is, if it were released publicly it would disadvantage the provider of that information and advantage the competitors of that company&mdash;we guard that information so that the supplier of it can have their secrets protected but so that it can be disclosed to the Crown&mdash;I would like to say the president of a republic but under our constitutional system the Crown&mdash;what the particular material is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> I do think that, from time to time, things are deemed to be commercial-in-confidence when they are hardly that sensitive. That is an area of some discretion. In this bill, it is the Attorney-General that has to make that finding and issue a document to the Auditor-General. The Attorney-General can be called to book in this parliament and, irrespective of whether he or she is inside or outside of the cabinet&mdash;I just note in passing that all of our Attorneys-General were inside the cabinet&mdash; 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">nonetheless, as the first law officer of the Commonwealth, there are still specific obligations on the Attorney-General so that he or she conducts himself or herself in conformity with the bill. It is not their status or rank in cabinet or in the outer ministry that is important, the important consideration here is the role of the first law officer in giving legal respect to his or her obligations under the bill in the proper and appropriate way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> If I can summarise what may have been a somewhat tortuous explanation, in the end it comes down to this: it is the Auditor-General's role to report. There are occasions in which we all acknowledge sensitive material may be disclosed in those reports. There is a way of protecting the national interest when it might have been disclosed, and that way of protecting the national interest puts the Attorney-General in the role of being accountable to the parliament rather than the Auditor-General. In those circumstances, that is sufficient protection.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will struggle on, Senator Conroy. I know you would never interject. Paragraph (a) talks about national defence. Senator Cook gave a very good example of our man in Baghdad. But what he did not say&mdash;and it supports his argument even more strongly&mdash;is that the Auditor-General under this act will have absolutely unfettered powers as far as looking into his TA forms and looking into all of the other aspects of our operations, covert or otherwise, in Baghdad are concerned. What we are allowed to do here is ensure that they are not revealed&mdash;for very good reasons, as Senator Cook pointed out to the Senate&mdash;and therefore put at risk our man in Baghdad and indeed our entire operations in the Middle East.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paragraph (b) goes into the deliberations of cabinet or cabinet committees. I do not know whether Senator Murray thinks that they should be revealed or if that is indeed in the public interest. Paragraph (c) talks about prejudicing relations between the Commonwealth and the states. Paragraph (d) talks about divulging a matter which was communicated in confidence by the Commonwealth to a state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We come to your favourite&mdash;(e). You would have it that again it is some sort of conspiracy that we should protect something that is in the public interest for reasons of commercial interest, as if to protect something of commercial interest is always in the inter 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ests of either the government or the commercial operation. I say now that one of the good reasons for protecting something that might unfairly prejudice a commercial interest is indeed that it is in the public interest, or it can be. It is not always in the interests of the business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a number of occasions, it is in the Commonwealth's interest and the public's interest to ensure that business can come to the Commonwealth and say, `By the way, here is a range of contractual undertakings that we will give you,' or, `Here are some commercial agreements that we can put before you, but we can put them before you only if you protect that confidentiality.' If the Commonwealth were unable to grant that sort of commercial confidentiality, one wonders how much competition the government would get for contracts, tenders or a range of other information that might be important to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think Senator Murray would accept that there are reasons why the Commonwealth should offer confidentiality for these matters. He would say that commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence can be, and is, abused. The Auditor&hyphen;General has on only one occasion said that it is in the public interest, and I am not sure that even on that occasion it was for commercial confidentiality. I am told it was for national security. So the only time it has ever been invoked is for national security reasons. Surely even Senator Murray in this matter could foresee that that potentially is in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, we are looking at matters of sub judice which I do not think Senator Murray would argue about. Senator Murray would seek to put these matters in the hands of the Auditor-General. We say that, as the ultimate responsibility for protecting the public interest from damage lies with those of us who are the elected members of the government sitting in the parliament&mdash;that is, the elected officials and not the appointed official&mdash;we are answerable for any failure relating to that. The Auditor-General clearly is not answerable through that mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that is a very important point, although I am sure you will regard that as not a solid argument. I think there are different 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7115"> lines of accountability. Ultimately, just as are ministers, the Attorney-General is responsible to the parliament; and the government, through the parliament, is responsible to the people. In these matters where you make a declaration, where you issue a certificate, which I think is what is required, that is made known to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if the Attorney-General is seeking to abuse 37(1) as circumscribed by the reasons set out in (2), that will be a matter that is put before the parliament. It is not something that is likely to be abused. It is something that has only been used once in 20 years. It is not a diminution of accountability to the parliament because it is an identical, or virtually identical, provision to that which prevails in the existing law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just add this as a final reason why the coalition government will not be supporting the amendment and, indeed, will be supporting the legislation as it stands: the reality is that the staff of the ANAO already have unfettered access to all Commonwealth information. What we should understand is that not only would it be impracticable for the Auditor-General or his staff to have their reports itemise the exclusions&mdash;which would be the effect of your amendment; that is, to itemise all the exclusions&mdash;but also it would risk devaluing the audit reporting process itself by playing to those who would seek to sensationalise those items left out of a report, rather than concentrate on the substance of what has been included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the third reason. I do not think that reason was covered by Senator Cook. But, clearly, to itemise all those matters, regardless of whether or not they were germane to the thrust of the Auditor-General's main area of interest in the audit, again, could diminish the importance and value of the reports. Again, these matters have been considered over many, many years. The government remains unconvinced that your amendment has merit, and I would urge the Senate to support the bill and clause 7 as it stands.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the taking of the vote, I put to the table on sheet 676 two alternative 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> amendments to clause 37. I deliberately did not put these alternative amendments up earlier&mdash;and I apologise to those whom it might have inconvenienced&mdash;because, despite writing extensively to Labor over a period of a month or more, I did not know until the vote was taken or until Senator Cook gave his speech where Labor would be going with this, and I did not want to provide them with the opportunity to take a lesser amendment as an out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had hoped that the sweet accountable face of Labor would have prevailed over the hard executive face&mdash;but regrettably it did not. I am proposing to deal with the two amendments separately. The first deals with clause 37, page 23, lines 13 to 17. We would omit subparagraphs (e) and (f) from the bill before us. Subparagraph (b) allows the Auditor&hyphen;General and the Attorney&hyphen;General in concert not to include particular information in a public report if there is a certificate saying they should not. Subparagraph (e) says not to do so if `it would unfairly prejudice the commercial interests of any body or person'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treason is always a much less likely action of any person in government than is improper or corrupt behaviour. My assumption is that if you have a bad egg that bad egg will be dealing more with money than with treason. It is in subparagraph (e) that any risk of a bad egg appearing in government and using their situation improperly would reside. That is why we have chosen that as the part to be emphasised. Subparagraph (f) says not to include the information for `any other reason that could form the basis for a claim by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth in a judicial proceeding that the information should not be disclosed'. It is our belief that matters in which liability could prevail and in which the Commonwealth and the people of the Commonwealth would therefore be at risk should be capable of being exposed to the parliament if it is the opinion of the Auditor&hyphen;General that that should be so. Accordingly, I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I just say that when I referred to the Green&hyphen;Democrat view about commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence and commercial interests earlier I sought to paint the opposition and the coalition's view in government of needing to protect commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence things from time to time. The previous government did that as well. It can be, and often is, in the public interest because if the Commonwealth is to receive valuable information it needs to be able to offer that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Subparagraph (e), which this amendment seeks to strike out, says the Attorney&hyphen;General must seek to stop the disclosure of information that would be contrary to the public interest for specific reasons. It not only relates to the prejudice of commercial interests of any body or person but it also quite clearly puts in the words `unfairly prejudice'. So it is a very high bar that the Attorney&hyphen;General needs to jump over to do that. In relation to (f), I begin to wonder what is the motivation for this action. One could only really wonder why someone would seek to remove a provision that allows the Attorney&hyphen;General in the public interest and for a reason that could form the basis for a claim by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth in a judicial proceeding not to allow the information to be disclosed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition regards that these provisions have been in the law for in excess of 20 years and have not been abused, and that to keep them the way they are in no way diminishes accountability. In fact, it could prejudice it. It is widely regarded amongst the most informed commentators and certainly amongst members and senators who have been pushing for over eight years for this package as a massive in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> crease in the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General and accountability within government generally. To remove this provision would be counterproductive and could, indeed, defeat the purpose for which this package has been put forward.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very interesting amendment. The first thing I have to say about it is that it is a pity the opposition were not given notice of it. It just appeared before me a moment or two ago. It is very hard, on the spot, to tease through all the variations of what the significance of this amendment might be. It is unsatisfactory, I think, to be in a situation where, nonetheless, I am required to respond. After all, this is the Auditor&hyphen;General's act; these are serious matters; this is an important issue that we have been debating in these amendments and this thing has been consulted about to death over a hell of a long time&mdash;I forget how many years. To get an amendment like this at the last gasp, with a minute or two for consideration, is not in my view a satisfactory situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me register my unhappiness about that. On the face of it, it seems like an amendment that I could support. But I say those words carefully. I am a stopgap shadow minister in this debate and I do need to get better and clearer instructions on this before I can commit the opposition to it. I am not quite sure of the procedural way I might be able to do that without in any way inhibiting this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can think of a number of circumstances where various committees of the parliament would be seeking information and where `perhaps' an attorney's certificate with respect to that might close down an avenue of inquiry which should be pursued in the public interest. If they were the circumstances, the two subclauses in the bill are the ones one needs to look at. They are subclauses that are not to do with national security; they are subclauses to do with commercial-in-confidence matters and to do with what I take to be the sub judice subclause. I am not a lawyer either. When questions are sub judice&mdash;that is, when they are before a court of law being dealt with between a plaintiff and a defendant&mdash;the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7118"> information or resources of the parliament need to be considered lest they be used in a way which might somehow unhinge the normal processes of government. One has to be careful about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I can say at the moment is that this does appear to me to be a provision that I am inclined to support but I am not prepared at this moment to say that we will support it. I do require some better and further particulars to be explained to us about this. I would be grateful if the mover of this amendment could say more about what is on his mind and how he would see this applying in particular circumstances. Please appreciate the situation we have been put in. I do think it is reasonable for us to say that, before we vote on a matter as important as this, we would like a better explanation.</PARA></SPEECH>

However, overall, these matters have been before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which met in May 1997 and focused just on clauses 35 and 37, and, of course, before the Scrutiny of Bills Committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it might be to you. Frankly, it is a fall&hyphen;back position. Recognising that the arguments which we have heard&mdash;I will not repeat them&mdash;would be put to subclauses (a) to (d), we thought that we should focus on those areas which most particularly related to venal matters. That is why I began my remarks by illustrating that, if you were afraid of politicians or of members of the bureaucracy acting in a way which was not in the public interest, you would probably fear corruption and improper behaviour more than you would treason, because I think traitors are few and far between but thieves are many. We know that by what goes on in our gaols.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We focused there on matters which refer to commercial interests. We think it is appropriate since the Auditor-General's primary task is on financial matters, that they should be excluded from the ability of the Attorney-General to instruct the Auditor-General not to look at those matters. I think that is fairly easy to understand, unless you have a view that I have not explained sufficiently. It certainly does not prevent matters being withheld because they are genuinely commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence. It certainly does not prevent matters being withheld because they would genuinely and materially unfairly prejudice the commercial interests of any person or body. That would be within the powers of the Auditor-General to make that decision. It is not that it would get out into the open. He or she would make that decision, but the Attorney-General could not instruct them to make that decision. That is the critical issue. Subclause (f) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">any other reason that could form the basis for a claim by the Crown in right of the Commonwealth in a judicial proceeding that the information should not be disclosed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is our view that judicial proceedings primarily and most fundamentally deal with issues of liability which extend over the terms of government. Those issues can put a liability on future taxpayers which deserves to be explored. The only restriction here once again is not that the Auditor-General may not make a decision of this kind; it is that the Attorney-General may not instruct the Auditor-General. It is in these matters of claims by the Crown that the Attorney-General is most likely to be partisan because in those roles not only does he or she behave as a politician but as a law officer on behalf of the Commonwealth. Subclause (f) would allow them to put a certificate in which goes directly to their personal, political or cabinet interests. It would be a directly partisan act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to Senator Cook that it is for those reasons that we have identified subclauses (e) and (f) as being completely different in character from subclauses (a) to (d). I trust that satisfies your question.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This is my ultimate fall-back position. This really is the final stone on which I want to make a stand for the parliament, for Australia. This is the stone which allows the people of Australia, if it is necessary, through the parliament to require the Auditor-General to report to them. They would have to do so by a motion of a house of the parliament, a motion of a committee of a house of the parliament or a motion of a joint committee of both houses of the parliament. This is the absolute core minimum requirement which would allow this parliament to retain its powers, its rights and its authority. I have spoken at length and with some passion because I feel very strongly about issues of accountability, issues of the rights of parliament. I can do no more than condense all that I have said into those three lines and say that this, at least, will protect much of the substance for which I have been arguing.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition is opposed to this. We do not think that in principle it is different from the arguments that were put in relation to the Attorney-General issuing certificates in relation to any other matter. To use Senator Cook's Baghdad example, let us say that a Senate committee, for example, which was not controlled by the government, ordered a report into Australia's activities in the Middle East, and the Auditor-General was going to make a report on that matter. And this is no reflection on opposition senators; the report could be supported by a mix of senators, regardless of which party they came from, from all around the chamber. For the Attorney-General not to have the&mdash;very much&mdash;reserve power to issue a certificate in relation to these matters would compromise the national interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that the committees of the houses of parliament can request information by way of tabling of documents or a range of other means. The Senate in particular has enormous powers to try to find information out. We saw an example of that today when, a few minutes ago, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) came into this place and tabled a rather large wad of documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray calls this his `fall&hyphen;back position' or his `stone'. I put it to Senator Murray that it is not a stone; it is indeed a lechstone, an imaginary stone, that he has in his mind. The coalition cannot support this. All the principles that stood in our defence of clause 37 stand here. All of the principles that the Labor Party have supported I hope will be supported again in relation to this fall&hyphen;back stone which I believe is a lechstone.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will support this amendment, and I will say a few words as to why. Reading closely the words of this amendment and bearing in mind all that I have said in the previous debate on clause 37, none of which I retreat one whit from, I nonetheless draw from the remarks I made earlier the observation I made that this is a complex issue and finding the balance is indeed a difficult matter. What this motion means is that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney&hyphen;General must not issue a certificate in respect of information requested of the Auditor&hyphen;General by a House of the Parliament&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I leave that part of it aside for a minute&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a committee of a House of the Parliament or a joint committee of both Houses of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let us just deal with this. In the case of a committee of the parliament from the House of Representatives&mdash;when you look to the future these things may always change; there may be a minority government in Australia at some point or other&mdash;the committee basically reflects the composition of that chamber, which is the government controlled chamber. So when we are talking about a house of the parliament we are seriously talking here about the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A joint committee of both houses in my experience is usually&mdash;invariably&mdash;a committee that is controlled also by the government. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7121"> Committees of the Senate are not necessarily controlled by the government and in that case may be pursuing some line of inquiry for which there needs to be some balancing protection as to their rights to proceed along that line of inquiry in the public interest against the executive wing of the government acting to prevent a legitimate line of inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I first looked at this I read it in conjunction with the clause 1 above and took it to mean that it referred only to (e) and (f). Of course it does not. It refers to all of the subclauses in clause 2, which means that in supporting this amendment&mdash;I draw attention to this&mdash;it is possible to construct scenarios in which some matter may be being sought to be inquired of by a parliamentary committee which does border on the national interest or directly impinge on the national interest or some state secret. What balances against that is the obvious composition of parliamentary committees and the fact that you have a majority on parliamentary committees of the government or of the party that seeks to be the government and that majority will therefore act to protect national interest issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not an easy decision by us but, in the circumstances of this provision, for the foregoing reasons and not in any way to act capriciously but to act in terms of the right of the parliament to know, we will vote for this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will not surprise the Senate to hear that the Greens (WA) will be supporting this amendment. I hope that the government will also accept it once it goes to the House of Representatives  because it is always possible for a minister to give a confidential briefing to a committee, perhaps, or to representatives of parties if there are issues or if one wants to express issues that might be of national interest in advance of a vote being taken. This is always possible. It is always important to make sure that there are some means by which the parliamentary process can be protected and by which access to information in the parliamentary process can be protected. This is one way to try to make sure that there is that check and balance in the withdrawal of information.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. It is simply not any sort of protection. As I understand it, you are saying that, because you have a majority of government senators, all of a sudden there is more inherent respect or even understanding of what the national interests may be. I put it to the Senate that it is possibly not until the information arrives at the committee that there may even be any alarm bells ringing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are saying here that the Attorney&hyphen;General is not allowed to issue a certificate. One wonders whether the Auditor&hyphen;General could even bring to the Attorney&hyphen;General's attention the matters that may jeopardise or put at risk the national interest.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not saying that a committee is any greater or lesser a judge of the national interest than the Attorney&hyphen;General or the Auditor&hyphen;General. In fact, the government has always said that the Auditor&hyphen;General is fallible in these things. Clearly, the Attorney&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7122"> General is fallible in these things but they do have a range of advice and advisers at their fingertips that a Senate committee or any other committee may not have on occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I can say is that I am alarmed and amazed at the Australian Labor Party's position on this. I realise that it has had to make a decision on the run. Senator Murray has used this tactic, which I am sure that he has thought long and hard about, because he wanted to corner the Australian Labor Party into making a decision on the run. I will not pre&hyphen;empt the decision that the government will make on this in the lower house when this amendment goes there, but I certainly see enormous problems with this amendment, and the government will certainly not be supporting it in the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Senate knows, I put forward an amendment to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R279">States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  three weeks ago now which would have ensured that Commonwealth moneys were audited by state 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7124"> auditors&hyphen;general who were independent. Of course, that would have simply maintained the status quo in terms of what the states currently do. The wording which was used then and now by Senator Murray in this amendment was actually suggested by the Australasian Council of Auditors&hyphen;General, who are particularly concerned about threats to the independence of auditors&hyphen;general. As the Senate will also recall, the Victorian state government commissioned a review of the Auditor&hyphen;General Act some months ago and it came up with a proposal, not yet decided on by the Kennett government, which would effectively nobble the independence of Victoria's Auditor&hyphen;General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to go over all of those arguments again today but I do want to say that the ALP in Victoria has made a great deal of their support for this question of opposing the threats to the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General. In this regard, Mr Brumby, Leader of the Opposition in that state, sent out circulars which said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Labor Government will implement the following reforms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* The independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General will be enshrined in the state constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* The office of the Auditor&hyphen;General will be re&hyphen;established under the direct control of the Auditor&hyphen;General, who will be responsible for staffing the office and other resourcing decisions within the office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* The Auditor&hyphen;General will have the sole power to carry out or designate an auditor to carry out the external audit on all public sector agencies over which the government has control, significant influence or to which it has financial exposure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* The Auditor&hyphen;General will not be subject to any direction on how to carry out audits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* The Auditor&hyphen;General will be free to determine the audit program, including the bodies to be audited, the nature and scope of auditors who will carry out the audits, the priorities for audit and what external expertise will be utilised for any performance audits.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The ALP has shared platforms with me on a number of occasions, decrying the actions of the Kennett government. As Senator Murray has already said, the ALP chose to vote against our amendment last time round. Senator Sherry said that, in principle, there was some opposition support but made the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> excuse that the bill was urgent and that another piece of legislation, which is the one that is before us today, would be more appropriate. Today, not only does the opposition have the option of supporting amendments which would protect the independence of the Commonwealth Auditor&hyphen;General but Senator Sherry can also demonstrate that his party is not hypocritical, that his party cares about open and accountable government and that his party is not afraid of the scrutiny that that most important watchdog in this country can provide. My colleague Senator Murray has, as suggested by Senator Sherry on 4 September, prepared this amendment which will do what Mr Brumby in Victoria would have us do. It will put in place not just a promise that Mr Brumby might make for some stage in the future but it will actually stop that ideological experiment likely to be imposed on Victoria. I want to recap on what the Victorian Auditor&hyphen;General said about this ideological experiment. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am more convinced than ever that the direction proposed by the review team will lead to a situation in which a future parliament, if confronted by either an oppressive or a corrupt government, would be relatively impotent and not privy to information which would allow it to call such a government to account. The team's model has been postulated in a report which is devoid of empirical evidence and is characterised by unsubstantiated assertions, textual inconsistencies, uncertainty as to the likely outcomes and recommendations based on minority views.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Senate will recall that, when this went to the vote on 4 September, Senator Carr and Senator Conroy spoke with some passion about their commitment to the independence of the Auditor&hyphen;General. They then proceeded to absent themselves from the chamber at the time of the vote.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Conroy said that a more appropriate place for this debate would be during the debate on the bill that is before us now. Here is the chance to have that debate. Here is the chance for the ALP to demonstrate that it has the strength to act on its rhetoric. Time is running out in Victoria. If the ALP does not support our amendment this time we can only conclude that it likes the idea of the nobbling of the Auditor&hyphen;General if and when it eventually comes to power either here or in Victoria. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7125"> If this is the case then I think the ALP should say so to all Victorians and not pretend to continue to take this high moral ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry said that we should perhaps have a Senate inquiry into this matter, yet when I moved that the ALP voted against that amendment too. I wonder when we can expect to see the terms of reference drafted up by the ALP for an inquiry. We would certainly be happy to develop them. But here today is an opportunity for real action on this question and it is my strong hope that we see the ALP vote where it really matters.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, in response to Senator Murray, and to some extent to Senator Allison from Victoria, I did make it clear that, as part of the discussion we had in respect to the Auditor&hyphen;General in Victoria, our desire was to have an appropriate Senate inquiry. We have commenced drafting up the terms of reference, Senator Allison. I was actually having a look at them this morning but I did get somewhat distracted by some other matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The terms of reference obviously have to be discussed with all of the parties in the Senate chamber. I do not want to traverse over the grounds that I traversed over on the last occasion, and I do not want to be too unkind to the Australian Democrats, but we saw an attempted stunt a couple of weeks ago and there is an attempt here today to replicate what we think is a stunt. As I said on that occasion, we have concerns about the independence and the proper resourcing of an independent auditor&hyphen;general in Victoria, but we have that concern about a number of states and territories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope that we can conclude some terms of reference during the rest of this week and get the inquiry under way, but I would say this amendment does not safeguard the office of state and territory auditors&hyphen;general. On the contrary, the passage of this amendment would severely put at risk the financial position of these other governments. The amendment would stop the making of all grants of financial assistance to states pursuant to all other pieces of legislation passed by the parliament if, either the Commonwealth 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister is not satisfied that all of the money will be audited by the state auditor&hyphen;general, or the state auditor&hyphen;general is not subject to any direction from any person in relation to any aspect of the audit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since a Commonwealth minister cannot be satisfied about   the future activity of state auditors&hyphen;general, there is a real risk that states may have all of their Commonwealth funding cut off. It would destroy the delivery of public services in this nation if this section were ever invoked. There may well be legitimate circumstances where the state auditor&hyphen;general does not audit funds provided to the state; for example, where the state government is just a post box which then sends on the money to local government or makes a grant to community groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For a party which professes to care about the level of public services provided in the community, we believe this is a poorly thought through proposal. If the Democrats are serious about examining the proper role of the auditor&hyphen;general in a national context, which we certainly are, we are interested in progressing the matter in a proper way. As I said when I commenced, I do not want to be too unkind. I am not in an unkind mood today and generally I am not in an unkind mood.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do see this in the context of somewhat of a stunt. I recall listening to some media&mdash;radio, I think, Senator Allison, which you did on the last occasion&mdash;and you were very unkind. That does not perturb me in a personal sense, but it had all the elements of a last&hyphen;minute dash to try to get involved in a very controversial issue in Victoria which, quite rightly, Labor and our leader, Mr Brumby, have been making a very strong stand on, in principle, in the media and in the general community. The Democrats have been hooking on to that issue and hooking on to legislation in an inappropriate way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to see the inquiry into those terms of reference concluded this week, and I am sure there will be discussions on that this week. Whatever the government chooses to do is up to them but, of course, we have to consult with people like Senator Harradine and, obviously, the Greens and the Democrats. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7126">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be a very significant shift in state&hyphen;Commonwealth financial relations if this amendment is passed. As I said on the last occasion, we want to have a thorough, proper examination of all states and territories and, if that inquiry finds that there are grounds for punitive actions against states in respect of state auditors&hyphen;general&mdash;and I think, prima facie, there are grounds&mdash;then we want to introduce a mechanism to do it in a proper and workable manner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will conclude my remarks with that. Unless the Democrats are overly provocative, I will refrain from speaking again on the matter. I know that represents a summation of our position on this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the summation&mdash;if there has been one&mdash;that I would make of Senator Sherry's contribution might very well indicate that we really do need to have a debate about broader constitutional reform in this country. I keep saying it again and again but the examples clearly come up in legislation that we have a changed and changing situation between the Commonwealth and the states as far as funding is concerned, and we have a situation where, more and more, the states are saying, `We don't want to be accountable to anybody for what we spend.' That is really not good enough.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Campbell asked, `What state said that?' My understanding is that the agreement between the states and the Commonwealth government in relation to such things as competition policy is that they receive more untied grants. That, to me, would indicate that they are saying they do not want to be accountable to the Commonwealth government for what they spend Commonwealth funds for. It seems to me that we have had debates within this chamber in relation to organisations like ATSIC, when the now&hyphen;government has called audits to the nth degree to make sure the money went where it was supposed to go. It is not unreasonable, if the states hold out their hands for funds for certain purposes and if the Commonwealth provides funds for the states 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for certain purposes, for those amounts to be checked to see whether they went for the purposes for which they were provided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How many times in this chamber have we heard fairly substantial amounts of money being quoted in relation to Aboriginal health, Aboriginal housing and so on? A fair number of people in the chamber should realise that most of that money, which has been given to assist in the provision of those services, has been provided through the states and then through the states to local government. But what we are missing out on is finding out whether those funds actually went to where they were supposed to go. Instead, we have a constant battle beating up on ATSIC because there is almost no accountability in such areas as Aboriginal health, Aboriginal education and so on within this parliamentary process. The reason is that the states do not have to come back and say, `We have spent the money on where it is supposed to go.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is unreasonable that, with the financial assistance given to states, the states should then have to come out with an independently audited statement that says, `The money has gone where we said it was going to,' or `the money has gone where you have directed it to go to'&mdash;if it has been allocated for a particular purpose. This amendment highlights the need for a debate on broader constitutional reform. We are almost in a no-person zone in relation to the rights of states and the responsibility of states and certainly of local government because local government gets left off altogether. It is about time we as a community started talking about those issues; it is about time we put the debate about where we want the constitution to go in the future back on the agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not good enough. The fact is that we know the states do not want the Commonwealth to watch over their shoulders to see where they spend their money. By the same token, people want to make sure that there is some kind of policy to make sure that certain goals are achieved. At the moment it seems as though everybody is putting their hands behind their backs and taking no responsibility to ensure that social goals, which many 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7127"> people think are important, are actually achieved in the expenditure of public money.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will not be supporting this amendment for a number of reasons, which I will put as quickly as I can. Senator Lyn Allison was doing her best to get both the government and opposition senators to support this amendment. But when she made the plea&mdash;I will try to paraphrase, not quote, but the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  will show what she said&mdash;that this might put in place a promise that Mr Brumby might make in the future, she just about lost me. It is pretty much a `let's get Jeff' amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, this amendment goes a lot further than that. Firstly, it would seek in both its intent and its effect to enact a law of the Commonwealth which would absolutely enshrine preferential treatment between states as to their access to Commonwealth revenue. On the face of it, that appears to the government to be in breach of section 99 of the constitution, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are also clear technical amendments with the amendment: it ignores entirely any mention of the territories; it does not seek to define `financial assistance'; it does not seek to define `responsible minister'; and there is no recognition of the fact that state Auditors&hyphen;General do not personally conduct audits. Moreover, the amendment&mdash;buried away as it is in the FMA act but which purports to apply to the broad range of states grants acts&mdash;might in any case be rather pointless since, if it were apply at all, it might well only apply to existing laws and might not be able to apply to the laws that future parliaments make. So it is technically seriously flawed and it is unconstitutional.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, most importantly, it seems to me rather preposterous&mdash;certainly against the interests of federation and certainly against the concept of having government responsible to its elected citizens&mdash;for the Commonwealth to presume to intrude into the role of state 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parliaments and their power when it comes to making laws over their own affairs. There is a very big debate going on in Victoria at the moment&mdash;it is a very healthy debate&mdash;over the role of that state's Auditor-General. I regard having the Commonwealth seek to interfere in how any state government, be it Victorian or any other state government, runs a state and seek to interfere in the accountability measures that are put in place by that state as absolutely presumptuous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in this government, contrary to the view of Senator Margetts, believe that more accountability is important. That is why we have put federal&hyphen;state financial relations firmly on the tax reform agenda. We believe that, with increasing vertical fiscal imbalance and increasing dependence on Commonwealth revenues, states do become less and less responsible for the moneys they raise and spend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">None of the state premiers whom I have listened to or spoken to support Senator Margetts's proposition that there should be less accountability. All of the states are pushing for more responsibility in terms of raising the revenues that they spend; they are all are actually asking for more accountability. It is entirely contrary to what Senator Margetts says. If Senator Margetts's proposition that there should be less tied grants is supporting the proposition that there is less accountability, I put it to her that she is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one looks at this question logically, one must ask: where does the money come from; where do the taxes that are handed by the Commonwealth back to the states and territories come from?</PARA>

A large whack of the money comes from Western Australian taxpayers and industries based in Western Australia. To say to Western Australians&mdash;or, Mr Deputy Chairman Calvert, to say to the taxpayers of Tasmania who also make a contribution to the Commonwealth taxpayer&mdash;that we will have Big Brother in Canberra saying, `Sorry, we know better. We will take

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think most Australians would believe that state parliaments should be responsible for the money that they spend&mdash;be it raised through their own taxes, levies or fees or be it sent to them by way of either tied or untied grants from the Commonwealth&mdash;because they are closer to the sorts of decisions being made. You can only have democracy in a nation the size of Australia if you have those sorts of responsibilities at that level, a level which is much closer to the people.</PARA>

We agree that this measure, which is an amendment about the principles of accountability relating to the dispersal of Commonwealth money&mdash;I would have thought that that is something we are all pretty concerned about&mdash;might have been better placed in the bills where it was rejected previously, in those Commonwealth&hyphen;state legislation bills. But it happens to be in this package specifically because Labor asked us to put it here. Let us have no misunderstanding about that. It is here because Labor wanted it here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the actual construction of the amendment. I would remind you that this is based on the amendment we originally put forward. I do not recall in the debate&mdash;perhaps Senator Allison can refresh my memory&mdash;the government putting the counterarguments that they have put today. This particular amendment was drawn together by no less a group than the Australasian Council of Auditors-General. So let us get some substance and some power into this. Of course, if you agreed with it but you disagreed with some of the technicalities, it is always up to you to amend it appropriately. This amendment has been before the chamber since at least 24 September.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry has raised the issue of stunts. On 26 April&mdash;this is disregarding all the other interviews and so on that we have had&mdash;the Democrats announced that they would seek federal powers to try to ensure that Commonwealth money was not paid over to another government within this country which did not have an independent Auditor-General to make sure that the money was being properly spent. Gee! That is a terrible thing to do. That is the stunt on 26 April that Senator Sherry referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 6 May, in an adjournment speech, I spoke at length on the Victorian Auditor-General. On 14 July, Senator Lyn Allison participated in the public forum in Victoria on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7129"> the position of the Auditor-General. So let us have no stuff here about us being opportunistic or performing stunts. We have spent a lot of time talking to the Australasian Council of Auditors-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You can criticise, if you like, the form and the content, but do not criticise the intention. If you disagree with the intention, then you leave yourself utterly exposed. The intention is to ensure the accountability for the dispersal of Commonwealth money. That accountability cannot occur if the persons who receive it are not subject to independent audit. That is the specific problem we have in Victoria. To my knowledge, we do not have it in any other state or territory. But in Victoria they wish to take away the independence of the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be, Senator Campbell, that the government of that state is of the same complexion and has the same thoughts as you. However, this is not an ideological issue. This is about honesty. This is about watching to make sure money is properly spent. Knowing you, as I hope I am learning to do, I would find it odd and difficult to believe that you would not like to ensure that, as far as is humanly possible, Commonwealth money is appropriately spent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are no stunts. There is no malfeasance here. There is no ideology here. This is about good housekeeping.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be extremely brief because all the arguments have been put.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to the latter, I would point out that the founders and writers of the constitution were quite adamant. As you can see in section 97 of the constitution, they held to the view that the audit and review of colonial government expenditure should be maintained. If you look at what happened, the founders of the constitution, I suppose, made sure that the states themselves would establish their own auditing procedures, and until such time as that occurred, under section 97, the Commonwealth Auditor-General could exercise that particular power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think we perhaps have to look at this matter at some future time. There will be further opportunities no doubt, and no doubt advantage will be taken of those further opportunities by, presumably, Senator Murray, Senator Margetts, Senator Allison, or somebody else. I believe that we will be able to have another think about this. However, in the meantime I am supporting this amendment, though it has very little chance of getting through.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just briefly, Mr Chair: the minister had some very interesting words to say about the devolution of power. Anyone reading the documents of the Greens over time would realise that we are very big on devolution of responsibility in power and the democratic process. However, the minister's words do not ring true when you think of what currently is happening federally in relation to local government. Major issues are arising where the interests of local government, which, after all, represent all Australians, are being stomped on by a combination of state and federal governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is saying that, in principle, they believe in the devolution of responsibility, perhaps they should be taking notice of what is happening with the democratic process in relation to a number of major issues being put forward by local government. The last representatives I spoke to from Western Australia indicated that they were very angry about the current situation on a number of very important issues such as financial 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7130"> accountability, responsibility and democratic decision making at a local level. These issues, as I say, are being stomped on by both state and federal governments at the moment. If the coalition believes in devolution, perhaps they should be looking further than at state government level. The teeniest grant given by state and federal governments to an incorporated body is usually required to be independently audited. It seems bizarre that the states are not accountable in terms of auditing, whereas the teeniest, weeniest grant at federal level has to be accounted for.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer at the commencement of my remarks to the indication from government that the regulations covering this area will allow the headlines or the characteristics of contracts to be published. I cannot recall the exact words used, Senator Campbell, but I do not think it will be the terms of the contract that you will be publishing. Until we see the regulations, we will not know what you will put in them. If you were to detail who won the contract and if you were to spell out the details of the contract in terms of its main terms, that would be helpful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have raised this issue because we think that the example of New Zealand and the United States in this regard is well worth following. The clause is intended to provide for the publication of all contracts, which would alter the current accountability mechanisms to ensure that the public interest is served on a regular basis by the government having to explain when a contract, or parts of a contract, fall within the exception to the rule that the contract is a public document and must not in this instance be disclosed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment is made in the interest of accountability and transparency, and the clause will ensure that, instead of applying for contracts to be disclosed, the government must indicate the circumstances when information ought to be excluded and not released because of commercial&hyphen;in&hyphen;confidence or in order to protect the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clause provides the chief executive with the power to delete any details of costs under the contract which would unfairly prejudice the commercial interests of any body or person. The subclause should allay any fears because it guarantees that, while these contracts are to be considered public documents, there is a safety net in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This clause is consistent with accepted practice in New Zealand, where all contracts are public documents. The common practice in New Zealand is that only the detail of the schedule of costs is omitted from public disclosure. This, as a rule, would serve well 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> both the interests of public accountability and the interests of those who are concerned with the government's relationships with the private sector. While it would ensure that the public is informed of how their money is being spent and on what it is being spent, business should have no reason to fear dealings with government under such a clause since the precedent already exists for that kind of practice in other countries where it is very acceptable and works very well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have heard both Labor and the government indicate that they will not support this accountability exercise. I know, from the point of view of our party, that there is always a long haul to get you persuaded to this point of view, so we will come back to you again and again until eventually the accountability practice is adopted in some form which is acceptable to the government of the day.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of contracts in relation to contracting out and providing the services that many people rely on is very important. It actually becomes the pivotal document when services are put out to the private sector. It becomes pivotal because, when you have a government department or a government program, that program is accountable in terms of its stated aims and goals. In annual reports, in Senate estimates and in questions to the minister we have ways of finding out how and why public resources are used in achieving aims and goals or achieving the policies that are set down for them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have the Auditor-General, whose role is not to criticise public policy but to see whether the aims and goals of a program or a particular enterprise have been achieved effectively and efficiently using the resources that have been given to them. However, with outsourcing you have this point at which you can virtually go no further, unless you have access to that pivotal document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems reasonable that, if governments are using public funds, not their own money, and if they are outsourcing various aspects of programs or government entities, people should see be able to see exactly what has been asked. Again and again when we ask in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7132"> estimates committees, `Where is this line of public accountability when it comes to privatisation,' we hear this response: public interest can be maintained through good tendering documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not necessarily going to provide the funds to make sure that the public entity can write good, clear, inclusive tendering documents. We assume that it can do all of that in the process of writing the tendering document and in the contract that is signed; the agreement between the Commonwealth body, the state and the contractor. It seems ludicrous that, in that scenario, given the reassurances about public interest and accountability that have been given to us about outsourcing and the use of private entities, there is no access to the basis of the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot accept that everything is going to be in the public interest if there is no means of people knowing what it is that the companies have agreed to. Do we have to wait to see whether that company loses the contract? How does the wider community know whether or not that entity has in fact breached its contract&mdash;it is not just a contract with the government; it is a contract with the community, which is in fact paying those wages or costs&mdash;or whether the contract itself is in breach of the basic public interest requirements that we have all been given assurances are going to be the basis of all of these interactions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is undesirable that these contracts be private, secret documents. Of course, it is possible for the actual figures to be deleted from that public document, but it is totally appropriate, and I believe totally responsible, for any government to make sure that the terms of contracts be publicly available.</PARA>

Why would you want them to act in any other way? In clause 28, for example, the directors of Commonwealth authorities are required to ensure that government policies are carried out. We know that if they are not required to do that they may be breaking the corporations codes if they act against the interests of other private interests.

I point out to Senator Sherry that if you are in an area which does not necessarily get sealed roads, the relevant goods and services are access to the roads that other people in that area may have access to.

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments relate to the application of the existing Privacy Act to Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies. My colleagues on the Democrat benches have spoken a number of times about extending privacy to the private sector. In recent months the level of support for a comprehensive privacy scheme has varied and we have no such measure in place for all Commonwealth authorities and companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you know, we regard the issue of not extending privacy to the community as a whole as a backflip by the government on one of its election commitments. After releasing a discussion paper last year and a range of very positive comments from the Attorney-General (Mr Williams), the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) ended the government's commitment to what they had forecast would be an international best practice privacy scheme and, in the process, reneged on their election promise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reasons for this decision and the relevant information the Prime Minister relied on in making this decision have not been made available. Some senators in this place have suggested that submissions to the Attorney-General's discussion paper were the basis for that decision. They have suggested that the submissions show that business or sections of business did not want privacy regulation. Unfortunately, I have not been provided with access to those submissions to be able to draw that conclusion but I doubt it, frankly, based on my own understanding of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments proposed here will go part of the way to making up for government shortcomings in the privacy area. We also think that it is consistent with the government's stated approach to fixing gaps in the privacy legislation. In other words, they have said that they will deal with it piecemeal, as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and when it is needed in terms of the existing privacy regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years the Democrats have been keen advocates of privacy. The Democrats have always supported extending privacy to all sectors of the Australian community. This recognises that managing personal information is central to accountability and confidence in the way private information will be handled. These amendments simply apply the provisions of the Privacy Act to Commonwealth authorities and companies by including them within the meaning of an agency for the purposes of the Privacy Act. With these two amendments, the Privacy Act will apply in its present form with all the existing complaints, investigation and enforcement provisions presently given to the Privacy Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Privacy is materially affected by technology developments. Collecting, storing and exchanging information on electronic devices is much easier and many of the applications are dependent on that personal information. That was the reason privacy legislation was accepted by both the coalition parties and the Labor party in 1988 with the tax file number issue. Since then, the ability to collect data has expanded dramatically with the collection and storage of ever increasing amounts of personal information. We think the need for privacy is increasing, and not static. What we have proposed here is a step along that road. We hope that the committee will look favourably upon these amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems to me that if we have the private sector `competing' against government entities on the basis that they will not need to provide privacy to the public, which the public have expected from government for their personal and private information that they have to give from time to time, then that is not really competing at all; that is undermining the competitive process. It seems that then the community is giving a subsidy to the private sector. That subsidy is a very valuable subsidy. It is the subsidy of their privacy and the protection of their privacy. They know that if material is leaked about their private information to people who need not know it or should not have access to it, then at the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7136"> moment at least they can make a complaint to the ombudsperson or whomever. Unfortunately, the ombudsperson is being stomped on by government. So the government does not really want to know about those kinds of complaints.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, it is the right of people to complain if their personal information at the moment is misused or passed on to another party. It may involve people being harassed or having information about them unfairly distributed to other people who should not have it. Or it may mean that their information is marketed by other people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why should we suggest that it is reasonable for the private sector to undercut the public sector on the basis that the privacy is the subsidy and the community pays it? If you were to ask the majority of the people in the community whether that was reasonable, they would say no. Therefore, I urge the committee to support Senator Murray's amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments relate to matters which we have discussed before under other bills. They deal with the question of gender specific language and gender amendments. Gender specific language is language which operates to exclude, at both overt and subtle levels, either men or women. Language, as you know, is a clear way in which social reality is constructed. If this was not so then there would not be so much concern at issues named as `politically correct'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Re&hyphen;introducing masculinist gender specific language is a process of trying to wind the clock back and to, once again, make women invisible in legislation. This reflects a current phenomena in this parliament where women's issues have significantly dropped down the agenda, and it is contrary to the government's law and justice policy and the women's policy statement which highlighted this government's commitment to women's equality and ensuring protection of antidiscrimination measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since we started moving these amendments, we have had various people once again claiming that the origin of the word `chairman' is Latin. There is dispute about that. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Oxford English Dictionary</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Random House Dictionary of the English Language</EMPHASIS> make clear that the first use of `chairman' was in the 1600s and was specifically taken from `chair' and `man'. Personally, that is irrelevant. The fact is that it bothers a lot of people. If that is so then we should be careful to avoid causing unnecessary offence. The use of masculinist gender specific language is contrary to a matrix of established legal and policy principles.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7144">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional affairs. In its 1993 report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Clearer Commonwealth law</EMPHASIS> it unequivocally stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years Commonwealth drafters have taken care to use both masculine and feminine pronouns when legislation is intended to apply to both males and females. Legislative drafters should ensure that women are not `invisible' in the law and the committee believes that interpretation of legislation should require phasing in of use of words and of appropriate gender in all legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was a cross&hyphen;party recommendation. The relevant recommendation flowing from this statement was that Commonwealth legislation should provide that words of the masculine gender do not include the feminine gender and words of the feminine gender do not include the masculine gender. This recommendation received cross&hyphen;party support in the House, including from committee members Daryl Williams, Peter Slipper, Peter Costello and Chris Miles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following that situation, the Acts Interpretation Act, which I deal with here in our amendments, was not, unfortunately, then amended to incorporate this recommendation but recent legislation implemented by the current government, before the lunacy that has started to prevail, clearly reflects this recommendation. For example, the Statute Law Revision Act 1996, which received royal assent on 25 October 1996, provides for the amendment of 58 acts to replace gender specific language with gender neutral language. The Attorney-General's second reading speech states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the bill continues the process which has been going on for some years of altering gender specific language in acts. The main element in this process is the insertion of feminine pronouns to accompany masculine pronouns . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So you have to ask, `What is going on here, where the Prime Minister can pursue an agenda which is not shared by his subordinates?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 23 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, which refers to rules as to gender, states that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . words importing a gender include every other gender; . . . 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the old fashioned way of thinking. That is an archaic section, and it is at odds with the above recommendation that I have quoted of the report on clearer Commonwealth laws and the practice of ensuring gender neutrality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Prime Minister continues to insist on using gender specific language, the government may be seen to be making a backflip over its previous position. I am given to understand it is even possible that the Prime Minister's office has instructed draftspersons to pursue a line of argument in this area which is entirely contrary to the findings of cross&hyphen;party, unanimous bodies such as those as I have quoted earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There appears to be no written policy instigating the shift in gender specific language. If there is, I would appreciate the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer tabling it because we would really like it exposed to the world. Such a policy would be contrary to the government's commitment to open and transparent government processes. If such significant policy decisions are to be made, they should be made open to public scrutiny through parliamentary debate. I record here that in the past I have had the pleasure of the unanimous and strong support of the two Green parties, Senator Harradine and the Labor Party in this matter, who between them just cannot see the point of the foolishness. This lengthy set of amendments will go a very long way to restoring the situation of gender neutrality in our legislative language.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I was sitting in a legal and constitutional committee hearing when one of the witnesses advised us that some important areas of the Acts Interpretation Act had never been amended by governments of the day simply because they never got around to them. However, this made the practice and operation of law in examining various bills very difficult. I asked the witness if she could provide me with some examples. She did so and, of the set of examples, there are two that I have put before you today because I think they are useful in helping advance the modernity and usage of drafting matters and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Believing that the Attorney&hyphen;General's bill would be coming up the next day, I took the precaution of faxing him a letter on 28 August 1997. It was headed `Acts Interpretation Act 1901 via the Audit (Transitional and Miscellaneous) Amendment Bill' and it asked him if he would be good enough to respond by commenting on these amendments so that we could proceed to them without much debate or, if there were to be any changes, I could be so advised. To this date, I have received no reply. This is not unusual&mdash;I have written to him on a number of matters in the past and I have not got replies. Quite frankly, I want to record in this chamber the dissatisfaction that I have with the Attorney&hyphen;General's office in responding to correspondence from my office. I hope that is not a matter that is a problem for everybody else as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This particular amendment that I refer to concerns the marginal notes and headings to sections of section 13, and I will briefly advise you of what the problem is. Section 13(3) currently excludes from being part of an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7146"> act any marginal note or heading to a section of an act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason is historical. Both marginal notes and headings to sections were formerly notes added by way of explanation in the margin of legislation after it had been passed or made. As such, the words lacked the authority of the parliament. Today marginal notes and headings to sections are on the bill as printed for discussion by parliament, and it is anachronistic that they are still excluded. The contrary intention clause there has been added for certainty, because some acts specifically reverse the rules in subsections (2) and (3). It is relevant to these bills because these bills are affected by such rulings but it is also a technical amendment. I do hope that the government will support the amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murray, can I firstly say that I was a bit distracted for a small part of your contribution, so if I have missed what you said in part, I apologise. The government will not be supporting the amendment. The reason is the way we regard changes to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901&mdash;which I am told, to interpolate, is the only act in existence or in use which is actually older than the Audit Act. As you know and as most senators know, the Acts Interpretation Act is the fundamental piece of law which underlies the interpretation of all acts of this parliament, and the Commonwealth takes a very sensibly cautious and conservative approach to amendments which seek to make changes to a piece of legislation where you would need to be very cautious as to the effect that such alterations would have to the way that all other acts of the parliament are interpreted.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not legally trained&mdash;my legal training is very small&mdash;but this is a broad&hyphen;ranging set of proposals to a piece of legislation which underpins all acts of this parliament, and I would be very surprised if the Attorney&hyphen;General could give you advice in such a relatively short time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The carriage of this motion will enable me to move two amendments which I have circulated. The first amendment is numbered on the amending page 681.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second amendment would be moved in the event that the first one was not carried. That amendment would be consequential upon a decision made by the Senate when this bill was last before the Senate. At that time, the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) was the minister representing the government and he&mdash;and I think this is fair&mdash;belatedly advised the chamber that there may be a need for a further amendment if the amendment the chamber was then considering was carried.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam Chairman. I use those words despite the amendment that was carried in this chamber a moment ago. That, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7151"> unfortunately, is the proper usage. I would like to recognise you in non&hyphen;masculine terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has moved that the committee not insist on the amendment. The opposition opposes that motion. We wish to persuade the Senate that it should insist on this amendment, on the grounds of, basically, fairness and what any reasonable Australian would argue is equitable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue here concerns rollover relief. By not insisting on this amendment, the Senate would enable the government not to value the personal wealth of an individual taxpayer, along with their business accumulated wealth, when it comes to the question of rollover relief. That would create an inequitable position for those who are in a position of having considerable personal wealth compared to those who are in a position of having inconsiderable personal wealth&mdash;or to put it in plain English: the rich benefit and the poor do not. For those reasons, we think the Australian fair go mentality, the reasonable person, the look&hyphen;after&hyphen;the&hyphen;underdog mentality and straight&hyphen;out equity and fairness require that the amendment carried by the Senate now be insisted upon despite the government's disinclination to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a way, and in microcosm, the government's insistence on its position reflects the fundamental difference between the parties. We in the Labor Party&mdash;indeed, I have to acknowledge the Greens and the Democrats too&mdash;have argued directly and frankly that ordinary Australians should be protected here. The government is arguing a position which advantages wealthy Australians. When we talk about wealth, the level of wealth we are talking about is $5 million, which is not an inconsiderable amount. I expect that normally my colleague Senator Sherry would make this argument, but on his behalf I put those views to this chamber at this time.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats think we should insist on this amendment. We had the debate last time. Since that time, there has been a lot of misinformation out there in small business land about what the Senate has and has not done for small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about capital gains tax rollover relief for small business, but we have to note that the Senate has already supported the tax bill to allow proceeds of the sale of one business to be rolled into another. It has done that, which is a positive thing for small business. What we have been asked to do since then is to agree to a further tax concession to allow proceeds to be rolled into superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember we asked the government to provide some modelling on this. We asked: how does this measure add to or reduce national savings? The government has failed to provide that modelling. In fact, I think it might have even refused to do so, but I stand to be corrected on that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that is true; I think you have the whole Treasury over there&mdash;press the button. I think we have made the point before that a lot of tax breaks for savings, while good in theory, do not work because the cost of the tax break to the revenue ends up being higher than the increase in savings concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also said that we are prepared to support well&hyphen;targeted tax breaks, but we do not think this one is well targeted. I do not think it is genuinely small business. I do not think $5 million worth of business assets is really medium to big business masquerading as small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill actually proposes opening up a new loophole. It is the Treasurer (Mr Costello) who has made a big deal, since he has been Treasurer, of saying that he is going to seek out the riddlers and the rorters of the system. Yet, at the same time, the government wants to open up a new $250,000 tax break.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People who have business assets of up to $5 million are multimillionaires. For a lot of people in business that might not sound like much, but I can assure you that, to the huge majority of Australians out there trying to save for retirement, $5 million is something they could never dream of attaining. We have to ask: are the people who have $5 million 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7152"> worth of business assets the kinds of people who really need a new $250,000 tax break for retirement savings?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we had this debate last time, the Senate moved an amendment to tighten this $5 million cut&hyphen;off by including personal assets within that cap. That is what we are arguing about. We said that that was the right thing to do because this prevents already&hyphen;wealthy multimillionaires from being able to take advantage of this new tax break that was designed to benefit small businesses. We argue that the number of people affected will be very small and they will be quite wealthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should remember that what we are talking about is retirement savings&mdash;trying to ensure that a tax break is sufficient to ensure that small business people have adequate retirement savings. Retirement savings are not just business assets. Retirement savings include the family home or business properties. They include art. They include investment properties. They include collectables. That is the point we are trying to make. If we are trying to decide whether a new tax break for retirement savings should be made available, then we should look at all the ways a person saves for retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think this government is about a fair deal for PAYE taxpayers. I do not think it can claim to be serious about preventing rorts while at the same time opening up the possibility for this one. This is a government that cracks down on social security recipients; it is the same government that cracks down on public housing tenants, that cracks down on the unemployed who have a bit of superannuation put away but, at the same time, wants to give those who have $5 million worth of business assets a gift&mdash;a $250,000 retirement gift.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government argues that this was an election promise. I looked in the fine print for the election promise which said, `We will give a $250,000 gift to multimillionaires on retirement,' and I could not find it. I did find election promises about maintaining Austudy, about maintaining job assistance programs, Medicare, child-care assistance, public housing funding, and rent assistance. But, as we have already said here, it seems that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government has misplaced these non-core promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a point of principle. Five million dollars is a lot of money. It is not small business we are talking about. It does not compare favourably with ordinary Australians who are trying to save adequately for retirement. I think the committee is right to insist on the amendment to tighten the means test to keep multimillionaires out of this tax break, and to stop this government from opening up a potential tax rort.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the previous occasion this legislation was being considered, I understand that Senator Cook made some comments like those which have just been made by Senator Kernot; and I understand that such comments were made not just by the Democrats but also by the Greens and Senator Harradine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We took the strong view that, when considering CGT tax relief of up to half a million dollars to be granted where the net business assets of the taxpayer do not exceed $5 million, we should take into account in that equation their personal asset wealth. I pointed out on the previous occasion that 97 per cent of small businesses have net business assets of under $1.3 million. If they have personal assets of something more than that $1.3 million then, under the government's proposals, they&mdash;this 97 per cent of small business&mdash;are still entitled to a substantial benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kemp, I think in one of his deep criticisms of me in question time&mdash;and I say that somewhat sarcastically&mdash;said, `Senator Sherry, don't&hyphen;tax&hyphen;the&hyphen;rich Sherry'. That was his reference, and they were his direct words. Here we have an example of the government, in the guise of assistance to small business&mdash;and we welcome the assistance to small business&mdash;not ensuring that multimillionaires do not benefit from the proposed capital gains tax relief of up to half a million dollars where it is rolled over into superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The argument is that this measure is to assist in respect of retirement incomes, and that is fine. But the very small number of small businesses that will be affected by the effective cut-off by the inclusion of personal 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7153"> assets in calculating the benefits to be derived from this measure&mdash;a very small number of small businesses, indeed&mdash;I certainly do not believe are `battlers' in the true sense of the word. Certainly, the vast majority of small businesses are battling in a very difficult economic climate at the present time&mdash;that climate brought about, I would submit, by this government and the economic environment it has created as a consequence of its two budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When considering these sorts of very substantial changes, we do have to weigh up what has occurred to other sectors of the community. We have debated on numerous occasions the introduction of the new social security provisions that really slug people at the age of 55 and take into account their superannuation assets&mdash;and, in many cases, they are not substantial superannuation assets by any manner of means&mdash;and the effective requirement to draw down on their superannuation assets on reaching the age of 55.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot has referred to attempting to find this extraordinarily generous commitment to, this promise for, the top end of small business, in wealth terms. Like Senator Kernot, we cannot find it either. There is a general commitment to assist small business. But, if these measures are to be passed by the Senate, they should be appropriately targeted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second argument, again, is one that Senator Kernot has touched upon, and it is this: if this government is serious about cutting out potential or existing rorts and rorting of the system, and bearing in mind the difficulties that most PAYE taxpayers face, we should have regard to the sorts of measures that pass through this Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would conclude my remarks by saying that Labor does not intend to change its position on this particular matter. As I said earlier, 97 per cent of small businesses have net business assets of under $1.3 million. Also, as a consequence of the passing of this legislation, there will be a substantial benefit to at least 97 per cent of small business. In fact, it will be somewhat higher than 97 per cent, but we have not been able to obtain the precise figures. For the reasons I have outlined tonight, and for those I outlined on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> previous occasion when this amendment was successfully passed by the Senate, we believe that it should be maintained in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997 .</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond to a couple of points. The first point is that raised by Senator Kernot and alluded to by Senator Sherry about the government's credentials in relation to tax avoidance and anomalies. One of the reasons that the government is insistent upon the $5 million threshold for small business&mdash;the definition of a small business for this measure&mdash;is that it wants to ensure it is consistent with the threshold that applies to the rollover relief that Senator Kernot has already spoken about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are other reasons which I will go into, but in 18 months this government has already taken action on R&amp;D syndication, it has taken action on infrastructure borrowings, it has taken action on luxury car leasing, and it has taken action on withholding tax avoidance&mdash;a very strong performance in a short time. I think Senator Kernot would have to acknowledge that Mr Costello has not only talked hard about taking action where tax 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7154"> avoidance or aggressive tax minimisation is brought to our attention but we have also acted very quickly and have brought legislation before the parliament on all of those matters.</PARA>

This government has already brought a number of these measures to the parliament, and we are keen for a whole range of good reasons to ensure that tax avoidance, anomalies and aggressive tax minimisation schemes are stopped in their tracks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with trying to change the $5 million threshold, which already applies to the capital gains tax rollover provisions which this government brought in, is that it brings in an inconsistency which is not sensible. Because the amendment would require people with amounts above $5,000 to be valued, it also puts an enormous compliance cost upon small business people, and we did not want to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What needs to be said is that this government is absolutely unreservedly pro&hyphen;small business. We think that Australia's small business people are the foundations for economic growth and economic expansion. We believe that tomorrow's medium sized businesses and bigger businesses will come from today's very small businesses. Rather than saying that we are giving multimillionaires assistance, this government is providing $500,000 worth of capital gains tax relief. So less than half of that in terms of the benefit is being provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said in the initial debate, we are providing it to people who, in the main part&mdash;and I do not have the statistics at hand, but I think those of us who have spent a lot of time 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in small business or with small business people would know this&mdash;have put everything on the line in their small businesses. Many of them do not have other forms of savings. They invest whatever they have into their small businesses. They go through very rough periods. They had to go through Mr Keating's recession that he told them they had to have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry has referred to the tough economic position at the time. I am sure he would have also regarded the period of Mr Keating's recession as very tough. At that time interest rates for a number of small business people at places like Custom Credit or AGC were close to 30 per cent. Things were a lot tougher. Certainly things are still tough for small business, but we believe that interest rates, a range of other policies and these tax measures are getting better for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Small business people put all of their savings into their businesses. Their lifelong work is in small business. This is a small but important measure which will provide a very good incentive for small business people to build their small businesses and to reap some reward at the end of it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a small contribution to this debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R208">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1997</XREF> , which is currently before the Senate. I think it is quite appropriate to note for the record, as a range of other contributors to this debate have done, that the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R208">Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3)</XREF>  as it currently stands provides for capital gains tax relief of up to half a million dollars to be granted where the net business assets of the taxpayer do not exceed $5 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition amendment that we are considering will extend this test by changing it to a net assets test to include all the personal wealth of a taxpayer. It does not harm us to stop at this stage to consider the significance of the proposal that is being put before us by the government. In any person's language, $5 million is a huge sum of wealth and it really would take a large amount of effort to earn it and to retain it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concession, the relief, that is the subject of the debate this evening, offering 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7155"> something in the order of up to $250,000 relief to that taxpayer from his or her tax burden at the end of each financial year, is a huge amount of dollars. It is particularly so when one considers the overall thrust of this government to reduce outlays, to pare back outlays in a whole range of areas that have been under discussion in recent months. So the quantum in terms of tax relief for savings that is being offered to one small sector of the community&mdash;in the order of $250,000&mdash;is, as I have said, not insignificant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor does not believe that when individuals retire they seek to live only from the proceeds of business wealth. They will also, of course, access personal wealth. That being the case, it is the opposition's belief that all personal wealth should be included for the purposes of determining a taxpayer's eligibility for the half a million dollars capital gains tax relief. This is, as we are all aware, an identical amendment to that which was moved to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1997 earlier this year. As I recall, that was supported by the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing before us this evening that has caused the opposition to reconsider its position, and later this evening when we go to a vote we will be taking the same position we pursued when this matter was discussed at first instance some months ago. We see no reason why, when a person retires with considerable business wealth, their personal wealth should be ignored in the determination of what is a very significant benefit that will be paid for by the broader Australian community and Australian families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of concessions are means tested by the government. A few examples are the family payment, the family tax initiative and the spouse rebate. I do not think it is untoward to comment that a lot of the means tests which have been introduced in the last 15 years or so were introduced by the current opposition when we were in government. The principal position was that those who are going to receive a benefit from government through either the social security system or, in another guise, the taxation system should not be receiving that benefit when they have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> acquired, earned or retained their own considerable personal wealth over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt in my mind that, over the next 18 months, as this government continues, if it continues, down the same path in terms of the more recent amendments to the taxation act and the developing superannuation debate, concessions that are offered by government to particular sectors of the community&mdash;whether they be big business, small business, pay as you earn taxpayers or those who incorporate their own private and business arrangements in different forms under the law of the day&mdash;will be, increasingly, very targeted and very specific. Indeed, one suspects that, as the years go on, the ceiling that applies to a range of benefits is increasingly going to be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a trend that has occurred over the last 15 years and a whole range of reasons have generated cause for that trend. It is not something that is occurring in isolation in this country. It is occurring in the United States, in Western Europe and in Great Britain. Indeed, if you go to the United States, the ultimate means test was introduced in that country during the last session prior to the last election. President Clinton enabled a bill to be passed through Congress that had the effect that persons who receive welfare benefits&mdash;and welfare, of course, is widely defined in that country&mdash;after a maximum of five years are automatically deleted from the rolls, under the law of that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not entitled to receive future welfare benefits, no matter what may have been the justification. It applies to persons who receive food stamps assistance and family income support measures, particularly for single mothers. They have made the decision in that country to limit that benefit to a maximum of five years for recipients. That is a fairly radical change that overturns all established social security payments in that country that date from the days of the first Roosevelt administration in 1934 when the present social security system was devised in the United States. It has flown in one form or another particularly to the Anglo&hyphen;Saxon world and to a range of countries in Western Europe. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7156">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That initiative has spread. It has certainly been picked up by previous governments over the last 15 to 20 years in this country and, undoubtedly, will spread further in this country in forthcoming years. The difference between the United States, when they introduced their elimination of welfare benefits for a whole range of persons, and this country is that they have effectively zero unemployment in about 90 per cent of the country. The notional unemployment rate is something in the order of 4.9 per cent in a whole range of areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one looks purely at the statistics, there is over&hyphen;employment&mdash;that is, unemployment is down to one, two or three per cent. So forcing that bill through the Congress, removing hundreds of thousands of persons from the welfare rolls in the United States, has had minimal impact on the ground because there is full employment and plenty of work around. Those who have been receiving welfare benefits are receiving what some would describe as a very gentle introduction to the labour market in that for the next two years they receive a form of re-education or work training in a vocation or profession of their choice. So the harmful effects of cutting back on welfare will not have the disharmonious consequences that otherwise may have been the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the interesting consequences for United States companies will emerge in terms of the capital gains tax that is levied on profits derived by incorporated associations in that country. The move is already about. After reducing welfare expenditure by billions of dollars, the suggestion is that the central government in that country no longer requires the tax take that it did, say, two years ago. As a consequence of that, there is a serious suggestion emerging from the corporate community that capital gains tax be reduced from 37 per cent to 22 per cent as part of an interim step to eliminating all capital gains tax and all incorporated associations in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, if that occurs, they will be able to keep as retained earnings something in the order of tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars that those companies would otherwise 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have paid to central government. Those retained earnings will be able to be invested in further capital expenditure in terms of technology or equipment or distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends. Either way, it will make United States companies incredibly cost effective.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R183">Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Male Total Average Weekly Earnings Benchmark) Bill 1997</XREF>  gives effect to the coalition's election promise to maintain the single adult pension and veterans' entitlements at a quarter of male total average weekly earnings. The importance of male total average weekly earnings must be emphasised as opposed to other indicators, such as the average earnings of people at large or the mean weekly earnings of males which, as a lot of people would be aware but some may not, are lower than the levels of male total average weekly earnings. If the maximum basic rate of indexed pensions falls below 25 per cent of male total weekly earnings it will be increased under this legislation up to that 25 per cent level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This measure is to take effect as soon as it is carried through this house. Its effect will cease as of 20 September, 2002. So it will be in effect for a period of five years. It is worth noting that the way this bill is framed does not fully honour the government's election promise because this is not a measure that continues to take effect; it is of limited effect for a period of five years. This is ensured by the sunset clause, which only guarantees this rate for a period of five years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has a further concern, and that is that there is no benchmarking of other benefits such as allowances. Allowances are generally those payments made to people who are of working age but who, because of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> misfortune, inability to obtain work or sickness, are not in employment. Therefore, they receive an allowance from the Commonwealth. This bill does not ensure that post the year 2002 pensioners can rely on the promise made by this government of pensions being maintained at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is of concern to know what the government's agenda might be on this issue. Why have they not seen fit to continue this measure past the five-year period? You do not need to look much further than the National Commission of Audit, which examined the benchmarking of pensions to male total average weekly earnings. The National Commission of Audit said about this measure that it is a risk to Commonwealth finances and that it weakens incentives for retirement and to find employment. They believe that the relevance of male total average weekly earnings should be assessed because of changes to the sex composition of the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, the National Commission of Audit believes that the pension should only be adjusted on the basis of regular reviews in light of relevant circumstances. The National Commission of Audit recommended that the link between pensions and the rate of unemployment benefits and other allowances be reviewed. We know that for the period of the Labor government, though there was no legislative requirement, an informal arrangement, a link, between pensions and benefits was maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the government's election commitment to maintain pensions and veterans' entitlements at 25 per cent, it has asked the National Commission of Audit to examine the issue. You have to ask why. Why do this if the government is bound by a promise? It is clear to the opposition and to the community at large that the government is looking for an opportunity, looking for ammunition, to wiggle its way out of this promise, as it has wiggled out of so many. Certainly the government would like to implement the National Commission of Audit recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have dealt with why it is important that we maintain the benchmark against male total average weekly earnings and I would like to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7158"> reflect a little further on this issue. If this were not the benchmark that was applied, there would be a 16 per cent drop in the value of pensions if they decided to benchmark it against average weekly earnings rather than male average weekly earnings. During the time Labor was in government they maintained the 25 per cent benchmark. When we left government last year, pensions were 25.3 per cent of male average weekly earnings. In light of the audit and the great silence of the government on this issue, it is clear to me that they intend to remove the link between pensions and unemployment benefits that would ensure that unemployment benefits value is maintained. Certainly, the five-year sunset clause means that the length of the government's commitment is limited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the committee stage of this bill, or later in the second reading debate, I will be very interested to hear from the minister the justification for this sunset clause and whether a commitment given during the election is only a commitment to the elderly people of the Australian community for a limited time. Was this a promise made not so much to preserve the pension rate in real terms but to corral elderly people's votes and to trick them into voting for this government on the basis that their pensions would remain at the same level in real terms?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other areas where pensioners have had a pretty hard time. In general business last Thursday a lot of these matters were raised. I suppose that many people in the government are tired of hearing about why elderly people and particularly pensioners are worse off under this government. It is worth while reminding you over and over again that not only their pension rate but also a lot of the benefits that they have obtained previously are under threat. Indirect benefits or services have been cut away quite seriously in a very short period. And I will remind you again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth dental health program was abolished. Many people may recall that the federal government, during Labor's term, decided that many elderly people were not able to access dental health care. It is very unusual for a person on a pension having 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trouble with their teeth to be able to afford to go to a private dentist. This need was ascertained by the previous Labor government and additional funds were provided under the Commonwealth dental health program. The problem is, of course, that that program has now been abolished and, in many cases, the routine dental care that is needed for pensioners is no longer available. If you are a pensioner you may not be able to access regular care, and even if you have a severe toothache you may be waiting for three to five days before you even get to see a dentist, unless, as I said, you have enough money saved up to see a private dentist. Few pensioners have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have also been losses in the pharmaceutical area. There has been a 50 per cent increase in the co&hyphen;payment for those with health cards, which includes pensioners. In the last budget there was the new drug tax, estimated by the AMA to cost an additional $30 per month. Again, for those on a pension that is a major hike and it is going to mean that pensioners cannot afford the health care that I believe they are entitled to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has also been the removal of a number of standard items from the PBS list&mdash;many that are often used by our pensioners. They include medicines for stomach pains, diarrhoea, muscle pain, vomiting and fungal infections. This means that items will cost pensioners from anywhere between $3.20 and $10 more than they previously did&mdash;a pretty raw deal for people who have made a contribution to the community for their whole adult lives, in many cases, and have paid taxes. Now, in retirement, this government is belting them around the head. In fact, with these changes to aged care there is an effective marginal tax rate of 100 per cent for part-pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I outlined in some detail what this government has done in the area of nursing care where they have introduced not only an entry fee but also a daily charge. The eventual result of these changes will be that there will a two&hyphen;tier system of nursing care. There will be the haves and the have&hyphen;nots of nursing care. I have indicated to this chamber over and over again&mdash;I hope the message is getting through to this government&mdash;that the industry 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7159"> itself has indicated that, on average, they would be charging entry fees of $40,000 and that in some cases those entry fees would be as high as $100,000. That certainly is not a small amount. It is not an amount of money that a large number of people in the community are going to be able to afford.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is particularly sad in light of the fact that, as we have reminded the government, entering a nursing home is not a decision you make because you feel like a change&mdash;you are a bit sick of your neighbourhood so you decide you might move into a nursing home. The reason people go into a nursing home is that they have become so chronically ill and so frail that they are no longer able to maintain themselves in their own homes. Generally, to take up a place in a nursing home is the last option considered by both the individual involved and their family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is particularly sad to see that this government is again singling out this particularly vulnerable group in the community for these sorts of additional charges and poor treatment. Even though, on the face of it, this bill takes up the government's promise to maintain pensions at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings, there is in fact no such guarantee contained in the way this bill is framed. In putting this bill before the House of Representatives and the Senate, this government is taking the opportunity to break the nexus between pensions and benefits that has existed for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another issue that I wish to mention briefly while dealing with this bill. It was indicated that there was some urgency over this matter and that it should be brought on as quickly as possible, but my understanding is that this bill was debated in fact in March in the House of Representatives. As it is now almost the end of September, I would like to hear the minister comment on that particular issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this matter is so urgent and if it is to satisfy a promise made during the election, why has so much time elapsed between the debate of this bill in the House of Representatives and the debate here in the Senate? I do not believe that poor management by the government in ordering its business can be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the real explanation why this bill has sat on the backburner for all those months while other bills, ones that this government has chosen to put on the list for debate here in the Senate and give a priority over this bill, have come through from behind it and overtaken it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to indicate that the opposition will move a number of amendments in relation to this bill. Those amendments should have been circulated. If copies have not been received by the government and other parties, perhaps they might indicate to me to that effect when they make a contribution in the second reading debate because the amendments deal with matters that are extraordinarily important to ensure that the promise this government has made to our pensioners is not only complied with in form but is also complied with in substance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments, which number from one through to 14, will have the effect of ensuring that this government meets its promise. They will ensure that this government guarantees that pensions are maintained at that 25 per cent rate, not retrospectively so that they are always falling behind but so that they keep pace with that promise over the period, and that they will be based not on the level of average weekly earnings in arrears but on the estimated average weekly earnings for males in advance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will also be removing the restriction that puts in place a sunset clause that ensures that this promise is good only for five years. We will also be doing that, of course, for the veterans payments, which are also pensions. We will also be ensuring that the connection between pensions for elderly people and benefits payable to the unemployed remains,  and that those people who are on a benefit do not fall behind. In particular, we will ensure that the 25 per cent guarantee is maintained for couples&mdash;pensioners and also people who are unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, all these measures are meant to ensure that the promise this government made during the election is not only met in theory and in form but in substance. I would like to deal with these amendments in some further detail at the committee stage. I thought it would be worthwhile to highlight them at 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7160"> this stage to ensure that the minister and members of the minority parties can fully appreciate and observe the intent of them if they have not already had the opportunity of doing so.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going to speak for very long, but I want to remind the Senate that some time ago some research done by the coalition suggested that there may be a change in the way in which pensions would be calculated from using male total average weekly earnings as the benchmark to simply average weekly earnings. At the time everyone was given a jolt when they realised the implications of that, and I am pleased to say that the government backed off at a great rate of knots when that whole implication was questioned. As is said in the second reading speech, the government made a promise at the election that it would maintain male total average weekly earnings as a benchmark.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats are pleased that the government is giving effect to that commitment and that promise. Lined up against all the promises that have been broken, it is important. It is equally important that we acknowledge when a promise is kept because it is surprising sometimes that this does happen. However, as Senator Neal has said, there are some problems with this particular legislation, and so the Democrats are inclined to listen very carefully to the debate. I understand that we have had the amendments in our hands for a only short period, which makes it difficult for us to respond to the detail in them. We certainly knew the thrust of the amendments and we were in support of those, but we will need to look at the detail before I can sign them off. We will probably now have time to do that because, I presume, we are not going to get to the committee stage tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot give an ironclad guarantee that we will be supporting the detail of these amendments, but we will be looking carefully at them. In conversations we had with the Labor Party at the time, we were in favour of the thrust of the amendments. I just indicate that is the position we are in. We are glad that the government has at least partly fulfilled the promise that it made, and it deserves com 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mendation for that, but we believe that promise can be sharpened and improved. To that end, the Democrats will read very carefully the amendments moved by the Labor Party, and we will give an indication during the committee stage of how we will be voting.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to be able to speak on this legislation, the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R183">Social Security and Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Male Total Average Weekly Earnings Benchmark) Bill 1997</XREF> , which actually enshrines in law the maintenance of the single adult rate of pension at 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. I am sure we will see the government trumpeting this legislation as their own and saying that this simply gives effect to a pre&hyphen;election commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I actually applaud them for at least honouring that commitment. After all, it is a very rare occurrence indeed that I am actually able to stand here and speak to legislation that gives effect to any of the government's pre&hyphen;election commitments. Given the post&hyphen;election proliferation of non&hyphen;honoured, non&hyphen;core commitments, there are not too many opportunities we have to actually stand up in the chamber and say that they managed to honour one of their commitments. So that is why I am being so generous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of course, as you would expect, it is not quite as simple as that. There is a lot more to this legislation than just giving effect to a pre&hyphen;election commitment. You really need to understand the history behind this legislation. It is certainly not a piece of legislation that the government can in any sense call its own. Speakers from the other side I suppose could be justified in saying that this was a promise given by the coalition to maintain the payment of pensions at 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. The social security policy document of the coalition said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under a coalition government, the pension benchmark of at least 25 per cent of average weekly earnings will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, that is the benchmark that we set when we were in government. We constantly maintained the benchmark at above 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. In

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth saying tonight that these issues were initiated by me on behalf of the opposition during debate on the Social Security (Budget and Other Measures) Bill last year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to address comments made by Senator Murray in the Senate on 26 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> June this year regarding land administration practices in the Northern Territory, which are clearly based on innuendo and supposition when read in conjunction with the facts. At best, his comments can be described as a grab bag of unsubstantiated allegations made by either uninformed political opponents or disgruntled idealists who would rather live in a museum than the dynamic, vibrant place that is the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray questioned the effectiveness of a parliamentary system where my political party has been in power for its entire 23&hyphen;year life. The results of the general election of the Northern Territory, held on 30 August 1997, give a resounding response in support of the Country Liberal Party. Out of a possible 25 seats, the Country Liberal Party gained an astonishing 18 and the Labor Party a very poor seven seats. This is almost a three per cent swing to the CLP and a three per cent swing from the ALP&mdash;hardly the result to be expected if, as Senator Murray would have us believe, the lack of opposition has, to quote him, `led to a few arrogant and tired government members running to their own agenda and riding roughshod over people in the Territory'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nothing could be further from the truth. Let me inform the Senate of the exceptional growth of the Northern Territory economy and the growth in employment that people are enjoying there. The Territory has the lowest unemployment rate: 4.8 per cent, compared with 8.2 per cent nationally. Territory employment grew 2.7 per cent last year, which is well above the national average of 0.9 per cent. Average weekly earnings increased by 4.5 per cent in the Northern Territory compared with 3.6 per cent nationally, giving territorians Australia's third highest average salaries after the ACT and New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Northern Territory economy continues to grow at an exceptional rate. BIS Schrapnel recently predicted a staggering economic growth of the Territory of around eight per cent, helped by three oil and gas projects worth $2.5 billion, which are expected to come on line in five to eight years. The Northern Territory government forecasts of about five per cent growth would still be the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7162"> envy of other states, and the partnership between the Northern Territory and federal governments on railway proposals and constitutional development leading to statehood will only complement the Territory's land administration regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it would be extremely difficult for a government to achieve the exceptional record and statistics that I have just outlined without the support of its people and without being energetic, fair and open in its dealings. I contend that the Northern Territory has politicians who are the most in touch and closest to their constituents in Australia due to the small size of their electorates and to the very nature of the Territory and its politics. It is ridiculous to suggest that territorians would continually vote in politicians that they were familiar with if they ran roughshod over them and ignored their wishes, as Senator Murray claimed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would now like to address the specific allegations made by Senator Murray and to set the record straight. On the matter of town planning, Senator Murray says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Open government means making the process of planning and approval transparent and open to scrutiny, but the Northern Territory scenario is apparently neither of these.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On what basis is this statement founded? The facts are that the Northern Territory planning act was completely rewritten and simplified in 1994 after 12 months of extensive public consultation. The current planning processes give greater opportunity than ever before for community involvement. Notwithstanding these advances, the Northern Territory Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment has recently announced further improvements to the act to even better reflect community needs and simplify processes. These include a review of the planning act, which will be carried out in close consultation with the community. One of the proposals foreshadowed is the appointment of a community representative for each division of the Northern Territory Planning Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray also refers to an announcement by the Darwin Lord Mayor, Mr George Brown, that he would resign from the Northern Territory Planning Authority over the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Northern Territory government's contempt for residents' wishes. This was in relation to a specific proposal which George Brown voted for himself when it went before the Northern Territory Planning Authority, of which he was then a member. The hypocrisy would almost be laughable if it were not so serious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to land acquisition, Senator Murray has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Northern Territory government has offered unacceptably low compensation to landowners in its drive to resume land for the Alice Springs to Darwin rail corridor.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The facts are that the Northern Territory Lands Acquisition Act is modelled on Law Reform Commission recommendations and is the only statute of this type in Australia to embrace these recommendations. In addition, the Northern Territory (Self&hyphen;Government) Act clearly prevents the Northern Territory government from acquiring land on less than just terms. It is also a fact that land acquisition can be very emotive for affected people and the value placed on land by owners in those circumstances does not always reflect the true market value. Offers of compensation made by the Northern Territory government have all been at the assessed market value plus any special value as determined by the Australian Valuation Office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principal objective is to try and reach a negotiated settlement. Departmental staff are authorised to negotiate within specific parameters in order to try and reach a settlement. Unfortunately, in some cases this cannot be achieved and compulsory acquisition becomes necessary. In these cases the level of compensation payable is assessed by an independent arbiter: the Lands Acquisitions Tribunal. Again, Senator Murray has not reflected on the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray also refers to the direct land sales and says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as the direct sale of crown land is not a publicly visible process in the Northern Territory it begs to be questioned.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He also infers that deals have been done with developers and questions why crown land is not sold by auction or public tender. The facts are, again, that the senator has got it wrong. He really should review the processes of his 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7163"> information. I table a public information brochure, published by the Northern Territory government, which outlines the methods of the sale of crown land. This document clearly states that the most common method of disposal of crown land is by a public competitive process such as auction, tender or the invitation of applications. It also clearly states that the direct sale of crown land is an opportunity only available when proposals satisfy strict qualification criteria. The most common proposal is the sale of adjoining crown land for consolidation with private land for expansion of existing development or a major new development. This approach accords with the commercial sector practices relating to the aggregation of land for major new developments and is an appropriate and proper activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray has said the direct sale of crown land is not a publicly visible process. It is a pity he did not read the crown lands act before making this allegation. Section 12 of the act clearly specifies that the minister shall notify the details of the direct sale of crown land in the gazette within 60 days. I am advised this happens in every case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Development of the foreshore and escarpment area is another issue. Senator Murray mentions the development of the foreshore escarpment area overlooking Stokes Hill wharf and the wharf precinct. Yet again Senator Murray has got his facts wrong. The Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment has formally declared land use objectives for the central Darwin area which clearly identify existing public open space and escarpment areas are to be retained. I suggest the senator obtain a copy of the land use objectives, which provide clear evidence of the Northern Territory government's stated objective to maintain significant open space in the central business district area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In closing, I place on record my deep disappointment that Senator Murray should use this chamber to cast wildly inaccurate and denigrating allegations against the Northern Territory government. Perhaps he may care to explain his motives. The Democrats sanctimoniously sit in this chamber as the watchdogs of the two major parties. It is an unfor 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tunate analogy, particularly in this case as watchdogs are normally useful. If Senator Murray wishes to adopt the role of watchdog over the Northern Territory's planning process then that is up to him. But it would benefit all concerned if he attempted to get his facts right before alerting us to problems that do not exist. It is no wonder the Australian Democrats are not relevant in the Northern Territory. This is highlighted by their dismal showing at the last Territory election, where they managed to field a single candidate who performed very poorly against the electorate winner, the CLP candidate for Drysdale, Stephen Dunham.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray also failed to cover any issues relating to the impact on Northern Territory land administration of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and the Native Title Act. The current federal government is conducting an important review of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and amendments are now before the parliament to amend the adverse effects of the Labor&hyphen;Democrat&hyphen;Greens deal on native title imposed in their 1994 legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray's inaccurate and clearly unsubstantiated allegations are no more than an unnecessary carping at the positive leadership being shown by the CLP government. The Northern Territory government is rapidly progressing the social and economic wellbeing of all Territorians, with the strong support and approval of the vast majority of Territorians.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7163"><TITLE>South Australia: Election</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on a matter of great interest to me and to Australia and our economy. I am referring to the Australian tourism industry. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr John Moore, recently announced his intention to develop a national tourism plan. It is this plan that I wish to discuss. Before I do, however, I want to refer to another recent government, or at least departmental, initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have just had the pleasure of reading a small booklet recently published by the Office of National Tourism. The ONT is the Commonwealth's foremost tourism policy advisory body. The booklet is titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Today's consumer, tomorrow's visitor</EMPHASIS>. This booklet gave me a great sense of hope. Here is a Commonwealth government agency that has recognised the central importance of the environment and sustainability to the success of the major industry that it services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The booklet sets out in clear terms, backed up by the results of numerous surveys, the priority that tourists and visitors from all over the world now place on the protection of the natural environment and the adoption by the tourism industry of environmentally sustainable practices. It demonstrates that Australia has unique opportunities to secure its place as a premier world destination for the many millions of tourists who want to experience 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7168"> nature, wilderness, wildlife and living indigenous cultures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That Australia still has so much opportunity in this regard is more in spite of, rather than because of, successive government and corporate policies and practices at both the federal and state levels. Indeed, as we increasingly recognise the enormous value of our natural environment and living indigenous cultures, we should pause to give thanks to the many thousands of Australians who have worked so hard, often in the face of strident opposition from governments and industry, to protect those values and attributes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since I became the Australian Democrats spokesperson on tourism, I have become aware of the strong and urgent call emerging from within the industry all across Australia for increased government attention to the protection of our natural environment and our environmental amenity&mdash;in other words, upholding and giving substance to our clean, green image.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In light of this, I am profoundly disturbed when I see, as we all do on a daily basis, decisions being made by this and other governments that are steadily eroding our environment and hence the basis of our tourism industry. Obviously, there are many questions that need to be asked and answered about the interaction between government and tourism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given this, it seems timely that the Commonwealth, through tourism minister the Hon. John Moore, has recently announced the development of a national tourism plan. The development of the plan is a welcome initiative. However, the government must be made aware that, on the basis of what we already know, as summarised in the Office of National Tourism publication, any meaningful plan will need to set out strong recommendations for the protection and sustainable management of Australia's environment and natural qualities. In other words, if the plan is to have any credibility, it will necessarily bring into sharp focus the conflict that currently exists within this government in relation to its policies on tourism, resource development and the environment. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As part of the process of developing the national tourism plan, a discussion paper has been published which summarises the aims and scope of the plan. That discussion paper hints at some of the problems such a plan will, or should, confront the government with. I will quote some excerpts from the section of the discussion paper dealing with the role of government. On page 5, the discussion paper reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A wide range of Commonwealth portfolios, however, have responsibility for policy issues that have a significant effect on tourism activity. It is therefore important that a `whole of government' approach be taken in the formulation of the National Tourism Plan . . . It is important to ensure that industry sectors are treated equitably and fairly.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Reading further through the discussion paper, it is apparent that the environment and sustainability must feature prominently in the final plan. Page 2 of the paper reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[Tourism] is an industry which can make an important contribution to the . . . conservation of our unique natural and cultural heritage;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Page 4 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth is favourably positioned to consider `big picture' issues. It has significant influence over . . . a range of policy areas that impact on tourism such as . . . the environment and international conventions and agreements;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Page 10 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of Australia's tourism icons are environmentally sensitive natural attractions. The long term viability of these attractions depends on their conservation and careful management. As visitor numbers increase, greater pressure will be placed on our natural resources and appropriate management practices will need to be adopted.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If the government is true to its own core statements and the wider concerns of the industry, when the plan is finalised it will potentially present this government with a major dilemma.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How does one reconcile the clear and compelling information contained in documents such as the Office of National Tourism booklet with, for example, decisions to open up uranium mines in one of Australia's greatest tourism drawcards, to permit the ongoing clear&hyphen;felling of our unique old&hyphen;growth forests, to construct resorts on sensitive coastal environments adjacent to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7169"> Great Barrier Reef, or to dam the Fitzroy River in the Kimberley? At its most crude level, what we see are governments and corporations greedily seeking to have their cake and eat it too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see governments paying lip&hyphen;service to the concerns and recommendations of increasingly enlightened sections of the tourism industry at the same time as compromising the future of tourism by giving preference to inherently unsustainable industries and developments. But it is not true of everyone within government. There are people who understand the dangers of this approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are the implications of current government commitments, written and unwritten, for tourism? Is this government prepared to reformulate its policies in relation to key environmental issues in order to facilitate the development of the tourism industry to its full potential? Will it be prepared to take a strong stand on key policy areas such as greenhouse and renewable energy, recycling and waste minimisation, air and water quality, wilderness and national parks, native title and the development of sustainable transport systems, including airports and rail?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments love to talk up, and benefit from, tourism&mdash;and so do the communities. But are they really prepared to restrain their developmental greed and adopt a longer term vision to allow for the long&hyphen;term viability and sustainability of that industry? When the government's response to the tourism plan is presented, it will tell us a lot about whether this government is serious about tourism or if it is being somewhat opportunistic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I close, I would also like to point out that the tourism industry itself faces some hard choices about its own directions and standards. As the industry increasingly realises where its future lies, it has some significant sustainability and other policy challenges of its own. Some aspects of the industry will inevitably not be sustainable and, in some cases, are actively eroding Australia's environmental credibility. There are issues ranging from waste minimisation and recycling, the use of renewable energy and environmentally friendly products in the construction and ongoing operation of tourism facilities, right 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> through to the issue of carrying capacity in natural environments and policies on the siting of tourism developments, which all need to be addressed and resolved across the industry. The industry also faces difficult moral and economic choices in relation to such issues as support for native title and acceptance of appropriate standards for employees' wages and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next couple of years offer governments and the tourism industry the chance to get their respective houses in order. The benefits of doing so will be immense, long lasting and job creating. Failure to do so will see Australia lose its marketing edge and become another worn out and indistinguishable destination on the global tourism trail.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7169"><TITLE>Drugs: Swiss Heroin Trial</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8U4">Senator LEES</NAME><STATE> (South Australia&mdash;</STATE><ROLE>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(10.23 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to highlight the success of the Swiss heroin trial, technically known as the `medical prescription of narcotics trial'. One of the reasons for my doing this is to acknowledge the very successful referendum that has just been held on the weekend in which 70 per cent of voters in Switzerland supported the continuation of this trial. Indeed, it has been so successful that the Netherlands has now decided to go ahead with its own trial and at least three other countries&mdash;Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg&mdash;are also looking at similar trials.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also rise tonight because of the enormous amount of misinformation still being spread about exactly what this trial involved. It was a medical trial. It was a detailed, scientific and thoroughly researched project which ran for three years. It involved some 1,146 patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major aims of this trial were to measure the effects of the prescription of narcotics on, firstly, the health of the participants, but also on their social integration and what I guess we could call their `dependent behaviour'. It also was aimed at looking at the suitability of this treatment for heroin addicts who had unsuccessfully tried before to quit the habit. Indeed, most of them had 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7170"> failed on quite a number of occasions with other programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The program specifically looked at this particular narcotic compared with several others. There were, in fact, three drugs involved, three substances tested&mdash;morphine, methadone and heroin. They were used orally and intravenously. The minimum age of participants was 20 and, as I have said, they all had to have tried previous programs and, indeed, had to have a heroin addiction problem of at least two years. They also had to be able to show that their health, as well as their social integration, had suffered as a result of their addiction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were two double blind studies where neither the patient nor the therapist knew exactly what medication it was that the patient was on. There were three randomised studies, and there were 11 studies that had individual indications. Eighteen treatment centres across the country were used during the trial; and an international specialist group, appointed by the World Health Organisation, was set up to independently appraise the results. So what were the results?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we begin by looking at the effects of the different narcotic substances: those patients who were prescribed heroin were more willing to stay with the program and adhere to treatment than those given either injectable morphine or methadone; injectable morphine and methadone were found to be of limited use, in fact, and heroin was described as being far more useful because it had fewer side effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On social issues, the participants' housing status improved. Indeed, by the end of the trial there was none that was described as homeless. Their job prospects rose considerably. Participants with permanent employment went up from 14 per cent to 32 per cent. Also, a large number of participants' debts were reduced considerably. A third of participants who had been dependent on welfare required no further welfare support. Most participants stopped or lessened their contact with the drug scene but, unfortunately, a lot of them did not establish the new social 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> contacts that those involved with the trial had hoped would eventuate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to criminal activity, income from illegal or semi&hyphen;illegal activities dropped dramatically. Only 10 per cent were still involved in that sort of thing at the end of the trial, as opposed to the 59 per cent who were when the trial started. Both the number of offenders and criminal offences decreased by about 60 per cent in the first six months of the trial. This was substantiated by access to police records; it was not just on the word of the participants. Court convictions also decreased significantly, and that evidence was directly obtainable through court records.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On to the costs and benefits of the trial. There was a cost, and this was borne by the public and private sponsors. This added up to 16 Swiss francs per patient per day. But, when one takes into consideration the overall economic value of the program, it was found that there were savings in criminal investigations, prison terms, and in terms of the amount of expenditure on the health of the participants to the tune of 96 Swiss francs per patient per day.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was evaluated that there was an economic gain of about 45 Swiss francs per patient per day from the trial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No matter what criteria you use to evaluate the Swiss trial, it was far from a failure, whether you look at the impact on the health of the patients&mdash;and I stress that, in the short time available to me tonight, I have only touched on a fraction of the health benefits&mdash;such as the reduction in infections from such things as HIV and also Hepatitis C, as well as a range of other improvements and indicators; whether you look at their improved housing status; whether you look at their increased social integration; or, indeed, whether you look at the economic benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would ask this government to consider again not only this particular program but a range of other alternatives to the `get tougher with drugs' scenario that, unfortunately, we hear particularly promoted on a number of our talkback radio programs. I certainly  hope that, with the move now in Europe, we will find this government thinking again.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="10.29 p.m." PAGE="7170"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 10.29 p.m.</EMPHASIS>

<PARA STYLE="Para">29 August 1997:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) With specific reference to the Telstra contract for W3, the south&hyphen;western region of Western Australia (WA), granted to E&amp;E Distributors Pty Ltd: is the Minister aware that in WA Telstra has let contracts for the distribution of White Pages telephone directories to a commercial company, where previously these were handled by various community groups seeking to raise money for charity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) is the Minister aware that the new commercial contractor is in many cases subcontracting deliveries back to community groups who have made deliveries in previous years but at a much reduced rate; and (b) does the Minister appreciate the social cost of the loss of this community resource, particularly in rural areas, at a time when government policies are driving a dramatic increase in the call on charities; for example, in Mandurah a Lions club with almost a decade of experience delivering telephone directories calculated that the price they were offered equated to $6 per person per hour, before allowing for the costs of running a vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Does the Minister condone this transfer of funds out of community groups pursuing charitable purposes, into the hands of a commercial organisation; and does the Minister endorse the driving down of prices paid for volunteer workers giving

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator Alston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question based on advice from Telstra is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) For some years Telstra had relied on contractors&mdash;many of which were voluntary organisations and community groups&mdash;to distribute its directories around Australia. Previously, more than one thousand local contractors were required by Telstra to ensure delivery of its more than 20 million directories. Whilst many of the community groups involved in directory delivery provided good service, when considered nationally, there were many instances where this service did not meet Telstra's or its customers expectations. Consequently, Telstra developed a more customer orientated and cost effective delivery process for directories throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the contract for W3, the south&hyphen;western region of Western Australia, Telstra received a large number of submissions from a range of organisations for directory distribution contracts which were evaluated on purely commercial grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) Sub&hyphen;contracting of directory distribution work is permitted under Telstra's directory delivery contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) With a view to providing continuity of work and the benefits which flow from the consequent fundraising, Telstra invited former contractor groups within the W3 south&hyphen;western telephone directory area to contact the successful tenderer. Telstra understands that some of these groups accepted the terms and conditions offered by the professional contractor and others, like the Lions Club of Mandurah, decided not to participate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Whilst Telstra's decision to introduce a more efficient and cost effective delivery system for directories may have led to concern by some community groups regarding reduced revenue opportunities, Telstra considers that the opportunity still exists for community groups to continue to benefit from directory delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Whilst Telstra and other carriage service providers have universal service obligations under the Telecommunications Act 1997, such obligations do not extend to the delivery of telephone directories by community groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)Telstra has introduced the revised delivery process on an Australia&hyphen;wide basis.
