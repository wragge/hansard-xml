<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Petition of the undersigned shows that only one group have been excluded from eligibility for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1394"> repatriation benefits in the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) where such group has performed honourable overseas `active service'. That group being members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 which were excluded under `Operational Service' at Section 6.(1)(e)(ii) of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various claims made in Statements to the House and the Senate and the contents of correspondence from various Ministers to maintain the exclusion are answered as follows, the answers are from documents obtained under Freedom of Information Act and from the public record:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) `They were never allotted for operational service', (contained in a letter from the Hon. Con Sciacca Minister for Defence Science and Personnel 1995). A letter from the Secretary Department of the Navy to Treasury dated 11 November 1955 stated `the date that the Navy were allotted for operational  service was 1 July 1955'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) `Members of the RAN were only doing the duty for which they had enlisted', (October 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation). This applies to Service personnel everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) `They were in no danger', (November 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). They shared the same danger as all other Australian Service personnel serving in Malaya at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) `They were not on Special Overseas Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop Minister for Defence Industry Science and Personnel to Mrs Williams of Adelaide dated October 1996). Requirements for Special Overseas Service was introduced in 1962 without retrospective conditions, therefore has no reliance to events of 1960.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v) `They were not on Active Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop Minister for Defence Industry Science and Personnel dated October 1996). It is now, as it was then, that Service Personnel had to comply with one of three requirements for Active Service, this group complied with two, or twice as many as is needed. The one that they did not comply with was, `is in military occupation of a foreign country'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request that the Senate should remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act, thereby giving the Australian sailors involved comparative recognition with the Army and RAAF personnel that served at the same time, and all other Australians who have served their Country on active service overseas.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator Newman</NAME><FROM>(from 30 citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PETITION PAGE="1394" TOTAL.SIGNED="57" PRESENTERS="Newman, Sen Jocelyn" NAMEIDS="BE4"><TITLE>Repatriation Benefits</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1395"> members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator Newman</NAME><FROM>(from 57 citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this report is to advise the Senate on action taken by the Committee in respect of legislative instruments made in preparation for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a sporting nation and there are few events which excite the national imagination like major sporting events. In the year 2000 Sydney will host the Olympic Games, which is probably the greatest sporting spectacle of all. The preparations for the Games have attracted continuing community interest. For instance, since the Parliament rose in December the official Olympic mascots have been launched and there has been considerable discussion about the Australian Olympic Committee investment in the Reef Casino Trust in Cairns. The Games are also of interest to Governments;  the Commonwealth has a Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Sydney 2000 Games, The Hon Warwick Smith MP, and New South Wales has a Minister for the Olympics. Also, the cost of staging the 2000 Games is estimated at $2 billion, of which the Commonwealth and the New South Wales Governments will each pay a share.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years the Senate has had a leading role in sports administration in Australia. For instance, the Australian Sports Drug Agency was established in response to the recommendations of the then Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. Those recommendations had strong bipartisan support and under the legislative structure of the Australian Sports Drug Agency Act 1990 and Regulations made under that Act, Aus 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1402"> tralia has established an international leadership role in the fight against the use of prohibited drugs in sport. The Committee scrutinised these Regulations, in the course of which they were amended to meet our concerns. The Act was most recently amended in 1996 to allow ASDA to cooperate better with international sports organisations to conduct drug tests, to improve Australia's successful anti&hyphen;doping program and to reduce the likelihood of technical legal challenges to a positive drug test. The second reading speech for those amendments advised that they were in the context of the goal of a drug free Sydney 2000 Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has now scrutinised a number of instruments affecting preparation for the 2000 Olympics, the most important of which being the Australian Sports Drug Agency Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1996 No 163.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These present amendments of the Australian Sports Drug Agency Regulations implemented the 1996 changes made to the Act, in particular in relation to procedures for drug testing of athletes, the use of new drug testing equipment and the ability of the ASDA to comply with the requirements of international sporting federations. These were all important provisions, which the Committee scrutinised in the usual way to ensure compliance with its high standards of personal rights and parliamentary propriety. The Committee found a number of apparent defects in the Regulations and wrote to the Minister for advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first problem was that a number of provisions appeared to affect personal rights. These diluted safeguards for competitors who are under 18 years, intellectually handicapped or who are unable to understand English, by providing only that the ASDA "may", rather than "must", notify a responsible person before asking such competitors for a sample. Further, those persons so notified "may" be the competitor's carer, coach, team manager or certain family members and, if the competitor is unable to speak English, ASDA "may" communicate with them through an interpreter. Finally, a drug control official making a request for a sample "may" identify themselves and tell the person that he or she is an ASDA official. The result was that compliance by ASDA with these safeguards was voluntary, not mandatory. In fact ASDA need not comply with any of the above safeguards when requiring a sample from, for instance, a 15 year old non&hyphen;English speaking athlete or an intellectually handicapped deaf athlete. The Committee advised the Minister that it accepted that these provisions may be based on the intention of the amending Act to reduce legal challenges on technical grounds. However, the Committee suggested to the Minister that this object was achieved by another provision 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the amendments, which expressly provided that substantial rather than strict compliance is required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the Regulations prescribed five private courier companies which could be used by ASDA. These included services operated by such well known Australian companies as Mayne Nickless and, at that time, TNT. The Committee was concerned that the Explanatory Statement gave no indication of how these were selected to provide what is presumably a commercially profitable service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, the Information Sheet prescribed by the Regulations advised athletes that different procedures may apply for their tests if they were not Australian. The Committee asked the Minister whether the same procedures and safeguards would apply to non&hyphen;Australian as to Australian athletes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fourthly, the Information Sheet provided only one telephone contact number for the ASDA, which was in Canberra and which did not appear to be a free call. Given that the Regulations were at least partly in the context of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, the Committee asked the Minister whether the Information Sheet would be amended to provide a Sydney number as well as the Canberra number.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister's detailed reply advised the Committee that, while the requirement for substantial rather than strict compliance was sufficient to prevent legal challenges on technical grounds, it was necessary for the ASDA to retain a discretion in respect of individual competitors to ensure that drug testing was smooth and efficient. In relation to the courier service the Minister advised that the provision did not oblige the ASDA to use one or more of the services, but the list would be reviewed and expanded if other courier services could demonstrate that they can provide the required service. In relation to the Information Sheet, non&hyphen;Australian athletes are subject to different result management procedures. Also, notwithstanding that the amendments are partly in the context of the Sydney 2000 Olympics, drug testing is conducted in all States and Territories so it is preferable that any questions that cannot be answered on the sport by the Drug Control Officer should be directed to ASDA head office in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted the Minister's advice but still had concerns about the Regulations, largely in the context of the Sydney Olympics, and therefore wrote again to the Minister. The Committee suggested that while the Minister's advice on permissive rather than mandatory procedures could apply to athletes under 18 years of age or who did not speak English, it could not apply to intellectually disabled competitors. In relation to the courier services the Committee advised the Minister that his advice did not appear to be correct, in that the Act provides for prescribed courier services and a notice delivered by any other courier service would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1403"> not be validly given. The Committee suggested that the Regulations should be amended to provide mandatory safeguards for intellectually handicapped athletes and for companies to apply to be prescribed as courier services, with AAT review for any company which failed to demonstrate that it could provide the required services. The Committee also asked whether the ASDA telephone inquiry procedures could be reviewed before the 2000 Olympics. The Committee emphasised again that it was particularly concerned at these provisions because they would affect the operation of the Sydney Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shortly after this letter, on behalf of the Committee, the Chairman met with officers of the ASDA, including the Chief Executive Officer, and discussed those concerns. The Committee is grateful for the assistance of these officers. The Minister then wrote to the Committee advising that the Regulations would be amended to meet our concerns and that the telephone procedures would be reviewed. The Committee appreciates this cooperation from the Minister, the Hon Warwick Smith MP, which demonstrates a commitment to personal rights and parliamentary propriety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next instrument dealing with the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games was the Trade Marks Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1996 No 184, which provided the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee with trade mark protection for their logos and mascots while maintaining secrecy up until the time of their official launch.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To obtain this protection and secrecy the Regulations postponed the publication of trade mark applications by SOCOG and SPOC for three months, thus exempting those applications from the requirement that trade mark applications must be published as soon as possible after an application is filed, which in practice is two to three days after filing. The Explanatory Statement for the Regulations advised that public release of the 2000 Games logo and mascots prior to the official launch would have serious consequences for the promotional impact of the launch, which would affect not only the organisational credibility of SOGOC and SPOC, but also possibly good standing of the Commonwealth government in relation to support for protection of the intellectual property rights of the Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement further advised that the cost of staging the Sydney Games is estimated at about $2 billion, which will be shared by SOCOG, SPOC, the government of New South Wales and the Commonwealth government. The ability of SOCOG and SPOC to market the Games is important for a good budget outcome. In these circumstances, the Explanatory Statement continued, the real benefit of postponing publication far out 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> weighed any potential inconvenience to other applicants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was concerned at the advice that this unusual privilege provided for by the Regulations could cause potential inconvenience to other people and wrote to the Minister. The Minister advised the Committee that in principle a person who applies for registration of a trade mark which conflicts with a Games trade mark would lose the application fee or, if already using a trade mark in the mistaken belief that it did not conflict with any earlier filed application from Games organisers, might be required to cease using the mark and thus incur financial loss. The Minister further advised, however, that the likelihood of a person proposing, in good faith, to register or use a similar trade mark would be extremely slight and in reality there is very little potential for anyone to suffer disadvantage. The Committee accepted this advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although not directly related to the Sydney 2000 Games the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Regulations (Amendment), Statutory Rules 1996 No 244, is of significance to those interested in the legislative supervision of sport. Those Regulations extended the protection of the enabling Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986 to documents, more than 30 years old, relating to the Melbourne 1956 Olympic Games. The Regulations included such documents in the movable cultural heritage of Australia, which is subject to export control. The Committee did not have any concerns with these Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances will continue to scrutinise legislative instruments affecting the Sydney 2000 Games and will report to the Senate on any interesting or unusual provisions. The Committee will be particularly vigilant in examining such instruments, given the earlier role of the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts and the continuing public interest in the administration of sport and in the Sydney Olympics.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Legislative Instruments Bill 1996 is now before the Senate. This bill introduces what is stated in the second reading speech to be the most comprehensive reforms to delegated legislation in Australia. The purpose of this paper is to set out the consequences of the bill for Parliament, which effectively means the Senate, and the role of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances in ensuring that the bill recognises all proper aspects of parliamentary propriety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this stage I point out that the entire project which led to this bill originally resulted from suggestions made by the then Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee, Senator Bob Collins, and its legal adviser, Professor Douglas Whalan, at the Second Conference of Australian Delegated Legislation Committees held in Canberra in April 1989. I add that this particular conference was graced by delegates from our present hosts, New Zealand, and by several other commonwealth countries. Some of the delegates from that conference are with us now. These hardy veterans include Tom Helm, Victor Perton and Rick Setter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At that conference in Canberra Professor Whalan described how there were many Commonwealth legislative instruments which were not subject to disallowance. In one act, instruments made under one provision of the act were disallowable while instruments made under another very similar provision were not. Senator Collins then observed that it would be an interesting exercise to look at this, particularly because it was not easily possible for members of the public to find out what laws were in force in any individual case. After further discussion, Professor Whalan suggested to Dr Cheryl Saunders, President of the Administrative Review Council, that this was the kind of matter which the ARC could investigate. Dr Saunders then confirmed that it would be the ARC which would be likely to do this sort of project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Administrative Review Council, which is a statutory body with the function of advising the government on administrative law, then adopted these suggestions and in 1992 produced a report which found that Commonwealth delegated legisla 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion varied in quality and was inaccessible and obscure. The report recommended that a new act address these problems. The then government subsequently introduced a bill in 1994 to implement those recommendations of the ARC, which it had accepted. At this point I should make it clear that there were two Legislative Instruments Bills, one introduced in 1994 which lapsed when Parliament was prorogued before a Federal election on 2 March 1996 and another introduced later in 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1994 bill provided for registration of all new and existing delegated legislation and for a consultation process for instruments which affect business. More importantly, however, from the point of view of the Committee, the bill provided for Parliament to have a greater role in the scrutiny of delegated legislation. All legislative instruments, with limited exceptions, were to be subject to tabling and possible disallowance. This was a major reform, because legislative instruments have heretofore only been disallowable if the enabling act expressly provided for this. Also, the bill required instruments to be tabled within six sitting days, which was a considerable advance on the present 15 sitting days. The bill also provide for a new procedure under which a House may defer a disallowance motion for up to six months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was especially concerned that the bill should recognise the proper position of the Parliament in relation to delegated legislation, the essence of that position being parliamentary supremacy over the executive. Delegated legislation only exists because Parliament provides for such power in acts. There is no independent power for the executive to make laws, even though public administration would be impossible without delegated legislation to provide for the day to day operation of acts. Also, Parliament has delegated, but not abrogated, its responsibilities with respect to legislation. Parliament must, therefore, establish and maintain control over delegated legislation by ensuring that legislative instruments are subject both to tabling and to disallowance. Unfortunately, the executive does not fully appreciate this and the bill included a number of provisions which appeared to be inspired by Sir Humphrey and which in some cases even represented a reduction in the existing safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Australia there is a further dimension to Parliamentary propriety in the context of delegated legislation. This is that the Commonwealth of Australia has a federal, rather than a unitary, parliamentary system. I know that our hosts here in New Zealand, and the home parliaments of a number of other delegations, have a unitary system where the problem of the executive attempting to usurp the role of Parliament may, and I emphasise may, be less acute than in Australia. There has been a recent tendency in Australia for Commonwealth, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1405"> State and Territory governments to address specific areas of legislative concern, such as companies law, by agreeing to so&hyphen;called national schemes of legislation, under which the different levels of government make complementary and cooperative legislation. The executive now asserts that such schemes should be exempt from disallowance, apparently on the basis that the delegated legislation providing for the schemes is so important that it can't be disturbed, even by the Parliaments which are the sole source of the power to make these laws. The Chairs and Deputy Chairs of the various Australian legislative scrutiny committees have now tabled, in every Parliament in Australia, all nine of them, a Position Paper on Scrutiny of National Schemes of Legislation. My colleague and good friend, Senator Barney Cooney, will present a paper at this conference on this topic so I shall not traverse the matter further other than to say that my Committee believes that the position of the executive on parliamentary scrutiny of national legislative schemes shows the necessity for continuing vigilance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate referred the 1994 bill to the Committee for inquiry and report. During our inquiry the committee received submissions from, among others, the Law Council of Australia, the Attorney&hyphen;General, the Administrative Review Council, the Business Council of Australia, the National Farmers' Federation, the Australian Council of Social Services and last, but certainly not least of this august company, from Victor Perton on behalf of the Victorian committee. Our inquiry into the bill was revealing. Although the general structure of the bill was commendable, it included a number of provisions which appeared to reflect the views of Sir Humphrey Appleby.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noticed immediately a quite fundamental problem in the 1994 bill which would have emasculated the power of Parliament to supervise effectively the making of delegated legislation. The bill provided for the Parliament to disallow only an entire legislative instrument, displacing the existing provision under which Parliament may disallow any individual provision of an instrument. I point out to delegates that 1989 this power was the subject of a court challenge in the case of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Borthwick v. Kerin, </EMPHASIS> (1989) 87 ALR 527. The essentials of the matter were that the Senate had advanced a broad interpretation of the disallowance power, while the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department and the Solicitor&hyphen;General argued for a narrower power. The Federal court came down decisively on the side of the Senate and the government did not choose to appeal against the decision, although it could have done so. In any event the Committee was startled to notice this restricted power in the bill, which would oblige a House to disallow the whole of a lengthy instrument, even if it only objected to a single provision of only a few 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lines. In reply to the Committee's inquiry the government informed us that the omission was an oversight and that amendments would be circulated to address the dozens of times that the oversight occurred in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also had, and in fact still has, problems with a provision which required the Attorney&hyphen;General, on request by a rule&hyphen;maker, to issue a conclusive and unreviewable certificate as to whether or not an instrument is legislative. This could be a judicial power exercised contrary to the Australian constitution. In any case, if the power was administrative, the bill not only removed the review power of the Federal Court, but failed to provide for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Also, even if the clause was technically valid, the Committee pointed out that laws should be interpreted by an impartial court and not by a Minister of the government of the day. In addition, the issue of a certificate may mean that in some cases an instrument will not be disallowable even if Parliament assumed that such instruments were legislative when the enabling act was passed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee therefore had considerable reservations about this power when it reported to the Parliament in 1994. It considered that the question of whether an instrument was legislative should be determined in accordance with the terms of the bill and be subject to judicial adjudication if required, as with all other such questions arising under legislation. Nevertheless, the Committee advised that it was prepared to accept the provision subject to acceptance of its recommendation that such certificates themselves be disallowable. Also, if a certificate determining that an instrument is not legislative was disallowed, the Committee recommended that the instrument in question should be deemed to be legislative. This would alleviate the possible problem of the Minister and the Senate having different views on the status of an instrument. Given that officers of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department had officially informed the Committee that there would be very few such certificates the Committee noted that this solution would have little effect on the operation of the bill. The previous government then accepted the views of the Committee and circulated amendments to this effect. This, we consider, was a major and welcome change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also did not provide for sunsetting of legislative instruments, although this was recommended by the ARC. The reason for the exclusion was the resource intensive nature of the work needed. Instead, the bill provided for staged backcapturing of instruments, under which all instruments in force would eventually be registered, but would not be subject to disallowance. A future review would examine the need for sunsetting. The Committee did not oppose this, because any 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1406"> amendments of existing instruments would be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the bill provided for a specific regime for rules of court made by Federal courts, on the basis that any supervision of these rules by the executive risks interference with the independence of the judiciary. The Committee did not object to this, but did point out that, as presently drafted, the separate regime need not be subject to parliament scrutiny. The government accepted this and circulated amendments to the effect that rules of court would continue to be subject to tabling and disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also commented on a new provision which had no counterpart in the Acts Interpretation Act, under which a House may defer consideration of a motion of disallowance for up to six months. This is in contrast to the present position under which, after tabling, notice of disallowance may be given within 15 sitting days and must be dealt with in a further 15 sitting days. These provisions ensure relatively swift action. The Committee did not oppose this new provision but did note that, while appearing to strengthen parliamentary control of legislative instruments, in practice it might favour the government. A Minister could use the existence of the provision to urge deferral of disallowance to order to allow time to amend the unacceptable provision. The experience of the Committee is that at the end of this time the Minister would probably say that circumstances have changed, that it is no longer practical to amend and that in any case the provision should remain because it has been in force for six months. The Committee concluded, however, that there were circumstances where the new provision would be useful, but that the Senate should remain alert to any misuse by the executive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also did not provide for tabling of reasons for several types of statutory decisions, including a decision that consultation is not required. Here again the previous government agreed with the Committee that this should be done and circulated amendments to this effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also noted that the bill did not provide for an annual report to Parliament on the operation of the scheme which it proposed. The Committee, however, accepted advice from the government that such a report would be included in the annual report of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally in respect of the 1994 bill the Committee accepted the view of the Vice&hyphen;Chancellor of the Australian National University that the bill should not apply to legislative instruments made by that institution which affected the content of academic courses. The Committee was assisted in its consideration of this matter by its then Chairman, Senator Mal Colston, who has for many years 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> represented the Parliament as a member of the Council of the ANU. Unfortunately the government was unable to agree with the Committee on this point.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, the final form of the 1994 bill, taking into account the agreed amendments, was acceptable to the Committee. The bill, however, had not been enacted when a federal election was called for on 2 March 1996 and so lapsed. After the election a fresh Legislative Instruments Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and, following passage in that House, subsequently in the Senate where it is still to be debated. The structure of the new bill is essentially the same as the previous bill, with similar procedural safeguards which represent, to quote the new second reading speech, a significant shift in control of delegated legislation back to Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee thoroughly scrutinised the new bill for any dilution or diminution of parliamentary power, particularly in light of advice in the second reading speech that the bill imposed a uniform regime on legislative instruments with only, to quote the Minister, "very limited exemptions". Unfortunately the Committee found that the bill included some provisions which would derogate from the proper role of Parliament. At this point I emphasise again that the intention and overall scheme of the bill is commendable. For instance, the bill now accepts the position of the Committee with respect to rules or orders made under the Courses and Degrees Statute of the Australian National University. There are, however, problem areas which detract from the ability of Parliament to supervise the government when it makes law and which do not recognise parliamentary supremacy over legislative instruments. I will now outline these areas of concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the bill still provides for the Minister to issue a conclusive certificate that an instrument either is or is not legislative, but this time with no provision for disallowance. The bill now provides that the Federal Court may review the decision to issue a certificate. Such review, however, will examine only the procedures and not the merits of a decision. Also Federal Court actions are expensive. The basic objection of the committee to this provision, which I outlined earlier, still remains. On behalf of the Committee, I met twice, at some length, with the Commonwealth Attorney&hyphen;General, the Honourable Daryl Williams, to discuss our concerns with the bill, although most of this time was spent on the conclusive certificate. The Committee appreciates the time which the Attorney spent personally on the matters which the Committee raised. We have now received formal advice from the Minister that he is unable to accede to our request that the bill should provide for disallowance of conclusive certificates. The Minister advised that the certifi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1407"> cates were in essence legal opinions and that disallowance was therefore not appropriate; this was an issue of principle which should not be set aside.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Next, the bill provides that instruments providing for national legislative schemes should not be subject to disallowance, although they would be tabled. A similar provision was included in government amendments to the 1994 bill, but not in the bill as originally introduced. I think that these amendments were issued after the Committee's 1994 report. However, as I have mentioned earlier, the Committee considers that Parliament should have the same options over such instruments as it has over other legislation, much of which is of far less consequence than national schemes. The Minister has now advised the Committee that the exemption should remain until a statutory review of the operation of the act in three years time. The Committee supports the idea of a review, but considers that in the meantime the bill should provide for parliamentary scrutiny of instruments in this important area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides that prescribed instruments dealing with Commonwealth employment are not legislative instruments, thereby removing them altogether from the operation of the bill. They would not even be tabled, much less be subject to disallowance. These instruments could include determinations made by the Remuneration Tribunal which provide for the salary and allowances of senior government judicial and administrative officials, which are of obvious interest to Parliament, and other determinations providing for the pay and conditions of public servants and defence personnel. There were 265 such determinations tabled in the Senate in 1996, many of which were defective. The Committee has advised the Minister of its view that the determinations should continue to be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny, but we have not yet received a reply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the bill provides for certain quarantine proclamations to be subject to tabling but not to disallowance. This provision was a late entry, not being included in the old bill or the new bill as introduced but rather included as a government amendment. In fact, it was such a late starter that the explanatory memorandum gives no reason for its inclusion. However, the Committee thinks that this late starter should be an early scratching. Scrutiny by the Committee revealed that penalties for breach of the proclamations in question included imprisonment for 10 years and a fine of $100,000. Unfortunately the Minister has advised that he is unable to agree with the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have reported to the Senate on the Committee's concerns with the bill which, as I say, has yet to be debated. While we do not know the result of that debate I can advise this Conference that action by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Committee has already resulted in more appropriate recognition of parliamentary propriety. Sadly, I can also advise that certain other provisions of the bill would bring a smile and a nod of recognition and approval from Sir Humphrey Appleby. These provisions are defects in which is otherwise a worthwhile reform.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 348</EMPHASIS> , which is the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts' review of the Tax Law Improvement Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is the second tranche of legislation to replace progressively the<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Income Tax Assessment Act 1936</EMPHASIS> . The first tranche of legislation has also been reviewed by the JCPA&mdash;in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 345</EMPHASIS> &hyphen; and is currently before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that this Bill rewrites existing law does not diminish its importance. There are few pieces of Commonwealth legislation that affect more Australians than the tax laws. It should be a matter of considerable concern, therefore, that the most significant of these laws&mdash;the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936&mdash;is in danger of collapsing under the weight of its own complexity. This problem is recognised by all&mdash;from taxpayers to the Tax Office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act is in desperate need of a comprehensive overhaul. It is nearly 3 500 pages long, cannot be easily read or understood, no longer has a recognisable structure and has had amendment piled on top of amendment over the last 60 years. The costs to business and individual taxpayers of trying to understand and comply with this law ranges from $3 billion to $6 billion annually. Any reduction in these compliance costs, therefore, will be a significant micro&hyphen;economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The defects of the 1936 Act have been known for some time. Indeed, in 1993 the Joint Committee of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1408"> Public Accounts in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 326</EMPHASIS> &mdash;a report on the administration of tax law and the operations of the Australian Tax Office&mdash;recommended that the tax law be simplified. That task is being undertaken by the Tax Law Improvement Project&mdash;known by all as TLIP. TLIP is rewriting the old Act in five legislative packages. The subject of this report, the Tax Law Improvement Bill, is the second package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Complaints about the faithfulness with which the Tax Law Improvement Bill reflects the old 1936 Act focused mainly on two divisions: Division 42 dealing with plant depreciation, and Division 70  dealing with trading stock. Accordingly, most of the Committee's recommended amendments to the Bill refer to clauses within these divisions. For the most part, the Bill itself has been well drafted and the complaints have been few.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The greatest debate during the inquiry has centred around what has not been included in the Bill rather than what has. Time after time the Committee has received evidence from people and organisations frustrated that TLIP's narrow policy mandate has precluded it from simplifying the policy complexities that underlay the 1936 Act. As a result, real simplification of the tax law is not being achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 326</EMPHASIS> , which provided the genesis for the rewrite project, the JCPA recommended that the 1936 Act be rewritten in order to simplify it. The Committee believes that the previous and current governments have chosen to interpret `simplification' in a narrow sense.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TLIP's role is to restructure, renumber and rewrite in plain language the income tax law. TLIP does not have a mandate to make anything but the most minor policy change. It is true, TLIP is able to make limited, small policy changes with the approval of the Assistant Treasurer. However, the changes have only been made where they have had no significant revenue impacts and where the changes help to clarify the operation of the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The critics are concerned that, by having this very limited mandate, TLIP is perpetuating unclear or unworkable sections of the 1936 Act in the Tax Law Improvement Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concedes that there is an immediate and pressing need to reduce the complexity of the 1936 Act. This reason alone is sufficient justification for the rewrite project. However, the Committee believes that TLIP needs an expanded mandate to give it greater latitude to contemplate `small p' policy issues. The Committee has recommended accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, TLIP would still have to refer any broader policy simplification recommendations back to Government for final approval. But, TLIP could at least consider a greater range of the policy simplification issues that are of such concern to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> private sector and which currently have to be excluded from the rewrite.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 345</EMPHASIS> , the Committee responded to the lack of progress on tax policy reform of any magnitude by recommending that a Revenue Committee of Parliament be established. Such a Committee would be concerned with tax policy simplification issues that are beyond TLIP's mandate to consider. Preferably, the JCPA should be given additional resources by the Government to undertake such a function. Failing that, the JCPA recommended that a joint standing or a joint select committee on revenue be established to undertake the task.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCPA believes that the arguments for a Revenue Committee of Parliament remain equally valid. For this reason, the Committee continues to press the Government for a response to the recommendation. In fact, the Committee believes that a Revenue Committee could complement TLIP's activities&mdash;if TLIP were given an expanded mandate&mdash;by coordinating and assisting the consideration of `small p' policy issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The adoption of these two major recommendations&hyphen; TLIP with an expanded mandate and the establishment of a Revenue Committee&hyphen; will facilitate the Government's pre&hyphen;election promise to allow greater private sector involvement in tax policy simplification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has also made a number of other policy recommendations which are beyond TLIP's current mandate to implement. Some of the recommendations are quite specific, others call for wider review. All are urgent. They include recommendations for review of the entertainment and non&hyphen;compulsory uniform provisions in the law. One witness rightly called these provisions `mind numbing in their exactitude' and they should have no place in progressive income tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such reviews will take time, with appropriate consultation to resolve. They should receive urgent attention by Government, but their resolution should not delay passage of the Tax Law Improvement Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I mentioned, the major professional and industry bodies, while supporting the rewrite process in principle, have expressed concern with the way it is being undertaken in practice. The Committee was concerned at the strength of the criticism by these organisations of aspects of TLIP's work. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that the Government allow greater private sector involvement in TLIP's decision making processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TLIP's senior management team includes two positions for private sector practitioners. The purpose of having these positions is to bring private sector experience and advice within TLIP. The positions play an important role, particularly as the Committee notes a perception held in parts of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1409"> private sector that TLIP tends to take a pro&hyphen;revenue stance when interpreting and rewriting ambiguous sections of the 1936 Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although both positions have been filled in the past, a vacancy has existed for one of the positions since December 1995. The Committee is concerned at the delay in refilling this position and believes that this needs to be done promptly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A stronger private sector presence in TLIP's senior management will help provide valuable private sector insights and perspectives and also reassure the private sector about TLIP's impartiality. This position would be most appropriately filled by a tax expert with a legal background.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that, even with both the above positions filled, there will still remain a need for greater private sector involvement in TLIP's senior management. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended additional funding be provided to allow TLIP to hire tax specialists on short term contracts as different parts of the 1936 Act are rewritten.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has been extensive consultation on draft versions of parts of the Tax Law Improvement Bill since July 1995. Nonetheless, critics have argued that TLIP has introduced changes into the Bill before Parliament that were not included in the final exposure draft version. There is argument over the significance of these late changes and whether there should have been more time to debate them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will always be a balance to strike between allowing as much consultation as possible and ensuring that the legislation is implemented. TLIP will need to strike an appropriate balance for the next tranche of legislation in particular, which rewrites the capital gains tax provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For its own part, the JCPA has not had time to review the Bill as comprehensively as it would have liked. The Committee will seek greater time to consider future tranches of legislation if they are referred to the Committee by the House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ultimately, the confidence of all parties in the consultative process is vital if support for the project is to be maintained. The Government will need to schedule sufficient time for parliamentary debate and review of the next tranche of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, Mr Speaker, the JCPA continues to support TLIP's work, providing that the Government supports the Committee's recommendations for improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Completion of TLIP's rewrite process is the most efficient way of simplifying the 1936 Act quickly, so that tax law can once again be understood by business and tax professionals. Just as importantly, the next generation of tax professionals will be able to start their training and careers with a clearer and more useable Act. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ultimately, however, tax simplification requires more than just a rewrite or a tidying up of policy complexities. It needs a wide ranging review of tax policy at the Federal and state level. Only after such a review can compliance costs truly come down. The Committee urges the Government to consider this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a final note, the Committee would like to thank all those individuals and organisations which have provided written and oral evidence and advice to the JCPA. Some have given evidence to the Committee three or four times. We also thank the various officials from TLIP and the Committee's consultant, Mr Michael Bannon of Duesburys.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a personal note, I would also like to thank my colleagues on the Committee who undertook the inquiry for the efforts they put in to it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madame President, the Committee believes that the efforts of all have generated a sensible and well informed debate. The result should be better legislation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an important report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. It relates to the consideration by the committee of the second set of bills in the rewrite of the taxation act. It is one of five stages of rewrite of the act which has been there since 1936 and which is universally recognised as required major change because it is highly complex, very anachronistic and very confusing in many ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tax law improvement project has been going on now for almost three years and it follows an initial recommendation in 1993 by the JCPA that such a rewrite should occur. The latest report, that Senator Watson has tabled, report No. 348, reaffirms several of the important principles that have been laid down by the JCPA in its earlier reports. In particular, it has reaffirmed the committee's support for the phased implementation of the rewrite law. There has been a lot of debate 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1410"> about this in the private sector and elsewhere as to whether to take a big bang approach.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are talking about report No. 348 entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An advisory report on the Tax Law Improvement Bill 1996</EMPHASIS> . There has been a lot of discussion both in and out of government on the question of whether there should be a so&hyphen;called big bang approach to a rewrite of the law&mdash;do it all in the one hit&mdash;or whether there could be a so&hyphen;called warehousing of progressive changes which would then be implemented together at the end or whether there ought to be a tandem approach whereby rewritten sections of the law could be used and considered at the same time as the existing bill with taxpayers being allowed to choose between the two. The committee gave this a lot of consideration but at the end of the day strongly reaffirmed its support for the phased implementation of the rewritten law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other couple of points I want to stress from the report is the strong view of the committee that there should be greater private sector representation in the rewrite process. There are two positions on the project team that are available to the private sector. One of those has been vacant since December 1995. There was a recommendation that that be filled quickly. There was also a recommendation that there should be additional funding for additional private sector involvement. I hope the government will take note of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other important point&mdash;I will conclude my remarks on this&mdash;is that the committee recommends that the mandate of the TLIB project be expanded so that the roadblocks to desirable change can be removed by allowing the project team to recommend policy changes subject to a series of actions to fully involve the government. The policy mandate position is a very important one. I draw the Senate's attention to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that Senator Kemp, who will be replying to the debate on the TLIB bills shortly in this chamber, is broadly sympathetic on behalf of the government to some of the issues that have been canvassed in the report and elsewhere over time. I hope very much

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The current runway length of Adelaide International Airport imposes payload constraints on departing wide bodied international aircraft.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Under existing arrangements more than half of the airfreight from South Australia is exported through other Australian airports.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Committee therefore concluded that there is a need to lengthen the runway to make full use of airfreight capacity (especially to Asian airports on existing flights), provide greater opportunities for direct export of South Australian products and enhance the development of international tourism to the State.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Expert advice to the Committee indicated that a runway length of 3,100 metres would be sufficient to accommodate full volumetric payloads on all types of aircraft in passenger configurations to all North Asian destinations, under the worst planning conditions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">That the Telecommunications National Code 1996, made under subsection 117(1) of the Telecommunications Act 1991, be disallowed.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Democrats have moved to disallow this code for two main reasons: firstly, because it has been a fundamentally flawed process; and, secondly, because of the inadequacy of the code to deliver any improvement on the previous code. Very few members of the public will realise that the new telecommunications code came into effect on 1 January this year. This is hardly surprising, given that the announcement was made the day before Christmas Eve. The code sets out procedures for installing and maintaining telecommunications facilities such as aerial cabling and mobile phone towers. The code was only 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tabled in parliament on 10 February, six weeks after it actually came into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, this new code offers little to those battling the overhead roll-out of telecommunications cables and the unfettered siting of mobile phone towers. It ignores years of complaints and protests in Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and New South Wales in particular. Those who are aware of the code and its content, notably local councils and the Australian Local Government Association and its state based affiliates, argue that it is no better than the last code and that in many respects it is much worse. In fact, they say that it is so bad that it should be disallowed. This is why we are doing this here today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very strong statement from organisations and people who have so much at stake. We share their concern, and we are now calling on the Senate to do two things: firstly, to disallow the code and, secondly, to ensure that the post-1997 telecommunications regulatory regime gives local communities more say in locating towers and protecting streetscapes and heritage values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I cover the specific reasons that make this code a worse outcome for residents, I would like to discuss the background of the code and the process by which it was produced. Senator Alston promised to introduce a new and tighter code by 1 July 1996&mdash;and this should not have been difficult. Austel had conducted a major review of the code and made 57 recommendations in December 1995; yet seven months elapsed before the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) eventually released a convoluted draft code for public comment, which largely ignored those recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Austel was then asked to conduct another inquiry on the draft and to report back by 9 August. The public was given only two weeks to provide comments in writing. By contrast, it is rumoured that the carriers were closely consulted in its development. I think it is interesting that the Austel report was never made public and that a final version of this code never appeared. In fact, only weeks after the review had been completed, the minister told me he had changed his mind. He said a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1413"> new code would be a waste of time and effort since he would ensure proper planning and processes superseding the code would be in place by 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was then revealed that cabinet was planning to  support the roll&hyphen;out of aerial cabling for a further three months beyond 1 July 1997 and the existing guidelines for erecting mobile phone towers until the end of 1997. So to appease angry backbenchers and disgruntled residents in their electorates, the minister returned to his promise to introduce a new telecommunications national code. This is the code we have before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The process by which this code was developed deserves some very close scrutiny and raises, I think, many questions. On 3 December, a second draft code was released, although it was not then actually available, and another public inquiry was announced. This was the third public inquiry in just 12 months. This time, however, the inquiry was conducted by the Department of Communications and the Arts rather than Austel, which, the Democrats would argue, removed any semblance of independence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public was given until 19 December to comment on the draft. These dates, as I will reveal, hold a great deal of significance. Unfortunately for the organisations and councils which struggled to meet the deadline and to lodge submissions, they wasted their efforts. The new code now in force is dated 20 December 1996, 4.00 p.m., just 21&half; hours after the close of submissions, yet the department was scheduled to report to the minister on the inquiry by 23 December, just four days after the closing of the inquiry. In actual fact, they reported on the 20th&mdash;the very day after submissions had closed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a copy of a letter concerning the code from Senator Alston to the member for Mitchell, Mr Alan Cadman, dated 3 February. There are three things that need to be said about this letter, two of which are quite serious. The first is trivial. The letter completely brushes over the fact that there are transitional provisions in the Telecommunications Bill which will mean that the new planning regime will not take effect from 1 July. That is nothing serious, as I have al 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ready said, but we have become accustomed to statements from the minister which are less than informative. That was a notable omission no doubt intended to keep a backbencher in the dark whilst appearing to be doing something.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the minister gives a completely different set of dates to the real ones, which I took from official documents. His letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The draft Code . . . was finalised on 5 December. The inquiry was held by my department between 5 December and 15 December. They reported to me on 23 December, and I immediately signed the appropriate documents to give effect to the new Code.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is a significant difference between the inquiry closing on the 15th and reporting on the 23rd to one that closed on the 19th with a code printed by 4.00 p.m. on the 20th.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through a freedom of information request by Mr Gavin Williamson of Cables Downunder in Sydney, we have been able to unearth information from the department of communications which brings to light even further inconsistencies. I will go through some of these. I have a minute from Ms Fay Holthuyzen of the department to the minister dated 20 December attaching a copy of the code which was adopted and asking for his signature by the 23rd, which is so signed. The minute states the inquiry was conducted between 5 December and 19 December&mdash;not the 15th, as the minister's letter declares&mdash;and, clearly, the final copy of the code was in existence and in the minister's possession on the 20th not on the 23rd. The obvious conclusion is that the minister is making deliberately misleading statements to his own backbench and to the public to cover&hyphen;up the fact that this inquiry was a complete farce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us proceed and consider when the submissions were received and read. The minute to the minister has some very interesting comments on these points. The ALGA submission was received by officers conducting the inquiry at 1.10 p.m. on 20 December&mdash;the day the finalised draft of the code marked 4.00 p.m. went to the minister. Ten other submissions arrived on the 20th, while 85 were received by 6.30 p.m. on the 19th. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1414"> Most of these, I expect, came in quite late. The minute says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">. . . the Department cannot guarantee that all issues in these submissions have been completely identified or fully addressed in this report.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Many submitters complained, some in strong terms, about the lack of time given to respond to the inquiry, which was widely regarded as inadequate, especially given the complexity of the document. A few submissions simply noted that because of the short time frame, they were not able to address the matters in the inquiry, or cited this as the reason for simply resubmitting their submissions to previous inquiries.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This should not be surprising. Copies were supposed to have been available on the web from 5 December. Yet I am informed that Manly Council downloaded on that day only to find that it was the old code. Gavin Williamson from Sydney Cables Downunder said he rang on the 5th to be told that the code was not available. He did not receive a copy until the 9th, while many others did not receive a copy until the 12th or 13th. Given that submissions had to be in Canberra by the 19th, they had to be posted by the 17th, which left many parties with only four or five days to study and comment on what was a very complex document. According to the departmental minute:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A number of submitters either object to or raise concern with the complexities of the revised draft Code. These submitters considered the revised draft Code to be overly legalistic and unnecessarily complex.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In conclusion, appendix C of the minute, which outlines comments contained in the submission, is dated 21 December&mdash;that is, a day after the final draft had been prepared. So much for public consultation! We have seen another example of this with the recent telecommunications bills inquiry where scope for genuine consultation has been squashed. My comments on this will be in the minority report, so I will not repeat them here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another point made in the minute is that several submissions, although it does not say which, expressed concern that Austel should not be the body which monitors carrier compliance visual amenity issues given its qualifications and resourcing. Austel, however, has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not been given the considerable resources it would need to undertake these and other new tasks. Predictably, the minister avoided answering my questions in parliament on this matter late last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did anything change from the draft to the final? The minute also revealed that the majority of amendments to the draft code as a consequence of the inquiry had little or no effect in addressing the issues raised in the 96 submissions. The majority of the amendments to the code are cosmetic or they needed to patch up appalling drafting in the first place. In fact, I challenge the minister to give details of any amendments made to the code as a result of these submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the key amendments actually made things worse. For example, firstly, `maintenance' was amended to include `the installation of an additional facility' at Telstra's request. Surely maintenance is meant to cover repair or replacement of parts, not for additional installations. Secondly, the definition of a `major road intersection' at which undergrounding is to be mandatory was cunningly redefined out of existence. This was done by specifying that it is an intersection where there are three or more aerial cables strung in layers. Given that there are only two carriers stringing cables, it would be rare to find an intersection which qualified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, an impossible time frame of 15 days was imposed for a council to obtain written agreement from all occupier&hyphen;owners to pay for undergrounding, otherwise carriers could go overhead. But it is ludicrous to expect a council to be able to obtain within 15 business days, say, in an average suburban street of 80 homes, the written consent of all parties to agree to pay incremental costs. What happens if one party&mdash;only one&mdash;is sick, or in hospital, or on holidays or for other reasons away? The very proposal is simply preposterous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I challenge the minister to explain how the Attorney-General's Department could have received advice from the department of communications after 6.45 p.m. on the 19th and possibly managed to redraft all of the amendments by the 20th. Let me return to the final point I want to make concerning the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1415"> minister's letter to the member for Mitchell. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I sought and obtained undertakings from the two carriers that they would comply with the new measures I had announced as if they were already in force.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have copies of the letters from Telstra and Optus to the minister dated 9 December and 12 December respectively providing confirmation that they would immediately comply with the new draft code. The sheer and utter hypocrisy of this cannot be overstated. The minister had agreement from the two carriers that they would comply with the draft code at a time when most people who had requested copies were just beginning to receive them. The inquiry had effectively closed before it had begun. It is not surprising therefore that no significant changes were made, other than those recommended by the carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government had sought to legitimise the weakness of its measures by playing on fears of legal reprisal by the carriers. It claimed that carriers are operating under assurances that existing legislation and guidelines, guaranteeing carriers certain immunity from state and territory environment and planning laws, would operate until 1 July. Current revelations suggest otherwise, and I will leave it to the minister to prove otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new code may have conned backbenchers, Minister, but it is no substitute for proper planning processes which would give the right to insist on the undergrounding of cables, infrastructure sharing and keeping phone towers away from kindergartens. The `greater protection for residents' has turned out to include little more than grey rather than black cables and mandatory undergrounding at major intersections. I do not know of one community or environment group that proposed grey cabling as a key solution to aerial cabling. I can only assume that it was a solution offered by the carriers because it costs no more. Even if the code is disallowed, they can of course do it in any case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned before, mandatory undergrounding at major intersections will occur only if it is in the interest of the carriers. Major intersections are not properly defined 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the carriers are likely to respond to this requirement only if, for instance, heavy traffic would cause cables too much damage. The underground cable rollout is provided for, but only if impossible procedures are followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of erecting mobile phone towers, the code supposedly empowers councils to suggest two alternative sites. However, there is nothing to prevent councils from nominating any number of sites under the old code, and this is something they do routinely. The suggestion was made but more often ignored, however, by the carriers. This is the problem with the new code; it does nothing about that. It simply says that they can nominate two alternative sites, and it continues to leave the final decision to the carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the frustrations expressed by the ALGA was the fact that carriers can claim commercial in confidence in relation to the siting of their network of towers. Carriers do not have to justify their choice of sites and they can all too readily argue technical or economic reasons for doing this. Cables less than an arbitrary 13 millimetres in diameter continue to be exempted from planning processes, which means there is nothing preventing carriers stringing up bundles of cables, as long as each is less than 13 millimetres in diameter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This code largely ignores the health impacts of telecommunications facilities. For example, an existing tower next to a school or a child-care centre can have extra banks of aerials without any concern for public health. The ALGA have pointed out further concerns. They say that it reduces the power of the environment secretary; it fails to provide adequate protection for sites of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander significance and for local heritage sites; it pushes the cost of undergrounding on to councils and residents, but at a price determined by the carriers; and it perpetuates a system under which the carriers are their own judge and jury, with very little effective scrutiny of their actions and they can ignore community views almost at will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the new code possibly includes some minor improvements to the previous codes, these improvements are largely of a cosmetic 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1416"> nature when compared with the problems I have already highlighted. Moreover, the code allows the government to take a further step away from responsibility for the substantial urban and environmental blight already created throughout Australia by cables and towers. The rejection of this code by the Senate will force national attention on the inadequacies of the policy framework in this area. The considerable damage already done to the urban environment can be corrected only by a carefully considered and strategic approach to reversing the policy framework which was implemented with major party consensus against the strong protestations of the Democrats in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is essential that this code be disallowed not just because the outcomes are, on balance, worse for residents but also because the government and the carriers will use it as a smokescreen for further inaction. The Australian community has been treated with contempt by the minister, who staged a mock inquiry and installed a code which is in fact a sham. I fear it will now be used to legitimise the transitional provisions proposed for inclusion in the post-1997 regulatory regime. The carriers will say that they have given ground but that the new code imposes sterner requirements for consultation and hence they need or deserve a time extension beyond 1 July as a compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will say that the transitional provisions are warranted because, after all, they have introduced a new and improved code. But the code itself is a farce. The process under which it was developed is a farce and it should be disallowed. As of 1 July this year, a proper system should be put in its place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the opposition, I indicate that we will not support the disallowance of the Telecommunications National Code 1996 made under subsection 117(1) of the Telecommunications Act 1991. I think in many ways Senator Allison has identified some of the deficiencies in the present code. She has certainly quite correctly identified the deficiencies in process of how the code was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> constructed. I think she has done that in detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not disagree that much of her criticism is effective&mdash;and we agree with it. However, if we disallow this code with all its deficiencies, from the opposition's point of view we will go back to a code that is even more deficient. I do not believe that having a pyrrhic victory of knocking off this code to go back to a worse code to make a political point at this moment is the correct way to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a process in this parliament at the moment when, either today or when we return in a week and a half, we will be debating the whole telecommunications package of bills on the regulatory regime to take place in Australia post 1 July 1997. In dealing with that legislation, all members of the Senate will have the opportunity to move amendments where they believe planning arrangements are deficient.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that it is much better to overcome those deficiencies by having that debate and amending the legislation. That is why the opposition in its minority report, which was tabled yesterday&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="MARGETTS" NAMEID="DX5">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator Margetts</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Margetts, if you can just let me explain. In the area of immunities in particular, which is what Senator Allison's basic proposition is about the code&mdash;how the immunities operate and have been operating effectively in Australia since 1901 for telecommunications&mdash;I believe the issue she has raised should be dealt with in the legislation. In our minority report we have suggested amendments that I believe will much more effectively deal with the issues that Senator Allison has so quite correctly raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, the issue that has set the local government organisations and communities right across Australia into various forms of outrage, disappointment and disagreement is the program of overhead cabling and now the growing concern about the siting of mobile telephone towers. The present system, which is based on a 90-year history of immunities, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1417"> clearly does not give the local community an effective say in opposing that infrastructure being built.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that what we propose is the best way to proceed. Local government should be able to disagree and have the power to stop that significant infrastructure, such as cabling and towers, proceeding willy-nilly by the carrier. What we are proposing is a simple appeals mechanism; if the council and the carrier disagree, there is a straight appeal to the ACA to determine whether that facility should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You cannot let councils have an absolute blackball and an absolute opposition to building any telecommunications facility because, if you do, this parliament will never be able to carry out its responsibility, as it should, to construct a national telecommunications system to which all Australians have equity of access. Therefore, you have to balance the quite strong local concerns about siting of facilities, as Senator Allison has so eloquently described in many ways, with the national interest. By having an appeal process that we strongly support, you can get the balance right as far as you can.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In our amendments we say, as from 1 July, no more overhead cables unless local government agrees. I think that is going to be supported by everybody. The government wants to allow a further three months for further cabling to be completed. We disagree with that. Local communities have been under the very strong impression for about 18 months now that 1 July was the cut&hyphen;off date. We will stick to that when we debate that. That is a very important issue to be dealt with in the legislation, which is beyond what you can do within the code. Parliament will make that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next issue is mobile towers. In the legislation, the minister has proposed that low impact facilities continue to have the general immunities that have been in the legislation since Federation in effect for telecommunications. The minister has proposed that Austel conduct an inquiry&mdash;what will become the ACA, I suppose&mdash;into what constitutes a low impact facility.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In most cases, I do not think there would be any argument even with local government about what those low impact facilities would be&mdash;what are ubiquitously described as pit and cable work, and ducting work that has been going on through the streets of Australia for a long time. It also wants to exempt what is already there&mdash;what has been built and so on&mdash;and I do not think anyone can argue that. No-one can argue about the need for proper access for maintenance of those low impact facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the opposition believes should be taken out of that inquiry and determined by parliament is telecommunications towers, whether they are for a mobile telephone system, microwave or whatever. Those sorts of facilities now declared as low impact ought to be taken out of that review and should be considered as a general facility, appealable by the local community to the ACA if they disagree with the carrier's intent. I believe that will take a lot of the sting out of the argument that communities have because they feel they are being dudded in the process of consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not disagree that the way the carriers have carried on over the last few years has made this debate much more robust than has been necessary. The engineers and the carriers, whether associated with Optus, Telstra or even Vodafone, have continued to conduct themselves as though they are a monopoly with no responsibility to the local community. They have done themselves enormous damage in the local community. For that, they ought to be strongly criticised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen repeatedly the consultation process going on for some weeks, some months with the local community over the siting of a tower. But at the end, with usually only a very minor modification, the carrier says, `Well, we're going to build it there anyway.' That has created considerable disquiet, considerable anger in the local community. Therefore, it is only reasonable that now the towers should in no way be given the chance to be declared a low impact facility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In considering the amendments moved by the opposition&mdash;and I think they are similar 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1418"> to the recommendations made by the Democrats in the minority report&mdash;it now ought to be declared that in no way will a tower end up being categorised as a low impact facility by the Austel review. Do not take the chance. If you do, it will come back to us for argument as a disallowable instrument. I do not think we ought to take that chance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Overall, the amendments moved by the Opposition and some of the amendments moved by the Democrats in this legislation package, I think, offer a very good balance between the needs of a national telecommunications system and the rights of the local community. For the first time the local communities will be given a right of appeal over the carrier. That has never happened before in 96 years of federation and in the history of telecommunications. It has been a long time coming. The carriers, in my view, have basically brought this on themselves in the way in which they have proceeded in recent years with the roll&hyphen;out of cable, with the building of mobile towers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But remember, the reason that mobile towers are going up is because millions of Australians are becoming subscribers to mobile telephone systems. I suppose one of the highest incidences of mobile telephone use would occur amongst the staff and the members and senators of this place. When using our mobile phone, we all like to get a good reception; we become frustrated if it drops away. The telecommunications companies will tell you that, to make mobile phones work effectively, you need more towers to cover their range.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of people in our community, millions of people, want to have access to a decent mobile telephone system&mdash;and that requires towers. In my view, the carriers have not acted sensibly either in having joint towers, common towers, or in the way they have thought about where the towers should be placed. As I have said before, they have acted like the old carriers who had a monopoly situation and complete immunity from the local community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> But I repeat: we should remember that there is a demand for these services that has to be met from a national telecommunications 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> system. I hope that the debate over towers can be a rational one. I think there is a lot of evidence around that cannot be ignored, no matter how you try to look at it. There is now evidence emerging causing us to ask: what are the minimum levels of electromagnetic radiation that should be allowed to emanate from towers?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am referring to someone, Minister, of whom I think your description at one stage was `shameless charlatan'. Another phrase I think was `snake oil merchant'. Those descriptions do not refer to credentials; they refer to the person himself. I think it was unfortunate, and I criticised you for it in the parliament yesterday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community finds the issue of towers very difficult. The debate as to where they are sited will get more intense, not less. Whether it involves Mr Cherry or 20 other people, there will be an argument about it. I met Mr Cherry yesterday, and I thought he raised a number of issues that could not be ignored. He may not be right. But in putting his case, he does raise issues that cannot be ignored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the Senate: the opposition does not want to disallow these regulations on the national code. We believe, firstly, that it would go back to a worse code. Though this one might not be much of an improvement, it is still some improvement. I agree with Senator Allison that the process of the code's construction was deficient. I think that any future code in any area of telecommunications under the new legislation will have to be more transparent, with more care being taken about 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1419"> the way the community gets access in the consultative process so that the codes are seen as transparent and supportable by the community. It is no use having a code adopted by the parliament which large sections of the community are aggravated about or believe will not work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also believe that most of the issues raised quite rightly by Senator Allison will be better dealt with when debating the telecommunications package of legislation in the committee stage in nearly two weeks time. In those areas I believe that the amendments moved by the opposition will overcome a lot of the community's concern that has been let loose by cables and the siting of towers. They are the two areas that the community quite rightly is concerned about. We believe that the opposition is putting up legislative amendments that deal with those issues, and I hope a majority of the Senate can deal with them in a positive way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said yesterday with the tabling of the committee's report, the opposition is willing to talk to all parties in the Senate, and to the government in particular, to try to reach common ground on these amendments as to how the process will operate for the benefit of all. Therefore, with reluctance, I say to the Democrats that they have made some very good points, but we believe that it would only be an Pyrrhic victory to knock off this code at the moment, when the processing of the legislation is the much more important place to take action.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am disappointed that this motion of disallowance of the Telecommunications National Code 1996 has been moved. I listened very carefully to what Senator Allison said and throughout most of the 20 minutes of her speech she seemed to get completely lost in the minutiae of a process of consultation. What Senator Allison really needs to focus on is what the actual effect of this disallowance will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Originally under the act we had a code brought in that was completely inadequate. I remember the Democrats criticising that code. That was brought in by the Labor Party originally. It absolutely amazes me that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Allison now wants to disallow this new code, because the effect of that would be to go back to the old code that everyone agrees is totally inadequate. Senator Allison should look at the timing of what she is proposing. It is now March. At the end of June or the start of July a totally new regime will come in. Having had a totally inadequate code originally, we now have an improved code. You want to go back to the old code that everyone says is no good&mdash;including yourself&mdash;then it all starts again on 1 July. Procedurally that is a crazy way to go about things. I agree with Senator Schacht that the better way to proceed is to have a look at the legislation that is coming in and try to negotiate changes to that, because the real world is what happens after 1 July 1997.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What Senator Allison will do with this proposed disallowance motion is create disadvantage to a whole range of groups and I am very disappointed that she has moved it. I am disappointed for this Senate which must now spend time discussing the merits of a code that will become obsolete on 1 July anyway with the passage of the new legislation. I am disappointed for the councils and communities. Senator Allison spent a lot of time talking about those people when she was talking about the consultation process, but what she has to realise is that during a very crucial period&mdash;this lead&hyphen;up to 1 July&mdash;if her disallowance worked those people would lose very important rights, because, if we go back to the old code, it takes away some of the benefits of the new code. Certainly the ALGA does not agree with what Senator Allison is doing at the moment. They want us to proceed at this point.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who have you been talking to?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They do not want to disallow it and go back to the old code. Why on earth would they want to do that? I am disappointed also for industry and for the authorities with which they have to interact, because, if the 1996 code is disallowed, there will be very widespread regulatory confusion and uncertainty at a time when we are moving up to a new communications regime. Apart from the smaller parties in this place, it seems 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1420"> as though no-one wants this. Certainly the opposition, the Labor Party and the government do not want it and it is the last thing we need as we move into this new era.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me explain why a code such as the one we are now debating exists. The carriers are exempt from certain state and territory laws so that they are able to plan, build and operate viable end&hyphen;to&hyphen;end networks. This is very much in the national interest, as it is with other sorts of infrastructure in the country. They are bound to comply with the code in lieu of these laws. I must stress that the exemptions pertain only to some state and territory laws, such as ones relating to environment and planning matters, and not to all state and territory laws. Those exemptions relate to specific activities, such as developing the network infrastructures, communication towers, excavations and controlling cables and structures that contain equipment. These exemptions do not extend to all of the carriers' activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the point in this debate which has been forced on the Senate over the processes and arguments for and against various codes? The most important point to make is that there is no point in disallowing the 1996 code. Both the 1996 code and the old code it replaces under the Telecommunications Act will change on 1 July. There is nothing to be gained by anyone in the proposals from the Democrats today; not for the carriers, the councils, the communities and certainly not for the government in disallowing this code four months before the whole thing will be consigned to history anyway and the whole debate will have become a waste of time. In the meantime, all you will have done is create an enormous amount of confusion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to support the point made by Senator Schacht that, instead of wasting time on this debate today, we should be focusing on the telecommunications package bill. The report came down yesterday. We are about to debate this bill in full and the real positive contribution that the Democrats could make is in debating amendments to this bill so that we do come up with the best possible information superstructure to put Australia in the lead with the new technological developments that are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coming to this country. I urge the Senate to reject this irresponsible motion of disallowance.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How many times during the Telstra debate were we told, `Don't worry about all your community and public interest concerns. Don't worry, because they will be dealt with in the code.' When the first 1996 telecommunications code amendments come up and when the community speaks, we are told, `Don't worry. Wait for the legislation.' It seems that they are going to run out of `don't worries' and that they are setting a precedent so that when we speak up and the community speaks up, they can put it off to some other time. They can set precedents in meantime and say, `Look, you people supported the previous code, so how come you are not supporting this code?' What is it going to mean for the standards that people are expecting governments to maintain?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it important to disallow the 1996 telecommunications code? It is important because we need to send a clear message to the government that the parliament will not tolerate disregarding community views and failure to follow proper processes. We will not tolerate the promoting of private interests at the expense of good planning and environmental protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was disappointed to hear Senator Schacht emphasise that general immunities have existed since federation. This does not cut any ice once you get into the privatisation era. The general immunities were a different kettle of fish. They were about immunities that existed for a government carrier which had responsibility to the government, and the government had responsibility to the parliament. The community had input via the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wake up everybody. This does not exist anymore. We have had that debate. We have talked about the Gambotto case. The minority shareholders of these privatised institutions have the right to make a profit and to maximise their profit. Wake up. The world is not the same now as it was at federation. It has changed. Both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party have overseen this change. You cannot 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1421"> pretend that the changes have not happened and pretend that the changes people are seeing&mdash;and are frightened of&mdash;in their own communities are not happening, because they are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will give an example of how this has worked. There was a telecommunications national road show. Members of my office contacted the federal Canberra office of the Department of Communications and the Arts to ask whether or not people would be able to go to this road show. That is, the kinds of people who actually fronted up at the Telstra inquiry and expressed legitimate concerns about the ongoing code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Guess what? Those people were not invited at the beginning. It was by invitation only. Only when a number of people contacted them and expressed concerns about an invitation only road show was that opened out. If that is not the case, how come people were not told about it? The reality is that people may have found out about it. When they contacted departments, they said, `Oh, yes, it's now open.' Nobody was officially told about it. It was not advertised&mdash;as far as I know, and I might be corrected&mdash;to say that people were welcome to come. If people did find out, it was very late in the show.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not the way to go about it, and it is very symbolic of the whole way this has gone through. As I say, it was a member of my staff who contacted the Canberra office to say, `Look, people want to go.' We were told that it was invitation only. Only later on they say, `Oh, no, it's open.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is this code unacceptable? It was rushed through with a minimal public inquiry, finalised less than 24 hours after submissions closed and introduced without adequate public information during the Christmas-New Year holidays. It fails to deliver, in any meaningful way, on the promises made by the minister in his statement of 3 December. Remember? `Don't worry. This will be in the code. Don't worry. If the code is inadequate, we will try to stop you from doing anything about it, because we will say that there is something else coming up and there is really no point in saying it.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This code means that communities will have more ugly overhead cables and more mobile phone towers without the proper planning and community consultation. It seems to me that this is yet another example of where corporate interest steamrolls public interest. That is an assumption which, unfortunately, was echoed by Senator Schacht. Because he likes a nice clear line on his mobile telephone, the public cannot be trusted to know what their best interests are. They cannot be trusted to work out whether or not a clear line&mdash;which, by the way, is not guaranteed by more mobile phone towers&mdash;on their mobile phone is more important than their health or their amenity or their local environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think you can trust the community to make some decisions about public interest or have some input into public interest. Funnily enough, that is why it is called public interest. If we are giving over the decision making roles of the government to monopolies or oligopolies, there will be little government control and that is quite a different kettle of fish. We are saying to the community, `No, your opinions are less important than the ability of the corporations to make the maximum profit,' which is what it is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The code also perpetuates a system under which the carriers are their own judge and jury. There is very little effective scrutiny of their actions, and they can ignore community views almost at will. It exempts overhead cables of less than 13 millimetres in diameter, and lead&hyphen;ins to individual subscribers, from the consultation process altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The code specifically prevents community consultation on a range of so-called low impact activities&mdash;who defines that?&mdash;including, for example, 30&hyphen;metre high mobile phone towers with two or three sets of aerials next to schools. Whose decision is that? It largely ignores potential health impacts of telecommunications facilities. We have seen how important the government thinks that is. We saw that yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The code allows indiscriminate and uncontrolled lopping of vegetation. The new code reduces the powers of the environment secretary compared with the old code. It fails to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1422"> provide adequate protection for sites of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander significance and for local heritage sites. It pushes the cost of undergrounding onto councils and residents, but at a price determined by the carriers. Senator Tierney suggests that the Local Government Association is supporting his viewpoint, but those points came from the Local Government Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Therefore, it is important that at every point along this process, if what we are given is inadequate and if what we are given is a clear reneging on what was said would happen&mdash;which I believe it is: read back to the debate on Telstra&mdash;then it is up to us to say, `It's not good enough. Go back to the drawing board and come back with something that is acceptable. Come back with something that has the real public interest at heart.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1M6">Senator ALLISON</NAME><STATE> (Victoria)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.51 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a couple of comments to round off. I want to run through the so-called 21-point plan of improvements that the government say this code is all about and show them up for the sham that they are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point is: grey cables rather than black. The community is saying to me, `So what?' We do not know of anyone who has actually praised the government for this. So this is revenue neutral. Obviously, it can go ahead in any case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is: subscriber drops undergrounded where subscribers agree to pay the cost. This is possibly a minor improvement but, as I indicated earlier, it pushes the cost of undergrounding onto residents at a price determined by the carriers. It is an impossible process in any case to bring about. I suppose you could argue that, if the residents were willing to pay for this, they could do it in any case&mdash;code or no code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third point is: cables undergrounded at major intersections. We know this will not occur because major road intersections are defined as intersections where there are three or more aerial Telecom cables but, as we know, there are only two carriers doing roll&hyphen;out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth point is: visual amenity impact with Austel auditing the roll&hyphen;out. Austel has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> almost no resources outside the city of Melbourne where its headquarters are located, as I understand it. The code imposes a whole range of new obligations on Austel but no provision has been given to Austel to undertake those activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifth point is: 3.5 metres minimum height. This is well below recommended standards. Austroads pointed out that a 5.3 metre clearance was required in New South Wales. Mosman council pointed out that AS3000 recommends 5.5 metre minimum height on the centre line of the road and 4.9 metres minimum on the kerb line. The only reason for such low height is to accommodate a second carrier stringing under another cable which, in our view, is already low slung. In fact if the 3.5 metres is measured at the pole and in the centre of a long span the cable could be closer to 3 metres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sixth point is: individual streets undergrounded where residents request and agree to pay. As I mentioned earlier, these are impossible time frames. It will be very rare for this to be able to be done by residents in a particular street. As I have said already, it pushes the cost of undergrounding onto councils and residents but at a price determined by the carriers themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seventh point is: carriers to use best practice to minimise degradation of environmental amenity and visual appeal. It is hardly likely to mean anything unless it is clearly defined, mandated and penalties are imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The eighth point is: carriers may nominate two alternative sites for mobile phone towers. Carriers must provide comments on councils' alternatives. This is a nonsense since councils can do this anyway, and of course they have. They can nominate as many as they want. The problem is that the carriers, by and large, ignore those council recommendations. The new code does nothing to improve that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ninth point is: $10 million fine for breach of code. This is good, but the code still does not protect residents. Moreover, Austel, who is to monitor and audit that roll&hyphen;out, has not been provided with the resources, as I have said.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1423">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tenth point is: Austel to have the power to audit the carriers for compliance with the code. They have the power but, as I have already said, they do not have the resources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The eleventh point is: carriers must comply with restrictions on times of day when activities can be carried out. This does nothing about the environmental, health and visual impact of the roll&hyphen;out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The twelfth point is: no aerial cabling in areas where there are none. This is possibly the only genuine safeguard in this whole package. It may provide some hope for residents in new suburbs. But note this is where it is cheapest to do so anyway and the carriers would be foolish to do otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The thirteenth point is: cables must go underground when all other cables do, unless council agrees otherwise. This will not occur within the life of the code, so it is entirely irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourteenth point is: public must be notified of all high and medium impact proposals in heritage, residential and commercial areas. Notification is next to useless if it does not change the outcomes and it is the outcomes I think which are of concern to people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fifteenth point is: if requested by the council, carriers must consult with community at a public meeting for high impact facilities. Again, this is only of value to enable residents to vent their already well-known disgust and anger, but it does not alter the outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sixteenth point is: information on facilities must be provided to councils. Again, information without outcomes is useless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The seventeenth point is: collocation of mobile phone antennas required, unless not technically feasible, with Austel to arbitrate disputes between the carriers. This requirement is not contained in the code, but it is to be executed as a licence condition, so it is not relevant to this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The eighteenth point is: if a council has telecommunications facilities planning guidelines, carriers must refer to them. Referring to them is one thing but abiding by them is a completely different matter.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The nineteenth point is: carriers must modify their proposals to accord with recommendations made by DEST and AHC. Yes, but once again, the power of the environment secretary is reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The twentieth point is: Austel able to direct carriers to comply with procedural requirements of the code. But, as I have already said, Austel has not been given the resources to enable it to insist on those powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The twenty-first point is: consultation time frames similar to those in the existing code. This is an open admission that they are no different or any better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats would like to say at this point that we are disappointed that the opposition is not going to support this disallowance motion. I think Senator Margetts makes some very important points about the reassurances inherent in this code&mdash;that is, `Don't worry we'll fix it later.' It keeps on being, `Don't worry. Something else will bob up which will satisfy your concerns.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting Senator Tierney says that we should focus on the issue. I look forward to seeing how he and the rest of the government will vote when it comes to our amendments to the legislation. It is quite interesting, too, I note that a couple of months ago Senator Tierney went along to a public meeting in his electorate and complained about the fact that the government was unable to do anything about cables and towers in that area. He faced a very angry community meeting but washed his hands of it and said, `No, there is nothing we can do. We are only in government. We are still having to deal with this problem from the previous government.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Tierney also referred to the ALGA and seemed to suggest that councils were opposed to this move of ours. I am happy to run through the list of complaints that the ALGA made. I am sure the ALGA made representation to government, the opposition, ourselves, the Independents and the Greens. I will not do that because I think it was a pretty feeble argument and not backed up by any substance whatever.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1424">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel compelled to speak about this today&mdash;and I apologise to the government for not having spoken about this earlier&mdash;because it was only yesterday, just before I was due to come into the chamber, that I was alerted to the fact that in the short Senate Procedure Committee report, the first report of 1997, there are two issues that are to be changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of them deals with petitions which are not in conformity with the normal format. They are not to be dealt with in the main part of the day. I have no real problems with dealing with those in a different way. But I do have a problem with losing that short part of each day which allows for the Clerk to make an announcement of the petitions lodged, indicating in respect of each petition the senator who presented it, the number of signatures and the subject matter of the petition. It is proposed that those details will not be read out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some people will say: `For the non&hyphen;broadcasting days, that does not make any difference.' I say that ignores the reason for which petitions are written. Often it takes a great deal of effort for people to collect signatures in this way. A petition is an awareness mechanism. It is one of the few means by which the community can have a direct voice, small as it is, in the parliamentary process. The most important thing is not necessarily that a petition is read out, though I believe that should continue to happen as it does not take up a large part of the day; it is that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1425"> message in a petition is to us, the elected representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for petitions to the House of Representatives, what they do with them is up to them. But the ones sent to the Senate constitute a message from the community to the Senate. I wonder, in reality, how many honourable senators pick up the list of regulations, after it has been tabled each day, and read it and have an idea of what is in it. I would say very few. I think this is what will happen if we have a tabled list of petitions. That voice, small as it is, will be stifled. I do not think that is good enough. Petitions constitute an aide&hyphen;memoire for us of the issues that are important to the community. With petitions, we know what the issues are. We know how many people are supporting a petition. If the same issue comes up day after day in large numbers, it is important&mdash;not just that it happens and not just that it gets written down somewhere&mdash;that we know, because we are the people to whom those people are sending the message.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think this change is good enough. I do not think it is just a matter of time management. I think we are taking away that very small voice in the community, and therefore I wish to amend the motion. I hope my revised version of the motion is now in the hands of honourable senators. If not, I will read it out. It is not very long.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Senator Margetts's amendment. I agree with her that it is very important, because petitions represent the one area where Australians on the street can actually have a voice in this chamber. They put their signature to a petition and at least the subject of that petition and the number of people who have signed it are read out by the Clerk some time during the day. The reading out of the number of signatures and of what is in the petition does not take very long. It is less than five minutes a day. For the time that we would be saving by not reading that out, we would be losing something important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am a member of the Procedure Committee, but I regret to say that I was not at the meeting where this issue was discussed. I am sorry that I have only just caught up with it. This is something that we should think about again. I am not too fussed about petitions not being in conformity; I would rather that they were in conformity. However, as Senator Margetts has said, spending something like two to five minutes a day to announce what petitions have been lodged and how many people have signed those petitions is a very important part of this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the years that I have been involved in the parliament&mdash;which is nearly 20&mdash;it has been cut down and cut down to this point. I think this is the point at which we should stop cutting it down. This is the point at which we should maintain a two&hyphen; to five&hyphen;minute announcement per day to let everybody listening in the chamber and those listening on radio know what issues people feel so strongly about that they are prepared to sign a petition and send it into parliament. I will be supporting Senator Margetts's amendment to this motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I totally agree with the two previous 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1426"> speakers. Senator Margetts is to be commended for bringing forward this amendment. I am greatly  troubled by the fact that hundreds of thousands of Australians sign petitions to the Senate each year and, in the main, the Senate totally ignores them. The best that happens at the moment is that petitions are read out detailing the number of people who signed them and the senator who brought them in. They then go onto the record. But the reality is that most people who sign petitions do not know how little notice we as senators take of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Petitions rate so lowly in the business of the Senate and in the thinking of people who are distracted by the issues we are dealing with every day. In some way or other, I think we have to be honest with the populace and say that petitions are not a good way of lobbying parliament. An enormous amount of effort goes into signing petitions, some of them with tens of thousands of signatures. Yet at the end of the day they have little above zero impact on the thinking of we senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Petitions are read out at the beginning of each day, but let us all be honest: we are not listening much of the time because we are distracted by the business of the Senate. I tell community groups to put their energy into other modes of lobbying their parliamentarians&mdash;directly in the electorates and through other methods of public debate. I think there is a very strong feeling in the community that, if people petition parliament, it is really going to have an impact. That is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Petitions have been a part of parliamentary procedure since the Magna Carta. They are an institution. However, as both Senator Margetts and Senator Bourne have indicated, they have been reduced to a thread of their former power simply by the passage of time. I think it behoves all of us to tell people who are campaigning to have their point of view registered with us that there are other more powerful ways of doing it. The very least we could do is acknowledge that 60 people in Echuca or 600,000 people in Queensland or, with the Franklin campaign, 30,000 people in Tasmania have signed petitions to the parlia 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment because they have felt strongly about an issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a responsibility on the Senate and on senators to let the public know just how little petitions weigh. It is a very sad factor in life, but it is a reality and we should not duck that. The least we should do is acknowledge that those petitions have been brought to the Senate and that there are people who want their point of view heard. If citizens have gone to the trouble of signing petitions, we should acknowledge them. I very strongly support Senator Margetts's amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not disagree with virtually anything that Senator Brown has said. When I was in opposition, I was responsible for some huge petitions coming into this place. Honourable senators who were here at the time would recall what I did in relation to the former Ambassador to Ireland, Mr Brian Burke. Many Western Australians signed petitions on that matter. There was the petition that Senator John Herron circulated in relation to the Carmen Lawrence <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cleo </EMPHASIS> sex guide. There was a big public campaign out there and petitions were part of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am reminded of what Senator Brown said in relation to the fact that, when the clerk reads the short version of the petition, we do not tend to listen. We are usually preoccupied with what is going to happen with formal motions or when a certain order of business is going to come on, and we do not pay it much recognition. It is a shame that Senator Bourne was not at the meeting of the Procedure Committee. I was informed by the whips that the Democrats had agreed to this motion being made formal and that they would support it. But I fully recognise that they have the right to focus on issues and change their mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Procedure Committee has come to the conclusion that all that is added by the current procedure is the clerk standing up and reading the short title for two, three or four minutes a day. This motion changes only that. Senator Brown has admitted that that does not give a lot of weight to the petition. I am reminded of former Senator Fred Chaney's views on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1427"> this matter: that is, the forms, the standing orders and the powers of the Senate are very strong. The Senate has enormous powers as a political institution. It is one of the most powerful upper houses on the globe. It is incumbent upon individual senators to use all of the processes of the Senate to assist their constituents, the people and democracy. When it comes to petitions, they can be used effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think you have asked senators to ensure that petitions are more important in the Senate food chain. They are already forwarded to Senate legislation committees for their consideration. It is quite possible for a Senate legislation committee to have a petition from 30,000 petitioners in Western Australia or Tasmania or somewhere else on an issue. In fact, Senator Brown, I remember when I first attended a committee and petitions turned up, and I asked the chairman or clerk of the committee, `What do we do now?' He said, `Oh, I think we just table them, or note that we have received them.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It reinforces your argument. It would have been incumbent upon me, if I had thought that was an important issue, to say, `I think this is a very important issue and this committee should do more than that; it should look into this matter, or have an inquiry into the matter, or take it further.' It should be part of the political process, and it can be. This motion does not interact on this process.

I always do that to petitioners so they know that it has been received. None of that will change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree with Senator Bob Brown on everything except on how I am going to vote on this motion and that is, that petitions can be used as a part of the democratic process&mdash;it is important that they are&mdash;but it is not really helped by the clerk standing up every morning and saying, `These are the petitions today'. It is all going to be in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>; it is all going to be recorded. It is all going to go to a legislation committee, then it is up to the senators to say that petitions should be an important part. When it comes to that, Senator Brown, I am on your side.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak a little less briefly than Senator Cook in relation to the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1997. The government is selling this bill as a simplification of the Income Tax Act. It is more than this. It is also a bill which formalises many of the exemptions given to the Australian mining industry and extends those exemptions to even more activities associated with mining. Currently, exemptions are given for activities such as exploration, prospecting and feasibility studies into economic viability of a proposed mine on a discretionary basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will `bring the law into line with established practice'. The bill will also extend existing deductions for site rehabilitation to include dams and levees. This is something to which we object strongly. The mining sector already gets massive subsidies from the public purse, both directly and through favourable tax treatment, the $900 million diesel fuel rebate being a notable example.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Through this tax bill, the government, with the support of the opposition, is allowing the mining sector to write off even more of its costs. The cost of rehabilitating mine sites is something which mining companies should have to wear. Why should the public purse fund mining companies to repair land which has been damaged by their profit making activities? Surely the mining companies make enough money so that they can  fund the cost of rehabilitation unassisted, or is this another example of `privatise the gains, socialise the losses'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also very concerned that, by giving deductions for the building of dams and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1429"> levees, they will end up encouraging the use of these rehabilitation methods, despite evidence that they are not a satisfactory answer to the problems of tailings. It seems that the government is determined to minimise any costs that mining companies incur. By doing it through tax deductions, they are effectively doing so at the expense of the rest of the population. The continuing deductions given to mining companies cut into government revenue, reducing the amount of money available for spending on community services, health and education&mdash;sections of the community which, unlike the mining sector, are already operating on insufficient budgets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will relate to the Senate an account of attempts by my office to get a figure from the government on how much the tax deduction for rehabilitation would cost. It is very revealing of the extreme generosity shown to the mining industry. When I first attempted to get a figure on the cost of the deduction, I was told that it would be `minimal', but that an exact figure would not be given. I asked, `What constitutes minimal? Could I at least have a range of figures?' Apparently not. I could get nothing more than the fact that it would be `minimal'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first question that poses itself is: if the cost is so minimal, why grant the deduction in the first place? If it is so minimal, it is clearly not something that is going to make or break the profitability of a mining company. I cannot help getting the feeling that the deduction is being given by this government because it shares the mining industry's outrage at having to engage in any form of rehabilitation. This, the mining industry believes, is an unnecessary cost imposed by minority political pressure groups. Apparently, the government agrees and is thus going to relieve them of the unfair burden!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I have to say that there is also a dangerous precedent here in one bill in calling the construction of tailings dams and construction of levees rehabilitation. Which other bill will we see this in? Perhaps one day in the future we will see things such as Natural Heritage Trust funds going towards environmental rehabilitation. Could that be the case in the future&mdash;that we could see some funds 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> from the Natural Heritage Trust going into the building of dams for mines? It is not beyond the realms of possibility. If we start redefining these in tax bills, maybe that is the logical extension of what we will see in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My inability to get an exact figure also raises another issue&mdash;that is, the government's alleged fiscal responsibility. This government has shown an extremely parsimonious attitude towards government expenditure of some sorts. No amount of spending is too small to escape vigorous scrutiny, provided it is to the community and such groups as the unemployed, Aboriginal people and community groups. Yet here we have the government claiming that it is going to allow a deduction for the mining industry despite not even being sure how much it will cost. I am sure those sectors of the community and public sector who suffered such deep cuts in funding will be impressed by this generosity. Despite this deduction being `minimal', I am sure those whose funding was slashed will be eager to get on the same gravy train as the mining industry is riding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another part of this bill which represents the mining industry getting a tax exemption which the rest of the community is denied. A prospector who on-sells a tenement will not have to pay tax on the income which they make from that sale. Why not? This is the standard real estate sale on which tax is usually payable. Why not in this case?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will finish by posing a question which these new  deductions raise. If the mining industry did not get these massive subsidies and the benefits of these tax deductions, how profitable would it be? Or, to put it another way, how profitable would the renewable energy industry sector be if it received only a fraction of the subsidies that mining receives?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We must look at the real costs, the community costs and the environmental costs. It is well overdue. It is also very important that the mining industry missed out on scrutiny in the much lauded report, which was written by the federal Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, on costs of resource extraction. The mining industry missed out. It has not been done. If it has been done, I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1430"> would be pleased to see it. What is the real cost? What are we actually paying out of taxpayers' funds to support this industry? Why can we support an extension of that without any real explanation for doing so?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be asking questions in the committee stage of the bill. I hope the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) will be able to provide adequate answers to those. I would like to briefly mention that Senator Harradine has amendments to this bill. They do, on my initial investigation, appear to be reasonable amendments to the bill. I will be listening carefully to Senator Harradine's contribution.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, I am sure you, and every member of this chamber, are concerned about taxpayers. We are all concerned about taxpayers. However, it does not appear from the attitude that has thus far flowed from the government or the opposition that they give a damn about taxpayers. Here is a piece of legislation that is likely to affect every single taxpayer in this country, yet the government and the opposition wanted to let this bill through on the flick as a non-controversial item. What a disgrace! It is a sell-out on the taxpayers of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The moment I see a piece of taxation legislation come before this chamber and being regarded as non-controversial should be the time that I should leave this place. I have not yet, in my 21 years of `service' in this place, seen any tax legislation&mdash;let alone a piece of tax legislation that is 366 pages long&mdash;that is non-controversial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been suggested that this is a rewrite of the taxation law. The problem with that, as honourable senators know, or should know, is that there is a body of judicial precedent that applies to the wording of the previous tax law that does not apply to this. I hope the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) can tell me what the word `idea' means in the beginning of this legislation. But we will get that at the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make it clear at the outset that I have no philosophical objections to the rewriting of tax laws. Indeed, we could do worse than go back to Sir Robert Garran's 1915 Income Tax 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Assessment Act, which was only some 30 pages long. I am also cognisant of the amount of money and effort that has gone into this bill, and I note the restrictions on the redrafting process in terms of `no policy changes' that have cost us dearly in terms of what might have been achieved. For example, Hong Kong has surpassed Australia's per capita income on the basis of a simple colonial Inland Revenue ordinance. A world-class tax law need not be the most elaborate&mdash;quite the reverse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am thus deeply concerned that the process of tax law redrafting must be made transparent to the public and not involve unnecessary loss of judicial precedent, especially where it is not intended to change the law. I therefore have profound reservations about proceeding with this bill at this time, and I am not alone on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that there is considerable unhappiness amongst the professionals and industry, in particular the mining industry, in relation to some of the provisions of this bill. Indeed, the Taxation Institute of Australia, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, in their joint submission of 18 February 1997, have gone so far as to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is concern among the members of the combined professional bodies, that, far from achieving the tax simplification and easier compliance goals of the Tax Law Improvement Project . . . taxpayers may be worse off if current TLIP legislation is enacted to become effective from 1 July 1997. This legislation is TLIB and the early instalment, the Income Tax Assessment Bill 1996 . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So you say to those people, `Go and jump in the lake.' These are the people that are dealing daily with taxation matters. They say that the taxpayers of Australia could be worse off because of this legislation, and you are prepared to go through with a flick. You should be ashamed of yourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The basic problem with this rewrite of the tax law is that you cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. Unless there is to be a change of policy, there is not much point in changing the words&mdash;is there? Indeed, it may be much worse than that. If you change the words, the courts presume that you intend to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1431"> change the meaning. In the case of the Bank of England v. Vagliano Brothers, in construing a far more elegant codification in 1882 by Sir Mackenzie Chalmers of the law relating to bills of exchange, the House of Lords observed that you start with the words of a codifying statute uninfluenced by the previous law. So a rewrite in different words inevitably means a loss of precedent. A rewrite for the sake of rewriting may thus be worse than useless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know the bill tries to avoid this logical problem by declaring in proposed sections 1 to 3 that ideas are not to be taken as different just because different words are used. But you are left to the subjective judgment of the courts to decide what idea was meant and whether it was different. There are dictionaries of words the courts can look to, but there are no dictionaries of ideas, unless you can come up with some during this debate, Senator Kemp. Ideas and words cannot be so easily separated and the danger of resulting ambiguity is real.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with the income tax law is not its basic concepts. Section 25, dealing with assessable income, and section 51, dealing with general deductions, have been extensively considered by the courts and there is a huge body of case law which exists to guide taxpayers. The problem with tax law is the continued excrescences being pushed onto it by successive generations of bureaucrats. For example, we just had the debt forgiveness rules pushed into the act. We are about to have rules on trust losses thrust in front of us. If there was a genuine commitment by the tax office to tax simplification, complex legislation like this would not be put in front of us at the same time as we are asked to approve a simplification of the tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was admitted on 19 February this year before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts that it may be up to 20 years before taxpayers have the benefit of the courts resolving some of the ambiguities of this bill. It was said that in some cases you could ask 10 QCs a question and get five opinions one way and five opinions the other way. I do not have time at the second reading stage to quote verbatim what was said and, significantly, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> who said it. Some eminent experts&mdash;notably Geoffrey Lehmann, co-author of one of the leading texts on Australian taxation law&mdash;have condemned this bill as being badly thought out and full of technical errors. Again we have the government and the opposition as one. Do you deny that this is the case; that this expert has said that? Remember the taxpayer. Do nothing that is detrimental to the taxpayer in a rewrite situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lehmann has pointed out that in some cases the guides to the act, which are printed in the text but are not part of the act, are not clearly separated from the operative provisions of the act and are in some cases inconsistent with the act. Given such warnings from persons of the highest eminence in their field, I think it would be most imprudent for the parliament to pass this bill at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are prepared to proceed, at a bare minimum, the commencement date in section 1.2 should be changed from 1 July 1997 to 1 July 1998. There are good reasons for doing so. First, technical problems can be identified and corrected before the act starts to operate. Second, this bill and the Tax Law Improvement Bill were meant to operate together and the latter bill will need extensive consultation&mdash;you will admit that, won't you, Senator Kemp?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Third, this bill, unless amended, will operate retrospectively in respect of early balancing companies whose fiscal year starts before 1 July this year. Retrospective legislation is repugnant at the best of times and is quite unnecessary here. It may help if I give the Senate an example of the sorts of technical problems which may emerge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators will remember that last year the Senate had to amend the law in respect of section 120(1)(c) on tax deductions for repayments of loans by cooperatives because the tax office put out a nonsense ruling which the Senate had to override by amending the law so that the word `or' in the act was not ignored by the tax office. Taxpayers cannot do that and we do not have the time to correct every silly ruling put out by some tax officials. I have nothing personal against taxation officers; some tax officials are among my best friends, I might say.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1432">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take another example. Hundreds of thousands of workers were potentially adversely affected by a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tax Pack</EMPHASIS> instruction that work related expenses should only be deducted when the money was spent as opposed to the law and the High Court's view that expenses were deductible when incurred. After representations, the tax office finally put out a ruling which restored previous practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Take a third example. Section 960-100 in the bill declares that a partnership or trust is an entity for the purposes of the tax law. How will this affect capital gains tax on changes of partners? Is a contribution under a will from a deceased's estate to an existing trust a new trust or the same entity as the first trust? Will a variation of a trust deed create a new entity? I do not know the answers to these questions. I will be interested to see whether the minister does and on what basis. Such questions may end up affecting hundreds of thousands of small businesses, so I am inclined to great caution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sorry saga of amendment after amendment to capital gains tax being backdated to 20 September 1985 should make us extremely cautious about how broad, simple concepts in apparently simple words can end up as legislative and compliance nightmares. It took years for Hepples's case on restrictive covenants to get to the High Court. When it did, the judges could not agree on what the capital gains tax provisions meant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Hence, if this bill proceeds, it is essential that it be amended so that there are safety ropes for taxpayers. There should be a general provision stating that, if a taxpayer would not be liable for tax or pay less tax under the pre-existing law, then he or she should have no further liability under this bill. That is fair, is it not? After all, this bill is supposed to be a rewrite of the existing law, not a tax increase bill. The government is committed to a policy of no new taxes, so I am sure the government will accept an amendment to this effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a further precaution, after section 950-150 on the interpretation of the act, a new section should be added to declare the normal rule for construing legislation potentially adverse to the subject&mdash;namely, in the case of ambiguity, the act should be construed in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> favour of the subject and not derogate from common law rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just as the courts construe tricky fine print in insurance contracts against the insurance companies which put them forward into the hands of consumers, the same principle should operate here. It is a basic consumer protection principle that ambiguous legislation should be construed against those who draft it. No parliament should hand over the liberties of the subject through obscure or ambiguous legislation into the hands of non-elected bureaucrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the controversy which has accompanied this process of tax law redrafting&mdash;and I am not sure it can be always called an improvement&mdash;the parliament has to insist on fail&hyphen;safe mechanisms and basic protections for the taxpayer. To do less than that is for us to fail as legislators. I am vitally concerned that taxpayers not be jeopardised in any way by unintended consequences. Unless this bill has such safety mechanisms built into it, I would find myself unable to support it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment this bill is only controversial in areas of the tax consulting professions and some industry associations. But I can guarantee the parliament that, if we let it go without safeguards, taxpayers will be affected by so-called unintended consequences&mdash;and that is admitted. If there are no safeguards for such cases, the resulting controversy among the public at large will make the furores over fringe benefits tax and substantiation rules look mild indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, this is the Senate. This measure was rubber&hyphen;stamped through the House of Representatives. There was no debate, virtually. There has been no offer of debate here. I challenge the Senate to consider the matters that I have raised in the light of the Senate's functions as a house of review. Much has been said about this of recent times. But we are a house of review, and here is a most important piece of legislation that is likely to affect every single taxpayer in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does this legislation not deserve more than the cursory treatment it has been given by the government and, to this stage, the opposition? Is it not legislation in relation to which we, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1433"> not only as legislators but specifically as senators, have the job of protecting the rights of individual citizens? That is one of our jobs. If we do not do that on this occasion and specifically give some guarantees and safeguards to those persons whose rights may well be affected as a result of this legislation, then we are failing in our duty as senators.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the senators for their remarks on this package of income tax legislation. Senator Margetts was kind enough to provide my office with notice of some questions. Senator, we certainly appreciate your courtesy and will respond to those in the committee stage of the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To the remarks made by my colleague Senator Harradine: Senator, it was a good and powerful speech. However, many of the issues you raised do not relate to this particular package of legislation but are general issues which will apply to any tax bill, regardless. Of course there will always be challenges in courts to legislation which is passed by this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, this legislation has a very long history of public exposure. I note your concern to protect the rights and interests of taxpayers, and on our side we welcome that. That is why this government in its budgets has tried to reduce the constant burden on taxpayers. No-one needs to speak to this government about the rights of taxpayers and the need to protect taxpayers' interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, you felt that in some way the rights of taxpayers&mdash;and I think this debate will continue in the committee stage&mdash;were somehow being impinged upon. I do not agree. The passage of this legislation in many ways will mark a new era for all those Australians who need to know under tax law what their basic rights and obligations are. That is why the legislation has been written in a way to make it easier for people to understand. That was one of the bases upon which this project commenced. Senator, to that extent, we are in blazing agreement with you: taxpayers need to know and understand their rights and obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to get the history clear, the bills that are before the chamber today have been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> subject to close review and extensive consultation. Their content was exposed for public comment and there was a series of consultative documents in August 1994 and April and June 1995. We believe that the quality of these bills has been significantly enhanced as a result of that consultation. It has been an extremely valuable process, and the government is keen to ensure that all stages of the tax law rewrite benefit from a wide range of views.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These bills were introduced by the previous government in December 1995 and referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for review&mdash;which is most appropriate and should happen in these cases. The committee held public hearings on these bills but, before the calling of the general election, was unable to report on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government introduced the present bills in June 1996, some nine months ago, and referred them to the JCPA, which again held public hearings. The committee, made up of people from all sides of the parliament, reported in August and commended the bills as a significant improvement on existing law. It also recommended some finetuning changes in response to public submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, in relation to your proposal for deferral, the committee proposed deferring the start date of the bills until 1 July 1997 so that there would be ample time to prepare for them. So, in that sense, they have already been deferred once. No-one is trying to dump these bills. Of all the bills that have come before this chamber, these bills in particular have been exposed for public comment over a long period of time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but here is the unanimous view of the three peak bodies, the Taxation Institute of Australia, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, all of whom are opposed to this legislation proceeding at this point of time and for very valid reasons. Senator Kemp has not gone to those reasons. Surely he knew that that was the case. Did he know that they were opposed to this before he was going to flick it through in a non-controversial time?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These organisations are there to serve the taxpayers in Australia. Of course, Senator Kemp's response is that these people are always concerned about tax. Of course they are concerned about tax law, but we are talking about a rewrite, and the unintended consequences that taxpayers could all be worse off as a result of this piece of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then Senator Kemp will find out. The government stood and said, `No new taxes,' but this legislation has the potential of exacting new taxes. That is what it is all about.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1435">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The proposed start date of 1 July 1997 is ill-conceived. There is no benefit to Australia of rushing new tax laws on unprepared taxpayers. Indeed, such action would appear to be contrary to the stated project goal of simplifying and improving tax law for taxpayers, particularly where such law contains errors and unrecognised changes in the tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. The proposed start date will be 1 January 1997 for some taxpayers and is retrospective.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let us not get into any argument over that. The government is proposing to put forward retrospective legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a breach of the fundamental principle that laws should not be retrospective. Australian parliaments have only made laws retrospective where there were extreme circumstances, which is not the case here.</PARA>

It may be not desirable, but it often happens in the real world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been considerable promotion of public awareness throughout Australia wide seminars and other public forums. Commercial publishers are geared up and training materials produced by the ATO will be available in May. There is no rush at all in this. The first draft of the bill was around in mid-1994. No-one has been rushed; no-one has been sprung. Many accountants have already anticipated commencement of the legislation in relation to their staff and clients. Of course, that also applies in universities with their teaching aids. Preparedness for this bill is substantially, we believe, an advance of the usual case for other tax legislation, which often contains much more substantial change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bills have already been deferred by a year. The JCPA, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, has listened to the submissions of the tax practitioners, the associations and those that had a view that they should be further delayed.

In the particular area that I am looking at, there is a great deal of need for clarification.

Firstly, how much will the deduction on dams and levees cost per year?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to do that. The first question is: how much will the deduction on dams and levees cost per year? Does carrying out eligible mining activities include construction and operation of tailings dams, dump leach pads or vat leach pads and, if not, why not? Does rehabilitating a mine site include the removal of topsoil from a mine surface, the construction of a waste dump, the construction of a tailings embankment or the recovery of economic tailings?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can the minister provide an example of a dam specifically constructed for no purpose other than to provide water for rehabilitation? To the best of our knowledge, no such dams are constructed in Western Australia. I believe that has been confirmed. We have sought information from the West Australian Department of Minerals and Energy and that seems to be the case. No dams in WA mining have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been built for anything other than tailings, so what are you talking about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Does rehabilitating the mine site include expenditure on site assessment, monitoring, compliance reporting and changed land uses&mdash;and this includes wildlife habitat&mdash;which do not increase the residual market value of the rehabilitated area? In other words, if you change the use which actually makes it more beneficial for the environment do you lose your tax deduction if other people get it? Does it include expenditure on recovery of contaminated seepage or erosion products?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for those questions and I appreciate the courtesy you showed in providing those to us so that we can respond more fully. In answer to the first question, I am advised that the extension of deductions on mine site rehabilitation to expenditure on levees and dams necessary for rehabilitating a mine site will not have any significant revenue cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second question, which senators will recall, was: does carrying out of eligible mining activities include construction and operation of tailings dam, dump leach pads or vat leach pads? If not, why not? The answer to that is: the tax treatment of expenditure on the construction and operation of tailings dams and similar activities is unaffected by the rewriting of the mining provisions by this bill. I am advised that such expenditure, if incurred in a commercial mining venture, would expect to qualify as allowable capital expenditure or as plant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the third question, the answer is: the tax treatment of expenditure on rehabilitating a mine site is unaffected by the rewriting of the mining provisions by this bill. Whether particular activities qualify will depend on their own facts. I am advised that the activities referred to would appear to be associated with mining operations rather than rehabilitation. They could expect to qualify as allowable capital expenditure under the mining provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the fourth question, Senator Margetts asked whether I can provide an example of a dam specifically constructed for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1437"> no other purpose other than to provide water for rehabilitation. `To the best of our knowledge no such dams are constructed in Western Australia,' I think was the point you made. The answer to that is: I have no specific example in mind of a dam built solely for providing water for rehabilitation. However, an example could be where mineral sands require vegetation as part of the rehabilitation process and a dam is built at the site to facilitate that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the fifth question, Senator Margetts asked whether the rehabilitating of the mine site included expenditure on a variety of matters, including site assessment, monitoring and compliance reporting. The answer to that is: again, the tax treatment of expenditure on rehabilitating a mine site is unaffected by the rewriting of the mining provisions by this bill. Whether particular activities qualify as eligible will depend on their own facts. I am advised that the activities listed in the question would appear to be associated with rehabilitation and therefore deductible under those provisions. An alternative deduction may also be available under the environment provisions. That responds to the matters raised by Senator Margetts.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the amendment that has just been moved and to put the opposition's view of that amendment. Before I do so, I draw attention to the fact that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1438"> Senator Harradine made what I thought was a reasonable point when he said that this bill should not be just flicked through. It is more important than that. All taxpayers are affected by it. I am mindful that perhaps that was a stinging aside to my party, among others, because we had not spoken in this debate. I thought that was a reasonable point and that just one or two points should be put on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  record from the point of view of the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is a Labor initiative. It was commenced in 1994. It sprung from a basic, fundamental principle of taxation. If we go back to first principles here, one of the fundamental principles of taxation is that tax ought to be simple and it ought to be able to be transparently understood by individuals who are subject to that taxation. That is a fundamental first principle in our view, and it is one that I am pleased to acknowledge the government shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at the tax act in Australia, you do not just look at a document; you actually look at a whole shelf of documents, as the tax act has grown like Topsy since 1936, when it was first brought down. There is a clear case here to simplify that. It is often asserted by tax experts that no&hyphen;one knows what the meaning of the entire act is. It is just too complex. This is often asserted by cynics who find these things, with justifiable cynicism in this case. They cite provisions of the tax act which sound like gobbledegook and confuse people and even, indeed, raise a laugh as to the supposed real meaning of that provision. When you have that type of complexity, it is a chance for lawyers to dine out on defining different meanings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I am saying is that we recognise&mdash;I think this is generally recognised&mdash;that there is a clear case to simplify this legislation, reduce it in size and make it as transparent and as accessible as possible to ordinary mortals so that you do not actually have to engage a high class lawyer at a fat fee in order to understand what your taxing obligations are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Broadly, we support this initiative, having initiated it in the first place ourselves. I acknowledge that the process has been going 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for three years. A thing like this has to be approached with care. This has gone through several filters  and over several hurdles to ensure that it has been properly scrutinised&mdash;the minister has recognised some of those&mdash;and it has been before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That committee broadly endorsed the bill but made some recommendations which have been picked up by the government. One of the important ones is the prospective operational date of this bill, which would be, if this chamber supports it, 1 July this year. That is still some months off, so that is a prospective operational date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will deal with a couple of the points that have been made. One is that because you change the words you change the meaning. That, on its face, is a point that appears to have some logic to it. But if one turns to section 1-3 in the bill, a section headed `differences in style not to affect meaning', a section in the bill that is taken from the Acts Interpretation Act to guide judges, law makers and mortals like me as to what the meaning should be, then you will see a provision there that says that, just because the words have changed for greater clarity, that should not infer that a different meaning was intended by that change in words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put that another way, as I comprehend it, section 1-3&mdash;`differences in style not to affect meaning', the copy of the Acts Interpretation Act provision&mdash;simply says that the jurisprudence of the old tax act stands behind these new words presented to us now. I think that ought to be clearly understood because that is a key element as to whether, in simplifying complex legislation, you lose the meaning and you lose the case law that has defined or refined the meaning over time. By virtue of that provision, we do not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point that concerned me in particular&mdash;a point that was dwelt on with some force, passion and at length by Senator Harradine, all of those things being quite proper in advocating a view&mdash;was that there is some retrospective legislation here. In the chamber, retrospective legislation is to be avoided, certainly in tax matters where possible, although I would assert this for myself 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1439"> and indeed, I think, for my party: the only way in which you can be absolutely certain of preventing tax avoidance is if avoiders know that when they are unmasked and caught the legislature is prepared to retrospectively wipe out their ill&hyphen;gotten gains. Then there is no percentage in avoiding. If you can write legislation that does that while protecting legitimate uses, then that ought to be open in the area of tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having put that caveat on it, though, Senator Harradine is right that, apart from that avoidance issue, broadly one ought to steer clear of and not introduce retrospective legislation in this area. My understanding of what he may have been referring to&mdash;if he wishes to join the debate again and spell this out I would be pleased, but I am not necessarily inviting it&mdash;is that there is a provision in this act where companies engaging in early balancing of company accounts may be affected by an operational date of 1 July of this year. I understand that point. I do know that the JCPA considered that point at length and did not think it was necessary for any special consideration on that issue. That was a unanimous joint parliamentary committee report.</PARA>

However, if that is the case of retrospectivity that is being referred to, I think I can adopt the view of the JCPA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads me to comment briefly on the amendment moved by the Greens. So I do not delay the consideration in this chamber of this legislation, I also take the opportunity to comment on the circulated but not yet moved amendment from the Australian Democrats. Both relate to mine site rehabilitation. In the case of the Greens, I have heard the questions and the answers and I understand that the intent of this amendment would be to remove deduction for mining companies for mine site rehabilitation. Frankly, I do not understand how such an intention, if I comprehend it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> accurately, is consistent with an environmental viewpoint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that great strides have been made in the mining industry over recent years in mine site rehabilitation and that in fact Australia boasts some of the best examples of mine site rehabilitation in the world. I have in mind Alcoa in the Darling Scarp east of Perth, where they mine bauxite and have been able to recover the area and regrow native vegetation, including jarrah and marri trees, which are the natural vegetation of the area. I think that anyone with a concern for the environment is rightly concerned about mining activity because that does disrupt the natural environment as a direct and obvious consequence of mining. But these decisions are made on balance. The key issue is that at the end of the process it should be rehabilitated, and a tax concession to help provide that is a guarantee of the environment being returned as near as possible to its natural state at the conclusion of mining. I do not see that removing this provision is in fact answering the point about the need to protect the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In any case, I make the observation that what we have here is an amendment that is not related to the purpose of the bill. The bill we have is a bill to simplify the meaning of the tax act. This amendment is to change one of those meanings. In other words, given that we have a simplification bill here, it is an opportunity for some honourable senators to want to change the meaning of the tax act. I do not think that is the purpose of this at all.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, we are here to make better laws, if I might take that interjection, but it is always open for senators to move these changes in other ways than by going against the purpose of this legislation. Therefore I will not be supporting the Margetts amendment. For similar reasons, I do not support the Democrats' amendment, although I think the Democrats' amendment is far more palatable. Their amendment removes `partially' and goes to `fully' and therefore is a direct incentive to engage in rehabilitation in full, not in part. I comprehend that, and in ordinary circumstances I would support that. But I say that we are not here to amend the act, we are here to simplify it, and therefore today I am voting for simplification.</PARA></TALK.START>

A complex piece of legislation that occupies a shelf in a library and has grown like Topsy since 1936 is made more simple and accessible, and that is, as I said at the beginning, a key principle of what taxation law should be about. That is what we are about here and I hope we support it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the Commonwealth level the Director of Public Prosecutions will now, as far as we read these provisions to operate, make all decisions to prosecute criminal offences under Commonwealth law. This is a welcome development. Those acts which will now have ministerial discretion removed in the decision to prosecute are the Australian Bicentennial Authority Act 1980, the Banks (Shareholdings) Act 1972, the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980, the Financial Corporations Act 1974, the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975, the Insurance Contracts Act 1984, the Prices and Surveillance Act 1983, the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951 and the Public Works Committee Act 1969.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian Public Prosecutions Act was passed in 1994. It repealed that state's previous DPP Act. It did not contain many of the changes originally mooted. For example, it did not establish an officer of Deputy DPP. It was said by Bernard Bongiorno to preserve the independence of his office and to ensure that decisions were made honestly. The power of courts and petitioners to initiate contempt proceedings is fundamental to the effective administration of justice and goes to the core of judicial power in this country. Halsbury Laws of Australia defines contempt proceedings as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Traditionally, contempt of court is divided into two categories. Criminal contempt involves acts or words which interfere with or tend to interfere with the administration of justice, and which amount to a public wrong. Sanctions imposed are punitive in nature. Civil contempt (also known as contempt in procedure) involves disobedience of the judgments, orders or other processes of the court and amounts to a private wrong. As the purpose of civil contempt is to assist enforcement for the private benefit of a party to proceedings, sanctions imposed are primarily coercive or remedial rather than punitive. Wilful disobedience of a court order constitutes a criminal contempt (especially if an element of public defiance is involved), as it involves a public injury that calls into play the courts's penal or disciplinary jurisdiction . . . Nevertheless, civil and criminal contempt share the same rationale, that is, the protection of the effective administration of justice.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This must be contrasted with the coalition government in Victoria which, under the stewardship of Mr Kennett and Ms Jan Wade, the state's Attorney&hyphen;General, has attacked the office of the DPP. In 1993 it was revealed that the Victorian Attorney&hyphen;General proposed to curb the DPP's independence by, among other things, appointing a deputy DPP who would report to the A&hyphen;G and have the power to veto decisions of the DPP. The Director of Public Prosecutions at that time was Mr Bernard Bongiorno, a person of considerable talent and repute in the legal profession and wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A chronology up to December 1994 is as follows. In August 1993 the Victorian DPP, Mr Bongiorno, angered the Kennett government when he indicated that he considered contempt actions against Premier Kennett over comments about the arrest of the Frankston 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1442"> serial killer Paul Denyer. Denyer eventually pleaded guilty making possible contempt irrelevant. Mr Greg Craven, the Victorian Crown Counsel and the Attorney&hyphen;General, Ms Wade, began speaking confidentially to other crown prosecutors about `problems' in the DPP's office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Public Prosecutions Act 1994, referred to above, did remove the power of the DPP to initiate contempt proceedings. Under the 1994 act, only the Attorney&hyphen;General acting on the advice of the Solicitor&hyphen;General can initiate contempt proceedings. This must be contrasted strongly with the inherent power of federal courts to prosecute for contempt as well as the power of ordinary individuals to petition court for contempt orders, and by any analysis is a breach of the civil liberties of Victorian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In mid&hyphen;April 1995 the Victorian opposition leader, John Brumby, attacked Jan Wade for refusing to hold an inquiry into allegations that her office conspired to force Bernard Bongiorno from his office. The Victorian Society of Labor Lawyers also condemned the Kennett government and asked for a full disclosure of the government's rationale for wanting to limit the DPP's powers. After a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program, the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, on 12 April 1995, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for impartiality in these posts requires absolute independence from Government tampering but Victorians cannot be sure that complete detachment was exercised in the Bongiorno case. As a result, public respect for the legal process has been diminished and the blame for this must rest with Mrs Wade.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS>  program, allegations were made that a bill to reform the office of DPP had been drafted because the view was held that Mr Bongiorno had been a megalomaniac who had considered suing the Premier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September 1995, the Victorian Labor opposition called for a return of powers to initiate contempt of court proceedings to the DPP. There had been a contempt of court case against BHP. By engaging in an agreement with the PNG government about the Ok Tedi mine which would have made it a criminal offence for landowners to take action for compensation arising from mining, a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> single judge in the Victorian Supreme Court said that BHP was in contempt of court. This finding was overturned by the full court of the Victorian Supreme Court on appeal by BHP and the Attorney&hyphen;General because the Public Prosecutions Act 1994 had given the Victorian Attorney&hyphen;General the sole right to bring an action for contempt and because the plaintiffs&mdash;the PNG landowners&mdash;had therefore no standing to bring an action for contempt of court. This judgment was appealed to the High Court but the High Court found the provision of the Public Prosecutions Act valid, although three judges called for it to be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of the independence of the DPP is that, as an independent statutory office holder, it protects the public interest and gives confidence in the proper administration of criminal justice. Many criminal matters necessarily involve allegations of serious infringements of the law. It is thus doubly important that all citizens&mdash;of whatever status&mdash;are equally subject to the processes of the criminal law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Impartiality in decision making about prosecutions is also important because of the characteristics of crime. Some of these are: crime has public implications&mdash;that is, the behaviour involved in crimes is viewed as having such an impact on the public interest that it should be punished by the state and not seen simply as a matter to be determined between individuals in a civil court; crimes have victims other than the defendant and the injury they cause to the defendant is such that criminals deserve punishment and perhaps incapacitation, through imprisonment, and not simply remediation in a civil court; some commentators believe that there is also a moral dimension to what is a crime, that crime involves behaviour that offends morality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Decision makers, especially if they are not independent of government or are ministers of the Crown, may be or may be seen to be acting for party political reasons and no&hyphen;one should be above the law on those grounds. Under the Australian version of the Westminster system, there is a separation of powers between the executive, the legislature 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1443"> and the judiciary. The independence of those exercising judicial functions is important so that they can act independently from the other two arms of government and so that they can apply the law without favour and carry out their functions free from fear that a decision or action that is unpopular with the government will lead to their removal from office. Thus, it is important that politicians are removed from the control of the prosecution process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It can be said that giving the power solely to the Attorney&hyphen;General to initiate contempt of court proceedings could lead to a potential conflict of interest between the responsibilities of the A&hyphen;G as the chief law officer and his or her political allegiances or the influence of big business&mdash;for example, in the case involving BHP and the Ok Tedi mine. In general, it can also be said that citizens should have a power to initiate proceedings for contempt. Contempt of court can occur when action is taken to intimidate a plaintiff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rule of law and adherence to democratic principles is bolstered by the effective separations of power. Ms Wade and Mr Kennett, by diluting that separation, made a substantial attack on those democratic rights which are the birthright of Victorian and Australian citizens. The Australian Democrats are pleased that the coalition, at least at a federal level, accords with those ideals. We believe that the passage of this bill will serve as a beacon and an example to people such as Ms Wade and Mr Kennett that certain tenets of our democracy&mdash;such as the independence of the DPP to initiate contempt proceedings&mdash;are not to be toyed with, particularly for the purpose of their political expediency. The Democrats and I commend to the Senate this bill and the principles it contributes in defining the contempt.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to have the opportunity to  extend my answer beyond the five&hyphen;minute limit, but let me get started on outlining all the things that we have done. We made commitments to women at the last election. During these last 12 months we have been busy honouring those commitments to women. Women of course are interested in the broader issues that relate to the economy, health and education, et cetera. After all, they voted for us in spades at the last election. They knew that we would do the job and they have been endorsing the effort we have made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are specific measures which we have undertaken to improve women's status in our 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> community. They include economic security, blending work and family responsibilities, safety on the streets and in the home, the lack of women in decision making roles, women's health and women in regional Australia. Obviously in the time I have, I will have to be quick.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own portfolio, for example, our priorities have been: to develop opportunities for Australian women to participate in developing policy and programs; I have introduced a comprehensive consultative program for women's NGOs to have access to and to influence government; extensive consultations around Australia by myself and my staff; the establishment of a parliamentary advisory group; an annual two&hyphen;day round  table; the publication of an annual report of the women NGOs of Australia; and an information booklet on the women MPs and the parliamentary committees and how to access both the MPs and committees. That is important because women need to be able to get their voices heard in the policy development and decision making process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that in 13 years of Labor they did not seem to know what the issues of importance to women were. In the 1993 election they had to import Anne Summers from New York to tell them what policies to put in place for that election. In the last election they had to spend $65,000 doing a poll on what issues women need to know and were concerned about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are keen to have women's input into policy making. We are keen to have more women in decision making and leadership positions. Of course, we already have a record number of women in the parliament and in the ministry and in the cabinet. Perhaps the Senate would not know that in the last year we increased the percentage of women on Commonwealth controlled boards and committees from 30.5 per cent, which we inherited on coming into government, to 31.5 per cent. I am not saying that that is terrific, but it is an improvement. The trend is up. You would be complaining if it was down. Tomorrow I intend to announce a pilot program to improve those figures even more.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1445">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Women have been appointed, including in my own portfolio, to major positions in government. Sue Vardon will be heading up the new Commonwealth Services Agency and Anthea Tinney will be heading up the Environment Protection Group. They are just two. The Treasurer appointed two very senior and capable women to very important boards the moment he gained office. There have been many others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our workplace relations act will help women in the workplace by ensuring equal remuneration for work of equal value, by ensuring anti-discrimination and establishing the employee advocate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to respond to Senator Sandy Macdonald, who has his electorate office in the heart of the Hunter Valley coalfields. Senators are hopefully aware that the Hunter Valley is the cradle of the coal industry in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are not the biggest coal producer in the world. There are other much greater producers than Australia, including: China at about 1.4 billion tonnes of coal; members of the European Union at about 1.2 billion tonnes; the United  States at about 900 million tonnes; and India at about 450 million tonnes. We are, however, the largest exporter of coal, as we supply low ash, low sulfur coals to foreign steel mills, power utilities and general industry. This represents an export income in the order of $8 billion a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As forecasted at the APEC energy ministers conference last year in Sydney, there will be enormous demand for energy infrastructure between now and the year 2010 if the projected growth rate in the Asia-Pacific region is to be realised. It will not, however, just happen. We have keen competitors in countries such as Indonesia, South Africa, the United States and Canada. It is vital that our competitiveness be maintained and any impediments to expansion and new developments be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Hunter Valley, with its resources, infrastructure and ports, is well placed to take advantage of the anticipated demand for semi-soft and thermal coals. Following discussions 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I had last year and representations I made to the Indian minister responsible for mines, both here and in New Delhi, I am pleased to advise the Senate that I have been informed by the Indian High Commission that tariffs on all coals have been significantly reduced. The coal tariff reductions announced in the Indian budget are: coking coal with ash of less than 12 per cent has been reduced from five per cent to three per cent, coking coal with ash greater than 12 per cent has been reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent and non-coking coal has been reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is already the major supplier of imported coking coals to India. India takes about 98 per cent of its coking coals from Australia, with plans to increase its steel making capacity from the current level of 22.5 million tonnes to about 40 million tonnes over the next five to six years. The market for imported coking coal is expected to grow from almost 11 million to 18 to 20 million tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For steaming coals, the gap between supply and demand in India is currently estimated to be 10 to 15 million tonnes. With prospective growth in power production, this is expected to grow to as much as 50 million tonnes by the year 2000. This change in tariffs will be of benefit to both Australia and India. Indian coals are around 45 per cent ash, so we have the opportunity to blend with the Indian coals to improve their quality and also to supply coals into their thermal power stations for independent power producers. This offers enormous opportunities for the Hunter Valley which has particular expertise in the values that are important&mdash;low ash, low sulfur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Because of interest from Thailand and the emergence of independent power producers, I have sponsored a trip to the Hunter by environmental journalists. Clean Australian coals will replace lignite in Thailand, which burns with a much higher emission rate than our coals. This, again, opens opportunities for the Hunter and for the rest of the Australian coalfields. I have moved to remove export controls on coal which remain a longstanding impediment to a greater reliance on Australian coals in the Asian region. Provided the condi

Also, at additional estimates hearings last week, the assistant secretary of the community and regional branch of the national landcare program agreed with my concerns about the opposition from the Yungaburra community to the Eacham Shire Council's use of landcare funds for a sewerage project for that township on the Atherton Tablelands.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Woodley for his question. On behalf of Mr Anderson, I wish to express the government's support and admiration for the work of the landcare movement. Australia is currently celebrating national landcare month and it is important that all citizens recognise the magnificent commitment that voluntary landcare groups have made to natural resources management over the last 10 or 15 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are currently 3,250 landcare groups in Australia with an estimated membership in excess of 25,000 people. In late 1996 the ombudsman, while recognising that landcare 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1453"> funds provided to the Boorowa New South Wales landcare group in 1992 had been expended for the purposes for which they were granted, it highlighted some areas were landcare project submissions and assessment processes could be improved. A plan of action is being implemented to address those processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Yungaburra case is an excellent example of where the Commonwealth has exercised care and responsibility in ensuring that environmental and community endorsement processes are followed before projects are finally approved for expenditure. Since 1993-94 the Commonwealth has withheld funding until those clearances are obtained. Currently, the project is with the Queensland government and relevant local government authorities for completion of environmental and community clearance processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the Commonwealth and state governments contribute significant funds to landcare, landholders themselves make a contribution many times over in terms of their own funding, materials and labour. Australia has established an enviable reputation in relation to its level of the community participation in landcare activities and I believe their efforts should be fostered and encouraged at all times.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Landcare encapsulates the true Australian spirit of tackling seemingly insurmountable problems head on through strong individual commitment and effort. Their efforts have certainly made a big difference, but there is still an extremely big challenge out there and a lot more work still to be done. I urge the community to get in behind the many thousands of individuals who are out there doing their bit, planting trees, protecting areas of remnant vegetation, fencing off rivers, creeks and wetlands, repairing areas of erosion, reducing sedimentation of rivers and a myriad of other activities which will leave future generations with a greatly enhanced environment.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable senator for her question. Yes, I am aware, in a very general way, of the case before the courts in New Zealand where post&hyphen;graduate fee paying students have taken a university to court for alleged breach of contract and negligence. As with any other customer service, a student has the right to take legal action if the product purchased is not satisfactory. While the Trade Practices Act, as I am advised, does not apply in these circumstances, the state equivalents&mdash;that is, the fair trading acts or whatever name they go under&mdash;may well have application to universities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian higher education institutions are well aware of the importance of their reputation and one would hope that none of them would let their reputation fall to such a point by offering courses of such a low level that Australian students felt obliged to take action. That would be a most regrettable situation, but it is not a situation that one forecasts as being likely to happen at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reputations of universities are gained and maintained by consistently providing quality courses, teaching of the highest standard and a wide range of services to their students. It was the Labor government that introduced fee paying post&hyphen;graduate places in Australian universities and in last year's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> budget we extended that to undergraduate places. However, it must be understood, because some senators opposite would like to create some flack on the air waves in respect to this matter, that the flexibility to increase funding to universities is of course available to them only after they have filled their government funded places. The government is very much looking to the expansion of the sources of income to universities, such as through the provision of fee paying courses, to enhance the quality of higher education in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the government and the universities are aware that to offer a substandard course simply to pursue additional revenue would in fact in the medium to longer term be very counterproductive for any university that sought to take that on. I have no doubt that Australian universities will continue to offer both their Australian and international students an education which is world class.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important to understand the difference between the people on this side and the people on that side with respect to additional charges to students. On this side of the chamber, we believe that higher education students get a lot more than the 75 per cent who do not go to higher education. It is fair to ask them to pay a higher contribution. People opposite do not think that. They think if you are academically bright you should get everything and they do not worry so much about the other 75 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also believe that if you pay for something, if your dollars are going into it, you demand a better service. By having fee paying students and higher contributions on government students we believe the student population will become more demanding of universities, and by the student population becoming more demanding they will themselves increase the quality of education for future graduates.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) to questions without notice asked by Senators Neal, O'Brien, Crowley and Lundy today, relating administration of the health and family services portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">When this government was elected, we thought it would mean pain for the community, but particularly for young families with children in child care, for the elderly and for the sick&mdash;particularly for the sickest and the frailest, those in nursing homes. We did not know how horribly right we were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In last year's budget pain was inflicted. This pain was inflicted by net cuts of $1.7 billion to the Department of Health and Family Services; $800 million in cuts to public hospitals, leading to longer waiting lists and a reduction in the quality of service; cuts to states grants in areas of public health; abolishment of the Commonwealth dental health program; increases in the pharmaceutical co-payment, both for concessional and general patients; the closure of 84 Medicare offices over three years; and cuts to a variety of procedures in terms of the Medicare payments, which means that patients are paying more out of their pockets.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were cuts in aged care; the introduction of an entry fee for nursing homes, an average of $26,000 up to $88,000; resident fees of $24 a day, which approximately 35 per cent of those in aged care facilities will have to pay; removal of the exemption for deeming on the first $2,000 of pensioners' bank accounts; and the increase in the user charges for HACC services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were cuts in child care&mdash;cuts to the operational subsidy meant that families had to pay an extra $35 a week&mdash;the introduction of a means test for the child&hyphen;care rebate and a tightening of the means test for the child&hyphen;care allowance, which meant again that families had to pay more. It also meant that 5,500 child&hyphen;care places that should have been built were not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is not where the pain ends. We know now that in the Department of Health and Family Services a committee led by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) has decreed that a further $1.365 billion will be cut. That means that families with kids in child care, the elderly and the sick get slugged once again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister might say that she does not know about this, but certainly this is not surmising. This is not guessing. This is not predicting. This is not scaremongering. A document we have been provided with shows that this is the case. It shows that $800 million of that money is going to come out of pharmaceutical. That means bigger co-payments, more money being paid by pensioners and families for their prescriptions. Four hundred million dollars is coming out of child care&mdash;again, higher costs for families with kids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not all. We don't know the exact figures, but the balance is made up of things like reducing the rebate for medical expenses for those who are in aged care facilities. Do we see that as fair that those who are sick and elderly and have to go into a nursing home cannot get any rebate for their medical expenses, even though everyone else can?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also know that the government is looking at reducing the income threshold for the private health insurance levy. Over time, more and more people in the community will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1458"> have to pay the additional levy if they do not compulsorily take up private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also know that there is going to be a reduction in money going to the states for public hospitals&mdash;so don't you pretend that you do not know what this is about, because you are inflicting pain and you are doing it willingly. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services (Senator Ellison) is well aware of this. The document has been provided to him. It seems to me a little bit peculiar that a document should be provided to the parliamentary secretary, who only did his first piece of legislation yesterday, when in fact the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Family Services in this place (Senator Newman) seems to be completely ignorant of what is taking place. But let me assure you that I am well aware, and very shortly the whole community will be aware that you have planned for them a further cut of $1.3 billion for the Department of Health and Family Services.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is indeed the height of cheek for the opposition to come in here and criticise this government, which has been in power for the sum total of 12 months, when we bear in mind that the opposition had 13 years to fix the disastrous situation in relation to health care that we have in Australia today. This is the government that has taken the initiative to give incentive to people to privately health insure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just recently, legislation was brought forward in this chamber and the opposition, grudgingly, agreed to it. They agreed to it because they could see the merit in it. But, even then, they had to put forward an amendment which indexed the thresholds which applied to the incentives bill and to the levy charge that the government brought in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is what the government was saying to the people of Australia: `If you privately health insure, we will give you a benefit. We will make it more attractive for you to privately health insure, and thereby take the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pressure off the public health system.' At the other end of the scale were those who were well off and who did not privately health insure. We said to them: `If you keep doing that, we will impose a levy.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember that the previous Prime Minister, Paul Keating, said that he did not have private health care. I think Carmen Lawrence, the former health minister, did not have private health care despite being able to afford it. I ask this chamber and the people of Australia: is it fair that people who can afford to look after themselves do not do so? Should they be a burden on the public health system when the public health system is there to catch those people who are concessional card holders and those people who are unable to afford private health care? That is what it is there for&mdash;to catch them. That is the safety net which this government is going to provide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is going to take the pressure off the public health system and it is going to wean people back on to private health. We heard Senator Neal say in the debate the other day that the rate of decline of the exodus of people from private health had gone from 0.45 per cent per quarter to 0.25 per cent&mdash;almost halved.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was quoted in the last 12 months, Senator Crowley. That was a result of the announced policies of this government, so I say to this chamber that the people of Australia are getting the message. There is an incentive to go into private health, and we will see a turnaround in the rate of decline. In the last three years, the rate of participation in private health has declined by some three per cent. That is disgraceful. I ask the opposition: what did you do for 13 years in relation to public health care? You presided over the biggest exodus from private health care that this country had ever seen. You presided over the greatest overburdening of public health that this country had seen. That, in turn, increased hospital queues, increased the pressure on public hospitals and produced the situation that we have today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has said that this initiative is not the total answer. Indeed, it is not. It is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1459"> the first step in a strategy to achieving that total answer. We are not saying to the people of Australia: `We have got the answer overnight.' Certainly we haven't. But we do have the first step in a well thought out strategy to get this country back on track in relation to health. That will entail a system where people who can afford to privately insure themselves for health do so, and take themselves off the public health system. That, after all, is what we are all about. We want to see the burden on the public health system alleviated and it can only be done as I have said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So all these furphies that the opposition trots out are just that. Just 12 months ago, we put our policy before the people of Australia and they endorsed it overwhelmingly. The polls still show that if we were to have an election today we would have the same result. I say to the opposition: you ought to take note of that because the fact is that the people of Australia are still behind us 12 months on. I bet you that in two years, when we go back to them, they will still be supporting us.</PARA></SPEECH>

You have broken every one of those promises. What it

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of Australia are not stupid. They do not buy those kinds of silly arguments, and they do not buy broken promises. Don't hold your breath on how long families will stay with you once they understand the full facts of what you have been doing. They will now have to find extra money. Your government's document shows that you intend to add much further pain in the child&hyphen;care area. We do not know how much you will increase fees again, but we suspect it will be another $20. This document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The balance of child care savings to reach the proposed Department of Finance child care figures of $315 million in total by introducing the least awful of the Department of Finance lists.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That sounds like a very authentic document from the Department of Finance, and so it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We want to know from you, Senator Ellison&mdash;because Senator Newman has not stayed to defend herself&mdash;what we can say to the families of Australia about what you say you are doing for them. Senator Newman got up in this place and talked about the benefits to Australian women this International Women's Day of having the coalition in government. This is a government that has removed equal pay for women from the Industrial Relations Act. This is a government that has removed award protection for part-time workers. Mr Howard was talking in the other place about flexibility. Yes, women have flexibility: they no longer have protection; they no longer have the same kind of assurance that they had before; they no longer have a commitment to equal pay. They are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1460"> now going to be casual, part-time and underpaid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If women do get a job, they will have to pay much more for their child care. Whether it is private child care or community based child care, increased fees of up to $20 or $25 a week are coming into existence. How can you say to the families of Australia that they are better off paying $25 a week for child&hyphen;care costs when they only get $4 a week from their tax payment? Families do not take too long to work out the benefit of that sum. It is not a benefit; it is a big loss for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABS figures that show people cannot find jobs because of child care should be of great concern. Instead, by way of an answer, we have a minister who says, `You did not do anything in child care.' That is rubbish. We dramatically increased child&hyphen;care services. To give Senator Patterson her due, she has often said that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We took the child&hyphen;care investment from $68 million when we came into office to $1 billion when we left&mdash;12 months ago. You have broken your promises and your commitment to child care, and Australian families are just beginning to feel the pain. Add to that what many families will have to pay for increases in Medicare, for dental services for which they previously did not have to pay and for increased costs for pharmaceuticals. All of those things will make families already reporting that they do not feel secure and comfortable increasing anxious about living in this country with the government that we now have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the next little while families will be much less comfortable than they are now, Senator Ellison. They will be feeling that because you are introducing policies which are not family friendly and which, as we approach International Women's Day, are certainly not kind to women. They are insulting to women because you are presuming that women cannot do the sums. They can, and they do not add up for Australian families.</PARA></SPEECH>

Dr Wooldridge has introduced a policy which has been accepted by a wide range of people in the community.

It is a very smart carrot and stick approach to encourage people to have their children vaccinated.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Crowley said that Mr Howard did not tell the Australian public that we were going to give money to private health. It was very clearly stated in our policy that we would be assisting families to take out private health insurance. Mr Beazley got it absolutely wrong when he said that we were targeting the wealthy at the expense of the poor. Dr Wooldridge said that, if the Leader of the Opposition had bothered to read our policies let alone his own, he would see that this is not the case. Our incentives will be available to single people on incomes of $35,000 and to couples and families on incomes of up to 70,000. Those opposite do not even know what they are talking about. Mr Beazley got it wrong: we are not taking money to pay wealthy people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that I want to say is that people are voting with their feet. The health system was left in such disarray by the former Labor government that people are actually going to private hospitals and paying. There was a report yesterday on the radio about people having operations: about 70 per cent of cataract operations and minor knee surgery is now being undertaken in private hospitals by people who are actually paying for themselves to have the operations done. People are saying that they have to wait so long for this elective surgery because the system was left in such disarray that they are now choosing either to pay for themselves or to go through health insurance. Many of these people cannot afford to do this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing that Senator Crowley did not talk about was the fact that the pharmaceutical benefits scheme was growing at something like 17 per cent per annum, which is something like $2.3 billion. This was not sustainable. We could not continue to have the pharmaceutical benefits scheme exploding at that rate. It was unsustainable. But no, Labor did not take the hard decisions. They 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> left it and kept borrowing. They sold the Commonwealth Bank and used that money; they sold Qantas and used that money. Borrow, borrow, borrow.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak on the issue of child care. What we have heard today from Senator Patterson, Senator Ellison and others is really quite astounding in its hypocrisy. Only last year, prior to the budget, we heard Senator Newman say, `This is all just scaremongering. You are concerning the parents of Australia on child care. You will have to wait until the budget to see exactly what our position is.' Well, Senator Newman, we waited and we saw exactly what this government's position was on child care. You cut half a billion dollars out of it and families right around Australia are paying the price for those cuts right now. Child care has increased by $20 to $25 per child. You have implemented a whole raft of measures that have made child care more inaccessible and more unaffordable for parents, whether it is in community day care centres or in association with family day care, with some of the cuts and restrictions to child&hyphen;care assistance relating to hours and the number of children, and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So you can expect us to stand over here and understand why we are asking exactly the same questions, when it is quite clear, from the documents that we have spoken of this afternoon, that this government intends to cut another $400 million out of that child&hyphen;care budget&mdash;nearly the same amount as last year. We are going to see nearly a mirroring effect of those restrictions on access and affordability of child care. We are going to see it all over again. It causes me&mdash;and all of us on this side of the chamber&mdash;to speculate as to where you are going to find these cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year you left family day care alone in terms of the operational subsidy. Is that going to be the government's target this time around? You engineered the strategy and we heard the plaintive cry from Senator Newman and others, `You are scaremongering; you are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1462"> scaremongering.' Well, family day care managed to hang on to its operational subsidy last year. Is this government prepared to come in here and say once again that family day care operational subsidy is going to be preserved? We have a very real fear that it is not. Our fears are justified by the fact that the words that we heard prior to last year's budget are exactly the same words that we are hearing now in the lead&hyphen;up to this year's budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will have to excuse our cynicism on the Labor side of politics. We understand and we know how necessary it is for women and families to have access to child care. It is not just a family welfare issue or an entitlements issue. It is about jobs, and it is about access to the work force that women in particular have. What happens if women cannot feel secure about their child&hyphen;care arrangements and cannot afford to put their children in care? My nature, as a parent, suggests that I do not have any other option. I would stay at home to look after my children, and not go back into the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you are doing is manipulating the situation that working parents are facing by making it tough for them. You are forcing them to take on hard decisions such as: can I afford to work; is it worth the psychological hassle of going to work if I cannot provide the sort of child care that I want to provide for my children?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The policies that have come forth to date from this government have reinforced this view and it is with the most bitter irony that this paper has exposed this government's policy at a time so close to International Women's Day. This government has no record to speak of when it comes to women entering the work force or having accessible and affordable child care. There is no record there. There is no claim. And it disturbs me greatly to hear Senator Newman stand up so boldly and so blatantly and say that the coalition has actually done something for working families in this area. It is not true. The proof of the pudding was in last year's budget, and I am gravely concerned that this will only be reinforced in the coming budget.</PARA>

What the community really wants is leadership, and that is what it has got with a range of reforms on both health and choice in child care. Today, I asked the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) a question about the incredible success of Australia's firearm law reforms and buyback scheme, and that is really just another example of peace of mind for Australians and health and safety in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>

There can be no doubt that the gun reform and gun control has made all Australians feel a little safer, a little more confident in their communities and healthier in the outcomes that they are now able to point to that the government has delivered.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a point of order, Mr Deputy President. My concerns may have been allayed.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2M6">Senator COONAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The pharmaceutical benefits service shows, firstly, that outlays grew from $2.433 billion in the 1995-96 budget to $2.637 billion in the 1996-97 budget, so it is still increasing. It is simply nonsense to suggest that there have been cuts in the pharmaceutical benefits service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1463">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look across the initiatives and benefits in health reform you find, for instance, that the government has corporatised and is corporatising the Australian Government Health Service to make it more efficient. The government has pledged&mdash;it is very difficult not to say that this has been said ad nauseam, but apparently it is necessary to keep on saying it, Senator Ellison&mdash;to retain Medicare. It is difficult to know why there are so many doubts about this on the other side. The community has accepted that Medicare is being retained. I think I have to say it again: it will be kept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing about health strategy is that the government has actually looked at the real health needs across Australia. The previous government did absolutely nothing substantial about the appalling needs of health in rural Australia. At least this government has looked at the appalling lack of medical services in rural regions. It has looked at the fact that no doctors seem to want to go there. Few doctors who graduate want to do the hard yards out there in the bush&mdash;out there where the problems are great and where people have little ability to access proper health care. The rural doctors strategy will at least try to ensure that people in the bush get access to proper health care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other matter of great significance that has arisen is that the appalling lack of immunity amongst Australian children is actually being attacked in a way that will minimise the number of children who are not immunised against preventable diseases that cause huge outbreaks and problems in a population that is not immunised. This is being done in a way that encourages parents to see the great value of vaccinating their children. There is absolutely nothing forced about this; it is still voluntary. The great good sense of having children immunised ought to be clear to all concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lundy spoke about child care. There is  absolutely no doubt that the whole of the health care initiatives have been directed to delivering to families a tax initiative that will enable them to actually take out private health insurance.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators will recall the sadness and dismay with which the nation heard the news of the accident at the High Range Training Area near Townsville shortly after dusk on 12 June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The accident occurred during an exercise to practise the recovery of Australian citizens held hostage by armed terrorists. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Six Black Hawk helicopters and 24 aircrew from the 5th Aviation Regiment and 43 soldiers of the Special Air Service were conducting a live-fire airmobile assault on a simulated terrorist position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the formation reached the target zone, two helicopters collided. The lead helicopter crashed to the ground upside down and was consumed by fire. The second helicopter entered a flat spin before crash landing in an upright position. It too was destroyed by fire.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eighteen Australian servicemen perished and a further 12 were injured&mdash;some critically. Equipment worth $37 million was destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were heroic acts in the face of this terrible accident. The reaction at the crash scene was cool headed, courageous and swift.  Despite the confusion of the collision and the crash and the danger of flames and exploding ammunition, those at the scene acted quickly and decisively to evacuate the injured.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that the Army will be proposing a number of awards to recognise brave and conspicuous service in the immediate aftermath of the accident.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The professional response of local ADF units, the Queensland Emergency Service, the Queensland Police and staff at Townsville General Hospital undoubtedly saved further lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence Department acted swiftly to ensure that the injured survivors and the families of those who lost their lives were paid such compensation and provided with as much ancillary support as existing legislation allowed. This was done as quickly as was possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know from letters which have been sent to me that the sensitive assistance of  family support bodies and the overwhelming support of the Australian community were of great comfort to the families of the victims, to their comrades and to those close to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was the largest peacetime disaster to strike our armed forces since the Voyager collision of 1964.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, the training activities which so unfortunately culminated in this accident are essential to our national security.  This is particularly true with just three years remaining before the Sydney Olympic Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Training for counter terrorism operations is inherently dangerous. It takes our forces to the cutting edge of capability. It demands degrees of speed, stealth, precision, accuracy and lethality beyond those required of any other element of the Army.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But such training also demands a careful balance between safety and realism. This can only be achieved through meticulous military preparation and planning and the execution of a staged progres 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1465"> sion of training which reflects the difficulty and danger of the task to be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This need to balance safety and realism is at the heart of the report which I will table today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the accident, the Chief of Army, Lieutenant General John Sanderson appointed a military Board of Inquiry. The Board was required to establish the primary and contributory causes of the accident and to make recommendations to prevent another tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it was also to make recommendations in relation to possible disciplinary action, the Board was not constituted as a court and had no powers or authority to make findings in relation to offences under the Defence Force Discipline Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the exception of matters concerning national security, the Inquiry was open to the public. The survivors and the next of kin and families of those who lost their lives were provided Commonwealth funding to attend the hearings and received legal representation as required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board of Inquiry was extensive and thorough. It conducted hearings in Perth, Townsville and Sydney over a period of three months. It took evidence from 144 witnesses, accepted 215 written exhibits and considered numerous instructions, correspondence and statements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board's Report, which was submitted to the Chief of Army on 20 December last year, reflects this thoroughness. It comprises more than seven thousand pages in seventeen volumes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since submission to the Chief of Army, the Board's finding and recommendations have been studied in detail by technical and legal experts within the Army and the Department of Defence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These experts have confirmed the adequacy of the Board's Report and advised on corrective action to minimise the probability of further accidents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These recommendations form the basis of the Chief of Army's Report which was submitted to me last week.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his report, General Sanderson addresses the findings of the Board of Inquiry, the advice of the panel of experts and, most importantly,  the steps to be taken to reduce the risk of further accidents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board found that the immediate cause of the accident was that the lead helicopter, Black 1, turned right and converged on an adjacent helicopter, Black 2.  As a result, Black 1 struck Black 2 with multiple rotor blade strikes causing both aircraft to crash and be destroyed by fire.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But, as is almost always the case with accidents of this nature, the events immediately preceding the accident do not stand in isolation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board found that while there was no single reason for the tragedy, there was a chain of events 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that successively and cumulatively led to a situation where the accident became what the Board describes as the inevitable outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the early stages of the Board's proceedings, there was a good deal of speculation about the causes of the crash. At that time and until today, the Government took the position that it would not comment on matters before the Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The findings of the Board clearly dismiss some of the more widely speculated causes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There were <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">no</EMPHASIS>  mechanical defects in the Black Hawk helicopters involved. In fact the aircraft's design unquestionably prevented a greater death toll;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The accident was <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">not</EMPHASIS>  caused by unserviceable night vision goggles; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">No shots</EMPHASIS>  were fired in or at any aircraft which were causal to the accident, nor was there any ordnance explosion  prior to the collision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board identified 16 directly causative and a further 26 contributing factors. It found a linkage between these factors, although it did not place a separate weighting on each of them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board found a number of long term systemic factors which contributed to the accident.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among them:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Black Hawk aircraft had a high rate of unserviceability in the two years leading up to the accident.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> High pilot separation rates over a similar period had further eroded the bank of experience at the 5th Aviation Regiment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These factors clearly affected the experience levels among Black Hawk crews and prevented them from gaining sufficient flying experience for special counter terrorism operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More immediate factors arose from the planning, preparation, rehearsal and conduct of the exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among these:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The planning for the air mission on the night of the accident was found by the Board to be inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There was inadequate information about the objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There was a failure on the part of aircrew adequately to resolve conflicting understanding of the location of specific targets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The conduct of the night mission differed from that of the day mission and there was no rehearsal of those changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Flight Lead in Black 1 lacked experience in leading special recovery missions. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1466">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On their own, none of these factors directly caused the accident. But the Board found that as a train of events, they, in addition to other causes, cumulatively contributed to a situation where the accident became inevitable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The function of the Board was not merely to determine the cause of the crash, but also to identify areas for remedial action to reduce the risk of further accidents. This aspect is of the greatest importance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board made 79 recommendations, many of which require the Australian Defence Force to implement and adhere to best practice procedures. These recommendations will help ensure a safer environment and assist in preventing a recurrence of the circumstances which led to this accident.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of the accident, I made clear our determination that all possible measures were to be taken to ameliorate risk without compromising capability. Accordingly, the Chief of Army has developed a plan to implement the Board's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plan addresses systemic and equipment issues, and proposes measures to improve command, control and exercise planning as well as changes to training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To stem separation rates, the Army is reviewing the employment and conditions of service of its aircrew.   Measures so far taken include the introduction of a Pilot Retention Bonus, increasing return of service obligations and increasing the numbers of trainee Army pilots.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Army is ensuring that qualified flying instructors can be better employed in operational units by contracting out some of the less demanding pilot instruction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Action has been taken to place all counter terrorism and special recovery elements within the same command structure, with all outcomes now being the responsibility of the Land Commander.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Army is reviewing the training requirements for counter terrorism and special recovery operations. This will establish a training sequence to overcome the erosion of combined skills which had previously occurred between biennial special recovery exercises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New directives will be issued to ensure that the command and control, planning, intelligence gathering, orders and briefings, conduct of missions and training requirements which were recommended by the Board are specified for future Special Forces operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The acquisition of proximity warning devices, improved night vision goggles and redesigned fast roping and rappelling devices is being evaluated. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Crash data recorders will be fitted to all Army aircraft as a matter of priority and to Black Hawk helicopters as a matter of urgency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have directed the Chief of Army, as the responsible commander, to provide me with monthly reports on the progress of the implementation plan and on the status and safety of counter terrorism training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, I have asked the Chief of the Defence Force, General John Baker, to establish an overarching Defence Force Flying Safety Authority, under the Chief of Air Force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This authority will be responsible for the supervision of all flying safety issues for the Defence Force, regardless of the Service operating individual types of aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the issue of whether disciplinary action is to be taken against any individual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with its Terms of Reference, the Board recommended that disciplinary action be considered against five members in relation to negligence, deficiencies in the exercise of command and errors of judgement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chief of Army has considered these recommendations and has taken advice from the Army's Legal Branch.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of advice to him, the Chief of Army has referred the Board's Report and the legal advice to the Land Commander Australia, whom he  has appointed as a Convening Authority, to consider whether or not to prefer charges under the Defence Force Discipline Act against three persons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Chief of Army has decided to take administrative action against two other personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until the matters of military discipline are properly determined by the Convening Authority, it would be quite inappropriate to disclose the names or appointments of any persons facing administrative action or referred to the Convening Authority, or to disclose details of offences which might  be pursued against individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this reason, some of the findings and recommendations which could lead to possible disciplinary action have been expunged from the Report which I will table today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the responsibility of the Convening Authority to decide whether military charges are to be laid. I expect the Chief of Army to announce the decision of the Convening Authority within a month.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can inform the House, however, that as a result of requests for advice by the Department, separate advice has been received from the Queensland and Commonwealth Directors of Public Prosecutions that, based on the Board's Report, no criminal charges would arise from the accident. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1467">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, for some time the Government has been considering the issue of the adequacy of the compensation and rehabilitation benefits available to members of the ADF.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Military service is distinctly different from civilian employment. It often involves considerably more dangerous activities which may result in severe injury or death. It therefore warrants distinct rehabilitation and compensation arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for a review of military compensation was brought into sharper focus by the Black Hawk accident. In particular, it has become quite clear that parts of the existing peacetime compensation and rehabilitation scheme for ADF personnel are inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel ordered a review of existing rehabilitation and compensation arrangements for military personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review was to investigate compensation arrangements for military personnel including the adequacy of the lump sum payments, ancillary benefits and supporting services for dependants of deceased personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was to also examine the different entitlements that accrue to members of the ADF for death or severe injury suffered during peacetime service under the Veterans' Entitlements Act or the Military Compensation Scheme as well as the administrative arrangements involved when members are covered by both schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This review is to report  to Mrs Bishop very shortly and will be subject to consideration by Cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing we can do will fully compensate for the loss of those 18 Australian servicemen.  All of us have been affected by this tragedy. But I hope some consolation can be found in the knowledge that those who perished did so in the service of their country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Defence Force has set in train sound, logical and decisive steps to ensure that counter terrorism and special recovery operations can be conducted for the protection of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The training and preparation of our counter terrorism forces will continue to be as demanding and realistic as is safely possible. We must maintain our cutting edge capability in counter terrorism operations.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1996&hyphen;97, appropriations totalling $363,000 additional to those made in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1996&hyphen;97 are sought for recurrent expenditures of the Parliamentary Departments. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increases sought relate primarily to an increase in the `Provision for Running Costs Borrowings' for each of the Departments of the Senate and the House of Representatives from $50,000 to $200,000 to enhance their access to the borrowing arrangements under the running cost rules. In addition, the appropriations for the citizenship visits program for both the Senate and the House of Representatives have been supplemented by slightly more than 5 per cent over the provision made when the Budget was prepared.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 1996-97</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), which I shall introduce shortly, comprise the Additional Estimates for 1996&hyphen;97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these bills, Parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1996&hyphen;97 under Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1 and 2) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additional appropriations in these three bills total some $1,402 million; $930 million is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3), $471 million in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) and less than half a million dollars in the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amounts are partly offset by savings in the appropriations made by Appropriation Acts (Nos. 1 and 2) 1996&hyphen;97. Reflecting the Government's determination to improve the efficiency of continuing programs, these savings, amounting to $343 million in gross terms, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document "Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations", which has been distributed to Honourable Members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After allowing for prospective savings, the total appropriations sought represent a net increase of $1,059 million in appropriations for 1996&hyphen;97, an increase of about three per cent on the amounts made available through the annual appropriations at the time of the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the main areas for which the Government seeks additional provisions in the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1996&hyphen;97 to meet payments for the ordinary annual services of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Running costs appropriations provide for the recurrent and minor capital costs of agencies in providing Government services. The total supplementation for running costs for all departments and agencies (including Defence military and civilian personnel) of $111 million represents an increase 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1469"> of less than one per cent on the funding for running costs included in Appropriation Act (No. 1).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A principal factors contributing to this increase are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">borrowings against the forward estimates and some additional funding for departments associated with workload changes provided for under the running costs arrangements; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a change in the funding arrangements for the Australian Customs Service as a result of the decision to implement some trade related charges through taxation legislation rather than user charging.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Gross additional estimates of some $93 million are sought for the Defence Portfolio in Appropriation Bill (No. 3). This figure includes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$29 million for compensation and legal expenses which comprises:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$17 million for compensation associated with the Cockatoo Island Dockyard; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$12 million for a range of other claims;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$40 million for Equipment and Stores largely related to increased purchases of fuel for joint exercises with the United States. This increase will be offset by recoveries of costs from the United States; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$10 million for Facilities Operations reflecting an increased provision for repairs and maintenance and minor new works activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increases have been partly offset by reductions elsewhere in the Defence annual appropriations, giving a net increase of some $76 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) includes provision for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$42 million for medical services for veterans reflecting an increased demand for those services together with the clearance of a claims backlogs associated with the transfer of claims processing to the Health Insurance Commission in December 1995;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$12 million for pharmaceutical services for veterans attributable to a delay in the introduction of a two (from four) card treatment entitlement system;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$14 million for increased lump sum and pension payments for former State railways employees;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$39 million for capital assistance for residential facilities for older people reflecting an acceleration in building activity in this area and the Commonwealth's obligation to make progressive payments as projects are developed;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$27 million additional funding for the Health Insurance Commission largely reflecting:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">increased funding for the Double Dipping Initiative; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">higher administrative costs associated with changes to the Child Care Cash Rebate payments to higher 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> income families as a result of the decision to reduce the rebate payments for families above the Family Tax Initiative income cutoff; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">$510m associated with the assumption of the debt of the Australian National Railways Commission preparatory to its sale. This payment to the Australian National Railways Commission. is classified as an advance and it will be offset by an equivalent receipt by the Commonwealth in 1996&hyphen;97 of a debt repayment from the Australian National Railways Commission. There will therefore be no impact on either the headline or underlying deficit as a result of these transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The balance of some $84 million in the amount included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) is made up of minor variations across a range of programs in most departments and agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These additional appropriations are required to meet undertakings made by the Government since the Budget, as well as economic parameter changes since the Budget was prepared.</PARA>

The proposed appropriations are required to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures for which provision was not made in the Budget appropriation measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additions are necessitated by certain cost and price increases which have occurred since the Budget, together with other commitments that have been made by the Government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate congratulates the Premier of Queensland, Mr Borbidge, for his quintessential summary of the political philosophy of the National Party of Australia into 12 words: `there are some little tricks that can be played around the edges'.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This comment of the Premier of Queensland, Mr Borbidge, is to do with his now infamous statement that, if there was a casual vacancy created in the Senate by the resignation of the Deputy President, Senator Colston, he would not stick to the spirit of the constitution of Australia and appoint a Labor senator to fill the vacancy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His quite infamous remarks have been criticised and condemned across most sections of Australian politics. Even in Queensland the Liberal coalition partners led by Mrs Sheldon have refused to confirm that they would be party to such a breach of the constitution. Mr Howard has made it clear that he believes that if a vacancy was caused by the resignation of the Deputy President, Senator Colston, the person filling that vacancy, in accordance with the amendment of the constitution of 1977 as well as in accordance with the spirit of it, would be from the Labor Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every editorial in Australia written on this issue and every commentator who has talked about this issue since Mr Borbidge made those infamous remarks last weekend have strongly criticised him and pointed out in various tough words that he is either a constitutional vandal or just a dill or a dope.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was referring to the premier of another state. I accept, Mr Deputy President, your advice and I will be cautious about my remarks. But, as you would be fully aware, there has been almost universal condemnation of the views of the Premier of Queensland on this matter. That has led Senator Ray, on behalf of the opposition, to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1471"> put this motion on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>  and for us to seek to debate it today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The National Party&mdash;and its predecessor, the Country Party&mdash;has a long history of ripping up conventions and twisting the rules whenever it wants to get a political advantage. That has been the case over its history, since it was formed in the early 1920s in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the history of this party and its role in Australian politics, you see that other people have made comments about it that sum it up. Billy Hughes, a former Prime Minister, during his 50 years in the federal parliament, from 1901 to 1951, had been a representative of the Labor Party; the Conservative Party, called the National Party in the 1920s, which has no connection to the present National Party; the United Australia Party; and the Liberal Party. That is four parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he was near his retirement, he was asked, `Billy, you've been in every party in Australian history except the Country Party. Why didn't you join the Country Party?' His very famous retort was, `You've got to draw the line somewhere.' Billy Hughes had been in every other political party&mdash;the Liberal Party, the Labor Party, the National Party and the United Australia Party. That sums up his view of the old&hyphen;style Country Party, now the National Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another very famous remark about the role of the National Party, the then Country Party, in Australia was in 1974, when there was a suggestion floated that the then DLP in its decline may merge with the Country Party to form a new third party. Mr Snedden, the then Leader of the Opposition, was quoted as saying, `Who's churching the old whore now?' He was clearly referring to the description of the church in relation to the history of the DLP and its strong support from sections of the Roman Catholic Church. That leaves no-one in any misunderstanding that the party he was calling `the old whore' was in fact his then coalition partner, the Country Party, which subsequently became the National Party.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this party has a dreadful history of being opportunistic and of walking around like a bunch of old boys with a gladstone bag full of money to hand out to its supporters, its 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> friends, and to bribe people. That has been the style of that party. Of course it came to its apogee in the period of the National Party government of Queensland under Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen from the late 1960s to when it was finally chucked out in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact I think in Western politics the only analogy to the performance of the National Party in Queensland and that period is probably the Hughie Long democrat party in Louisiana. Certainly Joh Bjelke-Petersen in every way fitted the populism of Hughie Long in the 1920s and 1930s. Hughie Long was assassinated. He was replaced some years later by another `Long'&mdash;Earl Long&mdash;as governor of Louisiana. I think Earl Long probably is more on a parallel with the performance of Mr Borbidge today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earl Long of course recently got some late fame when Paul Newman made a film called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blaze</EMPHASIS>, which is the story of Earl Long as governor of Louisiana falling in love with a stripper and being tried to be committed to an insane asylum while he was governor. I think the performance of Mr Borbidge last weekend, trying to rip up the constitution of Australia, is the equivalent of Earl Long ending up in an insane asylum by falling in love with a stripper. That is the level of this party and Mr Borbidge in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be interesting to see how well some of the Liberal Party members from Queensland will want to defend Mr Borbidge, if they are game to. Their own Liberal leader in Queensland, Mrs Sheldon, has not supported Mr Borbidge on this issue of trying to rort a vacancy if it were caused by the resignation of Senator Colston. I point out that Mr Borbidge has just ignored Mrs Sheldon's lack of support and has gone on with his business of saying, `We're going to look at every trick in the book,' as the motion says, `to try to rort the constitution.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been an absolutely astonishing performance. As I said before, he is either a constitutional vandal or just stupid in not understanding what is in the constitution. The constitution was amended in 1977. That amendment was overwhelmingly carried, as I understand it, by every state and was sup 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1472"> ported by all the major political parties. Section 15 of the constitution says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a vacancy at any time occurred in the place of a senator chosen by the people of the state and at the time he was so chosen he was publicly recognised by a particular political party as being an endorsed candidate of that party and publicly represented himself to be such a candidate, a person chosen or appointed under this section in consequence of that vacancy or in consequence of that vacancy and a subsequent vacancy or vacancies shall, unless there is no member of that party available to be chosen or appointed, be a member of that party.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You do not have to be a lawyer to understand that section of the constitution. That amendment was overwhelmingly voted for by the people of Australia in 1977, after the disgraceful performance of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen and the National Party in Queensland in 1975 when they did not follow the 75-year convention in Australia that a senator, for whatever reason they have left the Senate, should be replaced by a senator of the same political party. Senator Colston, you were an absolute victim of that process of ripping up the convention by Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen in 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that by 1977 even the Fraser government&mdash;the beneficiary of that vacancy being created and not being filled by the Labor appointee, Senator Colston&mdash;was willing to put this in the constitution to make it clear that it could never happen again. There was another attempt to get around this constitutional requirement in 1987 when the Groom Liberal government of Tasmania refused to appoint a replacement for Senator Don Grimes when he retired. Senator Devereux subsequently became a senator. Senator Devereux was nominated by the Labor Party and refused to be appointed&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If you read it properly, you would see that it is clearly Senator Colston's statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to point out that, since the infamous words of Mr Borbidge last Sunday when he was told he could not break the constitution, he is now suggesting that, if there is a casual vacancy caused by your resignation, Senator Colston, he would leave it vacant for a while. He would not necessarily be forced to fill it. Yesterday, Mr Terry Mackenroth, the Acting Opposition Leader in Queensland, pointed out that, under standing order No. 331 of the Queensland parliament, they have just two weeks to vote on a nominee for a casual Senate vacancy from the time the parliament is notified of it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1473">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Borbidge is even breaking up his own rule book, the standing orders of the parliament of which he is Premier. If a vacancy occurs, he is trying not only to subvert the constitution of Australia, which is illegal, but to subvert the standing orders of his own parliament. This man goes to no ends and that is why it is most appropriate that Senator Ray moved a motion relating to those 12 words&mdash;`There are some little tricks that can be played around the edges'. If he is going to play around the edges, he is giving an example that he wants to break the rule book everywhere&mdash;not just convention but the full rule book.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear. Section 15 of the constitution is explicit. The standing orders of the Queensland parliament are quite clear. If by some chance you resign, Mr Deputy President, your vacancy should and must be filled by a Labor nominee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next thing I want to point out about Mr Borbidge is that there has been some press speculation over the last two or three weeks up until last weekend that you, Senator Colston, may resign from the Senate. However, this was raised by Mr Borbidge, not by us. It was raised openly by him. He is actually suggesting that it is an open and shut case that you, Sir, will have to resign from the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does he know anything that we do not know. He has raised the issue as the National Party Premier of Queensland. That is the thing that ought to be noted, not that we raised it, in the way that he did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have put questions on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, Mr Deputy President, that you are aware of. We have asked questions in estimates committees quite appropriately. He went for the king hit. Basically, I think he is starting to agree that you may have to resign or you would resign. I do not know what he knows. But, if it happens, he says the Labor Party cannot fill the vacancy. It is a disgraceful performance by Mr Borbidge. It is in line with the good old boys in the 70-year history of the Country Party-National Party in this country. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From preparing my remarks for today, I have to say that consistency has never been a great trait of the National Party in Australian politics. Senator Colston, when you resigned from the Labor Party, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen said on 22 August 1996 that he and Lady Flo had respected Senator Colston for a very long time. `He was a very good citizen. I respect Mr Colston very much. He has played a very quiet but very important supportive role over the years,' Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen said. `He has completely won my confidence.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, way back when Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen was Premier on the 7 October 1976 and when Senator Colston raised a matter in the parliament about the share dealings of company structures in Queensland that could affect the then Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, Mr Bjelke-Petersen said, `Senator Colston had literally picked up his information out of the gutter by quoting from an anonymous pamphlet circulating in Brisbane.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we see Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, who stopped your appointment in 1975 to this place, in 1996 saying what an outstanding citizen you are. That is not what he said against you in the Queensland parliament in regard to why you were not a suitable appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hypocrisy of the National Party in Queensland in this area is appalling. I think that ought to be noted. I do not want to go through all the quotes against Mr Borbidge that are in various newspapers, editorials and comments by people over the last four or five days. They are all well known and are now on the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is disappointing that only two days ago the Liberal&hyphen;National coalition would not support a motion guaranteeing the convention of pairs in the event that Mr Borbidge somehow got his way to delay a replacement. That is very disappointing, and it is something we will remember and take to the Australian people on every occasion possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that we have seen an extraordinary series of events. Mr Borbidge clearly is a National Party leader in the worst traditions of the white shoe brigade of Queensland&mdash;in the worst traditions of that group of support 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1474"> ers of the former Premier of Queensland Sir Joh Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen. I have used the nickname that they quite happily applied to themselves: the white shoe brigade. They got into every corrupt practice, destroyed good government in Queensland, ruptured everything to do with government tendering and convinced the Premier to pay money to his mates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We finally had the royal commission in that state and got evidence of brown paper bags being delivered by the white shoe brigade to the Queensland Premier. Of course, he then was charged with perjury and to be convicted needed a unanimous decision of the then jury&mdash;a jury of which, it has now been exposed, one if not two members belonged to the National Party and, having not declared themselves, used their numbers. So the vote was 10 to two in favour of conviction of perjury against Joh Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen because he had lied to the royal commission. He got off on a 10 to two vote. In my state and a number of others, on 10 to two he would have been convicted and would have received, I hope, a major sentence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the Premier who on evidence could not remember receiving brown paper bags with cash in them in the Premier's office. These were the good ole boys of the National Party/Country Party operating just as they have for 70 years, collecting money, dishing it out and being bribed to do certain deals for the favoured in their own political party. I would hope that the National Party members in this chamber do not defend that activity. No politician of any party should be able to get away with that. Sir Joh got away with it for 20&hyphen;odd years, until finally it got so rotten, so corrupt, in Queensland that his own party had to have a royal commission&mdash;and then it all spilt out. This is the party of the good ole boys, as I have described them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you go back in the history of the Country Party/National Party, that is the way they have always operated in Queensland&mdash;and not only in Queensland but in Australia. When they get half a chance, they will fiddle the system, corrupt the system and bring good government and the political system into disrepute. Fortunately, I think in the federal parliament the National Party is under some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> control. But give them unlimited control, as they had in Queensland, and they will just take the lot and distribute it amongst their favoured supporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite appropriate that we debate Senator Robert Ray's motion here today on behalf of the opposition. It is a very simple motion of 12 words which, as he says, quintessentially sum up the political philosophy of the National Party of Australia, formerly the Country Party of Australia. We should remind the people of Australia from time to time that that is not good in the national interests. I will conclude on those words from Mr Borbidge: there are some little tricks that can be played around the edges. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that there was a big change overnight. Yesterday, Senator Ray was in full force. He was going to come in here and take Senator Colston to the cleaners, because that is what the Labor Party is all about&mdash;revenge and personal vilification. But Senator Ray quite sensibly saw the pasting, the absolute pasting, he got in the papers today, and he scuttled out backwards as fast as he could. And what have those opposite done? They have put in poor old fall guy Senator Schacht, getting down towards Z on their speakers list. That just demonstrates what the Labor Party think of this today.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The media have done what we and the rest of Australia, I might say, have done and seen it for just what it is. I cannot help but quote the first paragraph of Piers Akerman's excellent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>. It says:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht, before he scuttled out of the chamber, made an allegation about me. He said, `Senator Macdonald, you are not one of these people who love the National Party. You don't like them.' I can tell you this: back in the bad old days, I was one of the ones that stood up to them, for historical reasons that are long since gone. So my record is clear about those years. Let me tell you this: the National Party that is in control in Queensland today is an excellent party and one that I support absolutely 100 per cent. I have the very highest regard for Mr Rob Borbidge. I think he will go down as one of Queensland's best premiers. He is certainly a very caring and compassionate person, a person who is particularly learned and intelligent and understanding and who understands what needs to be done. He leads a very good party in the National Party and he leads an excellent coalition of the Queensland National and Liberal parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I don't see any Queenslanders among you people over there. Where are all the Queensland senators? Where are they? I'm sorry, Senator Gibbs, but you are too nice to be here. It is tremendous to see the Borbidge&hyphen;Sheldon government in Queensland because for the first time in a very, very, very long time we have an honest, open and accountable 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1476"> government that is doing decent things, good things, for Queenslanders. It is a government that has got Queensland moving again after six years of Labor holding it back.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say in response to Senator Schacht earlier on that Mr Borbidge, when there was an allegation made about a poor deal between his police minister and the police union, was the first one to insist it go to the CJC. By way of historical result, the CJC has completely cleared Mr Cooper. But it was Mr Borbidge who insisted that it go there because that was the honest and decent thing to do. So I have the greatest respect for Mr Borbidge and for the job that he is doing in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want to talk about rorts, what was this about the Labor Premier of Western Australia? He was offered $300,000 by Yosse Goldberg. He, a Labor Premier, sent it back and said he wanted $100,000 in cash. And you have the hypocrisy to talk about Mr Borbidge, an honest, god&hyphen;fearing, Christian man, when $100,000 was given&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, $300,000. But he sent the cheque back. He wanted $100,000 in nice, crisp green notes&mdash;and we know what that was for. I do not want to vilify a politician in any other chamber, but I might say that the Western Australian Supreme Court has indicated that that was a bribe; it was a pay&hyphen;off; it was daylight robbery. I think it even found it was robbing the Labor Party. You fools support him robbing your own party! And you have the hide and hypocrisy to come in here. What happened in Western Australia with the $100,000 worth of crisp green notes in cash is nothing new for the Labor Party. Their history is one litany of those sorts of things. I do not want to go back into history, but we can just go back to `Red Ted' Theodore. Remember `Red Ted' Theodore, the old Labor Premier of Queensland? He was prosecuted for getting a bit of the old stuff from mining back when he was Treasurer of the state. So it is nothing new for the Labor Party in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>

There are a lot of people over there who just do not really like the venom that is coming out of the Labor Party. Certainly Kim Beazley does not like it.</PARA>

If for one moment there were any truth in the allegations that Senator Ray has been making, then how hypocritical he would be, because all of the allegations relate to the time when Kim Beazley&mdash;Mr Beazley&mdash;was in charge.

She says things such as `less wise', `wild bitter rhetoric' and `his over the top performance'. We all know that. Some elements of the Labor Party want to inflict that rage and hatred and bile on what was one of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I enter this debate because it is really time that we stood up to the bullyboys. You will notice there are a couple of them on the other side. They have disappeared from this debate, but they are big people. They have loud voices. When they cannot win on their argument, they shout you down like the bullyboys of old.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Acting Deputy President, as you are from New South Wales, you probably do not know that the Townsville <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> reports that there is, at this very time, a federal police investigation going on into allegations not about branch stacking&mdash;because that happens all the time now with the Labor Party&mdash;but about fraud on the electoral roll perpetrated by people associated with the preselection of Labor candidates Mayor Mooney, who wanted

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to be that $100,000 is the going rate amongst politicians, although I have to say that Graham Richardson came much cheaper, and I say this more in humour. Graham Richardson reports in his book that he was able to be bought off by an entry to the Golden Wing lounge by Sir Peter Abeles, so he came cheaply.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Party never boots anybody out, but that is another story. So let me tell you some of the story that will illustrate the motion we have before us this afternoon. It does illustrate the political philosophy of the National Party in Australia. That is why I think it is worth going back in history. Although obviously in Senator Robert Ray's mind there is the issue of whether or not there should be replacements 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1479"> of senators by people from the same party, there is a whole lot of other history besides this issue which I think is useful to put on the record. In 1975 I was the Methodist minister at Mount Larcom in Central Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no church there now.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. That is exactly right. The church is not there because of what the National Party did. That is the point I want to make&mdash;exactly the point, because they will oppress anybody who gets in their road. Not only were they members of my church; they were members of the National Party as well, but they happened to be in the road. They were dairy farmers. But the National Party decided that it was going to remove dairy farmers because it wanted the area to be mined for limestone. So the dairy farmers tried for months to get somebody to listen to them and nobody would. Finally, the minister for mines, Mr Camm, came to Mount Larcom and I went to the meeting. Those dairy farmers simply copped an hour or two of abuse from him. I was amazed because I really had not had much to do with politics before. I thought, `These are people who belong to the National Party. What is going on?'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyway, after some more months of trying to get someone to listen, they were told that they could appeal to the mining warden's court. So these National Party members, dairy farmers, got together about $9,000, which in 1975 was a considerable amount of money. They were told they could go to the mining warden's court, so they did. They spent a week in the mining warden's court telling their story. The mining warden said, `I reserve judgment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">About three or four weeks later the day for judgment was about to arrive but, the day before, the mining warden was told by the National Party government, `Sorry, the advice 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that you have given and taken is only for the government. We are not going to let you tell all those people who appeared before the court the result of all the effort they put in. We are simply going to issue the licence to mine and you can go jump in the lake.' I can tell you that that is what they had to do. That is how the National Party treat their people and people who were members of my congregation. All of these people have gone but I can tell you this: none of them vote National Party any more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you about a current issue, the Wik issue. Let me give you some of the story of the Wik people, people who live mostly in and around the township of Aurukun in Far North Queensland. In 1975&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a lot of stories to tell. Stop interrupting. At midnight, the National Party government passed an act called the Aurukun Associates Act. This act was to enable Comalco to take over thousands of hectares of Aboriginal reserve land. That act was challenged in the Supreme Court of Queensland by the Aboriginal community, the Wik people. Their appeal was upheld. The Queensland government took them to the High Court. The appeal of the Aboriginal people was upheld once again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Queensland government then took them to the Privy Council in London and, on a legal technical matter, which was that the minister for Aboriginal affairs had absolute authority to do whatever he liked, with no appeal&mdash;that was the act in those days&mdash;despite the fact that the Supreme Court of Queensland and the High Court of Australia had found in favour of the Aboriginal people, the Privy Council upheld that appeal. These are the people who have tried every way to get justice. That is the kind of justice the National Party government delivered to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1977, when I was Uniting Church director for social responsibility, I went with Rev. Gordon Coutts to see the director for Aboriginal and islander affairs, Mr Killoran. We had heard that, in one case after 70 years and in another case after 100 years, the Uniting 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1480"> Church was going to be kicked out of administration of Aboriginal communities in Queensland, despite the fact that those communities had voted overwhelmingly to retain that administration. I went to see Mr Killoran with Rev. Coutts and we said, `Are these rumours true?' They said, `Oh, no. We wouldn't do that. Of course not! No way would we do that.' A couple of months later, in March 1978, the minister wrote to the Uniting Church. Although the church had administered those communities for almost 100 years, they were given three weeks to get out. These are the kinds of tricks this government gets up to. That is how it treats churches that get in their road. That is how it treats dairy farmers who get in their road. That is how it treats Aboriginal people who get in their road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you about Bob Katter, whom some people ridicule. He was the best Aboriginal affairs minister that the National Party ever had in Queensland, and that is saying a lot. The reason he was the best is that he got rid of Mr Killoran&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a member of the Liberal Party for a year in 1974 until I realised that they were not exactly liberal. Getting back to Johnny Koowarta, he applied with some other Aboriginal people to buy the Archer Bend cattle station. The vendor was very happy to sell it to him. It was a pastoral lease. I forget the fund from which the money was drawn, but the loan was approved and all was about to go ahead, because the vendor knew what a good cattleman Johnny Koowarta was, as were the other people who were forming the company that was to take it over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the change of lease came to be registered with the National Party government, they objected. The Uniting Church 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1481"> received copies of letters from the vendor. These letters were from the government to the vendor telling him that they had arranged with Comalco to take over the lease for a cattle property or for mining&mdash;or for whatever, as long as the Aborigines did not get it.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is right. So the government said, `No, we are not going to register this lease.' Why? `Because we are not going to allow Aboriginal people to own land in Queensland. There is no way that will happen.' Then the Human Rights Commission were called in and the National Party government decided it would challenge the Racial Discrimination Act in the High Court. This business went on for some years, but, when the National Party government realised it was going to lose in the High Court, what did it do? It changed the pastoral lease for Archer Bend into a national park so that when the High Court found in favour of Johnny Koowarta and threw out the appeal by the National Party government in Queensland, it was no longer possible for Johnny Koowarta to buy that property because the lease had been changed, out of pique and spite, by the government to prevent him from getting any title. When finally at the end of the process of about 10 years everything was cleared for him to buy it, by that time he had died.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are the kinds of tricks at the edges that many of us have had to put up with in Queensland. I agree with Senator Ian Macdonald.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Senator Boswell. This is best encapsulated and laid out in the dissenting report of the Northern Territory parliament's Public Accounts Committee, which I will quote from. I will not quote the report in its entirety but I will quote from the relevant sections of the report that lay out this story. The report says this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DISSENTING REPORT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Northern Territory Parliament Public Accounts Committee has again failed to carry out its duties. It is disappointing that CLP members of the PAC have again demonstrated their partisan participation with this committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this case when the issue of grants totalling $343,361 were made to a company owned by the then Speaker, now member for the Northern Territory's wife, the Committee refused to deal with the following issues;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. What were the procedures and processes behind the grant application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. What were the procedures and processes that led to the grants being approved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. What conditions and or outcomes were in place in relation to the awarding of these grants. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1482">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. What procedures were in place to monitor the financial accountability of both the transfer of funds and the acquittal of funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. What assessment was made into the quality of the product and what was the outcome and or benefit to the Northern Territory for this significant donation of taxpayers funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must be noted that while $82,000 was disclosed in DID's annual report the $261,361 was never made public in any annual reports, budget papers or press release. It should also be noted Mr Dondas and his wife had previously come under scrutiny by Parliament in relation to their financial dealings with the NT Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1993 a motion of censure was moved against Mr Dondas, the then Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. An action never before brought against a Speaker in the NT. The motion related to Sovereign Gold Enterprises Pty Ltd, a company owned by Mr and Mrs Dondas that had produced a coffee table book about the NT. The point at issue was the admission by Mr Dondas that not only was there a large amount of government advertisement in the book, around $200,000 to $300,000, he also admitted personally to soliciting advertising from government departments. This admission was only outdone by the admission that he not only then turned around and sold the book to government departments, he also used his position as Speaker to buy the books off himself to give away as protocol gifts! The faster he could get rid of a print run the quicker he could go back and collect the advertising money for the next edition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As would be expected, the censure motion was defeated on party lines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that the grant of $343,361 had occurred at around the same time as taxpayers' funds were going to the Dondas book.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You would therefore expect that when this second issue arose that potentially raised questions involving at least abnormal procedures in the approval of the grants through to potentially public corruption, you would expect the Committee to deal with it seriously. While Mr Dondas was not a shareholder or Director of North Australian Film Corporation (NAFC) the property he lived in was owned by NAFC and he did declare he had a beneficial interest in the property. With this in mind you would expect the PAC to undertake a thorough investigation of the issue so as to assure Parliament, and territory taxpayers, that what was a very unusual situation was in fact carried out in an appropriate and accountable manner. Only by carrying out a detailed investigation and reaching clear conclusions can the issues of favouritism and corruption be laid to rest one way or another. Mr Dondas is now Member for the Northern Territory, and it is a shame that the CLP members of the

<PARA STYLE="Para">and these are the facts relating to these tricks&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 28 March 1996 the PAC held a public hearing, one issue discussed was that of the International Project Management Unit (IPMU). The committee had requested IPMU to provide details of all projects that had been managed by IPMU. This was requested in order to give the committee an overview of IPMU's activities. During the hearings, questions were raised about a certain project involving IPMU and NAFC. The witnesses had not provided any information on this project, their excuse was that they had not considered it a project that fitted their specific definition of "managed" even though it would seem obvious to any reasonable person that the PAC's request for a briefing on all projects of IPMU was a wide ranging request and not a restricted request.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The specific omission of this particular project from the briefing raised Opposition concerns as this project involved grants to a company owned by the wife of the then Speaker of the NT Legislative Assembly and now member for the Northern Territory. The committee sought assurances that information regarding IPMU and NAFC would be provided, while this assurance was given in actual fact it never occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the March hearing the committee sought information from IPMU on a number of occasions. The committee seemed to be progressing very slowly and any attempts to reconvene the public hearing were resisted by government members. The committee did finally agree to call in the Auditor General to get advice on what documentation and evidence would be required to clarify the issues raised by the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor General gave clear information on what was required and what should be available to settle concerns about the propriety, process and outcome of a government decision to give over $340,000.00 in what could easily have been seen as a potential conflict of interest situation at least, and at worst outright political corruption.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the beginning of this report I outline what issues needed to be addressed I now detail those issues and the answers, to the best of my knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">What was the procedure and process behind the grant application?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was no procedure, at the most a direct verbal request.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">What was the procedure and process that led to the grants being approved?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within the confines of the Cabinet room CLP ministers gave $261,361 to the then Speaker's wife's company, illegally from the Trust Account, in such a way as to avoid any public or parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">3. What conditions and or outcomes were in place in relation to the awarding of these grants.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None. Even after the pilot program was shown to be a waste of money they approved a further $82,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">4. What procedures were in place to monitor the financial accountability of both the transfer of funds and the acquittal of funds.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None. While a single paragraph audit statement was provided, you would have to question the adequacy of this in light of the fact that this project was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 100% taxpayer funded to a private company for a project they initiated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">5. What assessment was made into the quality of the product and what was the outcome and or benefit to the Northern Territory for this significant donation of taxpayers funds.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only assessment provided said the product was very poor. As far as benefit to the Territory for this investment of taxpayers funds, there seems to be very little to show for it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any circumstances where special deals are done that don't go to tender, governments need to explain very carefully, and publicly.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I don't know who could argue with that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When grants are given that are not through the normal process, this must be explained even more carefully and publicly, and still may attract some criticism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But when significant grants are made in secret by Cabinet Ministers to the wife of the Speaker, where no announcements of the decision are made public and the funds come, illegally, out of a Trust Account so as to be beyond normal Parliamentary scrutiny, this can only be described as corrupt.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And it is signed by the opposition members of the committee. I point out, and it is an important thing to point out, that at the time these events occurred&mdash;and they all involved the education department of the Northern Territory&mdash;the then minister for education responsible for all this was, in fact, the now Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Shane Stone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is when this process became interesting, in a quite unprecedented way&mdash;which I think will probably attract the interest of some of the academic parliament&hyphen;watchers and, no doubt, a paper will be written on it. What then happened was the dissenting report that I have just quoted from was, in the normal way, prepared by the table office of the Northern Territory parliament with the majority report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no hesitation in saying this, and I do not apologise for saying it: one of the reasons that the Northern Territory parliament, in terms of its processes and procedures, is as impeccable a parliament as any parliament in Australia, is that the Territory parliament has had the good sense to draw its clerks and clerk assistants from the Senate, as the clerks assistant at this table know. In fact, the current clerk of the Northern Territory parlia 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1485"> ment, doing a very commendable job, was an officer of this Senate, as was his predecessor. I know the clerks will correct me if I am wrong but I think I am correct in saying that his predecessor was at one time Black Rod of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The table office prepared the reports. They were printed. They were in the normal fashion&mdash;majority report, dissenting report, ready for tabling. What then happened was the chair of the committee, Mrs Braham, went to the clerk and asked the clerk, `How do you separate the reports?' What she meant was physically separate them&mdash;actually pull them to pieces. The clerk said, `Well, normally you don't'. And I can tell you there  certainly had been no precedent for this ever in the Northern Territory parliament, and I suspect none here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clerk said, `Well, you don't normally do that'. The chairman then pressed the matter&mdash;and this, I might add, is a matter of public information. The clerk said, I am sure quite correctly, `Madam Chair, if you wish me to do that, would you please give me those instructions in writing.' She subsequently did and a letter was written by the chairman to the clerk instructing him to physically separate the reports. So staff were engaged and a great deal of staple removing was entered into. The staples were physically pulled out of the report and the reports were physically separated, and then rebound as two separate reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chairman of this committee&mdash;and this was astonishing; you talk about tricks&mdash;with absolutely no notice to the committee&mdash;which had in fact finished its job, produced its report in the way that we do in Senate committees constantly, and the report had been printed for the committee&mdash;with no further reference back to the committee and none to the opposition members of the committee, then tabled the majority report only, in the Northern Territory parliament. It was an absolute ambush. No&hyphen;one knew that this was going to happen. Of course, pandemonium ensued&mdash;and it has all been reported on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News</EMPHASIS>.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1488"> dripping bile and vitriol and hatred about Senator Colston.

It was all about bile, vitriol and hatred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party was so embarrassed by the whole thing&mdash;I am sure Senator Ray got a phone call from Mr Beazley saying, `What the hell do you think you're doing up that end of the building?'&mdash;that they had to resort to the good old Labor Party tactic of `when you are found wallowing in the mud, the first thing you do is reach out, grab somebody else by the legs and pull them in with you, have a mud bath'. This is the standard of Labor Party political propriety. It is the propriety of the mud bath.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This sort of politics is not something that is unknown in the history of man. I think John Milton described it very nicely in the 17th century. Senator Ray gave me cause to open up my copy of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Paradise Lost</EMPHASIS>. Senator Ray's performance reminded me of the performance of Satan when he rocks up in heaven and, as Milton says, `there with the companions at his fore, overwhelmed with floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire', he decides he is going to give a rallying speech to the troops. I will tell you what Satan said&mdash;and you could almost put it into the mouths of some of the people on the other side to encapsulate the deep level of political thought and propriety in the Labor Party. Listen to these words and you will hear the words of the Labor Party in this debate today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What though the field be lost? All is not lost; the unconquerable will, and study of revenge, immortal hate, and courage never to submit or yield; and what is else not to be overcome?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Forget about parliamentary propriety; forget about decency. We can have immortal hate. We can have study of revenge, unconquerable will. These are the rallying cries of the Labor Party. It is all so well encapsulated by Milton when he concludes:</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what the Labor Party is all about. It is about the politics of hate. The grandmaster has just walked in the door. The Labor Party is about the politics of hate. Every day opposition senators get up with yet another spurious allegation or personal slur. Those of us on this side of the chamber are quite used to it. Those of us in the National Party are quite used to the same old furphies being rocked out time and time again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it would be appropriate, given that Senator Carr has claimed in this place that the performance of the Labor Party is all about integrity, that we actually examine the integrity of the party that sits opposite us. I think the track record of Labor would be very intriguing indeed. These are the people who try to clothe themselves in the cloak of integrity and respectability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What respectability was given to the integrity of the Income Tax Assessment Act by the former Treasurer of this country who did not bother putting in his tax return for two years? Absolutely none! But it did not matter because he was so good at these things that they promoted him to be Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember&mdash;Senator Calvert, you will recall&mdash;the grand architect of the Labor Party's strategy in the years of both Prime Minister Hawke and Prime Minister Keating was former Senator Richardson.

It is well known that these people would do any deal they possibly could.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us talk about some of the other ones. We had the wonderful spectacle&mdash;and Senator Boswell will well recall this&mdash;of the former Prime Minister being caught out on some of the claims he made about his purported piggery deal. Senator Calvert, who has a big interest in primary industries, especially looking after pig producers, would be well aware that there was a plan that was hatched between Mr Keating and various Danish interests to circumvent the quarantine laws of this country by bringing in imported Danish pig semen and genetic material.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Boswell will recall that we uncovered in an estimates hearing through an FOI process a minute of a meeting in which all of this was recalled&mdash;a meeting between Mr Crean and the Danish agriculture minister to make it all possible. But the words were deleted. Senator Boswell, you will recall you and me fronting up to the estimates hearing with two copies of the same minute&mdash;one with the words deleted and one with the words not deleted. When I put it to Senator Cook that the words that had been deleted under the FOI process were `genetic material and live embryos', he said, `That is an outrageous and scurrilous suggestion. You have absolutely no evidence for that. You are a despicable person. There is no evidence for your saying that.' I said, `There is indeed.' He 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> said, `Table it.' I said, `Okay, I seek leave to table this, which is the same document without the words deleted.' Then he refused me leave.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the standard of propriety on that side of the chamber. They were caught out, clean bowled. There they were saying, `We want you to give us the evidence, but we are not going to give you leave to table it in parliament.' That is the standard of the people opposite.

Honourable senators may not be aware that the parliament gives Thursday afternoons for general business to the opposition in the Senate, which is their opportunity to bring forward for debate matters of great importance. It is their opportunity to bring forward for debate their own private member's bills so that they can lay out before the Australian people what their vision of Australia is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we get? We get this morally and intellectually bankrupt motion from Senator Ray which he did not even have the courage to come and speak on himself.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose this has been a very interesting and entertaining debate, but I will close by giving honourable senators a vision of what entertainment was for the parliamentary Labor Party in Queensland when they were in opposition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How did this come into the open? It came into the open because the Cook inquiry started investigating rorting in the union movement in Queensland just prior to the 1989 election. The very first thing that the Labor Party did when it got into office in Queensland was close down the Cook inquiry. It closed it down because it was worried about who else might have had a credit card and gone to the Red Garter strip joint.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take note tonight of the annual report of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, AWRAP. The role of AWRAP is to improve the performance of the wool industry by bringing together the promotion of wool and wool products and research and development activities. It is more practical for AWRAP to pursue these ongoing promotional research and development activities distinct from the immediate and short-term need to sell the stockpile, which is now down to 1.8 million bales from the 1993 level of 4.2 million bales, and to clear the debt, which is presently around $900 million down from $2.8 billion in 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1492">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wool promotion clearly must operate within the world's trade access environment. It is in this trade access area that the Minister for Trade, Mr Tim Fischer, has made substantial gains, with more to be done in 1997 and in subsequent years. It is certainly a priority of this government to obtain sustainable reductions in wool trade barriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Deputy Prime Minister has already demonstrated a strong commitment to trade liberalisation and the government is aware, as is the whole industry, of the enormous benefit to wool growers of tariff and quota reductions. The first of these was the 1996 reduction of tariff barriers to Mexico, which was good news because it had the potential to provide enormous access to the high value United States market, which is presently highly protected with significant quota levels and import duties applying to wool apparel and to greasy wool. China also has high levels of tariff protection, which range from 15 per cent for greasy wool to 45 per cent for apparel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">India, another major and emerging market for Australian wool, imposes a massive 52 per cent tariff for almost all wool categories. Just two weeks ago, the Indian minister for textiles was in Australia and discussions took place between him and the government. The Indian minister indicated then that he would make representations in their budget deliberations, which are presently going on and, I understand, are presently before the parliament. I expect some good news to be forthcoming from India that their level of tariff protection will be reduced, which is very important and would be very good news because it is an emerging market of great importance to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These three countries&mdash;India, China and the United States&mdash;will be the focus of the government's efforts over the next 12 months. These three markets currently consume about a third of Australia's wool production and, therefore, even modest improvements in trade access would be greatly welcomed by the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure senators would realise that the textile trade is always a two-way operation. Therefore, it must be remembered that successful outcomes in trade negotiations depend 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> partly on Australia's willingness to liberalise domestic trade restrictions in textile and clothing industries. Obviously, we are an importer of textiles and clothes. Therefore, the sort of perspective placed on Australian trade access to other markets must be seen in light of access to our own market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the wool round table meetings last year, a number of recommendations were made to the government, including the changes of future stockpile management, on which the government has acted. It was agreed that in addition the Wool Council and AWRAP would develop a framework, including potential additional funding plans for the wool industry, to address issues of how to increase demand for wool through promotion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Presently, the International Wool Secretariat spends around $75 million on promotion, being by compulsory 3&half; per cent levy on growers. The continuation of this levy is something that the industry will be debating. The framework of how the levy is imposed will also be debated in the next few months because the original enabling legislation setting up AWRAP in 1993 said that, whilst the present arrangements would continue on after June 1997, they would have to be subject to industry review.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report is highly commendable in relation to the work of the Australian Antarctic Foundation generally but, obviously, in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1493"> relation to those two projects specifically. I am pleased to note that the foundation does use its funds in these sorts of ways to support what are significant and imaginative projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, I will speak about the Royal Botanical Gardens project. I noted with interest, under the chairman's overview, the paragraph that deals with this issue which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens developed a particularly impressive project for consideration by the Board. This project creates a Sub-Antarctic environment within the grounds of the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens for the study, display and propagation of plants from Macquarie Island. The Gardens already have a significant collection of vegetative material from past trips to the island. The Sub-Antarctic House will feature Macquarie Island murals and recreate some of the island's attributes as well as providing significant information concerning the Sub&hyphen;Antarctic environment. The display will be viewed by over 300,000 people a year, enhancing their knowledge of this most significant location.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is very good news for the Royal Botanical Gardens and, as a result, very good news for the people of Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those of us who live in or who have visited Tasmania and the Royal Botanical Gardens know that those gardens are the second oldest botanical gardens after those in New South Wales. The botanical gardens in Tasmania have the oldest living trees, which date back to 1828. There are many reasons for the planting of those trees, but certainly the colonists in Tasmania were keen to have reminders of where they came from&mdash;particularly those coming from the United Kingdom&mdash;in terms of the sorts of trees that were planted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conifer collection is the largest public collection of conifers in the Southern Hemisphere. It includes 40 species which are literally on the verge of extinction in their country of origin. Clearly, this is a very important area in terms of ensuring the continuation of these species. The gardens are clearly capsules of biodiversity and they have links with botanical institutions worldwide. This, of course, ensures a flow of knowledge on plant protection and conservation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was indicated in the report, last year 310,000 people visited the botanical gardens. These gardens are very important for our tourism industry and as recreational facilities for the people who live in Hobart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, a crisis is facing the botanical gardens. It is with great sadness that I say that a deadly virus has arrived in the gardens which is killing a number of the trees to which I earlier referred. It is very sad, but 13 large trees have already died, and numerous small ones are dying. Tasmanian people have rallied to combat this crisis by trying to raise funds to save the gardens. This is a very worthwhile project and, hopefully, we will be successful and the gardens will be saved. If that is the case, the work funded by the Australian Antarctic Foundation will not have been in vain.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just briefly going through the issues associated with the state of the wet tropics at page 20 of the report, we see that the issue of land clearing again is highlighted.

The cane toad and its spread are damaging the environment, damaging other species and withdrawing the rights of other species to survive, particularly other species of frogs. My colleague from North Queensland Senator Reynolds would know this is a major problem that is not only experienced in Queensland. Now there are reports of the spread of the cane toad to other parts of Australia. It is a threat that is taken seriously by departments of industry and agriculture in other states because it threatens the livelihood of farmers in those states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last but not least, I just wanted to draw the attention of the Senate to the survey on page 28 of the report which refers to the pleasingly high level of acceptance that the wet tropics world heritage area has now got among the public and the ongoing support that I hope we will get from the government in maintaining these wet tropics areas for our future generations.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> speak on the annual report of the Wet Tropics Management Authority, particularly because I would like to pay tribute to the work of its first director, Mr Peter Hitchcock, who has recently retired. He played a very significant pioneering role in establishing the Wet Tropics Management Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not an easy job to head up an authority which has at the political level a number of political masters and, indeed, mistresses. At one stage a woman minister, Ros Kelly, was responsible for the Wet Tropics Management Authority. It is not always easy, when you are pioneering an area like wet tropics, to have to answer to a number of political representatives. State, federal and local representatives, the business community and the tourism community all were concerned about how the Wet Tropics Management Authority was going to balance the demands of the world heritage values, indigenous rights, tourist interests and farmers' interests. It was quite a challenge for Mr Peter Hitchcock.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to put on the public record not just the thanks of the people of North Queensland but the thanks of the people of Australia for the very good work he did. He demonstrated considerable patience and tolerance in dealing with such a wide range of competing interests. He tackled that role with considerable dedication, tact and diplomacy. I can assure you, Mr Deputy President, that when you are trying to balance competing interests it does take considerable effort and I think we should record our appreciation of his work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague Senator Hogg, in speaking to the report, did identify some very serious problems that are mentioned in the report. I note that some of my southern colleagues were quite taken aback by the problems that we have in the wet tropics. The disappearance of frogs and cassowaries is a very serious issue because it indicates to us that something is not right in terms of the environmental standards within the wet tropics. There is too much land clearing. There are quite serious threats to these species. The papaya fruit fly is extremely damaging and of concern for primary industries. We have had to take very specific action over the last 12 months or so.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1495">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the standards that must apply in managing a world heritage area, I would have to say that I believe that Senator Hill's intentions are honourable. I think that, as an environment minister, he does have a commitment to his portfolio and to his responsibilities. But, as an environment minister, like Mr Peter Hitchcock, he has all kinds of pressures placed upon him. I know that many people in the north are concerned about the level of commitment of the coalition government to maintaining high standards on protection of world heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have in North Queensland a very unique area where the wet tropics meets the Great Barrier Reef marine park, so we do have a very unique area for protection. Some of the decision making processes and initiatives that have been taken in the last 12 months do put at risk those standards. I would urge other ministers to give support to Senator Hill when it comes to protecting those unique areas of world heritage. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Hogg mentioned cassowaries. I want to say to him that his concern is certainly mirrored by our concern.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might invite both Senator Reynolds and Senator Hogg&mdash;as they obviously have a very genuine interest in this&mdash;to work together with us on these things, particularly those things that we all do agree upon. There are some items in connection with the environment that I suspect we will never agree upon. But, for those that we do agree upon, we really should work together in a cooperative way to try to get solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, I do not want to cause division. I simply say in passing that it was the view of our predecessors that the environment was a political tool to be used to gather votes as they saw fit. I regret to say that all the Labor Party did was cause divisions with their environmental policy. The wet tropics management area is a classic case in point. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1496"> They thought they gained a lot of votes&mdash;and I think perhaps they did&mdash;by declaring the wet tropics management area in the boundaries. Unfortunately, they never provided any money to manage those areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The allocation and the proclamation of the wet tropics management area was a good idea, and is one that I have always supported&mdash;although I had some hesitation about the boundaries&mdash;but it was an argument that divided the community. We want to bring the community together. We want everyone to work. We want to put some money in so that which do not have to talk about cane toads.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to direct my remarks to the Finance and Public Administration References 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Committee proceedings of the round table discussion that we held arising out of the discussion paper from the government: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a best practice Australian Public Service</EMPHASIS> . I will quote a couple of lines from that round table discussion, particularly those attributed to the Public Service Commissioner, whom, for a while, I thought must have written the government's discussion paper because of some of the views that he actually expressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I found it interesting that in his submission the commissioner supported the discussion paper and its supposed very comprehensive content. It was certainly a different view to the one I had about it. I found it rather confusing and not the slightest bit comprehensive about what we might do so far as improving the Australian Public Service is concerned. Nevertheless, the commissioner quoted the secretary of the Canadian Treasury Board, who says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would say how strongly I was struck by the articulation of many of the issues in the paper.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not know whether he got the same paper that I got, which was one issued by the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Peter Reith. In the first instance, it contains some quotes from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and does some comparisons with regard to the public sector&mdash;the cost of doing things in the private sector versus the cost of doing things in the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am quite amazed that the minister would endeavour to draw some conclusions along the lines he has done because it simply is not possible. For a start, the private sector is not required to deliver anything like the level of accountability and reporting that the public sector is required to deliver. During the course of our round table discussion that became quite evident. A number of the people who gave submissions raised those very issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By way of example, in Florida they contracted out the payment and distribution of the Department of Social Security benefits for the dole and other beneficiaries. Two years running overpayments amounted to something like $126 million per year. That went unno 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1497"> ticed for two years. When the government found out, it endeavoured to take the company that was contracted to do that work to court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, the court found that the government had changed its policy and had changed its level of payment, but in the contract the company had an obligation to a certain format of computer program. The company had not been advised and the company was not obligated to change. Not only did the government lose the money in additional payments; it was subsequently ordered by the court to pay another $63 million in damages. Contracting out services is not a straightforward exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to look at another matter in terms of the discussion paper itself that was also quite evident in the views of the people we had at the round table discussion&mdash;and there were varying views. A quote was attributed to the Prime Minister, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian public is very fortunate that over the years it's had a federal public service that has been distinguished by two characteristics. The first of those characteristics is an extremely high degree of integrity and honesty . . . The other characteristic, of course, is a very high degree of professionalism, and a willingness over the years . . . to give comprehensive and, on most occasions, pretty zealous technical advice.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister endorsed a statement and then it goes to a number of points, one of those points being a strong commitment to the community and a responsiveness to government. That is what the Public Service is designed to do. It is designed to be responsive, with a strong commitment to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is one of the fundamental issues which is then overlooked on the very next page. It is very clear on page 9 of this document where the government is headed with regard to how it is going to deal with the future of the Australian Public Service. It says in the third paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A responsiveness to governments and public accountability are equally important. The APS will continue to be responsible for ensuring that the delivery of programs and services accords with the public purpose set by government. To this end the APS will retain the role of oversighting service 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> delivery whether it is undertaken by specialised APS agencies (such as the proposed Department of Social Security/Department of Employment, Education and Youth Affairs Shopfront), new authorities outside the Public Service Act (such as the Public Employment Placement Enterprise) or&mdash;under contract&mdash;by private or non-profit organisations. This continuing role is central to the maintenance of accountability to the Government, Parliament and the Australian public.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We know what the government is proposing to do with regard to work for the dole. As we understand it, it has proposed to hand that responsibility over to non-profit organisations. But it all comes back to the questions that were raised in the round table discussion about accountability and about the cost of delivery in terms of the reporting obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very point I want to make and will continue to make to the government is that you cannot compare the cost of operation in the public sector with that in the private sector. It is a very simplistic view when we in this place require so much accountability and reporting back from the public sector. Those obligations are not placed on the private sector. Therefore, a cost comparison is basically misleading and is something we should not be doing if we are committed to properly delivering services to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, as the Prime Minister says, that is something we should do, then we cannot take this flippant approach and say, `It is three times cheaper to do it through the private sector.' That is simply not the case. I would say that there are numerous examples of where much of the public service in other countries has been privatised. In the case of the UK, there is now significant regret, even within the conservative government, about the steps they have taken with regard to privatising much of their public service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I read some very interesting articles in the British press with regard to bus services. They have bus services now that are totally privatised. You have all the buses running at peak hours&mdash;five buses bumper to bumper&mdash;and then no buses for three or four hours. What sort of a service is that to the public? If we are to spend taxpayers' money, then surely we have an obligation and a responsibility to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1498"> ensure that the service is available in an equitable way and to all of the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other aspect of what has happened in the UK is accountability. There is no mechanism for somebody who has a complaint against the service being provided other than to complain to the person that is actually providing it&mdash;the private sector provider. There is no mechanism to go to the government or to the opposition parties and raise concerns. The response from the government will be, `You have to see the person delivering the service.' There is no role of government, no real accountability and certainly no responsibility on the part of the government. Look at some of the comments made recently by Max Moore&hyphen;Wilton at a recent conference here in the ACT. We certainly know his view of the Public Service. He would not have one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was indicated in the letter to the minister which accompanied the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the round table discussion, we look forward to the government developing a white paper. I am very surprised and saddened to see statements by the government and the minister that they are intending to avoid what is currently award coverage and, indeed, proper negotiations with regard to workplace agreements or enterprise bargaining. They are going to head down the road of stepping around the current Public Service Act and endeavour to put people on individual contracts. I hope that at the end of the day they will take account of the circumstances they find themselves in and ensure, as the Prime Minister said, that one of the key principles of the Public Service is the ability to deliver to the public a service that is good and reliable.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this same report because I share some fairly strong concerns, having read the precursor of this&mdash;the discussion paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a best practice Australian Public Service</EMPHASIS> . I do not think the round table report that has been tabled here this evening in any way resolves many of the issues. It is my view that the original document was predicated on the view that there is something wrong with the Australian Public Service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague has quite clearly drawn out the fact that there is a real difference between the Public Service and the private sector. The Public Service is there to serve the public. Whilst efficiency and effectiveness are important, the needs of the public are supreme. This may mean in some way sacrificing certain so-called economic rationalist efficiencies which might be perceived by the economic rationalists out there in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some of the best practice that can be applied in the corporate sector might not necessarily be able to be applied, and undoubtedly cannot be applied, in a public service that is serving the public. After all, that is what it is there for. The corporate sector is driven by profit, whereas the public sector is not and should not be driven solely by the economic rationalist theory of profit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, the approach of the document shows no compassion for the employees or clients of the service. If the clients do not fit the needs of the business, the private sector can ignore them; however, no such option is available to the Public Service. The Public Service is there to serve the public, regardless of what they might think of their client base or how they might want to treat their client base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Best practice cannot be applied cold heartedly and dispassionately as in the private sector. I think that is a telling difference between the private and public sectors&mdash;that the best practice which is applied in the private sector, whilst it meets the profit motives of the people who run the private sector, cannot be dispassionately and heartlessly applied in the public sector. The service provided by the Australian Public Service is of the highest quality. That has been the subject of ongoing review over a long period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The original discussion paper talked at page 22 of revitalising the Australian Public Service. I think that was, in some ways, a slur on our public servants and was completely unwarranted. Part of the vision of the government, undoubtedly, is to make the government more efficient and cost conscious by outsourcing. Whilst outsourcing might be good in economic rational theory, in practice 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1499"> it does not necessarily all go well in government. The government have already flagged things such as IT and many other functions of government being  outsourced. This will lead to massive job losses within the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have grave concerns about the path of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a Best Practice Australian Public Service</EMPHASIS> when the path that the government contemplates advocates best practice not based on best service to the public but on least cost to the government. I think that is the telling factor in this whole thing. It will end up being an exercise in being cent wise but dollar foolish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that the government should tread very warily. An example is the sort of thing that was tabled in both the Senate and the House of Representatives yesterday: the joint plan by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives&mdash;a headline today in response to that read `Jobs at risk in parliament plan'&mdash;to fold the joint parliamentary divisions into the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This highlights the fears that come out of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Towards a best practice Australian Public Service</EMPHASIS>: that, in the end, this is an attack on jobs, on lifestyle and on people's ability to earn a legitimate income. It was flagged in the proposal that was put before the Senate and the House of Representatives yesterday that, over time, it would see people not necessarily made redundant but just drifting out of the system. In my view, this is not an acceptable way for the government to act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has a responsibility to people to be in the job of employing people and to see that people are utilised well in the best interests of the Senate and the House of Representatives. But, at the same time, the government must not be preoccupied with, or focused on, a purely economic rationalist approach which sees people reduced to nothing more than mere statistics in the unemployment lines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I commend this report to all members of the Senate. They should read it closely, and the government in particular should take no solace from the things that I have just spoken about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I last spoke on this report into the abolition of the development import finance facility, I spoke about the cavalry coming over the hill&mdash;that was how the inquiry was seen by one of the people in attendance at the lengthy inquiry we had. This evening, in the few minutes that remain to me, I wish to focus on the fact that one of the important recommendations that came out of this inquiry was that the government should look at establishing a replacement program for the DIFF scheme because there was no doubt in the evidence that was heard before the DIFF inquiry that there was a real place and real role for a scheme to operate similarly to DIFF, if not the same as DIFF.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While DIFF was an aid based scheme, the scheme that was required was one that gave concessional finance to exporters to make their mark in markets overseas. With the withdrawal of the DIFF scheme, this facility was withdrawn from those particular exporters, primarily small business people in Australia. So the community that was hurt by this decision of the government was in effect its own electorate and its own constituency: the small business community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the recommendations in the majority report was that the government establish a mixed credit scheme based on these criteria: that it be primarily a development scheme; that emphasis be given to projects of a humanitarian, poverty&hyphen;alleviation or environmental nature; that all projects be nominated by recipient governments; that it be integrated into AusAID's bilateral program for individual countries; and that all projects be open to competition amongst Australian companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need for such a scheme is purely and simply based on the evidence that came before us, that the part of the marketplace vacated by us has been taken up by other nations, be they Norway, America or Japan. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1500"> They are making use of mixed credit schemes to see that their small business communities have a launching pad to get into some of the burgeoning markets, particularly in South&hyphen;East Asia. Of course, that is where the main thrust of our DIFF program was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's response to the report was: `Thank you, but no thank you. We don't want to have anything to do with it. We don't want to have a part in this. We have shunted that off to another inquiry, and we might see you in a couple of years, thank you very much.' That is no consolation for the small business operators in Australia who were getting a kick&hyphen;along as a result of the DIFF scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the majority report went one step further and recommended that the percentage of projects under the green DIFF component, in any new mixed credit scheme, be raised to 40 per cent. So there was a balanced approach in the majority report. But what did the government say to that? Again, it said, `Thank you, but no thank you.' In its response, the government has not addressed the issues involving many small business companies that were at the leading edge of technology and innovation in exporting to South&hyphen;East Asian countries. All we see now is that that has been put into the too&hyphen;hard basket. It has been put on hold. Golden opportunities are being missed or wasted by the lack of initiative of this government to take something that was a success and run with it. The government's response is a failure in itself and, indeed, should be recognised as such.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to comment on the government's response to the report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee on the abolition of the DIFF scheme. I concur wholeheartedly with the remarks of my colleague Senator Hogg, who was a member of the committee that I had the privilege to chair.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The DIFF scheme was an excellent scheme. That was clearly acknowledged in all of the evidence put before the committee by industry and by people who in many cases came from the constituency that strongly supported the Liberal and National parties in recent elec 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tions. It was quite clear that they were very disturbed about the attitude adopted by this government in unilaterally abolishing the DIFF scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, the DIFF scheme was an excellent one because, on the one hand, it provided very well targeted aid to countries in our region and, on the other hand, through the use of mixed credits it enabled Australian companies to be involved in those projects and to gain some benefit from that involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The majority report sets out in some detail the way in which the scheme operated. It also sets out that Australia, in having such a scheme, was able to be a participant in the development of aid projects for countries in our region alongside and in competition with other countries. Many other countries, particularly European countries and some of the more wealthy Asian countries, such as Japan, have long used similar schemes as part of their aid program&mdash;in many cases in far more restrictive ways than the DIFF scheme operated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's unilateral decision to abolish the scheme saw Australia opting out of this type of provision of aid and putting forward no replacement. Therefore, many Australian companies are suffering. They are suffering because they have invested a lot of time and money in the program to be cut off at the 11th hour by this decision. Also countries in our region made known very clearly to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) their attitude in opposition to this decision of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister was then forced to review his decision to provide a limited opportunity for further projects to be approved. The minister was forced to back down in the face of significant complaints from our neighbours in the region and from industry. Notwithstanding that limited backdown, many companies&mdash;after having spent a lot of time and money developing projects, getting through almost all of the stages of the process&mdash;found that they were not able to complete the process and proceed to have their projects approved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the majority recommendations was that companies holding letters of advice be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1501"> given approval. The government responded to that saying that, if they changed their mind now, it would be a breach of their election commitment, as they had made an election commitment to abolish the DIFF scheme. One of the election promises that this government should have broken was this one, because it was a dumb promise to abolish a scheme that was working very successfully. It was providing aid, and it was providing Australian industry with opportunities to develop their export business throughout Asia and the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government runs back and hides, saying, `No, we made a promise. We cannot change our mind,' when in every other area they have broken promises&mdash;in health, education, funding to the ABC and so on. After having broken those promises in those areas, what did the government do? They set up a review. We saw it in education. They slashed education funding and then established a review to see how things were going to operate. It is the same with the ABC. They took $55 million out of their budget and then set up the Mansfield review. That, in many cases, demonstrated that this government's attempts to virtually destroy the ABC and its independence were quite wide of the mark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, in the area of foreign aid and the operation of mixed credit schemes, the government set up a review. They set up the Simons review after they made the decision to abolish the DIFF scheme. As is noted in the government's response, they have rejected a number of the majority committee recommendations. They said, `We have the Simons review which is looking into the possibility of a replacement scheme and will see what future arrangements should apply in this regard.' They say that they want to await the outcome of the Simons review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It has been stated on a number of occasions that the Simons review was going to be an exercise which would result in a report early this year. Certainly, the clear indication in the government's response No. 2 is that any new arrangements could not be introduced before 1997&hyphen;98, which is the financial year coming up. When we suggested the Simons review terms of reference might be expanded, they 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> said, `Oh no, we can't do that, because we have to get this review completed so we can get a decision&mdash;a report&mdash;on how these things should be constructed in the future.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam Acting Deputy President, as you will recall from the estimates committee hearing the other night, when officers of AusAID were questioned about how the Simons review was proceeding, and when we were going to get the report, we were told, `Oh, in the near future; in a month or two.' It is early March. In about two months time, we are going to have the budget delivered in this parliament. The budget negotiations are already under way, but there is no sign of the Simons review on this very important area of overseas aid and the way in which aid may be delivered through mixed credit schemes such as DIFF was.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was clearly acknowledged at the estimates committee the other night, we are not likely to see the report and certainly not likely to hear any response from the government on such a report before the budget. So what is going to happen is that because that review has still not been completed, there will be no proposals forthcoming from this government which would in any way be able to operate for the forthcoming year 1997&hyphen;98. So the government, once again, have failed miserably to deal with this problem that they themselves created. That is, they abolished an excellent scheme that was operating very well. There is certainly nothing forthcoming at the moment and there will be nothing forthcoming that could in any way operate in the coming financial year. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1502"> noted in perusing the report that it talked about community concern. It said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The strong support expressed in submissions for a reduction in the amount of violence shown must be seen in the broader context of community attitudes generally and of the shocked reaction in the wake of the Port Arthur massacre.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public opinion polls conducted after the mass murders showed that up to 68 per cent of those surveyed favoured more restrictions on violent movies, videos and video games and 75 per cent of voters believed violence on television was excessive.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Whether or not one agrees with those survey results, there is not doubt, out there in the broader community, that there is a real concern about the violence that is being faced by people today and, of course, the effect that violence in the electronic media has on others in inciting them to violence themselves. It is worth while then turning to the conclusions of this report where the committee, among other things, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recognises that the community needs "true stories" and "dark stories" as well as happy tales. Violence is often part of the former and must be portrayed. The evidence before the Committee suggests, however that the community questions the graphic way in which the violence is conveyed and the frequency with which the electronic media offers violent portrayals for consumption. It expects government action on this issue but it also expects professionals in the electronic media industry to assume responsibility for reducing the volume of anti&hyphen;social messages conveyed in programs and film.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think that is spot on. I think that reflects totally the community attitude out there. There is a real concern. Whilst the community identifies that government has a role to play, the community also recognised that the media has a role to play in this as well. This is the frightening part of this report, because it then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As technological advances make more electronic images and information easily available, the problem of reducing exposure to violent portrayal becomes so complex that it can only be dealt with by a concerted effort at international, federal and state government levels.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So it is something that should not be wiped away by the presentation of this report to this Senate. It is something that needs continual 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> addressing, because it is going to be an ongoing concern out there in the real world. The committee report concludes inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a reduction in the volume and levels of violent images that can be received in homes and schools around the country.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to speak, but I really think I should compliment my friend on the other side of the chamber for his remarks. I think Senator Parer would share the same view that I do that Senator Hogg is quite correct in saying that we do have to counter the level of violence and indecency which is appearing in the electronic media. I take this opportunity to raise my concerns about it. I think Senator Hogg would probably appreciate these points.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report of the Senate Select Committee on Community Standards Relevant to the Supply of Services Utilising Electronic Technologies refers to pay television, but what is of concern to me is the convergence of electronic media. We will soon have a situation where the distinction between the Internet in terms of service providers and pay televi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="1503"> sion will become very blurred. We will soon get to a situation where it is possible to order video on demand over the Internet. The technology for compressing digital signals is now so good that in Singapore I even saw CD video, which is a little CD player, just like an ordinary CD player that you would use for music&mdash;you can use it for music&mdash;with a standard size CD that contains a whole feature length movie. We are not talking about a big bulky laser disc. We are talking about a standard size CD containing a video compressed version of a movie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will soon be possible to download feature length movies on demand over the Internet. Whilst it is likely that there will be a charge for that and, therefore, people will have to use a credit card or have some other means of paying, it worries me that you may well have a situation where these service providers are offering free samples of violent or pornographic movies, which could be downloaded at no cost. I really do believe that we have a major challenge in terms of maintaining standards of decency. It is not, Senator Hogg, like the movies when you were a boy or when I was a boy or when Senator Parer was a boy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade has, for a period, reviewed our relationships, particularly our trade relationships, with many of our regional neighbours. This report is an excellent contribution to that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things the committee did at the beginning was to have a discussion about which country or countries could be looked at in order to highlight the problems that Australia and Australian service providers might have in breaking into markets in Asia. This report is significant because it draws our attention to a whole range of weaknesses in our arrangements, and those who came before the committee showed us their successes in trade in services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This report is also very significant because of the important employment aspects that it has for Australians throughout the country. I think it also allows us to see various regional advantages that some areas of Australia have and how, from evidence we had, some people with enterprise had opened up markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, we were looking at Indonesia and Hong Kong. We selected those two places because they were different markets. They were markets where I think we in the service industry in Australia, the largest sector of our economy, could learn lessons that would assist us in looking outward to our region and developing trade.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1505">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's trade in services has grown strongly during the 1980s and 1990s. Trade in services accounted for 20.5 per cent of total trade in 1984-85. By 1995-96, this had increased to 22.7 per cent. Exports of services have grown at almost double the rate of service imports. In 1994-95, service exports were valued at $20.4 billion and, in real terms, contributed 21.3 per cent to total exports for goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The percentage increases to some 40 per cent when embedded services&mdash;those bundled in with goods&mdash;are taken together. Although it is difficult to define in some cases a service and the goods that are attached to a service, nevertheless it shows in those figures how important it is to our economy. The service sector makes a critical contribution to the domestic economy and economic development. Services directly comprise some 70 per cent of gross domestic product and more than 70 per cent of the work force. So, as I say, it is absolutely critical to our job creation programs and the needs to overcome unemployment as it is in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the committee and many others applaud these international trade achievements by the service sector, there is little room for complacency in the evidence that came before the committee. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The intelligent exports: ". . . and the silent revolution in services</EMPHASIS> report, launched in September 1994 by the then Labor Prime Minister and jointly commissioned by the government and the private sector, revealed that only a small percentage&mdash;1.2 per cent&mdash;of Australian service companies export. When you consider the fact that 1.2 per cent of companies are doing it, then you realise how serious that is as far as Australia is concerned. Unfortunately, we have the need to get a cultural change as far as service companies are concerned, because that 1.2 per cent represents only about five per cent of Australia's total service capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proportion of service exported does not compare well with some of our key competitors. When we look to others we find that Singapore has 69 per cent of its services in exports; Hong Kong, 19 per cent; the Netherlands, 17 per cent; France and the United Kingdom, 10 per cent; and New Zealand and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Germany, nine per cent. So our Kiwi cousins are doing far better than us in the service sector area. Australia's service export proportion rate equals Canada's five per cent, is slightly ahead of the United States&mdash;four per cent&mdash;and more than double that of Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In seeking the reference the committee chose Indonesia and Hong Kong markets for investigation for a number of reasons, as I have said. Both markets have strong growth rates in the service sector and are attractive markets for Australian exporters. These two markets provide a contrasting challenge for Australian business in service exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee also felt that there were lessons to be learnt from the Hong Kong experience which would assist Australia's exporters to Indonesia. So, in choosing both Hong Kong and Indonesia, we felt that we would be able to benefit from the differentiation between the two markets. Hong Kong is a mature service market, with services being the fastest growing sector of the economy, accounting for 83 per cent of the gross domestic product in 1995. In looking at Hong Kong, to a large extent one is also looking at China, since a substantial part of Hong Kong trade is eventually linked to China. Indonesia is a net service importing country. The potential for service exports to Indonesia from Australia is significant. More generally, Indonesia is recognised as one of Australia's most important trade partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not intend to go through all the recommendations, but I would like to mention just a few of them. The committee, in drawing attention to the areas where Australia needs to lift its game, in many cases had to refer to the need, for example, for the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs to commence its promotion of the Australian qualifications framework as a matter of urgency. Another recommendation was that Australian companies adopt the policy of recruiting and supporting students with both language and professional skills to provide an important resource for Australian businesses operating in the Asian-Pacific region in the future. So those recommendations and many other recommendations are in the report, but I will leave it at that.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today's Editorial (6.3.97) is an unfair swipe at the use of travel allowance by Parliamentary staff and fails to distinguish between allocation of travel allowance for staff and Members of Parliament. Travel for staff is not discretionary but is at the direction and under the authorisation of the Member of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Industrial Relations determines the amount of allowance paid to all Commonwealth employees using a formula which accounts for the average cost of accommodation, meals and transport. Travel allowance payments are also closely monitored by the Department of Administrative Services. The formula applied is similar to that applied throughout the public sector and is paid at a lower rate than that for Parliamentarians. A travel allowance system is also used significantly in the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are required to be in Canberra for parliamentary sitting weeks&mdash;for some staff this can be up to 25 weeks a year. Aside from the disruption to family life, in Canberra we are unlikely to have access to a car or any other usual form of transport. In many instances we do not have access to cooking facilities and the long working hours don't allow time for grocery shopping let alone cooking. Cafeteria meals are not subsidised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The accommodation allowance certainly doesn't allow for accommodation in a five star hotel and very few stay rent free! In addition, many staff are not paid travel time and frequently are required to travel to Canberra on a Sunday for which overtime is not payable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is widely acknowledged that political staff are not well paid and many sacrifice the benefits of a higher salary to contribute their services. There is no structured long term job security for political staff as their employment is determined on the electoral fortunes of their Member or Senator. The

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the past week or so, particular sections of the Australian media have been giving a great deal of air time to criticisms of David Helfgott's ability as a pianist. Central to those reports have been the interviews with the music critic of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Boston Globe</EMPHASIS>  newspaper, Richard Dyer. I have now heard interviews with this gentleman on four occasions. He has been given, I have no doubt, far more national air time in Australia that he has in the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have now heard him in two separate interviews criticise: one, that the Schumann piece on track six of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shine</EMPHASIS> CD was being played not by David Helfgott but by Wilhelm Kempff; and, two, that the movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shine</EMPHASIS> delivers the message that mentally ill people should marry their astrologists. I now have no doubt, after hearing that interview to my great anger on national radio this morning, that Mr Dyer belongs to that large group of anally retentive professional critics who are far more preoccupied with the cleverness and the acerbity of their own criticisms than they are about a serious attempt to fairly analyse a performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the first criticism about the Schumann piece on track six, Mr Dyer attempted to falsely create the impression that he had discovered this as some piece of deception on the part of David Helfgott or the people who put the CD out. It is, in fact, nothing of the sort. Mr Dyer found out about this in the same way I did, by reading the liner notes on the CD. They clearly explain 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which musician performed every track on the album, including the fact that the Schumann piece was played&mdash;beautifully, I might add&mdash;by Wilhelm Kempff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Would I suggest for a minute that a number of the tracks that are played by David Helfgott on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shine</EMPHASIS> CD, which I enjoy enormously as much as I enjoyed the film the four times I have seen it so far, are the best performances that I have of these compositions, most of which I love? No, of course, I would not, because a number of these tracks are played by David Helfgott on out of tune, tinny pianos with lots of atmospherics. But do I enjoy them any less for that? No; in fact, I enjoy them a lot more.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to quote what Scott Hicks, the director of the movie, had to say about music and cinema with which I absolutely agree&mdash;and I love both music and cinema. Scott Hicks said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Cinema, like music, is not primarily a medium of the intellect, it is about the emotions and agitation of the mind.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Indeed it is. That is why I love this album so much and that is why I love so much Helfgott's rendition of Rach 3. I love that composition and always have. It is over-the-top, heart on the sleeve romantic and I love that sort of music.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The intellectual music, which I listen to sometimes on the ABC at 3 o'clock in the morning, is usually punctuated by extremely long pauses and then a lot of discordant notes. I appreciate that musicians love that sort of music and that is intellectual music. The only trouble with it is that it sounds dreadful, so I do not hesitate to say that I like romantic music, I like the way Helfgott plays it and I agree with Scott Hicks. But back to Mr Dyer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Dyer's other criticism&mdash;and it was disgraceful&mdash;was that the movie attempts to, as he said in the interview this morning, deliver the message that mentally ill people should marry their astrologist. I do not know if in real life Mrs Helfgott ever was David Helfgott's astrologer, but having seen the movie and the trampoline scene, which is their introduction in the movie, the movie suggests nothing of the sort. The movie does not suggest that Mrs Helfgott ever was David 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1508"> Helfgott's astrologer. He met her because she was a friend of a friend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course there is that wonderful line in the movie where, having met her for the first time his life, he immediately proposes marriage to her. When she expresses some polite rejection of this approach and some concern about it, he says to her in the movie, `Consult the stars.' It is a great line in the movie. It was probably never uttered in real life, but so what?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who can possibly suggest that a movie in one and a half or two hours can be an absolutely accurate portrayal of someone's life? But it is a great depiction of Helfgott's life. It is a great depiction of his love of music, which is shared by so many millions of other people. It is a great depiction of the success, the triumph of the human spirit, as we say in real terms, of that man dragging himself back with the help of a lot of friends from the abyss of crippling mental disease to the point where his life has at least been substantially restored. He loves playing the music and the audiences love listening to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that, in respect of this outrageous and inaccurate slur on the movie, if Mr Dyer is as accurate a music critic as he is a film critic, then the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Boston Globe</EMPHASIS> should kick his backside through the top of his head and sack him because what he said about this movie is wrong. He also told a few other little fibs in this venom&mdash;and that is what it is&mdash;that he is continuing to deliver on Helfgott.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was asked by John Highfield how the audience reacted to it, because he absolutely panned the premiere performance of Helfgott in Boston&mdash;a great music loving town, as I know. Richard Dyer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Courteously, as American audiences do, and with some warmth because they were responding to the myth.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Is that true? No, it is not. In fact, Helfgott got four standing ovations at that performance. The audience reaction was so spontaneous and wonderful that, having given him four standing ovations, they then flowed onto the stage of the amphitheatre to meet him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To refer to the rest of this interview&mdash;and I said it was pure venom&mdash;I rest my case. I

I refer to the comments Dyer then made about people&mdash;unidentified, of course, by him&mdash;apparently physicians who came up to him and rang him the following morning after the performance and said, `Wasn't it dreadful. I have got to get out of here.' Mr Dyer said, `I felt it indecent being present.' I can suggest a very easy way out for him if he is so offended by being present&mdash;don't be present.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was absolutely delighted to see on AAP tonight, because I decided this morning that I would deliver this speech, an article headed `"Elitist" criticism prompts rush for Helfgott tickets'. This really cheered me up. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The North American public has shown its disdain for critics of acclaimed Australian pianist David Helfgott by rushing to buy the few tickets remaining for his current tour, according to promoters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Helfgott&mdash;whose life is the subject of Oscar-nominated film Shine&mdash;has 17 concerts remaining on the American leg of his world tour, of which 14 are sold out.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish David Helfgott well for the rest of his tour. I publicly thank him for all the pleasure he has given me since his emergence as a pianist. I wish him the best for the rest of the tour and would like to say to him, in much milder language than I would like: stuff the critics, what do they know?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, while the critics in America are obviously singing a different tune from music lovers&mdash;I am pleased to say&mdash;in their appreciation of David Helfgott, as demonstrated by today's AAP report, I will use my remaining time to briefly touch on a minister in this parliament who is today singing a different tune from the one he was singing last night. In Senate question time today, Senator Herron tried to make light of a number of remarks he made at Senate estimates last night regarding the Prime Minister (Mr Howard).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron attempted today to dismiss his statements of last night that the Prime 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1509"> Minister was as ignorant as I was and needed to be educated after describing Third World conditions in Aboriginal communities, indeed, as being something that should not be said.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to make a few comments about the Sutherland Shire, an area in southern Sydney that I am and have been all my life proud to live in. Firstly, I would make some comments about a pleasing feature of the Sutherland Shire, and that is the continuation of a great sporting tradition in that shire.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have already seen earlier this week the Super League Sharks beat Canberra at the start of the Super League. I have to put on the record that I am not a fan of Super League and I do not like the way in which it was established. But I can certainly say that it is good to see the local team going well in that competition. I look forward to the day when we get back to a single competition in rugby league in this country. It is unfortunate that the game has been rent with the difficulties and traumas it has suffered over the past year or two.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1510">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tonight I will talk about the sport of baseball, particularly junior baseball. I had the privilege and pleasure on 15 and 16 February this year to attend the state cup finals of New South Wales Junior Baseball. They were held over at Curl Curl on the north side, probably as far as away from the Sutherland Shire as you can get without getting out of the Sydney metropolitan region. In that competition the Cronulla Sutherland under&hyphen;12 team, also known as the Sharks, was represented. It was a particular pleasure, I must confess, because my own son was in the team.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The team played along with teams from Manly, the Hills District in Sydney, the Illawarra, Newcastle, and Ryde&hyphen;Hornsby. Those regions made up the teams in the finals, and the finals were played over two days. Firstly, I have to congratulate the team from the Hills that won the event. They narrowly won the event from the team from the Sutherland Shire, the Sharks, who were runners-up. I pay tribute to those teams in particular, and also all other junior teams that participated in that competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Baseball is a sport which is growing in leaps and bounds. It is growing because it is played with such a great attitude&mdash;an attitude demonstrated by both juniors and seniors who play this sport. One of the great things about the game is that it is a game that particularly at junior levels all children can participate in, children of both sexes can play in the same teams, and all the kids get a go. You do not have to be a star to enjoy your baseball. I particularly pay tribute to the organisers of the competition and all the players and officials because of the way in which it was conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To see kids who played it hard for two days in each of their games and then, when it was all over, get out and enjoy each other's company on the field was a great pleasure. As I said at the outset, I just hope that we can get back to some of that attitude of enjoyment and love of the game of rugby league.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also mention this because one of the coaches came up to me after the game and said, `Listen, Senator, these kids have put their heart and soul into this all year. How about getting them a mention in the Senate?' 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> I could not say no. So I am going to mention them. These are the players and officials from that team from the Sutherland shire: the team, Peter Baker, Mark Bardsley&hyphen;Smith, Ben Black, Peter Blanch, Wayne Bochkareff, Bradley Callaghan, Matthew Callaghan, Tim Haig, Matthew Kinnear, Tod McKay, Adam Minter, Dylan Reddy, Rhys Wilson and Martin Forshaw; the coaches, Ken Saville, Bob Callaghan and Dennis Mannix; the manager, Ian McKay; and the scorer, Kathy Blanch. I think you have all done a great job and I am pleased to record it in the Senate. I know you will be as proud of it as I am.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, in the remaining five minutes I have to turn to an unfortunate aspect which could possibly take away a lot of that gloss and pleasure that we in the Sutherland shire are used to and enjoy. What we have seen in the last couple of days, again, is this coalition government wanting to inflict more distress and anguish on the people living in the Sutherland shire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only are they looking at locating a 24&hyphen;hour international airport within the Sutherland shire in the Holsworthy region, but we now hear that they are considering building a nuclear reprocessing facility at Lucas Heights. What else do you people in the government want to do to the good citizens of the Sutherland shire in the electorate of Hughes? We already have the nuclear reactor. The people have within their area Australia's largest oil refinery; they have the largest metropolitan waste disposal centre in New South Wales; and this government is now seriously considering locating a nuclear waste reprocessing centre at Lucas Heights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is just a crazy proposition because, if the community is outraged, as it is, about your plans for an airport at Holsworthy, you just wait till you hear their outrage when it comes to this proposal. Indeed, in the other place, when this matter was debated yesterday in an MPI and was again brought up today, your own local member, Danna Vale, virtually had to be restrained from getting up and getting stuck into the lot of you. Unfortunately, your own Liberal member for this electorate is unable to do anything about this. But the community is going to do something 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1511"> about this. They are going to send you the message loud and clear that they are not going to put up with this proposition for a high&hyphen;level reprocessing plant which is just going to create further health hazards, further potential damage to the sensitive environment of that region and cause great distress and anguish as well as potential economic loss for the citizens of that shire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal is clearly contrary to the recommendations of the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Dangers of Radioactive Waste brought down last year entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">No time to waste</EMPHASIS>. The recommendations of that committee, of which I was a member, were that Australia look at building a waste disposal repository away from suburban areas. But what is this government doing? It is actually looking at putting, in an area where there already is a nuclear reactor, another and potentially more dangerous facility to process and store on a long&hyphen;term basis nuclear waste from both within this country and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This proposal is also quite contrary to the ANSTO Act when it was amended back in 1992 because there was clearly an intention in that legislation then that Lucas Heights would not be the site for any facility which would be used for the storage of nuclear waste on a long&hyphen;term basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two issues to be addressed at Lucas Heights. Firstly, there is the issue of the future of the reactor. Whilst the people of the shire have accepted that it is there, they are not going to accept putting a new nuclear reactor there. Secondly, they are not going to accept this disgraceful proposal to dump this reprocessing facility in their backyards. The sooner the government gets that message loud and clear, the better. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to raise those two important issues tonight.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1511"><TITLE>Senator Woods: Retirement</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say up front tonight that I have a passionate regard for the responsibilities associated with the use of parliamentary privilege. It has saddened me greatly on past 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> occasions to see this being misused, particularly by some people pursuing personal vendettas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have never in my parliamentary career said anything inside this place which I would not have said outside this place without the protection of parliamentary privilege. I am not about to change that tonight. I will simply say that I would never comment publicly on my private life and I would certainly never comment on anybody else's private life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Politics is, above all, frustrating. We all come into this place excited by the opportunities to change, if not the world, at least our society in some way. Most of us do not achieve all that we have hoped for. I felt that in 1993 when I lost the seat of Lowe and I feel that again today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So many activities in the health area are about to burst into flower: changes to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, the Australian Hearing Services, the Australian Government Health Service and the Therapeutic Goods Administration, just to mention a few. Some have clearly had an impact already; some are yet to do so. I am delighted that those areas are now in the very capable hands of Chris Ellison, who is not only a good friend but a very fine and able parliamentarian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to pay a compliment here to Michael Wooldridge, the Minister for Health and Family Services, who is my dearest friend in parliament and godfather to my youngest son. I would like to praise him for his humanity but also for having the courage to grasp the various nettles in the health arena and not being afraid to take some of those necessary tough decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also would like to add my enormous regard for two senior public servants in my field: Ian Lindenmayer and Mary Murnane. Both have been excellent examples of the perfect public servant&mdash;with wise, impartial views and sensible perspicacious advice. It was a pleasure to work with both of them, together with so many other public servants. The body of the Public Service is very much maligned, but it really is overflowing with very competent individuals.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1512">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like in this last speech just to touch briefly upon some of the current directions of politics which really concern me. Others in this place and outside it have already mentioned the role of the High Court. I genuinely believe that, with decisions like the Wik case, our democracy is at real risk of being subverted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Putting aside the question of the actual Wik decision, the High Court has clearly, partially at least, taken over the role of our democratically elected representatives. They now see themselves as law makers rather than law interpreters. Given their non-accountability to the people of Australia, this is a development which gives rise to enormous concern to me and I know to many others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have concerns about the increasing power of the ACCC. Whilst most of us here&mdash;I think on both sides of this chamber&mdash;strongly believe in the virtues of competition, this commission really has become such a nitpicking organisation which has lost sight of the overall plan and which has the potential to hamstring some of our Australian industries. I hope they are able to raise their eyes from the small print on the desk to the broader horizons of our national future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I had initially planned that I would leave this place last week. Although the ALP&mdash;which behaved very fairly in all of this&mdash;offered to pair me for party divisions, my concern was to ensure that the vote on the Kevin Andrews euthanasia bill was not affected by my resignation. I am delighted that Winston Crane&mdash;who was not able to be here tonight, who would have taken a different position from me on that bill&mdash;has very graciously offered to abstain from the division, although I am sure he will make his views very clear during the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue is one which I have been very close to during my years as an oncologist, as a cancer specialist. I have no doubt&mdash;and I think many others here would share my view&mdash;that often the dose of morphine needed to relieve pain may shorten patients lives by minutes, hours or sometimes even more. I have no problem with that at all. What I have enormous problems with is the concept of legislating for euthanasia. I believe the law is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> too blunt an instrument for this. I have no doubts that it can potentially be open to misuse or abuse, both by the well meaning and also by the unscrupulous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fair to say that these issues which I have touched upon very briefly&mdash;democracy, and building a competitive but very fair and humane society&mdash;are central to all of us here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remain very confident that the government, now just beginning its second year, will continue with the great start it has had. I sense that we are now better in touch with the reins of power. I think it took a while, after 13 long years in opposition, but I am sure that under John Howard's leadership the country really now has the ability to fulfil its potential in every sense&mdash;social as well as economic. I look forward to watching it, albeit from the sidelines now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to thank my friends and my colleagues&mdash;particularly, but not only, on this side of the chamber. I have made some very good and very close friendships. It has been very important to me. I look forward to continuing those friendships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to thank the very many members of the public and the Liberal Party in particular who have been so supportive. The strength and the warmth of that support that we have received from all quarters has been absolutely overwhelming, and we are truly grateful. Being a senator has been a great privilege. I thank those responsible for extending that privilege to me.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1512"><TITLE>Senator Woods: Retirement</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond briefly to the final words of Senator Bob Woods in this place and to wish him well in his retirement. In some ways I think it has been a frustrating political career for Bob.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was the member for Lowe from 1987 until 1993, when he left lower house politics through no choice of his own. He stayed involved in the organisation of the Liberal Party and held senior office within it. He then joined us in the Senate, where he has been for some years as well. He has not really said 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1513"> it&mdash;although he was generous in what he said about the role of the Senate and so forth&mdash;but I think his passion was more with the lower house.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do find&mdash;don't we, Senator Short and others?&mdash;that we inherit some who have had that lower house experience. We like to think that it is their choice&mdash;I see Senator Tambling grinning&mdash;as the role of the house of review is a different type of politics and it has a different role within our parliamentary system. I fear that most of them, if you give them the choice, would say that they would have preferred to stay where they were. I think that was probably the case with Bob.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it has been an interrupted political career, and he leaves it again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bob mentioned his life before coming into politics and the time he spent as a cancer specialist. I understand that is an area in which he was held with great respect. I am told in particular of his contribution in helping set up the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research and also the Cancer Treatment Centre at Concord Hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at his record as a parliamentarian, we will recall his contribution through various parliamentary committees: the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise in Sydney, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, the Joint Statutory Committee of Public Accounts and others. Therefore, he made a very willing and worthwhile contribution to our parliamentary committee system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My memory of Bob will be particularly related to that period in which he was opposition spokesman for health, from 1990 to 1993, in which I worked close quite closely with him. It is one of those periods when we were seeking to develop the perfect health policy&mdash;as every shadow spokesperson has ever done and found that it is an enormous challenge. In the work that Bob did in the development of that policy, you could sense his passion for medicine and his passion to contribute to a better health system in this country. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, he did not quite achieve the goal that I know he would have wanted to&mdash;that is, to have the opportunity to implement health policy as a minister in this place. Nevertheless, he has played a very valuable role in the help that he has given to the Minister for Health and Family Services, Michael Wooldridge, and the help that he has given to many of us as we have had these complex debates on good health policy for this country over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the time of Senator Bob Woods's final speech in this place and his retirement, I certainly wish him well in whatever is his next career. We all know there is life after politics and Bob will prove it, as others have who have gone before him. I hope he does find another satisfying career and I also hope his family finds happiness in his retirement.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1513"><TITLE>Senator Woods: Retirement</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will briefly say a few words on behalf of the opposition in this valedictory debate. As Senator Hill has said, Senator Woods had two terms as the member for Lowe in the House of Representatives, elected in 1987 and 1990. I remember those campaigns well. I remember the nature of those campaigns.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the period from 1990 to 1993, when Senator Woods was the then opposition spokesperson on health, I must say that I thought he had a very tough job.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would certainly like to associate myself with the remarks of those who have spoken. Bob Woods is, I think, a special character in this place, not least of all because we are very fortunate when we have people who come into the chamber with very high level qualifications. To have a person who is active on the policy front is often necessary but not sufficient in this game. What you also need to be is an effective politician. I think we would all acknowledge that Bob has been steeped in politics. He has loved it as a game, as a commitment, as a public service. I think he has performed the combination of those two roles very effectively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was certainly there in the hard years in opposition. He reached the heights of the shadow cabinet and he was really, I think, in a very difficult position&mdash;not only having to solve the problems of health policy but also having to hold on to a marginal seat at the same time. He was able to bring the lessons he learnt from that experience into play in recent years in coordinating the marginal seats committee in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the real test of his commitment to public service in politics was the decision he made after he lost the election in Lowe to actually continue to pursue a political career. It is very easy to walk away, to go back to the private sector, undoubtedly with a great deal of professional promise and reward ahead. But to say, `No, I'm still attracted'&mdash;fatally attracted for a number of us, I suppose&mdash;`to the sport and science of politics and I am prepared to sacrifice the profession that I could pursue outside for the profession inside parliament,' I think was a measure of his commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am sure he feels that in a number of ways he is leaving this place prematurely, but I think we all understand why he feels the need to do it at this time. I think he should look back on his years in politics and be aware that we all acknowledge that he did make a very

I express my appreciation for your dedication to the people through this parliament and also for the job you did in this place as parliamentary secretary to Michael Wooldridge. I know that you brought a new look to things in that particular arena. You were aware of a number of things that would face health in this country over the next few years and you took the long-term view. You realised the dangers of, for example, destructive human embryo experimentation and also cloning. I think it is worth while, if I may, just to read the poem of Leunig's cartoon in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 17 February on cloning of the clown. It reads:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was with regret that I recently learned that Bob Woods had decided to resign from this place. As his successor as parliamentary secretary to the minister for health, I can tell this chamber and the wider community of just some of the achievements that have occurred under Bob's stewardship of that position in the last 12 months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his time as parliamentary secretary Bob drew on his vast experience and substantial intellect to ensure that this government's approach to health and health reform was delivering the best outcomes for all Australians. Before becoming a parliamentarian, Bob was an oncologist of note. He transferred his commitment to society into politics and he worked as shadow minister for health and a member of shadow cabinet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he was appointed parliamentary secretary, his responsibilities included some of the most active areas of health reform, including food regulation, medicinal products, hearing services and government health 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1516"> services. Along with reform and good management, Bob has been instrumental in ensuring the passage of difficult but necessary budget legislation. A substantial part of the great volume of groundwork he has done in only a relatively short time. The groundwork he has completed has left these portfolio responsibilities in good shape. I want to thank Bob for his kind comments on my succession. However, I must say that I approach it with some trepidation in view of the example that he has set before me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that Bob mentioned that so many things are about to burst into flower, and indeed that is the case. I would draw the attention of the Senate and of the wider community to just some of the things that Bob has done. With the Australia New Zealand Food Authority, Bob completed the formalisation of our nation's harmonisation of food standards with New Zealand. He personally drove the debate on the introduction of genetically modified foods and oversaw the greatest reform of our nation's food hygiene laws ever. This progress pursued the overarching goal of ensuring high standards of health for all Australians while removing unnecessary burdens from industry. I say that with special reference to small business food outlets. I believe that Bob achieved a balance between a viable food production and processing industry on the one hand and consumer rights and health and safety standards on the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He also drove reform in the area of hearing services. With the corporatisation of the Australian Hearing Service now in hand and the development of a new voucher system for people eligible for government hearing services now the subject of legislation, Bob has brought to life the best current thinking of industry and consumers in order to not only deliver what people had been calling for but to do so in a manner which is fiscally responsible and provides quality of service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the area of drug regulation and supply, Australia's unique system is the envy of the world, but more than a decade of mismanagement by the previous government was taking us down the path where drug approvals were unfairly slow and the growth of the pharma 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ceutical benefits scheme was out of control, potentially damaging our whole health system. Through facilitating consensus and incorporating the government's overarching economic and social themes, Bob began reform which has seen the time taken for approval for medicinal products shortened without any impact on proper health and safety checks. The foundations have also been laid for restraining the growth of the PBS without restricting people's access to well priced medicines. In relation to the Therapeutic Goods Administration, a response is about to be formulated in relation to a report commissioned by Bob Woods, and I hope I do that response justice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reforms I have mentioned will result in quality outcomes and improvements in the health system. Although they will take time to measure and appreciate, there is one measure of Bob's effectiveness which I can relate now. In my new role as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services, I have found that consumer, industry, community and other groups all speak very highly of Bob and the work he has done. Bob is held in high regard by an enormous variety of people with whom he has worked closely. These endorsements I am experiencing from a diverse range of people and groups and they speak volumes for his effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am saddened to see his resignation and I am sorry that he will not see the bursting into flower of some of these initiatives that he has set in train. I am lucky to have followed him and I congratulate him on the work that he has done, and I think this should be brought to the attention of the Australian people. I have enjoyed working with Bob as a trusted colleague and I wish both him and his family well for the future.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1516"><TITLE>Senator Woods: Retirement</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add my remarks briefly to those of the earlier speakers as the person who chaired Bob's preselection. Tonight, on behalf of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party, Bob, I would like to thank you for your service to the people of New South Wales, first as the member for Lowe from 1987 to 1993 and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1517"> then as a senator for your state from 1995 till today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Throughout his parliamentary career Senator Woods worked tirelessly to represent New South Wales constituents, particularly in the inner west and greater western Sydney areas. Senator Woods had his office in the centre of Sydney, Parramatta, to provide greater access to Liberalism in what had been before the last election&mdash;thankfully no longer&mdash;a Labor area. It is very much thanks to Bob Woods and his work in that area that we achieved that result. It was Bob's key role in the 1996 federal election campaign which helped to turn the tide against Labor and saw a record win for us in New South Wales. Of 12 new Liberal seats won in New South Wales, four were won by women, including the extra seat in this house by Helen Coonan. This was done without quotas or tokens, I might add.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When people make the unselfish decision to leave the often more profitable private sector and take up the great and onerous task of public service, as I said in my maiden speech, the cost of political commitment is both high and well documented. Unfortunately, Senator Woods leaves the Senate today under unparalleled media scrutiny of his private life. The ugly Fleet Street nature of the media intrusion into the private life of a public person has set a dangerous precedent. I would like to commend the opposition for their respect for the private life of their Senate colleague, and I hope that they join with me in condemnation of the tabloids' venture into dirty backyard journalism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one door closes, Bob, another opens. I wish you and your family all the best in these difficult times and hope that you find a fulfilling future together, and that God's light shines upon you. Thank you, Bob.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="1517"><TITLE>Senator Woods: Retirement</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly to wish my colleague Senator Woods well as he leaves this place. When we come to this place, we come with 75 other colleagues, many of whom remain only acquaintances for the duration of their time here. Some become friends; some become very good friends. Then 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there are others whose company we enjoy a lot on both sides of the chamber. Bob Woods is one of those people whose company many of us on this side have always enjoyed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was looking through the list of senators tonight who have resigned. I have been in this place less than five years, and I think Bob takes it over the halfway mark of those senators who have left since I joined this place less than five years ago. That indicates a very high attrition rate, but it also indicates some of the stresses placed on people in modern public life. In less than five years, I think 38 senators have come and gone since I came into this place. That speaks a lot of the pressure many people are placed under in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I join with the comments that Senator Heffernan has made. What I regret most is the nature of Senator Woods leaving this place. When newspapers and the media have to resort to telescopic lenses to make a story for their papers, it is not the sort of Australia that I want to live in. I always understood that reporters were there to report the news, not to make the news, and that people took a career in journalism not in commentating. It seems as though every reporter wants to be a news maker, not a news reporter and every journalist wants to be a commentator, not someone who reports the facts as they really stand.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the media's response over the past month to both Senator Woods's private life and the allegations made against other senators in this place, many things have been written that are incorrect and many assumptions have been made that do the media no credit. I do not think they do Australian society any credit either. I guess it is up to this chamber or the parliament as a whole to determine how the community should react to the sorts of pressures that individuals are placed under by a media which has no respect for privacy whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bob, you came into this place with a very successful career. You leave at an age when I am quite sure you have time to make another very successful career. I certainly wish you well. I know that lots of your colleagues who enjoyed your company on this side will

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I could not let tonight go by without thanking Senator Woods for the work that he has done in terms of the health committees of the parliament since his arrival here. I have been in this parliament for 12 years, and I have found that the arrival of Senator Woods and Dr Wooldridge put a breath of fresh air into the Liberal Party in terms of health policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Woods well knows, I have had a very long, deep and abiding interest in a lot of alternative health therapies. I believe the Commonwealth need not be spending the money that it is spending if there is a cheaper and more effective way&mdash;even if it is thus untried&mdash;which is a real alternative. It was extremely refreshing to find people like Senator Woods and Dr Wooldridge who were not only interested in and aware of these alternatives but also prepared to consider those alternatives with someone with a deep and long interest in them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a real plus for me when I ended up sitting besides Senator Woods. Unfortunately for him, I would chew his ear off at every question time. It was something that I really cherished. I think it has been an interesting shift in terms of Liberal Party policy in the way in which we have looked at health over the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So to you, Senator, I say a huge thank you for the contribution that you have made. You have been a terrific friend. You have been a lovely guy to work with. As I have said to everyone since the controversy broke, `Hey, hold on, I sit beside Bob, and I know the type of guy he is.' He is someone I am proud to know and proud to call a friend. To you, Senator, to Jane and your three children, I say good luck and good fortune. The time that has passed has not been easy.

We all get pushed together into this place, and the whole lot of us are under attack at the moment in every way you can think of by the media.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps in some ways you are lucky to be getting out of this place.

You know in your own heart how hard you have worked for your constituents. We know how hard you have worked for your constituents.

You cannot get together in here or while you are busy, but at least after the bells ring and we get away from this place we can enjoy ourselves in a social manner and get to know each other better. There is no better way to do that than representing this country on an overseas trip, as you and I did in Bucharest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After having heard all the wonderful things that you have achieved in medicine, I must say that I do have some doubts about your effectiveness as a doctor, having been with you in Bucharest and seeing what happened after a few days.
