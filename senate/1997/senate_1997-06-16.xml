<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These are amendments to subsection 164(7)(c) of the definition of `mining operations'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are supporting this government amendment. As the minister has explained, this involves a change in the definition in the bill about direct journeys. The amendment in the bill reflects, I think, initially, a lack of understanding of the complexity of modern mining by the government when it framed this provision. Consultations between the government and the community, since this bill has got public exposure has, I think, shifted the government's view on this. It was our intention, had that view not changed, to have of course sought to amend the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has briefly explained what the purpose of it is. But the change sought here will mean that direct journeys can be varied according to whether they encompass other activities which ought to attract the diesel fuel rebate. It is the case in modern mining, for example, that a locomotive may well run from the mine to the beneficiation plant to a port and return by a different route, but which encompasses all of those three things or, in fact, a direct route. All of the activities that it undertakes by going from the mine to the plant to the port, which attract the diesel fuel rebate, are now encompassed by virtue of this amendment. For those reasons, and because the government has shown some good sense in listening to the views of the industry sector, we support this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Taken together with amendment No. 11, which I am co&hyphen;moving at the present time, amendment No. 9 will enable, I think, proper recognition to be given to service vessels for offshore activity and will allow, under amendment No. 11, similar services on land, but within the mining lease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just explain that briefly. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that, where activities such as the oil and gas extraction occurring on the north&hyphen;west shelf of Western Australia is undertaken, service vessels servicing those offshore rigs will be entitled to claim the diesel fuel rebate for the activity that they undertake in so servicing those rigs. When we had this matter before us last, I instanced the example of the Piper Alpha 1989 disaster. Senators will recall that Piper Alpha was an offshore oil rig in the North Sea. It was engulfed in a fireball, leading to massive destruction, loss of life and damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a consequence of that disaster in offshore oil and gas extraction, a review was done in Australia of the safety provisions for offshore oil and gas operations. As a consequence of that, a series of measures were put in place to ensure that no Australian oil rig, offshore from our coast, would go through a similar experience as Piper Alpha and the disaster that followed; that is, a series of safety checks were prudently and legitimately made and, learning from the British experience, a sensible arrangement has been put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of those sensible arrangements is for a vessel to stand off an oil rig for safety purposes. This is a mandatory requirement. The vessel needs to be there in case of some emergency on the rig which leads to immediate evacuation of the personnel from that rig. In the seas in which our oil rigs operate, it is fair to say that they are inhospitable and downright dangerous. Humans rapidly evacuating an oil rig would be at considerable risk. The purpose of the safety vessel is to provide 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> back&hyphen;up facilities in the case of an emergency evacuation, which ought to lead to the protection and saving of human lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a mandatory requirement and I have taken some time to explain the reasoning behind it. Under the provisions taken together of the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996 and the act, this is not regarded as a function that ought to attract the diesel fuel rebate. I would argue, and do, that, because it is essential to the operation of the rig for safety reasons, it is essential to the operation of mining&mdash;mining in this case being defined as the extraction of natural gas or oil. Therefore, there is a case in principle, because there is no discrimination on behalf of the companies&mdash;nor should there be; it should be a clear regulation&mdash;that this is an area that ought to attract the rebate. That is, in the first part, the case we put today in support of this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the second part, what is true is that there is a considerable intercourse between an offshore rig and the shore. That is necessary in ferrying equipment and personnel to and from the offshore rig, in ferrying supplies and stores to and from the rig and in ferrying maintenance equipment and so on to and from the rig. It is, in our view, appropriate to regard those activities as essential to the operation of drilling and extracting the gas or the oil. To put it the other way around, if one considers this operation without those services being provided, you could very quickly see that the whole thing is reduced to a farce, that in fact you could not have the carrying on of this activity if those services were withheld.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first people to complain&mdash;or, in this case, maybe the second people to complain&mdash;if those services were withheld by industrial action would be the government complaining that this had brought the whole operation to a close. They would have a point because it would do that. By not providing the diesel fuel rebate they, in fact, tax the provision of these services to and from the offshore facility. While that will not bring the offshore facility to a close, it is, nonetheless&mdash;and I reference my earlier remarks about this in the debate on the second reading&mdash;a direct tax as an input tax on the operation of the extraction 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4162"> of oil and gas and, therefore, a tax that pushes up the price of the final product. To some extent, therefore, we run the risk of becoming less competitive in the international marketplace in which this commodity, LNG, is traded. It is also a tax which is totally inescapable for the purposes of this operation. One can argue whether or not these sorts of taxes should be levied. I do not think anyone can argue that the service vessels are not essential to the operation. Amendment No. 9 supports that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Amendment No. 11 would allow for similar services within a mining lease on land to apply. Vehicles used for the delivery of those services within the lease itself would be eligible for the rebate. For the reasons that I have cited above, one can see the support for it within a landlocked situation. It is clear that, on a mining lease, there needs to be the ferrying of equipment, supplies, stores, individuals, personnel and maintenance equipment around the lease in order to keep the mining operation going. I think it is, therefore, clear to argue that such an undertaking is essential to the operation of that lease. If the personnel did not arrive, if the stores did not turn up, if the maintenance parts were not on time, then the efficient operation of the lease would be impaired and, in certain circumstances, may be brought to a halt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By not providing the rebate in these circumstances, a tax is being extracted on the operation of the mining&mdash;nothing more or less than that. It is our view, given the discussions that have been going on about the operation in core areas of mining activity between the government and the private sector, that this amendment should be made and the government should accept it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the view of the government that Senator Cook's arguments are illogical in that, where you have goods, people or services transported to a mining lease on land, those particular vehicles are not eligible for the diesel fuel rebate. Where there is any logic at all within the diesel fuel rebate itself, that sort of logic in this particular instance should prevail. They do not apply on land as it now stands. In regard to safety issues&mdash;and this refers to the work boats that go around the platforms&mdash;I would also like to draw the chamber's attention to the fact that safety vehicle&hyphen;type operations on land mining leases, such as ambulances and things like that, do not attract the diesel fuel rebate. The diesel fuel rebate is there for what is termed `eligible purposes', that is, the mining operation, not the ancillary services that go with it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also point out that opposition amendment No. 11 would make transport by rail and sea of inputs to mining eligible for rebate.

If it dealt with the issues of specific safety and such things as fire trucks, then I think there would be a good case for it. It is more a general amendment and it deals with all service vessels to offshore rig vessels. There is always pressure to extend the rebate scheme in various ways to peripheral uses. Some things, such as environmental rehabilitation, the Senate obviously agrees to and some things it does not.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment is, I think, one of the more important ones that we will deal with in this legislation. I note that, on the running sheet, following this amendment from the opposition is an amendment from the Australian Democrats on a similar subject within the broad topic. While I think the opposition amendment is superior, and I hope the Democrats vote for the opposition amendment, if the opposition amendment does not pass, I will signify that we will support the Democrats' 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4164"> amendment. But that would be a second-best option by a long way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue concerns what is colloquially known in the debate over the diesel fuel rebate as light vehicles. Vehicles of 3.5 tonnes or less are excluded within the bill from attracting the rebate where they operate on a mining lease. Clearly what the government has in mind is that only heavy equipment and heavier tonnage vehicles will attract the rebate; vehicles at or below 3.5 tonnes in weight will not. It is hard to understand the reasoning for the government position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, before I go to that, I want to go back to the high&hyphen;level negotiating group that was created to represent the industry in negotiations with the government. The high&hyphen;level negotiating group, I remind the Senate, has the task of working out which areas of claims the industry would agree to forgo rebate in and which areas of claims the government would recognise and continue with for the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This whole argument devolved into a debate around whether there should be a cap on the amount of rebate claimed&mdash;that is to say, irrespective of the merit of the claims by particular companies, claims under the diesel fuel rebate for the mining sector would be capped at a certain figure and, if legitimate claims were made that exceeded that figure because of the growth and expansion of this industry, then all claims would have to be reshuffled and the total payout would be limited by the amount of the cap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the negotiations with the government the industry perspective was to argue for the government to recognise that there should be no cap in the core areas of their entitlement and conceded, with a gun at their head, as I argued earlier, other areas in order to win recognition from the government that the rebate remain uncapped. The response from the government is unsatisfactory. It has not specifically ruled out the prospect of capping the rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the issues that were put on the table by the government on the very last day of quite an extensive round of negotiations with the high level negotiating group was this issue of vehicles weighing 3.5 tonnes or less. It was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> put on without notice, with the government demanding that this be included within the package. The APPEA, the body that represents the petroleum and gas industry in Australia, and the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, a body that represents mining companies and explorers, did not agree to and sign a package which contained the 3.5 tonne vehicles&mdash;the item that the government had put on without notice on the very last day of the negotiations, demanding that it be included.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a matter of record that the government has not agreed with the cap. What is also now a matter of public notoriety is that the Department of Finance is pursuing a course in which they are proposing within the government structure that a cap on claims for diesel fuel rebate in this industry sector be applied. This early paper from within the government's own Department of Finance has created an angry response from the industry because it is seen as a betrayal by the government of the original negotiations that the industry entered into with it in order to secure a no cap situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Various government spokesmen at various times have tried to indicate that the somewhat merely mouthed response to the claims for a no cap implies that, `Well, you're lucky we haven't yet imposed a cap and therefore you've got a cap agreement.' That type of merely mouthed debate is now, of course, turned on its head with positive moves to in fact impose a cap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the government did not come good with its side of the bargain in the high level negotiating talks and has remained somewhat aside from actually honouring the undertaking that has been sought up until now. We know that within government there are now positive moves to impose a cap. That has caused representatives of the mining industry to be in Canberra today and, I understand, later today to meet with the government again to have high level negotiations in order to try to reach an agreement that there should be no cap on diesel fuel rebate claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know in this debate the Democrats take the view that there should be a cap. That view is supported by the Greens, who would take a stronger view that there should be no rebate 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4165"> at all. The government is proposing that those matters traded by the industry in order to secure no cap should now be picked up and put through in legislation. So all of the industry concessions are taken and none of the government concessions are made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that in mind, the opposition supports industry moves, particularly those of the APPEA and AMEC, on 3.5 tonne vehicles. At the end of the day, if you are going to negotiate you have to negotiate in good faith, and this is a clear case of a lack of good faith by the government, of ambushing the industry on the last day, of insisting that the ambushed claim in fact be part of the package and that industry should just simply wear it, and of then selling out the industry position by now debating the imposition of a cap. In broad terms, our amendment is moved against that background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn to the specific issues of vehicles of 3.5 tonnes or less on a mining site, in particular what sorts of vehicles they are and whether they are essential to mining operations. These vehicles transport machine parts, personnel and staff around a site, and pick up and return samples or spares that need to be moved around a site. There are usually vehicles dedicated for this purpose. They are easily recognised. They are easily metered in order to assess what amount of fuel they consume and what the rebate would be. It is, again, impossible to say that they are not integral to the mining operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A piece of heavy equipment which attracts the rebate is essential to the mining operation. It is facile to say that one piece of lighter equipment which services the maintenance needs of and provides the personnel who operate that item of heavy equipment is not essential to the mining operation. By drawing an arbitrary line between types of equipment based on their weight is to artificially crimp the entitlement for this rebate simply for fiscal needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no other argument in principle which we can say justifies the drawing of the line here. There is no argument which says that both items of equipment are not essential to a mining operation, because both are. Looking at it even in the specific, it is clear 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the government's position here is just arbitrary and therefore taken for fiscal reasons&mdash;that is, to save as much money as possible without looking at the essential character of the operations concerned&mdash;and therefore specifically there is no argument in merit or principle that can be raised by the government about this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, as well, taken against the broad canvas of how these negotiations have been conducted, it would be a travesty if the government did not come clean and recognise that this amendment should pass. Its conduct in these negotiations, as I have said, has been the conduct of holding a gun at the industry's head in order to extract concessions and then claiming at the end of the day that that is an agreement when, clearly, the facts of this matter are that it is not. It is for those reasons that I have moved my amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will not support these amendments. Let me just speak briefly as to why. The government was faced with excessive growth of the diesel fuel rebate and, in that context, it sat down with the industry to work out ways and means of stopping that excessive growth. A lot of it was to do with loopholes within the Customs Act and decisions that were made by the AAT and courts. Let me make the point very clear: the exclusion of the 3.5 tonne vehicles was actually offered up by the industry in the discussions. There was no gun at anyone's head. The reasoning behind it, I guess, was that in the main these sorts of vehicles are not used for actual mining purposes. They are not used to excavate coal, they are not used to haul coal and they are not used to process coal. In many cases&mdash;and I can say this because it is an industry I know very well&mdash;those vehicles are used at the mine by inspectors and a range of people like that who go around looking at mines, and for people to travel to and from work.</PARA></TALK.START>

If the government wishes to do so, the Greens WA will support it. I think that a lot of smaller vehicles are used around large mining sites for various reasons and, effectively, if government wishes to reduce the mining rebate by limiting it to large vehicles, that is fine. It really does not matter to us whether these vehicles are legitimately used in mining or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting, however, that the major argument that has been used on a number of occasions by the coalition is that the reason this diesel fuel tax should not be charged is that these roads are private roads. It would seem to me that the actual number of vehicles used on private mining roads is probably greater in the under 3.5 tonne category than it is for the larger variety carrying equipment, but I have not seen the figures on that. It is interesting logic and it is interesting that the companies themselves have offered that up.</PARA>

It might be all right for the big end of town&mdash;for those companies in the minerals council&mdash;but most of the members of the companies that are typically covered by APPEA and AMEC, while many of them could be characterised as big end of town mining companies, are the small mining entrepreneurs.</PARA>

There are all of the headline companies&mdash;the eight major oil companies&mdash;in APEA, but most of their members are still the smaller companies. When you talk about these associations, it is these smaller aggressive entrepreneurial mining and oil and gas companies that are carrying the exploration effort in this country. They are the ones who use vehicles of this size in the carriage of that exploration effort.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Schedule 1, item 21, page 11 (line 2), after "used", insert "or a vehicle that is principally used in relation to prospecting".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment covers some of the areas covered earlier by Senator Cook for Labor. The Australian Democrats believe that prospectors undertake an essential high-risk and difficult task for the mining industry. This amendment is particularly directed to that sector of the mining industry. The prospector's end of the industry is a major small business and entrepreneurial sector. The Liberal-National Party government has already ended a tax exemption concession&mdash;paragraph 23PA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, which applied to prospectors&mdash;so they have already had a major hit on their profitability and their ability to operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's decision in the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) to end the diesel fuel rebate for light vehicles which weigh under 3.5 tonnes gross is another hit at this small business sector. Light vehicles are the main off&hyphen;road item used in prospecting. The diesel fuel rebate has consistently been advanced, in terms of its credibility, as a rebate provided for off&hyphen;road activity. If any off&hyphen;road activity is carried out, it is for prospecting. These vehicles and the equipment on them are frequently the major item of investment and the major piece of equipment used by prospectors. So to attack an item of funding on which prospectors have relied would fundamentally alter their ability to carry on their business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wish to deal with the issues raised earlier by Senator Cook. My reading of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> scenario is as follows: when the high level group sat opposite the government, they were given an ultimatum. They knew that they had to find savings. They asked themselves, `What can we offer up, or give up, which is least harmful to us and which we can most manage?' Of course, the big end of town&mdash;as described by Senator Cook&mdash;was bound to offer up those who were weakest in the situation, who were least well&hyphen;represented in the discussions of the high level group and who were least able to defend themselves. Those people offered up, as an item affecting them, one of the most important constituents of the mining business&mdash;just passed the prospectors by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my view that prospectors do what is probably the most difficult and often the most unrewarded task in the mining industry. Many of them barely scrape a living, and some of them do rather well, which is probably what keeps all of them going. There are literally thousands and thousands of these people. They are the small end of town. When we are seeking to limit and reduce DFR, whether it is on a cap or an abolition basis, they should be the last, not the first, to go. It is for that reason we have introduced our amendment. We have sought to include `vehicles that are principally used in relation to prospecting'. We think that that will cover the concerns and the problems that I have outlined. Accordingly, I commend the amendment to the chamber.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure to whom I should direct my question. As I have mentioned before, often the principal argument as to why diesel fuel rebate is not a subsidy is that the roads that are used by vehicles for which the diesel fuel rebate is claimed often are roads that are created by the companies. This is the question in the case of prospecting: when these vehicles use roads, what kinds of roads do they use? I put it that, as they are prospecting, they would be using existing roads&mdash;perhaps existing roads produced by councils or governments, and they potentially may ask permission to use existing mining roads. I am not sure how that works.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is an interesting issue. It has been said again and again that the diesel fuel rebate is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4169"> not a subsidy and that the reason it is not a subsidy is that the vehicles did not use, or do damage to, the existing roads paid for by taxpayers or ratepayers. This is the salient question&mdash;I use their own logic; I did not go with it in the first place, but I will use that same logic now&mdash;when prospecting vehicles use roads, what kinds of roads do they use?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to both you, Senator Margetts, and you, Senator Murray, let me make the point from the beginning that it was not an ultimatum to the industry. If you go to any mine site, whether it be metalliferous, a coalmine, or one involving oil or gas onshore, you will find that a lot of the vehicles used are four&hyphen;wheel drives and that the usage of them is fairly high. The industry saw the measure as a way of limiting what could have been seen as the excessive growth of the diesel fuel rebate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of Senator Margetts's question, one of the major problems in this whole thing is that those vehicles could be expected to use a fair bit of public roads&mdash;apart from just, having got to a lease or a prospective site, using their vehicle on that prospective site. The problem with the amendment, and the very question that you have raised, is that, from our point of view, it is incapable of practical administration. If the amendment did go through&mdash;bearing in mind it was an agreement with the various industry groups, acknowledging what Senator Cook said&mdash;the savings to the government on light vehicles would be substantially reduced.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, I think that it has always been impractical to administer, which is one of the reasons why there was concern from not only 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this government but also the previous government about the excessive increase in the diesel fuel rebate for matters which were not considered to be the original intent of eligibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is our own bill which, in agreement with the industry, states that these vehicles&mdash;they basically are the four&hyphen;wheel drive vehicles which go around mine sites and are used in other areas&mdash;would no longer be eligible for the rebate. If your amendment went through, it would make it difficult, because of the sort of usage of those vehicles, to determine what is and what is not eligible. That is one of the problems we have had in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In discussions you and I had previously, Senator, you wondered whether there was some method we could use&mdash;I think through the income tax act&mdash;whereby people were designated as prospectors. I do not know whether you have checked up on it but I did and apparently there is no such list; it is done on a case&hyphen;by&hyphen;case basis.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are other issues too. I asked what kinds of roads and the minister indicated there would perhaps be substantial use of public roads. As these are off&hyphen;road vehicles, we could expect substantial off&hyphen;road transport going through into areas where there are not yet existing roads and in which tracks will eventually develop because of usage through the bush if they are going backwards and forwards. If that were the case, it would not be unreasonable to extract some sort of levy that might increase the government coffers because that does not necessarily involve rehabilitation if people are cutting roads through bush.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst obviously the Greens have been interested in the issue of small business, it does seem a bit odd to put a bracket around small business related to mining when similar subsidies are not available to other small businesses of the same value&hyphen;adding nature or other industries which are needed for creating jobs throughout Australia. I have been listening to the argument but whether or not it involves use of publicly provided roads or whether or not it involves use of the bush to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4170"> get to sites to find out, I have not yet seen an argument sufficient to sway me that there should not be a diesel fuel tax applied in this regard.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition reluctantly supports this amendment: reluctantly because we cleave to the view that our earlier amendment, which has now been defeated, was the appropriate amendment to make. This is now a fall back and a considerable dilution of the value that ought to flow to industry. Nonetheless, given that our headline amendment has been lost, this is at least something and the case for this is quite compelling. Therefore we support the Democrat amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In support I want to say a couple of things. Let us go back to first principles here. There is a diesel fuel tax in Australia and that tax is levied for the purpose of extracting from road users a tax which can then go towards the maintenance and building of roads around the country. What we are talking about here are not vehicles which classically use those roads, rather we are talking about exploration vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think, with respect to her, Senator Margetts is right. Exploration vehicles may well use the Queen's highways in this country from time to time but that is not their purpose. Their purpose is to go off&hyphen;road and explore. You do not explore for minerals, oil and gas in Australia from major highways. That is clearly the case. When these vehicles are off the highways and are not using the roads or contributing to their wear and tear, extraction of a tax in order to maintain those roads is, in terms of the principle at stake here, wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite what it said about the use of exploration vehicles on major highways, I do not think the government would, if really pressed, try to pretend to argue that the reason why the tax will be imposed on these vehicles if the government gets its way is their use on highways. I think that is a farcical allegation and one that is easily defeated. It is an allegation from which the government would move away pretty rapidly when confronted with strenuous argument on it, irrespective of the fact that the minister has put it to us this afternoon.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first principle involved here is that the tax is levied for the purposes of maintenance and construction of roads in Australia. These vehicles do not use those roads, therefore it is appropriate that they attract the rebate. That is what the rebate is for. To bring them into the bag where they do not attract the rebate and where they have to pay the tax is to just regard them as, without intending to make a pun, a vehicle for taxation purposes alone&mdash;a revenue raiser. It is not related to the principles under which the rebate or the tax are to be applied in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On first principles I do not think the government has any case whatsoever. There is a matter, though, that has been raised by the Greens which is substantial and needs to be recognised. That argument goes&mdash;to paraphrase my impression of Senator Margetts' argument&mdash;`We do not think they are actually used on highways so we&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You indicated that you do not think that they are used on highways to any extent; they are used off&hyphen;road. Your argument, as I understand it, is that if they are used off&hyphen;road for exploration purposes they may then be doing some damage to minor roads&mdash;that is, ancillary roads&mdash;or to the environment and therefore no rebate should apply to them because they should make a contribution for that. I took the main point of your argument, in supporting the government's position, essentially that their off&hyphen;road use was being focused on more by you than their alleged on&hyphen;road use and that their off&hyphen;road use may well damage the environment in some form and therefore it is appropriate that they pay the full diesel fuel tax.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not a good precis? I am sure you will correct me, if you have the opportunity, in a minute. Let me focus on what part of that precis I understood to be the accurate part&mdash;that is, when they are off&hyphen;road they may be doing some damage in some form and therefore they ought to pay a tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be considerable justification in that argument but I think it is wrong to impose a tax meant for purpose A on a body 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4171"> because they may be justifiably attracting a tax under item Z. You cannot mix here. The tax ought to be specific for its purpose. Once you start arguing conveniently to bring into the case other things that may be the case you create a fuzzy and unfocused definition of what this tax is there for.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, if there is&mdash;and I have not yet conceded that there is&mdash;a case for a tax for environmental aspects of this, it should be under another heading specifically for what it stands for, rather than encompassed here for convenience's sake, and convenience's sake alone. Otherwise we will find that diesel fuel tax will be applied to all sorts of things for which it was never intended and taxpayers will rightfully rebel, arguing that these do not in fact encompass the definition of why this tax is being imposed. Therefore you will get into this terrible situation of people avoiding it or rejecting it or creating dispute about it. Tax should be simple and direct and stand for what it is applied to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In evidence before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee when the committee was considering the bill, was inquiring into it, the companies here did not say that they were not prepared to pay tax; they argued what sort of tax. They argued against a tax on business inputs, which a diesel tax is, and said that the appropriate tax to apply, if you are wanting to extract a tax from these companies, is one to their profits. That is the appropriate place, so that you do not push up their prices and make them uncompetitive by applying an input tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government heeded that view, in their thirst for fiscal consolidation and in their thirst to raise more and more funds out of this industry, they ought to take the industry at its word about its profits, rather than reject that or bypass it and attack the industry at its cost level by imposing more and more input taxes on this industry&mdash;and imposing them, I might add, in direct defiance of the government's own undertaking prior to the last election that they would not increase taxes in this country nor extend existing taxes. Here the impact is to extend existing taxes, and the only defence the minister has given is that in some cases of what is before us the industry have agreed. In 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> some cases they have agreed, but that does not absolve the government from the fact that, whether or not the taxpayer may agree to an extension because they have a gun held at their head and they have got no real choice, the government is here explicitly breaking its election undertaking about the extension of new taxes, because it is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, going to first principles on this argument, there is no justification for vehicles which are substantially for prospecting and which therefore are for off&hyphen;road use to have to pay a tax for the maintenance of major highways and the building of new roads in this country, because they do not use them. To the extent that they do use them, okay, tax them; but, to the extent that they do not use them, do not tax them and do not create a new category. And do not drag in side issues, irrespective of how important those side issues may be, as simply a justification that somehow the definition of this is elastic and you can impose a tax whether it was truly meant for that function or was meant for something else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point of view I wish to put here is the importance of exploration. I do not have a lot of time to put this point of view, so I will put it in summary form. The government has often made the point&mdash;it is a major booster for the industry in its rhetoric, as opposed to being a booster in its actions&mdash;that the future of the Australian mining, oil and gas industries resides with prospectors&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With exploration. Thank you, Minister. I agree that, if you do not have a healthy level of exploration going on in this sector, you cannot be sure about the long&hyphen;term future of this industry. We see that exploration increasingly these days is finding new and hitherto unrecognised associations of minerals, which opens up and challenges existing exploration paradigms and causes areas that people thought were well prospected to be looked at again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have, by imposing a tax on these vehicles, is the government in fact imposing a tax on exploration. I again say that the future of this industry is directly related to the level of exploration that is going on. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4172"> most sensitive strategic input for the future wellbeing of this industry, which is Australia's biggest export earner and employs a substantial number of Australians, is exploration, and the government is going to tax exploration. In the government's announcements previously about the importance and strategic value of exploration, there is absolutely no justification for that in these circumstances in economic theory, and there is no justification for this in fact either.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I could speak a lot longer on the question of the importance of exploration and the fact that we are now to have our exploration effort taxed, but in the short time available to me let me turn to the third point&mdash;one that the minister himself has produced in argument&mdash;as to why this amendment from the Australian Democrats should not proceed, the point I think rejected by Senator Murray. It is that the government is incapable of providing practical administration&mdash;those were the minister's words as I took them down&mdash;should this amendment go through. I do not accept that as an explanation. I think in this day and age to say that it is beyond the wit of, in this case, the customs department to devise a way to differentiate the use of exploration vehicles from other vehicles is rubbish. I think it is possible to define, and to do so relatively easily, the difference between a vehicle used for exploration purposes and for prospecting from vehicles used for other purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the only complication in this argument is when vehicles are used for prospecting and for other purposes and to what extent they are used for one or the other. But most of the vehicles that are used for prospecting, in my experience, are purpose built or dedicated to that purpose, and overwhelmingly the majority of them are easily identified. Frequently there is a rig or a drill installed on their tray, they carry equipment and are fitted out to carry equipment specifically for prospecting purposes, and it is not hard to know which are the ones for prospecting and exploration and which are the ones which are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has had no difficulty telling farmers, for example, in the use of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tractors or other farm equipment within the farm which may be used on road, how to assess the use of one function of that equipment against another function of that same equipment. If they can do it in those circumstances, why can they not do it in this circumstance? I just do not accept a blanket rejection that it is administratively impossible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do know that the rebate is, in effect, tax legislation. There is a whole industry out there geared to finding ways around the tax system&mdash;a whole industry based on saving money by tax avoidance and the promotion of tax minimisation schemes&mdash;and any amendments that are made will come under the scrutiny of that sector. That is true no matter what happens. I do not think the fact that there is an active industry putting these measures under scrutiny means that it is impossible to draft administrative arrangements in order to be avoidance&hyphen;proof. I again say, as an example, that the government believes that it has done so with respect to farmers; why it ought not apply the same effort and ingenuity to do so for miners is beyond me, but my time has expired and perhaps the minister might care to tell us.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to address some of the points that Senator Cook has made and also clarify what ended up being his paraphrase of my argument. Senator Cook comes from Western Australia and we all know&mdash;and especially if we are talking about purpose&hyphen;built exploration vehicles&mdash;that Western Australia is a very large state and you would not choose to go all the way to a location off&hyphen;road if you could choose not to. You would take the blacktops as far as you could, I imagine, to reduce time&mdash;time is money, especially to prospectors&mdash;and you would use existing roads where you could.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was not using my own argument in relation to roads and fuel taxes. I was actually throwing back the argument that is used by the industry in relation to excise on fuel taxes, because fuel taxes do not go directly to roads and nor should they. We should be helping to create alternatives to the use of roads where possible in many instances and, if it means that transporting for mining means that roads 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4173"> or tracks are being created, then yes, that is damage&mdash;it is real damage&mdash;and why should excise collected not be used for repairing that kind of damage. If we are supposedly using money to repair damage to roads, why not use it to repair the damage caused in creating tracks sometimes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no logic to that. We know that people say that fuel taxes should be used only for the repair of roads. I know that that is not necessarily the case. I think we have to say that the logic of Senator Cook's argument is not entirely there. It is not, as far as I understand it&mdash;and if there are any figures, it would be good to see them. I do not think the majority of travel done for prospecting is done off&hyphen;road. A lot of it is, certainly, but I think the very large distances in places like my state of Western Australia would indicate that a company would be likely to be located in places like Perth up to the point where they felt that they were going to go beyond the prospecting stage and set up a regional area from which they would be operating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you were travelling from Perth&mdash;up north or in the east, in the goldfields or even down south&mdash;to save money and to save your own vehicle as well, you would be using established roads as much as possible until you got to the point where you had to go off&hyphen;road.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Hill, the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Has the Australian government been approached by any other country with a view to boycotting the swearing&hyphen;in ceremony for China's appointed law making body for Hong Kong? What factors has Australia taken into account in making its decision as to whether to attend? Does the government endorse an appointed rather than an elected body?</PARA></TALK.START>

<ANSWER PAGE="4174" SPEAKER="Hill, Sen Robert" NAMEID="BH4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Environment" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly I do not know about Australia being approached by other parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Schacht &mdash;What do your briefing notes say?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator HILL &mdash;I am just looking at that. I am happy to seek further advice on that aspect of your question. I think the answer would probably be that, if it is a communication between governments, we would be reluctant to take you into our confidence. But, as I said, I will seek further advice on that part of the question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true, as you have said, that Australia has made the decision that we should be present at the swearing&hyphen;in of the Provisional Legislature. As Mr Downer said in a press statement on 22 December 1996:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian government considers it important that the Provisional Legislature should exist for as short a time as possible. Elections for a Legislative Council be held as soon as possible after the transfer of sovereignty, consistent with the undertakings by China under the Joint Declaration of Basic Law to provide an elected Legislative Council for Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On the basis of those undertakings that have been given, we are prepared to attend the swearing&hyphen;in of the Provisional Legislature. I think that by and large answers your question.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a very mediocre way, I must say. My supplementary question is: Minister, you said that the government favours an elected body replacing the provisional appointed body as soon as possible. Has the government determined yet what a time limit would be for `as soon as practicable'? Is it the end of this year, the end of 1998, or by July 1998? Or is this one of those things that can be stretched out forever and a day so that the Chinese government is under no pressure to have an elected assembly or council?</PARA></TALK.START>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>

<QUESTION PAGE="4174" SPEAKER="Patterson, Sen Kay" NAMEID="LI4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston. Minister, will you inform the Senate about the benefits to consumers from increased competition once the new Telecommunications Act takes effect from 1 July 1997? What benefits have overseas consumers already enjoyed from similar reforms?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4174" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some very interesting and exciting indications from offshore about what we can expect in the new deregulatory regime. Of course, if Labor had its way we would still have a wholly owned government carrier and we would not have anything like the amount of competition that we are facing up to now, because with a partly privatised telecommunications carrier there is a much greater incentive to ensure that it gets its cost structure right; that it does not just price a little below the market level or the official level set by price caps but that it really does start to dig deep. Once it does that, it sets the trend and others have to follow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there are some interesting examples. One that has come to mind is a recent study by the Henley Centre for Forecasting, entitled `The family shopping basket'. This is in the UK. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">UK living standards would be 10 times higher today if the weekly shopping bill had fallen in line with the cost of a phone call since 1975. A long distance call which cost 90p in 1975 costs less than 40p today.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="SCHACHT" NAMEID="4J4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator Schacht</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How much have local call charges gone up in England?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The local call charges would not even look like falling if we had had your pro-union, preselection convention approach taken to Telstra's cost structures, because Telstra has historically had amongst the highest local charges in the world. The reason they have had that is that you would not let them streamline; you would not let them get up to world best practice; you insisted on them finding plenty of jobs for your mates 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4175"> and not keeping their eye on the ball. They are doing that at long last. They are very grateful to be freed from the shackles of the constraints that you imposed. As a result we will start to see some really decent competition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the five years to April of this year the real price of a Sydney to Melbourne STD call has fallen by 33 per cent. The real price of an Australia&hyphen;USA IDD call fell by 21 per cent and the real cost of residential line rental fell by 24.2 per cent. That is just a taste of what is to come in a fully deregulated and competitive environment. What you will find is that, instead of having a duopoly for general carriers and a triopoly for mobile carriers, there will be an unlimited number of new entrants, and a number of those players are very keen to offer very substantial discounts. People like Tele 2000, WorldxChange, Primus Globestar and Northgate Communications are not just switch resellers; they are aggregators who are offering very substantial discounts. They are offering savings of up to 40 per cent and more on typical long distance and international bills. World Exchange has announced the provision of services to ACT customers allowing them to call interstate cities at 23c a minute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Productivity Commission recently found that Telstra and Optus charged something like five times as much per minute for international calls as the actual cost of that service. Of course, with some service providers offering calls for as little as 45c compared to the average cost of $1.11 charged by Optus and Telstra, we can expect that there will be very dramatic discounts. Phone calls on the Internet through providers such as OzEmail will again show dramatic reductions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of this is coming about because we were able to get the package through the Senate, despite the best endeavours of some of those opposite who would have opposed some of those major changes but very significantly because Telstra will for the first time be in a position to offer very significant competition in a streamlined fashion, not in the old bloated way that suited some of your internal policy objectives but certainly were not in the national interest.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is a lot happening out there. The ACCC has recently announced a draft determination for the price new operators have to pay for interconnect to Telstra's backbone network and from 1 July the interconnect regime will mean that prices will drop by over 40c, from 4.41c per minute to 2.74c in peak periods and from 2.35c to 1.19c per minute in off&hyphen;peak periods. In other words, there will be very significant price reductions. Optus undoubtedly would like to see the ACCC go even further. I have no doubt that competition will have that effect in due course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another amendment which we managed to get through despite the endeavours of the Labor Party was to ensure that the cap imposed on local call prices will be adjusted each year in line with the revenue weighted average local call price in the major capital cities, ensuring that outside the capitals you will still get very substantial benefits from competition&mdash;for the first time ever, I might say, in this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see some press reports yesterday that, apparently, a tape recorded by Dr Hewson, to be played at some meeting of a Liberal forum, was alleged to contain the content along the lines of that which Senator Sherry said.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TH4">Senator KNOWLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp. Minister, could you inform the Senate of the measures contained in this year's budget to further help small business to expand, to invest and to create jobs?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="4176" SPEAKER="Kemp, Sen Rod" NAMEID="WW4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Assistant Treasurer" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for the important question. This side of the parliament is quite different from the other side, because we are interested in small business. We are interested in providing assistance to small business and, as Senator Knowles implied, the government sees small business as critical to boosting jobs and cutting unemployment. For this reason, the government is unashamedly pro-small business&mdash;not like you, Senator Sherry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget furthers the major tax reforms this government has introduced to lift the tax burden on small business. Three hundred thousand small businesses will be given the option of remitting tax to the tax office on a quarterly rather than on a monthly basis. This means a two-thirds reduction in the number of remittances. This will provide those businesses with a $500 million tax deferral in 1998-99; in other words, a cash flow benefit of some $500 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This comes on top of a range of other measures the government has introduced to help small business to grow. We have cut the provisional tax uplift factor from eight per cent to six per cent and introduced legislation to guarantee the uplift factor remains at a fair level; provided CGT rollover relief for small businesses; provided a CGT exemption for small business owners on retirement; doubled the FBT minor benefits exemption threshold to $100; and been able to reduce the FBT bookkeeping requirements. We have exempted small businesses from FBT on car parking on their business premises and extended the CGT treatment to gains and losses on the realisation of eligible equity investments in small and medium sized businesses by lending institutions to encourage lenders to make long-term investments and become equity partners in SMEs.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4177">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are enormous improvements and reforms to the tax system which will serve Australia well, now and into the future. This will help grow small business and will help bolster investment and create jobs. This is in complete contrast to the sorts of policies which we saw followed by the Labor Party during its term of office, the major thrust of which was to increase taxes on small business and, indeed, on all people, to raise taxes, and to bring in forms in the industrial relations area which made it extremely difficult to manage many small business enterprises.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Payne for the question. I did see the report of this comment by Professor Gale. As I understand it, it is a comment made in a book that is about to be launched and it is the first report that I can recall having seen where the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee or any member thereof has publicly admitted that the government is in fact effectively maintaining spending on universities in real terms. It is a very important admission, especially from the head of the Vice-Chancellors Committee, to be saying that funding has been capped&mdash;in other words, not cut.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might recall, Madam President, the fuss that some in the university sector made last year when I said that the funding changes at universities were nicks, not cuts. They were in fact against forward estimates&mdash;that is, what universities hoped to have&mdash;not against what they had. The idea that there would be cuts to higher education spending was very firmly established in the media last year, months before the budget was even announced. The higher education sector decided to conduct a campaign to convince Australians that spending on higher education and money available to higher education were to be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At that stage I made it very clear that the higher education sector could not be quarantined from the substantial budget savings task inherited from Labor's fiscal ineptitude. Although reluctant to publicly support the achievement of savings through increasing HECS, the universities made it very clear, mostly in private but not all, that this was to be preferred to cuts in spending and the number of places available at universities. In other words, when push comes to shove, the universities would rather see an increase in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4181"> the higher education contribution scheme and maintain their funding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The budget package that was finally approved met the universities' preference for HECS changes rather than actual cuts to their spending. Government spending on universities has been capped at about $5.4 billion a year, which is about 1995-96 levels, for this year, next year and the year after. The operating grant component of this spending will remain at about $4.7 billion in real terms this year, next year and the year after.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very important&mdash;Senator Payne's constituents will be interested in this&mdash;that spending per student will be effectively maintained in real terms. In actual dollar terms, there will be increases to take account of inflation. A graph illustrating what happened to funding per student when Labor got in in 1983, when it was up near $12,000, shows that they progressively took it down to nearly $11,000 and had to slowly but surely move it up from there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the out&hyphen;years that I am looking at, funding per student adjusted for the clawback still stays over $11,100. So quality at universities, to the extent that it can be judged by funding, has not been affected. The reason universities are making dramatic changes in some cases is that the previous government decided, and this government agreed with this decision, that if universities needed a salary rise&mdash;and there was no doubt they did need it&mdash;they would have to meet it like everybody else does: through efficiency and productivity gains. Those opposite would not just top up university money for salary increases, and we agreed with them. Universities, therefore, have had to find the money to meet staffing increases and are therefore making these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The new government at no stage said it would increase funding per student to allow universities to award themselves a pay increase. We never promised that. What we have done in response to specific requests is to accede to their longstanding request for universities to be able to offer full fee places once they have filled their government funded places. That will allow them to get more money. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Wet Tropics Ministerial Council met in Cairns last Saturday. It comprises Minister Moore and me, together with two Queensland ministers, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Natural Resources. It was an historic meeting because the management plan for the wet tropics world heritage area was finally approved. The plan will protect the unique world heritage values of the wet tropics region. It will also promote ecologically sustainable tourism in North Queensland, which is good news for jobs. Approval of the plan is a major boost for the protection of the region's values. It demonstrates this government's commitment to working cooperatively with the states to ensure best practice management of world heritage areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate might recall the rather sorry history of this process under the previous administration. It took the ALP two years to even begin to prepare a management plan. After a further 4&half; years the ALP had not finished a management plan. They could not even agree with their own state colleagues at the time. So, seven years after the area was listed, the ALP was no closer to finalising a management plan. The Howard government, in contrast, within a period of just over 12 months, has been able to ensure appropriate management of this important world heritage area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to say that our plan has the support of the community of North Queensland, the conservation movement has welcomed its approval, the Queensland Conservation Council have indicated that they are delighted with the passage of the plan after all these years of discussion and debate, and local governments in the region have made constructive suggestions and influenced the final provisions of the plan. The ecotourism industry has expressed its views and we have agreed to keep open two roads previously identified for closure, which will encourage 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4185"> that ecotourism development. It is estimated that rainforest based tourism is worth over $600 million to the North Queensland economy. The plan will promote sustainable tourism and jobs for the region. To ensure that the full potential of the tourism industry is realised in a sustainable way, work is now under way on developing an ecotourism strategy. The plan also recognises the special position of the rainforest Aboriginal groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After nearly seven years of failure by the ALP, the Howard government has worked cooperatively with Queensland to finalise a management plan with broad community support which will protect world heritage values and will maximise the sustainable use of the area by the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now it is important to move forward&mdash;in other words, move to the implementation stage. I have already started that process by establishing a $200,000 fund to protect the symbol of the wet tropics, the cassowary. The fund will enlist the support of the community to address the threats to the cassowary, such as loss of habitat and traffic. Work has also begun on establishing the necessary infrastructure to present the wet tropics better. That work has identified a number of potential projects, including the establishment of new walking tracks and visitor centres.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill), to a question without notice asked by Senator Faulkner today, relating to questions asked at an Environment, Recreation, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee hearing concerning the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Last week at the Senate estimates committee we had the most extraordinary revelation when it became clear that the Prime Minister's own press office had been responsible for drafting questions&mdash;politically poisonous questions&mdash;about the capability of Mr Kerry O'Brien in his position as senior ABC journalist and anchor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These in their original draft form were pretty ordinary. They were badly spelt. They got polished up either by Senator Alston or members of Senator Alston's staff, and then they were headed up in a document prepared for Senator Coonan. Then, of course, they were foisted on Senator Coonan, to be asked of Senator Alston at the Senate estimates committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Coonan herself could not cope with these, so Senator Coonan foisted them on Senator Eggleston during the estimates hearing. Senator Eggleston had a good look at them and thought, `This is a very offensive political witch&hyphen;hunt,' so he decided to place the questions on notice. The questions on notice were before the committee, the committee secretary placed them before the ABC and the ABC started to answer these questions. Apparently Senator Coonan's conscience got the better of her, or she got instructions from someone in the executive wing, and she withdrew those questions. But, unfortunately for Senator Alston, but I must say fortunately for the opposition, those questions&mdash;all three sets&mdash;were leaked to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4189"> opposition before Senator Alston was to face the estimates committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The guts of this story really relates to the sordid way in which Mr Howard and members of his staff, his key political apparatchiks, his principal press secretary, Mr Tony O'Leary, and his senior political adviser, Mr Grahame Morris, were involved, along with the Prime Minister's doormat, Senator Alston.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might well ask, Madam Deputy President, what they were all playing at. I think Mr Howard and Senator Alston have really got to wake up to the fact that they are in government, not in opposition. The revelation that Mr O'Leary and Senator Alston plotted to discredit Mr Kerry O'Brien suggests that the government just have not woken up to what their responsibilities really are. There are 800,000 people out of work and business confidence is in the doldrums, but what they do is waste their precious time and resources and the community's precious resources in polishing nasty, vitriolic, vindictive political questions that bring into disrepute a senior Australian journalist and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a gross misuse of the Senate estimates process and it reveals a very high level of bile and hatred towards the ABC, something which runs strong in this government but particularly from the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, and Senator Alston. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister's right hand men, particularly Mr Tony O'Leary, have played a very vindictive role in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had in recent times a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> that a ministerial level briefing attempted to bring the head of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, into disrepute over the stolen children report&mdash;another effort of the government. That would not have been carried out without the approval of the Prime Minister's press office. We also had reports about high level attempts to discredit Mr Mick Dodson. I am pleased to say that we have a situation now where very few journalists are taking much account of what Mr O'Leary says. Very few are accepting Mr O'Leary's word; he is not now a very credible spin doctor at all for the government. There is one journalist who still seems to be able to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mouth the briefings from Mr O'Leary and regurgitate the nonsense, but time has caught up with Mr O'Leary, Mr Howard's operation and Senator Alston's operation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill, in an anguished wail today, asked what would be wrong with the Prime Minister's office preparing questions for an estimates committee. Apart from its Nixonian overtones, the fact that they get prepared in the PM's office and then directed at the deputy leader in the Senate for him to give answers to assassinate a particular journalist&mdash;leaving that aside&mdash;the real problem here is that Mr O'Leary has said he has nothing to do with the preparation of these questions, in spite of evidence to the contrary. So what we have is the Prime Minister's most senior interface with the media claiming to have had nothing to do with these questions. If he did, the Prime Minister has a liar representing him to the fourth estate, to the media. That is the question. As is often the case, it is the cover&hyphen;up in this circumstance rather than the original sin.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If ever we have seen an issue in which dissembling has been elevated to an art form, it is this one. We have got all the stories in the world. Senator Coonan first of all said she prepared the questions entirely herself, but later on she said there is nothing wrong with talking to someone else about it. Of course there isn't. Mr O'Leary said he had never talked to  Senator Coonan about it. No&hyphen;one ever alleged that. We all know that the interlinking of this was done in Senator Alston's office. So we have all these dissembling statements trying to lead people off. We have Senator Alston, when first confronted with this, saying he knew nothing about it. I tend to believe him. But he does not say he will investigate it until he is put under real pressure, and then we get the most desultory response, when the facts are not properly checked out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt what we will get is the usual Senator Alston response: `It is not my fault; it is my staff's fault.' That is the standing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4190"> operating procedure by Senator Alston. He gets the Telstra figures with regard to Tasmania wrong: it is the staff's fault. He misses a division: it is the staff's fault. With any mistake Senator Alston makes, it becomes `incompetent staff'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When that particular defence evaporates, Senator Alston will go to the poor memory trick. Senator Alston cannot remember signing off the ABC cabinet submission; he cannot even recall whether he signed it off. He cannot recall whether he discussed Norfolk Island with Senator Colston. He cannot recall the reasons for visiting Senator Colston's office. This is a senior minister wandering down to an obscure backbencher's office, and he cannot remember why he went. He can remember meeting Mrs Christine Smith but cannot remember the discussion. He cannot remember whether Senator Colston visited his office on 3 March. He has no memory of this.</PARA>

They drive you mad. Maybe Senator Alston should enrol in one of those courses, because it is obvious he has got no control over his office. He does not even know that his staff are conspiring with the Prime Minister's office to denigrate the reputation of a journalist. And they think so little of him, apparently, that, having run this Nixonian exercise in his office, they do not tell him about it. So poor old Senator Alston has to sit at the table&mdash;if this scheme comes off&mdash;looking like a dumb bunny, while he is asked questions that have been prepared in his own office to ambush him. They do not even bother to tell poor old Senator Alston that they are up to these tricks and if they did tell Senator Alston that they are up these tricks, then Senator Alston's credibility will disappear, because he has denied all knowledge of it.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Alston said that these are questions anybody could ask; it is free speech. The people involved in his office and his former press secretary, Mr Manicaros, were obviously involved in drafting these questions in association with Mr O'Leary or Mr Morris from the Prime Minister's office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was put to Senator Alston that he is in fact the minister with a statutory responsibility for the legislation for the ABC. I draw his attention to the fact that section 6, paragraph (2)(a)(iii) of the legislation carried by this parliament&mdash;and for which the government voted when they were in opposition&mdash;states:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to maintain the independence and integrity of the Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister and his staff were up to their elbows in preparing political hand grenades to use at the estimates committee to attack the political standing of the ABC. That is what is really improper. It is bad enough that the Prime Minister and his staff would waste their time trying to draft these questions in three different forms to get it in a way that had the most impact. The real issue is where a minister, who has a statutory obligation to defend the integrity and independence of the ABC under legislation of this parliament, is involved in a guerrilla war campaign of preparing deliberate political hand grenades to throw at the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is something that the minister could not answer at the estimates given half a dozen opportunities last Wednesday and Thursday by myself and other senators. He would not answer and could not answer. When we gave him the opportunity to go and check with his staff about who was involved, he said, `I know nothing about this. I know nothing and have heard nothing about it.' We accepted his word. We still accept his word that he knew nothing about it, even though it makes him look like a dope that the rest of his staff were out there trying to organise this, even though he is the minister responsible for the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we asked him, `Will you check with all your existing and former staff if they were involved?' All he would say is, `I will talk to my relevant staff.' He would not go back to check with Mr Manicaros, his press secretary at the time of the estimates committee hearing on 27 February or with Mr Duffield, his chief of staff who was there at the time. He will not talk to them, because he knows what the answer will be. Therefore, he says, `I am in the clear. I am not misleading the Senate, because I will not ask the people who know that I know that I should not ask them.' That is how stupid this man is and he expects us to believe it.

The second point is that he went on to say, `Well, if he did have anything to do with it, there is nothing wrong with that.' He sees nothing wrong with the Prime Minister's press secretary writing questions about an ABC journalist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have the Prime Minister's press secretary here and a journalist over here. This journalist, who happens to be the Prime Minister's press secretary, has the extraordinary right&mdash;which the government has conferred upon him obviously, because they see no problem with it&mdash;to write questions about the salary of this journalist over here. Why does he have the right to do that? Why does the government confer upon him that right? Those questions were all so obviously designed to damage that journalist. He has, by the admission of this minister, the right conferred upon him by this government to ask damaging questions which must be answered according to this government&mdash;because they have gone through estimates&mdash;about another journalist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is just extraordinary. Why would he have that right? Who would be next? Who is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the next person who is paid with funding from appropriations No. 1 that will have these questions asked about them? Who is the next person in a parliamentary department or in the ABA, ASIO or ASIS, and there are lots of really interesting organisations in there where people are paid with funding from appropriation No. 1? Who is the next one we are going to ask questions about their salary and everything about them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Questions about Mr O'Brien's salary and anything else to do with his employment are questions for the board and the management of the ABC. They have absolutely nothing to do with the estimates committee. That detail is an outrageous breach of Mr O'Brien's privacy and that this government would even consider that that is a reasonable way to use time in estimates is something I find absolutely extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The third thing&mdash;and this is the most important&mdash;is that this government would go to these extraordinary lengths to pursue their vendetta against the ABC. It has to be a vendetta. It is something that is just absolutely amazing to watch and it has been amazing to watch from day one the way the ABC has been targeted by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The targeting by this government has been absolutely relentless, it has been vicious, it has been ruthless, and it continues to be so. The lengths to which the government goes are amazing. That has been shown by these questions in estimates. I would have to agree with the editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. It said words, which I cannot remember properly, to the effect that it believed that it demeans the government&mdash;and that is a very good word to use; it does&mdash;that the government should want to pursue its ABC vendetta to these lengths. I think it demeans the government too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to goodness the government would just get out of the mind-set it has that the ABC is evil, that Mr O'Brien in particular is against it and, if the government thinks he is against it, that it has to do something to demolish him as well as the ABC&mdash;an extraordinary thought. The idea that it is okay for that to happen, that there is no problem with the Prime Minister's press secretary asking questions which are deliberately destructive of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4194"> another journalist, I find absolutely extraordinary.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, was astonished at Senator Hill's response in here this afternoon. I can only assume from it that Senator Hill had not actually taken the trouble&mdash;I am not suggesting he should have, necessarily&mdash;to read the copies of the documents that I tabled in Senate estimates and upon which I based the questions that I then asked Senator Alston. I just want to advise Senator Hill, through you, Madam Deputy President, that I know the source of these documents which were given to me. The source was a government source. I would not have taken the documents into the Senate estimates if I had not from the source known the credibility that was attached to these documents.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you read the documents, you can see precisely why this was a particularly nasty exercise indeed. Obviously other senators have had experience of Mr O'Leary, but I personally have not. I make no bones in saying it. I have no axe to grind with Mr O'Leary on a personal level. Senator Kernot interjected just a few moments ago that Mr O'Leary was `an inveterate and vicious liar'. So obviously the Democrats have formed a view about Mr O'Leary that is similar to a view that some of our people have determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All I know from my very long experience with Senator Kernot is that there is nothing in any way offensive against standing orders, if Mr O'Leary objects to such terms being applied to him, if he seeks redress in the Senate by making an application to the Privileges Committee to respond. Obviously there are people with hard views about Mr O'Leary, but let us have a look.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), to a question without notice asked by Senator Carr today, relating to a proposed fee for technical and further education.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I ask the minister: was it a fact that this government had given consideration to the introduction of such a scheme and that at the ministerial council meeting on 23 May a paper was introduced by the minister Dr Kemp and sponsored by Dr Kemp, an Australian National Training Authority paper, which was entitled: <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The national strategy for VET</EMPHASIS> &mdash;vocational education and training&mdash;which did advocate support for a deferred payment mechanism for TAFE and that the causes relating to the introduction of a HECS 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> scheme were only withdrawn after the objections were raised by the state ministers?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked a series of questions at the estimates committee. I refer to page 87 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. In a direct question, I asked whether it was the case that the government had been considering the introduction of a HECS&hyphen;type scheme. I was advised by the senior executive officer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has not been considered by ANTA and as far as I am aware, it has not been considered by ministers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those were the direct remarks of the chief executive officer, Mr Moran. Then I asked a question of the minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister, is that the case?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At best, one could say that it was an ambivalent and ambiguous answer given. The minister referred to the KPMG consulting report, which highlights the underfunding of the vocational education scheme in this country by this government, which points out the need, according to the consultants, for the government to find additional moneys and canvasses the prospect of the introduction of a deferred payment scheme for TAFE. The minister indicates, by referring to the report, that she believes that the matter had not been undertaken. She in fact said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I certainly have not asked for anything to be prepared on it to assist my mind on it, and I can assure you that Dr Kemp has not either. Whether there is someone out there who aspires to having either or both of our jobs cooking up a scheme to have this raised, I cannot tell you, but I can tell you that I have not asked for it to be considered . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister today was asked a direct question: has this government considered the introduction of a HECS scheme for TAFE? She responded by saying it is `not currently considering'. That of course is, at best, a sleazy way around the question, and, at worst, I say, it is in fact part of what appears to be now a pattern of misleading this parliament as to what the actions of this government are and of course what the actions of her public servants are, acting presumably on her behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the minister's attention to the Prime Minister's statement `A guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility', in which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4196"> it is stated quite explicitly that the minister has a responsibility to ensure, first of all:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the overall administration of their portfolios, both in terms of policy and management; and secondly for carriage in the Parliament of their accountability obligations to that institution.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister has a direct responsibility to the parliament to ensure that answers given to questions in parliament and at its various committees are honest and are frank. That obligation has not been met. We are seeing a circumstance here where officers of the minister's department, statutory authorities, have quite clearly misled the Senate, and the answers to those questions have not been corrected, despite the fact that they are quite specific questions put to the minister. Furthermore, the minister herself, together with her junior minister, Dr Kemp, are misleading the Australian people when they suggest that they have not been considering, in the past, actions for the introduction of a HECS&hyphen;style scheme for TAFE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course the whistle has been blown in Victoria by none other than Mr Honeywood, a coalition minister, who explained that a paper was not only introduced by Dr Kemp, but also sponsored by Dr Kemp. An Australian National Training Authority paper was introduced at the last ministerial council meeting on 23 May, which advocated the introduction of a proposal for the introduction of a HECS&hyphen;type scheme, a deferred payment scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is not telling the truth. It is a pattern that is being repeated. A pattern now emerges where there is, quite clearly, a pattern of deceit being followed by this government to try to cover up its actions, undertaken in the various departments of this government, particularly within the department of employment, education and training. I would call upon the minister to correct the record and honour her obligations. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4198"> in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Helping Australians abroad</EMPHASIS> , deals with a number of very important and indeed, in some cases, very distressing issues with respect to the provision of consular services to Australians overseas. You, of course, Madam Deputy President, were a member of that committee. Certainly I am sure you will endorse my comments that this was not an easy inquiry for the committee. It was not easy because there were some very tragic circumstances that the committee inquired into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular the committee inquired into the circumstances surrounding the kidnapping and murder of David Wilson by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. The committee also conducted an inquiry into the circumstances with respect to the death of Mr Ben Maresh in Timor. They were two of the more notable cases where Australians have tragically lost their lives overseas. It was the committee's charter to look at the circumstances involved, particularly with respect to whether or not the provision of services by the Australian consulate and embassy representatives in those cases was adequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a number of other cases that may not have necessarily achieved the public prominence as those involving David Wilson and Ben Maresh, but certainly the committee examined other cases involving the sad and, in a couple of cases, tragic deaths of people 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4205"> overseas who met an untimely end in mysterious circumstances. In a number of cases, the full facts are yet to come out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not wish to identify the people involved, but some of those circumstances involved the deaths overseas of people suffering from mental illnesses and also people who are still missing in other countries&mdash;their whereabouts and fate are unknown. The committee also inquired into a couple of other cases in particular; namely, the gaoling of Dr Flynn in India and also the circumstances with respect to Mr James Peng, who is still imprisoned in China. Efforts have been made by both the previous government and the current government to have Mr Peng released.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee considered a wide range of issues involved in the provision of consular services, particularly in the cases that I have referred to but also in general. The wide nature of the services provided extended from the provision of small amounts of financial assistance to travellers who may have lost their property or had their property stolen overseas to very complex cases such as the ones I have mentioned, where assistance was provided to the families and also to the individuals concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee looked at issues such as the relationship between our consular services and other organisations locally, for example, in the travel industry. We looked at our relationship with other countries, including the implementation of sharing arrangements with Canada&mdash;such arrangements exist in a number of countries&mdash;where Australia and Canada, on an agreed basis, represent each other's citizens. We examined the role of honorary consuls. We considered assistance that is sought by people who may have been arrested and/or gaoled overseas, including some people who have been given very long sentences and are in gaol overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also considered relevant issues such as the relationship of the department and consular services with the media, both locally and overseas; the policies followed by the department in hostage cases; and the provision of assistance to people who may get sick overseas, particularly those who, as I have mentioned, may travel overseas and then suffer 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> relapses of mental illness. A whole range of issues were considered by the committee. It is a very extensive report, and I do urge all senators and indeed the public to read it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is impossible to summarise the committee's detailed report and findings in the short time available to me today, but I do want to touch on a couple of issues. Firstly, it has to be acknowledged that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through its consular services around the world, receives in excess of 400,000 contacts a year, ranging from a simple telephone call to the provision of assistance in very complex cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee noted in the report that many people have unrealistic expectations about what can be provided. Many people apparently believe that, if they get into trouble overseas, they can just contact an embassy or a consulate and they will fix it all up for them. I want to stress today that the committee urges Australian travellers heading overseas to understand and accept that they have a responsibility to themselves for their own safety to plan properly, to make sure that they have taken out adequate travel insurance, to keep in regular contact with relatives and friends, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that quite often the embassy or the consulate may well be restrained from providing assistance because of the local laws and customs and the nature of the country and society in which travellers find themselves in trouble. The committee has made quite a number of recommendations, which are set out in the overview in the report. Unfortunately, I do not have time to read them into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> today, but I do draw the attention of senators and the public to those recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that we have been somewhat critical of some of the services that have been provided by the department, in particular in relation to the case of Mr David Wilson. We found in that case that a better system could have been adopted in terms of the department's relationship with the media and also that greater assistance and information could have been provided to the family members during and after that tragic circumstance. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4206">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee has been the subject of some criticism from members of the Wilson family and the media, but I want to stress that the committee was never in a position to answer all their questions. We were not in a position to determine precisely why it was that the Khmer Rouge murdered David Wilson. But what we do know&mdash;and what everyone knows&mdash;is that it was the Khmer Rouge, a group that has an unsurpassed reputation for murder, indeed genocide, during the recent history of Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put on the record quite clearly today my concern that some people have set out to try to blame the department of foreign affairs or the former minister for foreign affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, for the fate of David Wilson. They in no way could ever be held to have any degree of responsibility. As the committee unanimously stated, we found that the efforts by the then minister and the officers of the department throughout that tragic crisis to have been made with the utmost integrity. Whilst we have the benefit of looking at these situations with hindsight and can find situations where improvements can be made in the future, it should never be forgotten that at all times the minister and the officers of the department acted with the greatest integrity and effort in those cases. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">I am sure it was to the astonishment of the members of the Senate committee that canvassed the enormous problems that were caused in the purchase of this equipment that the matter was dealt with in a single throwaway line&mdash;minor modifications&mdash;in the government response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add that these so&hyphen;called minor modifications have not yet been made. Although Airservices Australia had to seek, at significant expense, external engineering advice outside the company that actually provided the equipment and received payment for it, that modification is not yet in place. It utterly ignores the fact that this so&hyphen;called minor modification placed lives at risk&mdash;that is, the lives of the crews that were flying the aircraft that was delivering this equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No Senate committee member who sat in that Senate committee room and watched videotape of the static line of this equipment recoiling from the raft after it came off and then hitting the aircraft that delivered it, wrapping itself around the wing of the aircraft and, on one occasion, actually flying forward and striking the engine of the aircraft, would doubt for one minute the truth of what I am saying. There was not a majority or dissenting report in respect of this issue. Even though the report did contain serious criticisms of the way in which this government agency handled the purchase, it was a unanimous, bipartisan report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problems were serious and, to this moment, have not been resolved. This equipment that has now cost the taxpayers at least $2 million all up in terms of not just the original purchase cost but the testing programs that were undergone and the consultancies that were then let to try to repair the problem is still lying in a warehouse in Melbourne, almost useless at this point in time, like a huge pile of remaindered books in a Dymocks bookshop.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4208">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter of resolving the failings of this equipment&mdash;the major flaw in this equipment which led to its use being discontinued and which led to the safety regulators withdrawing, because of the danger to the pilots, the certification from the static line that allowed it to be used&mdash;is good luck, not good management. It is as simple as that. Because of the way in which this contract was let, and principally because of the actions of Mr Sharp's personally appointed Chairman of Airservices Australia, Mr Forsyth, it is more good luck than good management that this situation may in the future be satisfactorily resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a long history to this equipment&mdash;as a number of senators on both sides of the house know. This equipment was tested by the technical division of the Royal Australian Air Force&mdash;a division with an international reputation for its expertise. The technical division of the RAAF found that the problems associated with this equipment, causing potential danger to the lives of the rescue crews, were so great that they recommended that it should not even be further tested until the engineering problems were sorted out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of that documentation is a matter of public record; it is in the public domain. Airservices Australia&mdash;this is important&mdash;determined, on the basis of that expert advice, not to purchase the equipment. A decision had actually been taken not to buy it. But the newly appointed Chairman of Airservices Australia, Mr Forsyth, overturned that position, which was the firm position of the management and executive of Airservices Australia. He ordered that a new assessment panel be set up to test the equipment. He told the Senate estimates committee, to our astonishment, that he had deliberately not informed himself of the history of the problems with this equipment in order to come to it with an open mind, or something to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the fact that the Royal Australian Air Force had actually published a damning document after a fairly expensive exercise on behalf of Airservices in testing this equipment and condemned it was something which the Chairman of Airservices Australia deliberately chose not to inform himself of. It is quite 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> extraordinary. As I said at the time, I do not know what the shareholders of Dymocks books would think if he took similar decisions about equipment purchased by Dymocks books that cost $1&half; million and could not be used, as this equipment, as we speak, cannot be used. It is still unusable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To see this history described in one line in a single page response to the government as a minor modification is just breathtaking. I would suggest that anyone who has an interest in this issue and who doubts the government's and the minister's sincerity when they talk about concern for aviation safety should read this government response and then go back and read the majority report&mdash;the only report, the unanimous report&mdash;of the Senate committee into this same purchase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that the company that supplied the equipment has fundamentally and basically said that as far as they are concerned, there is nothing wrong with it. They have refused to take any part in further modification of the equipment, bought and paid for by Airservices Australia. Airservices Australia had absolutely no choice in the matter, in a desperate attempt to use $1&half; million worth of unusable equipment, as I said, lying useless as we speak still in a warehouse in Melbourne. It cannot be used to rescue anybody. They had no choice but to commission themselves engineering consultants to try to solve the engineering design fault with this after they had bought it, not before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, as the Senate committee knew&mdash;it is all there in documentation that was produced by the department to the Senate committee&mdash;this was despite the profound agitation of senior management in Airservices Australia who actually saying in writing to the executive of Airservices Australia, `Check this now, not after you buy it.' We had electronic memos actually laying out in detail the very problems that are still at fault with this equipment and these officers saying, `Before you hand the cheque over, make sure this is all resolved before you buy it, not afterwards.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of that was ignored because the Chairman of Airservices Australia, appointed by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4209"> this minister, had made up his mind that this equipment was going to be purchased. To the astonishment of us all, he told the Senate that he had not bothered reading any of the previous reports on this equipment because he wanted to have an open mind when purchasing. Well, he had an open mind and an open cheque book on behalf of the taxpayers as well. Whatever the government says about this issue here today, the one thing that is absolutely beyond argument is that this equipment still cannot be used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were told last week at Senate estimates that one of the independent consulting experts, paid $100,000&mdash;that is $100,000 paid for by Airservices Australia, not the supplier of the equipment&mdash;is now confident that they can find an engineering fix for the problem. Of course, we do not know yet&mdash;this was made clear&mdash;how much the actual modifications themselves will cost if the engineering solution is found to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the cash register still has not stopped ticking over. The poor old taxpayers have been given a very rough ride on this issue indeed. So as we speak here on this debate, according to the government this minor modification currently means that this rescue equipment cannot be used for the purpose for which it was purchased. Two million dollars has been spent on equipment which is lying, as we speak, utterly useless in a warehouse in Melbourne. We are yet to know whether the optimism of the officers who gave evidence last week that an engineering solution may have been found is yet to be realised. The one thing we are certainly yet to find out is how much that fix will cost the taxpayers when it is finally and hopefully delivered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To sit through all of that evidence, to watch video film of this equipment actually placing the lives of rescue crews in unarguable danger and to see all that brushed under the carpet and brushed off as a minor modification by this minister who came into office saying that safety was his major concern and his major consideration is just beyond belief. I am sure that all members of the committee who investigated this matter and came down with that unanimous report will share my view.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like Senator Bob Collins, I was a member of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee and, like Senator Collins, I sat aghast as we listened to the debacle over the purchase of PADS. We had a situation where an evaluation committee was established by the new Chairman of Airservices Australia, as outlined by Senator Collins. This evaluation committee conducted what can only be described as a pathetic scientific trial. It was pathetic in that it did not examine the equipment in genuine rescue conditions. It admitted as much. It subsequently tried to say that it did not have time. But it admitted that it did not even conduct a test in rescue conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Notwithstanding that, the equipment malfunctioned significantly. What I mean by `significantly' is that it endangered the crew who were conducting the rescue or, in this case, the practices and the tests. It is not a matter of conjecture. It is not some senator standing up and saying, `This is what might have happened.' This is what independent tests showed before, during and after the purchase of PADS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the manufacturer claiming&mdash;to this day the manufacturer still claims it&mdash;that it is all the fault of those who had been conducting the testing, the manufacturer continues to ignore the engineering tests that have subsequently been conducted, which have shown the equipment to be absolutely of poor and shoddy quality. We have heard stories about Korean tennis balls cut in half. Because they are Korean tennis balls instead of good old Australian tennis balls, they have collapsed under the pressure. We have heard about tests to simulate air turbulence in crash conditions, in rescue conditions, being conducted on the back of a truck. Yet the government has said that it has confidence in the board and the chairman, both in the past and currently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chairman said that he did not even examine previous evidence. He received a one&hyphen;page draft report from this evaluation committee, and then he made the decision to go ahead. He did not have even the full report, not that the full report is much of an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4210"> improvement in quality and in the advice contained in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a question for the government and for the Airservices board: is the evaluation panel able to be taken to court over its pathetic performance and monetary recompense for the extra costs that Airservices, not the manufacturer, has had to incur to make this equipment safe? What you have got is the government saying, `We have confidence in the board.' The board does not want to ask these questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a second point for the Airservices board. The modifications so far have cost more than the original purchase of the equipment. The equipment cost $740,000 or so. The modifications and the testing for this project to date, as Senator Bob Collins has said, has taken us past $2 million. The cost has already doubled. We have spent more on modification and repairs than on the actual equipment. Yet we are still sitting in a warehouse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Who is going to be the owner if, as the government says, Airservices Australia has entered into a process to develop the minor modifications necessary for a solution to the safety problems? `Minor modifications' is a very interesting term. I would love to hear what the manufacturer and a court of law would say about minor modifications and the patent. Who is going to own the intellectual property arrived at after hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment has been modified? Who is going to own the patent and the intellectual property on the modified equipment&mdash;Airservices or Mr Gruzman? Does anyone have any idea? </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is trying to pretend that there are minor modifications. This was equipment that could have killed the rescuers. This was equipment that was shown to be defective. It should never have been purchased. The chairman was negligent in his conduct. He refused to listen to the expert advice. He set up a bodgie selection panel to get it done as quickly as he could.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chairman of the evaluation panel made it quite clear that the pressure was on to get it done quickly. That is why they could not conduct the tests when it mattered, which was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> when it was important for them to be conducted. So we have a situation where the government has confidence in the board. The minister has confidence in his mate he appointed, who has cost Australian taxpayers over $2 million in equipment that is unusable and that requires significant, not minor, modifications just to bring it into service.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think the Senate has been very wise in this notification process. It is a good thing, because of the requirement that we, as members of parliament, act according to the highest levels of our conscience as well as have regard for the law and the future of this country, that there is some mechanism for the Senate to be informed if a member is placed under arrest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I, for one, hate being arrested. I hate being put in the situation where the law as it stands, which is invoked so often in the defence of property, brings one's conscience into conflict with one's regard for the natural environment, the rights of future generations and, indeed, the rights of our fellow species on this planet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was motivated to go to East Gippsland after Senate estimates committees last week. On the one hand, I had seen a regional forest agreement signed between the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Premier of Victoria, Mr Kennett, in February. On that day, I saw a statement saying that this was a world&hyphen;class protection mechanism for the wilderness and the biodiversity and old growth values in those national estate forests at East Gippsland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, we had protesters in the forest. I was aware that a regional forest agreement promising just the same things was about to be signed in Tasmania and I wanted 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4211"> to see for myself these forests. I was aware that three senior Victorian scientists&mdash;Dr Ian Lunt, Dr Doug Robinson and Bertram Lobert&mdash;wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> just last Monday, 9 June, describing the Goolengook Forest in East Gippsland as having immense biological value. They said it contained endangered plants, birds and mammals, and a unique rainforest community all within the closed and largely undisturbed catchment. The question that arose was: how could it be that such an important and valuable area, which the Prime Minister had said was safe in the regional forest agreement, was in fact being logged?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is, in this situation, the Prime Minister who ought to be in the dock. When I went to East Gippsland I found that what the scientists had said was correct and that what the Australian Heritage Commission had found in citing national estate values in this forest ought to be upheld. Here we have, intact, magnificent eucalypt forests and rainforests in the valleys, full of mammals and birds and the whole range of biodiversity that makes up these ancient ecosystems.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There are slender ferns and tree ferns, which would range between 500 and a thousand years old, intact in amongst the eucalypts which are probably 300 or 400 years old. There is great diversity of life in this magnificent piece of Australia's natural estate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The judgment of the Prime Minister and the Premier of Victoria stands indicted. There is a process both before that regional forest agreement and within the regional forest agreement itself which requires those political leaders to have consulted with the Australian Heritage Commission where these national estate values are at stake. They did not. I have preliminary legal advice which says they are acting illegally in allowing the destruction of this forest, which is a national monument.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . thank the Senate for once again highlighting the priority it gives to its deliberations. Is it any wonder the public question the relevance of the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This reflects a much deeper attitude within the Liberal Party. It reflects the fact that the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4214"> Liberal Party has a completely double standard when it comes to this chamber. It has a view that it can rort the system when it suits it, and it can use the procedures of this Senate to bring down elected government when it suits it. It can abuse the procedures and the conventions of this parliament and the conventions of the Australian constitution in such a way as to seek a very narrow based political advantage. What we see again and again on the question of filling of casual vacancies is this appalling record coming home to demonstrate the contemptuous attitude the Liberal Party has towards the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The great irony here is that it is the Liberal Party that has cried foul whenever the Labor Party in the past has spoken about the need for reform of the Australian constitution. It is the Liberal Party that has argued how glorious our constitutional institutions are. It is the Liberal Party that has argued for a view that nothing should change in the Australian constitution. But when it comes to seeking narrow double standards, when it comes to adopting positions which give political advantage to the Liberal Party, what do we see? We see the situation that is highlighted in the state of Victoria where it takes one day to fill a casual vacancy created by the Liberal Party but 56 days, on average, to fill a vacancy created as a result of the need to replace an Australian Labor Party senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, of course, have seen the examples in recent times of the discussions about pairing in the Senate, and the replacement of senators under the constitutional provisions to ensure the protection of the will of the Australian people in terms of their election of senators to this place. We have seen the same case arise in recent times with the appointment of Senator Conroy, where it took 84 days for the Victorian government to fill a vacancy created as a result of the resignation of Senator Gareth Evans&mdash;but one day when it comes to the filling of the vacancy for a Liberal senator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we see further within the Liberal Party? It is highlighted by the contemptuous attitude that the Premier of Victoria has shown towards this whole procedure and convention in terms of the appointment, and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> quite contrary to the resolutions of the Senate passed not just once but on several occasions, unanimously by all senators in this place, that there should be the filling of vacancies as expeditiously as possible and that `State parliament should adopt procedures which will enable Senate casual vacancies to be filled within 14 days of the notification of the vacancy or within 14 days of the notification of the nominee of the relevant political party.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What do we see within the Liberal Party? Since the defection of Senator Colston, we see a course of action which now moves to ensure that, as they see it, the Australian electoral laws are changed in such a way as to nobble the Senate and to seek legislative amendments to the Senate voting system. This has been advocated now not only by the President of the Liberal Party, Mr Tony Staley, and the former federal director, Mr Andrew Robb, but, as I understand it, position papers are being prepared within the office of the Prime Minister himself to undertake studies as to the ways in which the Senate voting system can be rorted to ensure this government has a majority in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The hypocrisy of this position is all too clear to all those who care to look. It is the same hypocrisy that is highlighted by resolution of the Senate which was carried on 15 May this year. That resolution demonstrates the double standards of taking one day to fill a vacancy when a Liberal casual vacancy arises but 84 days in the case of filling the casual vacancy created by the resignation of Senator Gareth Evans and the appointment of the now Senator Conroy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government stands condemned for condoning the actions of the Premier in terms of the comments that have been made in this chamber over time. This is the government in Victoria that was only too happy to advise its public servants in the strongest possible terms not to appear before Senate committees. We saw the scandals that arose regarding the tenders for the casino in Victoria. The public servants were instructed that they were not to have anything to do with the Senate. It was quite relevant then, wasn't it? The Senate was more than relevant, far too relevant, in fact, for the Premier of Victoria&mdash;far too relevant 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4215"> to allow evidence to be presented to Senate committees in regard to the shameful, disgraceful corrupt practices that have occurred in the state of Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But now, when the question arises about the appointment of senators to this place by the state parliament in Victoria&mdash;a parliament controlled by the Premier of Victoria, given that the Liberals have a majority in both houses in that parliament&mdash;we see actions being taken as described in the letter to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is it any wonder that the public question the relevance of the Senate?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Well is there any wonder that the Premier of Victoria questions the relevance of the Senate? Because the Senate stands up to defend positions taken by the Australian people, and the electoral system in this parliament ensures that there is a range of views being expressed in the Senate&mdash;actions that this Premier would like to see undermined; actions, of course, that have been quite seriously canvassed and supported within very senior elements of this government; actions taken by senior members of the Liberal Party and its administrative wing to support the government's charges against the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All have arisen as a result of Senator Colston moving away from you, in terms of the arrangements you entered into, which means that you can no longer guarantee the majority that you thought you could have. So what do we see? Talks of double dissolution, talks of rorting the Senate electoral system, talks of ensuring that there is a majority put together by hook or by crook to protect this government's majority.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(Committee's Fifth Report of 1997)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the report which I have tabled concerns the proposed development of facilities for Number Six Squadron at RAAF Base Amberley in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Defence proposes to construct new facilities adjacent to the existing apron and hangars for the operation, servicing and maintenance of F&hyphen;111 aircraft at RAAF Base Amberley.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal examined by the Committee is intended to provide an integrated facility for the various operational elements of No 6 Squadron, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4217"> which include an operational reconnaissance and strike capability as well as aircrew conversion and training functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal will provide office accommodation, mission briefing and training rooms, storage facilities and workshops as well as associated amenities for a unit strength of 180 personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When referred to the Committee the estimated out&hyphen;turn cost of the proposed work was $10.25 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the works should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No 6 Squadron is one of two squadrons equipped with F&hyphen;111 strike and reconnaissance aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The squadron is responsible for F&hyphen;111 aircrew conversion training and the provision of an operational strike and reconnaissance capability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until recently, there was some uncertainty about the Life of Type of F&hyphen;111. This uncertainty, and higher facilities priorities, delayed the provision of modern facilities for the squadron until now. With the benefit of numerous studies into the life of type of the F&hyphen;111, an avionics upgrade, and the purchase of additional attrition and rotation aircraft, Defence now believes the aircraft will remain in service for many years. It is estimated that the life of type will expire in 15&hyphen;20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the aircraft and squadron personnel represent a substantial equipment and training investment by the taxpayers of Australia. The aircraft themselves are a sophisticated conventional deterrent force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on extensive inspections of facilities housing squadron activities, the Committee concluded that facilities at RAAF Base Amberley occupied by No 6 Squadron are inadequate due to their dispersed locations, age and condition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is therefore a need to provide new purpose built facilities for No 6 Squadron's existing command, administrative, technical and training functions at RAAF Base Amberley.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed facilities will be at two locations. The new No 6 Squadron facilities will be in hangar annexes and new buildings contiguous to Hangar 373 and the storage of F&hyphen;111 attrition or rotation aircraft will be in two existing Bellman Hangars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that the proposed scope of the works can be justified as being consistent with the functional requirements for squadron facilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also concluded that design features to be adopted are consistent with functional requirements and recognise the need to comply with relevant standards and codes. The scope of the proposed works capitalises on the adaptive re&hyphen;use of existing hangars.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Master Plan has been developed for the future development of RAAF Base Amberley with which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the proposed works are consistent. Careful phasing of the works will minimise disruption to the continued operation of No 6 Squadron during construction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis of evidence received, the Committee has therefore recommended that the development of facilities for No 6 Squadron at RAAF Base Amberley should proceed.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exercise Tandem Thrust was conducted in the first months of this year, culminating in March in a combined field training exercise off the Queensland coast, and in the Shoalwater Bay Training Area, near Rockhampton. Unlike many previous major defence exercises hosted by the ADF, which involve the forces of several regional nations, Exercise Tandem Thrust was a bilateral exercise, involving only Australian and US forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was a major exercise from an ADF perspective, involving direct participation by over 21,000 US personnel, almost 6,000 ADF members, 43 naval vessels and over 200 aircraft. Exercises of this nature, and on this scale, are an important way to confirm and practice interoperability of forces and planning staffs with our most important ally, the United States, in a joint and combined military environment.  This exercise was noteworthy because it was the first truly combined, all&hyphen;environment, strategic&hyphen;level activity that had been conducted between the forces of the two nations since World War II.  That is, it provided the opportunity for senior Australian Defence staff to participate in strategic planning on an equal basis, rather than taking a role subordinate to a US command structure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Beyond the aim of exercising ADF capabilities, Tandem Thrust served also as a reaffirmation of our continued friendship and alliance with the United States.  It followed current Government policy in supporting US strategic engagement and activities in the region, which in turn contributes towards regional security. In this respect, Exercise Tandem Thrust was an important outcome of the AUSMIN talks held in July last year, between the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the US Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense.  One outcome of those talks, the Joint Security Declaration (also known as the Sydney Statement), saw Tandem Thrust as a major step towards the ADF/US Pacific Command vision for future combined operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, one of the key outcomes of such a major exercise must be to test our military  interoperability with the US, as our most powerful and important ally. However, a significant concern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> identified during the Sub&hyphen;Committee's visit was that the ADF currently lags the US military in the fields of communications and information systems. The Sub&hyphen;Committee was shown a number of innovative software applications, and communications systems used in the field by the ADF.  Of themselves, these were encouraging. However, as the US military aggressively develops its capabilities in these areas, there exists an incipient danger of our defence forces falling further behind, to a level where we may be unable to interconnect with US systems. A defence force which cannot interconnect with the essential operational systems of its allies, in order to produce a seamless network, is liable to be at a significant disadvantage in the likely information&hyphen;intensive operations of future conflicts. I commend close attention to this field, as I believe that this area should be afforded priority in ADF force development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sub&hyphen;Committee also observed other aspects of the exercise which were a source of some concern. Prime amongst these was that the exercise was structured to meet US training requirements, rather than those of the ADF. Given the preponderance of US forces in the exercise, and the need to attract US participation in initiating the Tandem Thrust exercise series, this deficiency is understandable. However, in later exercises of this series, I would like to see Australian training requirements given primacy, and planning done around a scenario more in keeping with requirements for the defence of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The weather, as always, is one of the exigencies with which a military must deal, and this exercise provided ample demonstration of that truism. The maritime forces were hampered and delayed by the encroachment of tropical cyclone Justin, and various aspects of the exercise were forced to be postponed, modified, or deleted from the exercise plan.  This should not be viewed as a failure of either the exercise planning or the forces involved.  The senior personnel with whom we spoke viewed this apparent hitch quite positively, pointing out that it necessitated exercise of a considerable degree of flexibility on the part of the planning staffs involved, and effectively simulated one aspect of the `fog of war' with which military forces would have to contend in a situation of genuine conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My comments on Tandem Thrust would be incomplete if I did not mention environmental issues, as these matters were accorded considerable attention by the media in the weeks preceding the field training phase of the exercise. This was in part because the exercise was conducted in Shoalwater Bay Training Area, which overlaps in some areas the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. I must commend the planning staffs of both the Australian and US militaries in their planning to address these 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4219"> concerns. A combined monitoring team was established to ensure that environmental concerns could be treated sympathetically, while still achieving the realistic training objectives intended. Briefing of the personnel involved on their environmental responsibilities was reportedly comprehensive. The Sub&hyphen;Committee viewed several examples during their visit where military procedures were modified to ensure compliance with environmental restrictions, yet these adjustments did not seem to detract from the overall conduct and training value resulting from the exercise.  This impression was confirmed in briefings from the Commander of the Exercise Control Group, Rear Admiral Kenneth Fisher of the US Navy. It is worthy of note that these two aspects&mdash;environmental restrictions and exercise requirements&mdash;are not incompatible, and I congratulate those involved for their sympathetic treatment to achieve a satisfactory outcome. I don't want to create the impression that the Australian Defence Force are newcomers with respect to environmental concerns. They have always recognised that Training areas are a finite and valuable asset. Since the end of the Second World War, the ADF have been ahead of the community in managing the preservation of their training areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Sub&hyphen;Committee's visit provided an excellent opportunity to meet and speak with members of the ADF operating in the field, and we were impressed by the enthusiasm and level of innovation shown by those personnel we met.  We viewed the ease with which the forces of both countries were able to integrate, from high level command appointments down to the soldier in the field, operating in a combined environment with their counterparts in the US Marine Corps and US Army. I believe that the exercise was worthwhile and successful at all levels, as was the visit by the Defence Sub&hyphen;Committee.  I would like to thank the Minister for Defence and the military and civilian personnel of the Australian Defence Force, who assisted in ensuring the success of the Sub&hyphen;Committee's visit to Exercise Tandem Thrust 97.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS (NOTIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT) AMENDMENT BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS) was established under the Industrial Chemicals (Notification and Assessment) Act 1989 to assess the health and environment risks of all new industrial chemicals and selected existing chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All new industrial chemicals are assessed before their importation or manufacture so that recommendations about appropriate safeguards can be made before their use. Chemicals already in use and causing concern can be selected for assessment as priority existing chemicals. In total over 700 industrial chemicals have been assessed in the six years NICNAS has been in operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NICNAS has operated on partial cost recovery since its inception. This bill (and its cognate bills) will move NICNAS to full cost recovery consistent with other Commonwealth chemical assessment schemes. Currently, costs are recovered by a system of application fees for the assessments carried out. This has worked well for new chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand, the current scheme for existing chemicals does not result in costs being shared fairly in the industry and has been described in a 1995 review as "virtually unworkable".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To rectify this problem, the bill will implement a system of"company registration" to replace the current fee collection mechanism for existing chemicals. The bill establishes a new register, called the Register of Industrial Chemical Introducers. All persons who introduce industrial chemicals with a total value of more than $0.5 million will be required to register and pay a registration charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Company registration" was first proposed by the previous government in 1995. Following extensive consultation with industry, we have refined the scheme to minimise its impact on business. A two-tier system of registration charges will apply. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The $0.5 million initial registration threshold will ensure that small business will not be affected. For companies introducing chemicals with a value of more than $0. 5 million but less than $5 million, a maximum annual charge of $1,200 will be payable. However, for companies introducing chemicals to the value of $5 million or more a year, a higher annual charge will apply. This will not exceed $7,000. Based on available data, it is estimated that approximately 600 companies will pay the lower charge and 190 will pay the higher charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Company registration will enhance the operation of NICNAS by overcoming problems in the current cost recovery mechanism for existing chemicals. Costs will be shared more widely in the industry. Registration will also facilitate the operation of NICNAS by improving knowledge about the companies introducing chemicals in Australia. The government will review the new cost recovery arrangements in 3 years time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More effective and efficient cost recovery will also improve the assessment of existing industrial chemicals. The bill introduces a framework for better targeting of assessments to the specific risks posed by particular chemicals and allowing for a group of chemicals to be assessed together. A three year program of existing chemical assessments will be developed in consultation with industry, participating agencies and other stakeholders. The program will be consistent with national priorities and needs, tailored to concerns and will make maximum use of appropriate assessment information from overseas. Based on anticipated revenue from the registration charge, about ten comprehensive assessments and 40 more limited targeted assessments would be completed every three years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes important changes to the Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances (the Inventory). The Inventory lists of all chemicals imported or manufactured in Australia since 1977. Persons introducing a new chemical can apply for the chemical to be included in the confidential section of the Inventory if publication of the chemical' s particulars would be commercially damaging. The current arrangements which automatically cancel any confidentiality after 6 years have the difficulty that they may discourage overseas manufacturers from making new chemicals available in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments allow the continued listing of chemicals in the confidential section subject to review every 5 years. The test for inclusion in the confidential section has been strengthened. Currently, only the prejudice to the commercial interest of the person or company is considered . This will be changed to require the Director to balance that prejudice against the public interest in disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Measures to streamline the assessment of new industrial chemicals are necessary to secure the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4222"> benefits of new chemicals quickly without unnecessary assessment. The bill proposes new limited exemptions from notification and assessment for research and development chemicals and for chemicals introduced in quantities of less than 10 kilogram per year where the chemical poses no unreasonable risk to human health or to the environment. These changes are consistent with developments in schemes operated by our major trading partners and are justified by assessment experience.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, a new form of permit will be established to allow the introduction of certain non-hazardous chemicals before the assessment of the chemical by NICNAS is finalised. This amendment will facilitate the early introduction of new chemicals to replace older more hazardous ones.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To increase accountability for the management of NICNAS on full cost recovery, I propose to establish a non-statutory Industry Consultative Committee. This will review and report to the minister on the use of resources and recommend future improvements to NICNAS operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes minor amendments to improve the operation of the act, including by updating certain definitions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, this bill (like the cognate bills) is aimed at further enhancing the operation of NICNAS by introducing full cost recovery, and streamlining assessment procedures particularly for new chemicals introduced in very low quantities and for non-hazardous chemicals. Greater flexibility in the assessment of existing chemicals is proposed so that they are directed to areas of concern. The changes are consistent with the recommendations of the 1995 Gwynne Report which considered the implications of full cost recovery for NICNAS. As a result of these reforms, assessments under NICNAS will be able to focus more on the chemicals posing the greatest risks to the Australian people and the environment.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the taxation laws to give effect to a number of 1996&hyphen;97 budget measures designed to prevent tax avoidance and address abuse of certain tax provisions and anomalies in the tax law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also amends the interest withholding tax provisions, as announced by the Treasurer in June 1996, in an effort to inject further competition into the Australian financial market and, in particular, the home lending market and update the provisions to reflect current overseas financial arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments related to net capital losses</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the income tax law to rectify anomalies in the capital gains tax provisions dealing with the carry forward and transfer of net capital losses. These measures were announced in the 1996&hyphen;97 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the existing capital gains tax provisions, taxpayers are able to carry forward net capital losses into a later year of income for recoupment against future capital gains which, as with the carry 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> forward of revenue losses, is subject to a number of recoupment tests. These tests prevent capital losses incurred by a company from being recouped where there has been a substantial change in the beneficial ownership of the company since the losses were incurred and the company does not carry on the same business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the existing capital gains tax provisions operate so that taxpayers who carry forward net capital losses into subsequent years are taken to reincur those losses in each subsequent year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of this anomaly is that the recoupment tests for company taxpayers do not achieve their intended purpose. That is, a capital loss is able to be recouped even where beneficial ownership of a company has changed substantially since the loss was incurred and the company does not carry on the same business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This defect flows through to the provisions permitting the transfer of net capital losses between resident companies within the same 100 per cent owned group. A further defect is that, in certain circumstances, the recoupment tests applying to the transferee company are less stringent than those applying to the transferor company. This contrasts with the revenue loss transfer provisions which require both companies to satisfy the same recoupment tests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will ensure that net capital losses attach to the year of income in which they are incurred and are recouped or transferred within a company group in the order in which they were incurred. In addition, where a net capital loss is transferred within a company group, the transferee company will be required to satisfy the same recoupment tests for example, the continuity of ownership test or the same business test that apply to the transferor company.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, the Treasurer announced that the general anti&hyphen;avoidance provisions, Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act, were to be extended so that they can apply to non&hyphen;resident interest, dividend and royalty withholding tax in order to provide a mechanism to effectively counter withholding tax avoidance schemes. Four other specific amendments were also announced which will further assist in preventing abuse of the withholding tax provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures do not reflect any change in the government's policy on withholding taxes and are intended to give effect to existing policy by addressing tax avoidance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Bill was originally introduced into the House of Representatives, however, some concern was expressed by the Banking and Finance industry that the proposed definition of interest could impact on certain financial products which are not current 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4224"> ly subject to withholding tax such as interest swapping arrangements where, for example, a floating rate of interest is swapped for a fixed interest rate in order to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has therefore amended the definition of interest and this Bill now more accurately targets avoidance arrangements. The industry has since indicated that the amendments address their concerns and have in general welcomed the Government's initiatives to extend the anti&hyphen;avoidance measures to withholding tax.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dual resident companies</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the income tax law to provide that certain dual resident companies which are in substance non&hyphen;residents cannot take advantage of their dual resident status for the purposes of the operation of specific tax concessions and anti&hyphen;avoidance measures at a significant cost to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Removal of standard superannuation contribution limit</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill removes the option for employers with 10 or more employees to elect to calculate the maximum deduction they can claim for superannuation contributions made for the benefit of their employees by reference to a standard contribution limit. All employers will be required to determine the maximum amount of allowable deductions for superannuation contributions based on the ages of individual employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The standard contribution limit was introduced for reasons of administrative simplicity. However, the standard contribution limit has been subject to abuse with some employers claiming deductions for contributions on behalf of particular employees well in excess of the age based limits. The abuse has come at a cost to revenue and the government believes that the standard contribution limit can no longer be justified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Leases of luxury cars</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another measure in the bill relates to the taxation treatment of leases of luxury cars. The cost limit for depreciation of luxury cars that was first enacted in 1980 has been effectively circumvented by leasing arrangements under which the lessor is largely unaffected by the limit. A common avoidance technique is to ensure that the lessor is a tax exempt or other tax preferred entity such as a loss trust.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new measures will treat leases of luxury cars in much the same way as other forms of vehicle finance. The lessor will be treated as having disposed of the car to the lessee at the beginning of the lease and having lent the lessee the money to buy the car. The lessor will be taxed only on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> finance charge component of the notional loan to the lessee, but not on the actual lease payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the lessee uses the car for income producing purposes, the lessee will be entitled to deduct an appropriate proportion of the finance charge component. No deduction will be allowed for actual lease payments, but the lessee will be treated as the car owner entitled to taxation depreciation allowances. The amount of depreciation allowed will be reduced under the depreciation cost limit rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Interest withholding tax and related provisions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will implement the Government's commitment to amend the section 128F interest withholding tax exemption to increase competition in the Australian financial market. The end use in an Australian business requirement in the existing section 128F will be removed. The requirement that the debentures issued by an Australian company must be widely distributed on overseas capital markets will be replaced by a public offer test. This amendment will extend the exemption to borrowings in offshore wholesale capital markets. Division 11 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 will be amended to exclude its application to interest paid offshore in respect of bearer debentures which are issued offshore. The interest on such debentures will be subject to interest withholding tax. Division 11 will also be amended to provide an exemption for bearer debentures issued by an offshore banking unit. The interest withholding tax collection provisions will be amended to ensure that they are consistent with the royalty withholding tax procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable senators.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (ACTIVITY TEST PENALTY PERIODS) BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill introduces changes to penalties which are applied where recipients of newstart allowance or youth training allowance do not meet their obligations under the activity test provisions of the Social Security Act 1991 or the Student and Youth Assistance Act 1973.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its first budget, the Government announced a range of measures to tighten the administration of the activity test applying to unemployment allowances. In doing so, the government met a specific coalition pre&hyphen;election commitment. The range of measures announced, most of which have already been introduced, received considerable support within the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government considers that a rigorous application of activity test requirements is important to maintain community support for, and confidence in, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4225"> the system of unemployment payments. It also sustains active job search which should improve employment outcomes for people receiving unemployment allowances and contributes to the efficiency of the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This approach is supported by Australian and international economic research which points to the importance of maintaining strong job search requirements as part of an efficient system of unemployment allowances. For instance, the OECD Job Study concluded that "A priori reasoning and historical evidence both suggest that if benefit administration can be kept tight, the potential disincentive effects of benefit entitlement will be largely contained". The previous government's own Committee on Employment Opportunities discussion paper titled "Restoring Full Employment" also concluded that "any impact of the income support system on long term unemployment is likely to be minimised when the administration of income support, and in particular the activity test, is tights".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing the package of measures to improve the administration of the activity test, the government recognised the need to change the current regime of penalties applying to those who breach their activity test obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current penalty arrangements are too complicated. Penalties can vary according to unemployment duration and previous breach history. Unemployed people do not know what penalty might apply to them and even DSS and CES staff have difficulty working them out. For such penalties to act as an effective deterrent to non compliance, they need to be known and understood by unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government, therefore, proposed changes late last year in the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 1996 to simplify penalty arrangements, strengthening their deterrence effect while removing some features which have been criticised as particularly harsh and unfair such as increasing the penalties the longer a person had been unemployed and allowing the penalty period to increase indefinitely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community views were heard around this time encouraging the Parliament to amend the existing and proposed activity test penalties from a complete withdrawal of payment to a limited rate reduction. The government had already moved to convert administrative breach penalties to rate reductions rather than full withdrawal of payment. The Minister for Social Security agreed to withdraw the proposed changes to activity test changes and consult further prior to introducing a revised approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the provisions of this bill, penalties for breaches of activity test requirements will be as follows:  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> for a first breach within any two year period an 18% reduction in the rate of allowance for a period of 26 weeks;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> for a second breach with any two year period a 24% reduction in the rate of allowance for a period of 26 weeks; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> for a third or subsequent breach within any two year period, withdrawal of payment for 8 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that the penalty arrangements are changing significantly, to avoid any element of retrospectivity and so that all unemployed people will know exactly where they stand, any breach occurring after the commencement of this bill will count as a first breach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also provide that penalties and waiting periods for payment will be served concurrently with the higher penalty taking precedence. At present, such penalties and waiting periods must be served consecutively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government considers that it is necessary to maintain a non payment penalty for a third or subsequent breach within two years. To simply allow a further rate reduction would allow someone to continue to receive unemployment allowances (albeit at a reduced rate) indefinitely even though they continually refused to meet their reasonable and legitimate obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new approach to activity test penalties provided for in this bill has been developed to take full account of the concerns about the current penalty arrangements and after consultation with community welfare groups. It is an approach which is fair, eliminating the worst and most complex features of the current arrangements but still meeting the government's objective to maintain a strong deterrence for failure to meet reasonable requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to introduce amendments to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987, the Export Control Act 1982, the Farm Household Support Act 1992, the Imported Food Control Act 1992, the Moomba&hyphen;Sydney Pipeline System Sale Act 1994, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967, the Quarantine Act 1908, the Sea Installations Act 1987 and the Social Security Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 (AHC Act) specifies that the Australian Horticultural Corporation (AHC) consists of a chairperson, a government member, a managing director and six other members. The AHC has requested that the number of `other members` be reduced to four and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4226"> the horticultural industries participating in the AHC by way of statutory levy have supported the AHC's request. The AHC has put forward this proposal as part of a package of proposals designed to reduce AHC overheads and reduce the cost of participation, for horticultural industries, in the AHC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill gives effect to the AHC's proposal by amending the AHC act to reduce the number of `other members' on the AHC from six to four. The number of members required for a quorum will also be reduced from five to four.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to sections 23, 24A and 24B of the Export Control Act 1982 are to allow the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) to confirm that Australia's export control legislation provides appropriate coverage to contemporary administrative arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under current export inspection arrangements there is a strong move for exporters to assume more responsibility for the quality of their product under AQIS supervised and approved quality systems. Amendments proposed to section 23 of the act will allow the secretary of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to appoint suitably qualified persons to issue a limited range of certificates required to facilitate the export of prescribed goods from Australia. This proposal will extend the certification power exercised by authorised officers, generally AQIS inspection staff, to qualified on&hyphen;site staff who will certify that goods submitted for export were produced in accordance with an AQIS approved quality system. AQIS inspection staff will continue to be responsible for country to country certification required for the export of prescribed goods from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sections 24A and 24B of the act were inserted in 1990 to protect the integrity of new electronic documentation systems which were to be introduced by AQIS to facilitate the application process for export permits. Given the flexibility that new technology has been able to offer AQIS in the implementation and upgrading of these systems, it has now become necessary to amend the specifications governing the communication between AQIS and users of the electronic data system. Many players in the meat export industry, for example, are responsible to some degree for the entering and transmission of data into electronic documents, which will eventually be sent to AQIS as requests for export permits, these players include registered processing establishments, brokers, exporters, cold store operators and AQIS authorised officers. The proposed amendments to sections 24A and 24B provide the appropriate coverage for control over such electronic transmissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 will allow recovery of drought relief payments (DRP) overpayments through a range of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mechanisms that currently apply to specific social security payments (not including DRP).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Farm Household Support Act 1992 provides for overpayments of DRP to be recovered as a debt due to the Commonwealth, but it does not specify the means by which these debts may be recovered. This amendment will provide the mechanisms by which DRP debts can be recovered, thereby maintaining equity with other social security payments such as Newstart allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recovery mechanisms that will be made available include deductions from the DRP, deductions from a social security payment, legal proceedings and garnishee notices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment to the Imported Food Control Act 1992 will allow the Governor&hyphen;General to make regulations to exempt certain New Zealand food from the provisions of the imported food control act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will enable Australia to legally meet obligations under the Trans&hyphen;Tasman Mutual Recognition Agreement (TTMRA) where food safety and food standards are considered equivalent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under this agreement, food imported from New Zealand will be treated as if produced here, and inspection will be at the market place rather than upon entry to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Passage of this amendment will enable regulations to be made to mirror the intention of the TTMRA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed exemption power applies only to the imported food control act. Australia's quarantine requirements are not affected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, in 1994 the Commonwealth sold the pipeline authority's pipelines to East Australian Pipeline Ltd. That sale included provisions to make the Commonwealth and East Australian joint owners of the more than 1,000 easements covering the pipeline system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part of the sale agreement involved the Commonwealth entering into a contractual obligation to rectify any shortcomings in the existing pipeline easement corridor that might subsequently come to light and that were necessary for pipeline operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">East Australian has identified a number of such easement requirements. Shortly after the sale, a misdescribed easement was also discovered in the schedule of those easements whose ownership had been transferred from the pipeline authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the 1994 sale act did not provide a mechanism for dealing with easement description errors and the additional easement requirements the Commonwealth had contractually agreed to meet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Moomba&hyphen;Sydney Pipeline System Act 1994 will allow the Commonwealth to fulfil its contractual obligations in respect of such 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4227"> easements. They will also enable it to deal with any similar easement problems that might in future come to light without recourse to further legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to allowing for easement adjustments, these amendments will also enable the Commonwealth to transfer to other parties ownership of its residual easement interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Moomba pipeline sale was being negotiated, transfer of all related easements was considered by the Commonwealth. However, a decision to retain for the time being joint easement ownership with East Australian was taken for two reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In June 1994, the $200 million Moomba to Botany ethane pipeline project for ICI was still being developed. This pipeline required the use of the same easement corridor as the existing pipeline to Sydney. Further, the proponents of the eastern gas pipeline project to bring natural gas from Bass Strait to New South Wales markets had not yet settled a preferred pipeline route. One of the various options being canvassed involved making partial use of the existing Moomba&hyphen;Sydney easement corridor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of these circumstances, an ownership interest in the easements was maintained by the Commonwealth to ensure that easement access issues did not become an issue for either project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today ICI's ethane pipeline is built and operating, and the eastern gas pipeline project has selected a route well to the east of the Moomba&hyphen;Sydney pipeline corridor. Since the sale, no other potential users of the easements have come to light.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, there are now no foreseeable policy reasons for the Commonwealth to remain an easement owner indefinitely. However, continuing access rights to the easements for any new users that might emerge in the future can and would be secured as a condition of any divestiture by the Commonwealth of its easements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given these changed circumstances, it is prudent to provide the means for the Commonwealth to divest itself of its easements should an appropriate opportunity arise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the petroleum (Submerged lands) act will ensure that petroleum pipelines on the Australian continental shelf that carry petroleum from a source outside Australian waters come within the scope of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. This will facilitate projects such as the proposed gas pipeline from Papua New Guinea to North Queensland, and the proposed gas pipeline from the Timor Gap zone of co&hyphen;operation to Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also ensure that any changes to the territorial sea baselines do not impact on any 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> offshore petroleum pipeline licences granted under Commonwealth jurisdiction. This will give certainty to holders of offshore pipeline licences if changes to baselines occur. Similar amendments relating to petroleum exploration permits, production licences and retention leases will be introduced after necessary consultation with the states and the Northern Territory is concluded. Under the provisions of the offshore constitutional settlement, states and the Northern Territory are expected to mirror these amendments in their offshore petroleum legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill has been drafted to ensure that the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 remains consistent with Australia's international obligations namely:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1982 United Nations convention on the law of the sea.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The treaty between Australia and the independent state of Papua New Guinea concerning sovereignty and maritime boundaries in the area between the two countries, including the area known as Torres Strait, and related matters</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The treaty between Australia and the Republic of Indonesia on the zone of co&hyphen;operation in an area between the Indonesian province of East Timor and northern Australia.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recently signed maritime boundary treaty between Australia and Indonesia, once that treaty is ratified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Sea Installations Act 1987 is a consequential amendment to exempt offshore petroleum pipelines from the operation of that act where those pipelines are required to be licensed under the provisions of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. This will ensure that all Commonwealth offshore petroleum pipelines are covered by the same legislation and will prevent overlapping jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes proposed to the Quarantine Act 1908 are intended to clarify and confirm the legislative basis for contemporary quarantine practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Prime Minister stated in his ministerial statement to the parliament of 3 March, on Australia's ocean policy, we are facing an increasing problem controlling foreign marine organisms introduced into Australian coastal waters and ports, attached to ships hulls or in ballast water on ships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A provision of this bill seeks to confirm the importance of the requirements for the proper cleansing of ships and ballast water before these vessels enter Australian ports, subject to proper maritime safety measures. The bill also clarifies the requirement to make available samples of ballast water for testing and examination. The penalty for failing to comply with orders about the cleaning processes ($50,000 for an individual, $250,000 for 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4228"> a corporation) is a clear statement of the government's strong commitment to encourage responsible compliance to protect our coastal environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another focus of the bill is to have appropriate legislative authority to support the quarantine proclamations and regulations. Within my department significant effort has been directed to the revision and consolidation of the delegated legislation in order to have effective and efficient administration systems to meet Australia's contemporary quarantine needs. The recently presented Nairn report on the Australian quarantine review noted the work in progress on updating the quarantine proclamations and regulations and recommended that it be expedited. It is my intention to submit the updated proclamations and regulations to the executive council after these amendments have been considered by parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to emphasise that these amendments reflect only one recommendation (of a total of 109) made in the Nairn report. As Nairn has recommended, this matter is being dealt with promptly. The government is still considering the other recommendations of the Nairn report and its comprehensive response to the report will be issued in due course.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Australian Science and Technology Council Act 1978 implements the government's election commitment to add the field of engineering to the Australian Science and Technology Council's range of responsibilities. To reflect the Council's additional functions this bill will change the name of the Council to the Australian Science, Technology and Engineering Council. Selection of this name will have the added benefit of avoiding a change to the acronym ASTEC, which already enjoys widespread recognition both within Australia and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the procedure for making appointments to the Council will be made more efficient. The previous arrangement of requiring appointments by the Governor General was overly time consuming and complex.

These signals are currently used in surveying, communications, aviation and shipping navigation. This amendment will ensure that measurements are made on a consistent basis throughout the nation and are compatible with measurements in other countries. Responsibility for maintaining UTC is to rest with CSIRO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The repeal of the section 9AB of the Science and Industry Research Act 1949 will reflect the new framework developed by the Review of CSIRO's Management Structure and Performance. The repeal of the section will remove the old CSIRO research management structure under which CSIRO's research divisions were grouped into Institutes. The repeal will enable a new research management system that clearly refocusses research delivery activities on identified industry, economic or national benefit sectors and enables CSIRO's various research divisions to work in full alliance, free of the limiting rigidities of the Institute structure as identified during the CSIRO review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 repeal two subsections of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The repeal of subsection 14(3) addresses an administrative oversight concerning the retirement age of appointed Australian Tourist Commission Board members. The Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1991 was intended to remove age restrictions for the appointment and the continuation of appointment, of non-executive statutory office holders in the then Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories portfolio. However, while the subsection in the Australian Tourist Commission's legislation restricting the age of appointment for Board members was removed in 1991, subsection 14(3), which relates to the continuation of appointment after the age of 65, was overlooked. The proposed amendment removes this anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The repeal of subsection 42(3) of the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 will remove possible confusion relating to conditions of employment of Australian Tourist Commission officers. Subsection 42(3) currently provides that a person shall not be employed by the Board on terms and conditions more favourable than those applying to the Managing Director.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The business environment in which the Australian Tourist Commission operates has changed considerably since 1987 when this legislation was introduced. In some countries where the Australian Tourist Commission has overseas offices, the high cost of living has resulted in substantially higher wages in Australian dollar terms than those prevailing in Australia. The amendment will remove any anomaly, in relation to the conditions of employ

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Australians we all believe that we should be able to maintain the same high standard of living that we have enjoyed throughout out lives, when we become older. The vision that this government has for older Australians is to build an aged care system that will maintain comfort and dignity in a way that is viable and sustainable. To build a safe and secure future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am very pleased today to introduce the Aged Care Bill 1997&mdash;a major piece of legislation that will guarantee these outcomes for older Australians. It will see the most significant reform of aged care services in Australia for over a decade. This legislation delivers on the government's 1996 Budget announcements and election commitments to build a secure future for older Australians in partnership with the aged care industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we do not undertake reform now, older people will not face a secure future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, many of our nursing homes do not provide accommodation that meets basic community expectations. Almost 40% of residents share a room of four or more beds&mdash;a situation that most Australians would consider unacceptable when talking about someone's home.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is unnecessary administrative red tape that nursing home proprietors have to contend with that deflects from the primary aim of the industry&mdash;to provide quality aged care services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no incentives built into the current system to address these problems. The system is rigid in its application and outdated.

It maintains what works well in the current system and makes improvements where we have learned from experience to ensure the provision of better care. It also makes clearer that for those permanently entering residential care this is their new hone. As the case is in society more broadly, there is an expectation that those who have an ability to provide for their accommodation costs should do so, and should make a contribution to care based on means.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It replaces the provisions in the National Health Act 1953 and the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 under which nursing home and hostels are currently administered. Home and Community Care services are not covered by this bill as they are administered jointly by the States and the Commonwealth under the Home and Community Care Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the bill provides important links with the wider spectrum of care in the community. Together with the Home and Community Care program, older Australians are now able to access a wide range of services according to their needs and preferences, whether in their own home or in residential aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms contained within this bill have been developed in close consultation with industry and consumers to ensure that the system takes into account the realities of service delivery and, at the same time, provides high quality care for consumers.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This consultation process culminated in the release of an exposure draft of the bill for public comment in February. We received many comments and suggestions for making improvements. This government has listened to the suggestions made and refined the bill accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A UNIFIED RESIDENTIAL CARE SYSTEM</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill recognises that over the last decade, services provided by nursing homes and hostels and the care needs of residents have become increasingly similar. Today, there is a significant overlap in the frailty of residents in the two systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are funding gaps in the system through which some groups of older people slip. This is particularly the case for older people with dementia. It also includes people with high care needs in hostels who receive less in Commonwealth funding than people in nursing homes with similar care needs. This is an inequitable situation that must be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The dual nature of the classification and funding system currently used in nursing homes and hostels has perpetuated these problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will align these classification and funding arrangements. This will overcome funding gaps and provide better assessment of the physical and mental frailty of all residents to ensure that residents are funded properly according to their care needs no matter where they are residing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes will facilitate diversity and a broader range of care options for consumers. Whilst some facilities will continue to specialise in nursing home, hostel or dementia care, others will offer a broader range of services that allow residents to age in place as their care needs change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes will mean certainty and security for older people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To complement the alignment of funding and classification systems, there will be changes that will mean less unnecessary red tape for nursing home providers so that they can get on with the job of providing quality care. Changes to nursing home financial accountability will facilitate enterprise bargaining and workforce adjustment. This streamlined system will be similar to the way that hostels have operated successfully for many years with a focus on outcomes for residents rather than inputs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INCOME TESTING</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second major reform contained in the bill is income testing of all people who receive residential care from the time the legislation comes into force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This reform recognises that the provision of residential care is expensive&mdash;ranging from about 38 to 46 thousand dollars per year for someone in a nursing home depending on the level of care. Of this the Federal government contributes between 29 and 37 thousand dollars from taxpayer revenue. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4231">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These income testing provisions are similar to, and will replace, on commencement, the Aged Care Income Testing Bill 1997. This bill will allow income testing to begin prior to the commencement of the Aged Care Bill enabling people to be advised about their potential charges as much in advance as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Income testing recognises that as the older population continues to increase over coming decades, this level of taxpayer support needs to be sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is responsible reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Income testing is being undertaken by the Departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs using the current income assessments that are routinely carried out in determining entitlements to pensions and benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The determination of income for people already in receipt of Social Security or Veterans' Affairs pensions or benefits will therefore be based on their existing available income information and they will not have to provide additional details. People will, however, be able to request a review of their determination if their circumstances have changed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, people who are not satisfied with decisions made about their income will have a right of appeal, first to the relevant Department and then to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or Social Security Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What will aged care recipients pay?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reality of income testing is that only those who can afford to pay a little more and make a fair contribution will be asked to do so. Older people will not be asked to pay what they cannot afford for the residential aged care services they need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Couples will have their income split for the purposes of income testing. They will not pay double because they are a couple!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently nursing home residents pay only a standard fee representing 87.5% of their pension towards their daily living costs. Hostel residents pay `variable fees' which do not have an upper limit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new system all nursing home and hostel residents will pay a basic daily resident fee as they do now. This fee will be based on 85% of the pension. This will enable service providers to raise the same base fee from hostel residents as they do from nursing home residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The percentage of the pension that makes up the base fee has changed only because pensioner residents will no longer receive the Residential Care Allowance (formerly known as Rent Assistance) paid by DSS and DVA but will instead will be eligible for the `pensioner supplement' paid to providers on their behalf. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part pensioners and non&hyphen;pensioners will pay an additional income tested fee of 25 cents for each dollar of private income above $50 a week or $88 combined for married couples.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there are limits to what a person can be asked to pay. The amount of fee that is payable by a resident will be capped so, regardless of how much a person's income is, they won't have to pay more than the maximum amount.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The alignment of fees may result in a small reduction in the amount of income that some hostel residents are left with after paying the base fee&mdash;around $5.50 per week. It will not be compulsory for hostels to charge a flat fee that would enable them to raise this additional amount.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RESIDENTIAL CARE ACCOMMODATION BONDS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also embodies strategies that will bring about improvements to the unacceptably poor quality of many nursing home facilities. It encourages nursing homes to invest in lifting accommodation standards to a quality level that all older Australians can enjoy. To achieve this the bill extends to nursing homes the `Entry Contribution' system that currently applies to people who enter hostel care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">'Entry Contributions' will now be known as accommodation bonds to better reflect their purpose&mdash;a bond designed to provide a valuable source of capital which will help improve and maintain the quality of residential aged care. It will not be compulsory for a provider to charge an aged care resident an accommodation bond. Some providers will therefore choose not to charge one as is currently the case with hostels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me emphasise that only those people who enter a nursing home after commencement of this legislation, who have not already paid one, and can reasonably afford it, may be asked to pay an accommodation bond.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A nursing home cannot ask its current residents to pay a bond. People who currently reside in hostels will have an agreement in place that sets out the amount of any entry contribution payable. These agreements will be honoured and residents will not be required to pay any extra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A bond will operate as a capital deposit which the provider holds while the resident is in the facility and refunds to the resident or their estate when they leave, less a modest contribution of up to $2,600 indexed per year for up to five years. This is a maximum of $13,000 that is retained by the provider.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to stress that people will not pay twice if they move to another facility. The bond from the first facility will be `rolled over' or immediately transferred to the new facility. There is also a range 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4232"> of payment options that consumers can choose that best suit their individual circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Residents who receive respite care in residential facilities will not pay an accommodation bond.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PROTECTIONS FOR PEOPLE WHO CANNOT PAY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has ensured that the bill contains strategies that will ensure that those who cannot afford additional fees or an accommodation bond will still be able to obtain the aged care services that they need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concessional Residents</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, every residential care facility will be required to set aside a minimum number of places for concessional residents. Concessional residents are people who are full or part pensioners, who have not owned their own home in the past two years and have assets under two and one&hyphen;half times the single age pension&mdash;about $22,500.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The number of concessional residents will be set in each region according to local need and, as an added incentive, providers will receive a higher government subsidy for these residents. Concessional residents will not be required to pay an accommodation bond.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will ensure that access to aged care will continue to be on the basis of need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the bill contains specific hardship provisions for people entering care who will leave a spouse, long term carer or resident family member in their home. In these cases the family home will not be counted in determining whether a person can reasonably pay a bond.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OTHER PROTECTIONS FOR OLDER PEOPLE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ensuring Rights and Quality</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides strategies for ensuring that the rights of aged care recipients and quality of care are maintained and strengthened. The legislation is based on the premise of helping to ensure that aged care recipients enjoy the same rights as all other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill maintains quality of care standards and clearly sets out the responsibilities that approved providers have to care recipients in ensuring their rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sanctions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also includes a range of sanctions for the small numbers of providers who do not meet their clearly defined responsibilities. These are responsibilities in relation to meeting user rights, quality of care and accountability requirements imposed in relation to Commonwealth funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This represents a major advance on current legislation.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sanctions process is based on the concept of `punishment fitting the crime'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is therefore a range of sanctions that can be imposed depending on the nature of the non&hyphen;compliance. These include, for example, the variation of a funding condition for a relatively minor act of non&hyphen;compliance through to revoking a provider's approval to provide aged care services and the appointment of an administrator to run the service where the non&hyphen;compliance is of a serious nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the system balances the degree of non&hyphen;compliance with how often non&hyphen;compliance has occurred in the past and imposes an appropriate sanction. It is a hierarchical process that sees the escalation of the seriousness of the sanction imposed for repeated non&hyphen;compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are, of course, appropriate notification and review provisions for the decision to impose sanctions, however, where there is an immediate and severe risk to the safety and well&hyphen;being of care recipients the notice provisions can be waived and a sanction imposed immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accommodation Bonds and Quality Assurance</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For those who lodge an accommodation bond the bill will ensure that this financial investment is protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before a provider can charge a bond, they must meet set standards for building quality and care through a process of certification and ultimately accreditation by a new independent Aged Care Standards Agency to be established from 1 January 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This means that providers will now have both the incentive and the means to invest in quality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mandatory prudential arrangements will be implemented to protect the bonds that people pay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Incorporation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another protection contained in the bill is the requirement for incorporation as a new condition of approval for all new and transferring providers of aged care services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Incorporation of new providers has advantages for people receiving aged care services as it clearly defines who has legal liability, for example, for the debts of an aged care facility as well as requiring providers to abide by the corporations law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OTHER CHANGES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also builds in increased flexibility and other improvements that will be to the benefit of consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Flexible Care</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill allows the Commonwealth to provide funding for Flexible Care Services to enable the development of innovative alternatives to standard 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4233"> residential or community care. For example, flexible care funding could be used to investigate the provision of care to groups of people with special needs such as those living in small or rural communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Existing innovative services such as Multi Purpose Services and Nursing Home Care Packages will be funded under these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other Benefits</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also maintains funding for unlimited hospital leave for both nursing home and hostel residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new system all residents of aged care services will now be entitled to 52 days of paid social leave each year. For nursing home residents this means access to an extra 24 days of social leave each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, funding for the costs of enteral feeding and continuous oxygen has been maintained and extended to hostel residents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill increases the choice available to people by maintaining the Exempt Homes Scheme which provides a higher level of services and accommodation for residents who pay additional charges and extends it to also apply to hostels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill refers to these services as Extra Service Arrangements which can now be offered in distinct parts of facilities, for example, a wing of a building.  In the past, only whole nursing homes were able to offer these services and hostels were excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Improved Administration</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes explicit how personal information is to be protected. This is in addition to normal administrative practice of storing information in a secure manner and only allowing access to those who have a need to know.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the bill sets out improved decision making processes for the Department of Health and Family Services to follow. The bill includes clear criteria on which decisions are to be made, time frames for making decisions and the requirement for providing reasons for decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People who are unhappy with a decision made about them are able to seek a review of that decision by the Department and then by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. To assist this process, the bill clearly sets out the decisions that are reviewable. This is a vast improvement on the current situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">EVALUATION OF THE REFORMS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have outlined, this legislation will implement significant changes to the way aged care services are provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this reform is urgently needed the government acknowledges that it would be irresponsible 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to allow the system to develop unchecked after the passage of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is therefore committed to evaluating the effectiveness of the reforms in achieving high quality care outcomes for older people within two years of the implementation of the package.  As a result, any adjustments that are considered necessary to ensure continued quality care outcomes for consumers, will be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process will be undertaken in partnership with consumers and industry to continue the co&hyphen;operative and beneficial relationship that has resulted during the development of this package of reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, I am committed to ensuring we target the areas of highest need for new services. I will shortly commence a review of how we allocate and target new services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides the framework for the future of aged care services in this country. It represents the outcome of much hard work by many sectors of the industry and consumer representatives who have made significant contributions to the reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It strikes a balance between residents needs and the need to ensure that nursing homes and hostels are able to provide quality accommodation and services now and into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides incentives for excellence and encourages innovation, flexibility and creativity in service planning and delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We owe it to the older Australians who have contributed in many ways to Australian society to ensure the comfort and dignity that they deserve in the later years of their lives.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend Part 3 of the Migration Act 1958 which provides for the Migration Agents Registration Scheme. The bill amends section 333 of the Migration Act which contains a sunset clause. Under this clause, the Migration Agents Registration Scheme will terminate on 21 September 1997, after having operated for five years. The amendment will have the effect of terminating the Scheme on 21 March 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that the bill was considered non&hyphen;contentious in the House of Representatives and was passed with the support of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators will be aware that the Migration Agents Registration Scheme was recently reviewed by a task force within the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The task force was guided by a reference group headed by Mr Ian Spicer, former Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review recognised that the Migration Agents Registration Scheme had provided a measure of consumer protection and had removed a number of incompetent or unscrupulous operators from the migration advice industry. It was supportive of the industry moving to self&hyphen;regulation, where its members voluntarily join an industry body and agree to meet the competency and ethical standards set by the body. The body, in turn, sets in place procedures for disciplining members who breach its code of conduct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In considering the task force's Report, the government recognised that the migration industry is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> disparate and lacks a body with sufficient coverage and infrastructure to take on the task of self&hyphen;regulation at this time. Consequently, the government has decided to introduce a form of statutory self&hyphen;regulation as a transitional stage, with an eventual move to full self&hyphen;regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under statutory self&hyphen;regulation, regulatory power is delegated to an industry body and, subject to an agreement between the body and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the body takes on the administration and enforcement of regulation. The Migration Institute of Australia is prepared to take on the role of industry regulator and is aware of the parameters under which such an agreement would operate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to improving competency standards and providing an enhanced consumer protection focus through a complaints resolution process, the industry body will also be able to impose disciplinary sanctions against agents who behave in an unethical or grossly unprofessional manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed six months extension of the existing Scheme to 21 March 1998 will enable the government to develop and introduce legislation shortly for this transitional period of statutory self&hyphen;regulation for the migration advice industry. It will also allow the Migration Institute of Australia time to establish the infrastructure to take on this new self&hyphen;regulation role.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Chamber.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AGED CARE (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, the Aged Care (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997, establishes the transitional provisions and consequential amendments to move from the current legislative framework for aged care, to the new system under the Aged Care Bill 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill repeals provisions of the National Health Act 1953 and the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 that are no longer required and maintains other sections applying to periods prior to the commencement of the Aged Care Bill 1997. It also contains necessary transitional provisions for a smooth transfer from the old legislation to the new.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the bill amends relevant legislation of the Departments of Social Security and Veterans' Affairs and others to take account of the new aged care provisions. These are technical amendments only, for example, the bill amends definitions in these acts to reflect the changes embodied in the Aged Care Bill 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In considering these transitional issues, we have adopted an approach that provides security and minimises intrusion into the lives of those persons already receiving aged care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, formal agreements between hostel providers and residents concerning entry contribu 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4235"> tions and fees, will be maintained as resident agreements under the Aged Care Bill 1997. This will protect these residents from having to pay any more in entry contributions than they have already paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current approvals and classifications will be maintained for existing residents ensuring that they will not need to go through another approval and classification procedure, until those classifications expire.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also clarifies a number of exempt status issues for residents receiving these services. For example, existing exempt residents will continue to pay the same exempt fee and will not be income tested.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill ensures that current service providers are not unduly burdened with administrative red tape in moving to the new system. This bill gives providers of aged care certainty in the transition from the old system to the new.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, approved operators currently providing care, or who have approvals to provide care under the National Health Act 1953 or the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 before the commencement of the Aged Care Act 1997, will automatically become approved providers under the Aged Care Bill 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This approval will be retained whether or not these organisations are incorporated. This bill specifically allows existing approved operators to choose not to incorporate at the time of transfer to the new system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aged Care (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1997 also makes provision for applications made under the old legislation, that are not finalised at the commencement date of the Aged Care Bill 1997, to be considered under the new bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, applications for approved operator status will be considered as applications for approved provider status under the Aged Care Bill 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition sanctions on providers,that are now in place remain as sanctions under the new bill. In addition, for Commonwealth funding received by providers up until the commencement day of the new legislation, this legislation will preserve the accountability processes so that this funding can be acquitted after the commencement of the new-act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consequential amendments will also red*ect the payment of Residential Care Allowance (formerly Rent Assistance), to providers of residential aged care rather than to residents. This is a technical change only that is designed to simplify administrative arrangements. It will not significantly affect either the amount of income residents are left with after they pay the base fee, or the total funding available for providers. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will also amend the National Health Act 1953 in relation to a 1997 budget announcement to increase the number of days of respite that a person in receipt of the Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefit is eligible for. This will be an increase from 42 to 63 days of respite per year from July 1998.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this amendment is not directly linked to the residential aged care reforms, which are the main subject of this bill, it supports greater flexibility in the broader spectrum of aged care services that are available. People who receive DNCB do so because they provide 24 hour a day nursing home level care to their spouse or other relative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment recognises the dedication of these carers to their family member and is another step towards honouring this government's commitment to carers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are committed to achieving substantial reform in the residential aged care sector. This bill is essential to that reform and is the link between current legislation and the new Aged Care Bill 1997 that will allow this transition to occur.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AGED CARE (COMPENSATION AMENDMENTS) BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Act 1995 to reflect the changes resulting from the introduction of 5 the government's aged care reform package. The changes are reflected in the Aged Care Bill 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Health and Other Services (Compensation) Care Charges Act 1995 provides for the Commonwealth to recover moneys it has paid to, or on behalf, of a person for their care. The recovery is able to be made when the person receives a compensation ruling which includes the cost of nursing home care up to the date of settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed in this bill are required because under the Aged Care Bill 1997 nursing homes will cease to exist when they become part of the new unified residential care system.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">The reason for this amendment is that, peppered throughout the act and the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> 1996 are references to the place where mining occurs, or the place where the mining operation is carried on. But that term is not defined in the act or the bill and it seems to us that, for clarity of understanding and, in particular, given that the words the `place where the mining operation is carried on' carries significance here for claiming of the rebate, the term should be defined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The words we have proposed by way of this amendment do that. They define it and they clarify it. That clarity of definition and understanding will be of great value, we believe, to the enforcing agency here, the customs department, and to the mining industry, who have to work under the provisions of this legislation and who regard apprehensively the ambiguity that is currently surrounding the meaning of the place where mining is carried on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me support that comment that I have just made, about the term `regard apprehensively the ambiguity that is currently surrounding the meaning of the place where mining is carried on', by referring to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee which conducted an inquiry into this legislation on 25 February last. In particular, I refer to page E15. At that page there appears a map which was tendered in evidence to the Senate hearing by the President of the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, a Mr Maynard. That map is of a mineral lease. It is headed, `Association of Mining and Exploration Companies: Layout of a Mining Operation'. In the bottom right&hyphen;hand corner there is a legend interpreting all of the signs and details of this map.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accompanying that document, which appeared in the hearing as an exhibit, there is, on page E16 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, a presentation which I do not intend to read into the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> here but I want to reference for the sake of this debate all of what Mr Maynard says on that page and the spill&hyphen;over to page E17. The point about Mr Maynard's evidence&mdash;and I repeat that he is, I understand, the president of AMEC&mdash;is to show, as he does I think comprehensively, the degree of confusion that can arise over a non&hyphen;clear definition of the meaning of `at the place'.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4237">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those of us who had the responsibility of sitting on the Senate inquiry taking evidence from industry will remember, I think quite graphically, that at the end of this section of evidence we all shook our heads in confusion at the very many ways in which an industry spokesperson had illustrated that the place where mining is carried on could be defined in so many different and conflicting manners so as to create real doubt as to what was being referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that the departmental evidence later was drawn on the accuracy of all that Mr Maynard said, and that the departmental evidence refuted, in part, some of those things that Mr Maynard had put, but I do not think it is fair to say that departmental evidence refuted in whole what Mr Maynard had said. Indeed, one is left, in reading both what the department and Mr Maynard have put, with a real feeling that there is a serious problem here and one that must be addressed. The purpose of our amendment is to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In arriving at the words that we have included in our amendment we have been assiduous in talking to industry as to what a reasonable&mdash;I underline the word `reasonable'&mdash;definition of `place where the mining operation is carried on' would be. These words, which we initially crafted, are not our words in the final outcome but they are words that have been amended by taking on board informed industry commentary as to what would be the appropriate definition. In saying that, I do not lay it at the door of any particular industry body but say that this is indeed a definition which would have widespread industry support and I think does the job of addressing the clarity question for the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One might say, `All this is very well. It's an interesting story, but is it necessary at the end of the day because "at the place where mining is carried on" can easily be argued in physical terms; there is a mine and there is a place or a site where that is carried on.' That is, I think, potentially a fairly damning argument and I, therefore, want to deal with it in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the words `at the place' or reference to the location appear so frequently throughout the act and the bill that it is necessary, on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a plain person's reading of all of that, to come up with a definition so that we know what is being referred to. Secondly, it is not a matter of simply referencing an area, because this deals with mining leases, legal entitlement, all sorts of tenure rights, licensing rights and things of that nature too. It is not a matter to be resolved simply by referencing the physical area in which the actual mining is carried on. One needs a more complex treatment of the subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, industry is apprehensive and it is against a background of this act being a highly litigious act. We have had, in the evidence before the Senate inquiry, a great deal of evidence about a series of cases before the AAT and some cases that went as far as the High Court on defining what the meaning of particular provisions were. I will not delay the Senate now but you will recall that when this bill was last before the chamber&mdash;not in today's treatment but on the previous occasion&mdash;to some extent we debated the issues of the salt industry. The salt industry had a legal claim upheld by the Federal Court, and the High Court refused to take an appeal from the Customs service, as to whether their particular processes conformed to the actual act. At the end of the day it was found that they did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is just one example of quite expensive and lengthy litigation over the meaning of words in this act. I can give the Senate another example, that is, in the case of the amendment we dealt with which was moved by the opposition upon resumption of play today relating to the cement industry. The cement industry has cases on foot before the AAT at the present time. The point I make is that this is an area of great litigation. It is an area where there are serious claims and entitlements being pursued and, if there are vagaries or ambiguities in the act, it is, I think, our responsibility as legislators to clear that up directly and unambiguously so that to the extent that litigation as to meaning can be avoided, we have done our job to ensure it has been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth point I make with respect to this concerns this argument about varying interpretations that are placed on `the place where mining might be carried on'. This is an 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4238"> industry argument in which industry cogently, convincingly and persuasively argue that they lack confidence in a consistent interpretation being applied by the Customs Service to the meaning of `the place where mining is carried on'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They argue that they are replete with examples of where different interpretations to that phrase have been applied by the Customs Service. I have not chased down each one of these things, and I am not in a position to say that in all cases the industry are right; it may well be that in some cases they are not. But the fact that they are apprehensive and can argue convincingly about varying interpretations by the Customs Service of the meaning of these words is a fourth reason why a prudent legislature would move to create clarity on this subject.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are the reasons I have moved the amendment. I remind the chamber that the amendment would, in the definitions part of this act, clarify the definition of `where the mining operation is carried on'. The words contained in this amendment to clarify that are unexceptional and reasonable words. They are not seeking to distort or extend a definition unreasonably in any direction. They are simply there to correctly and accurately describe what such a place might be. Because they do not change the real meaning of the act, they should not involve any extra costs either way. They should not create a saving and they should not create a cost. They should be cost neutral.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to quickly say why the government will not be accepting or supporting the amendment. Prior to doing that, let me state for the record that, to the best of my advice, Mr Maynard is not the president of AMEC; he is actually a consultant employed by AMEC. The government is opposed to this amendment because we believe that it would actually result in quite a substantial expansion of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. I guess we are a bit confused as to what the Labor Party is doing, because to remove the `connected with' provisions would seem to be in absolute contravention to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the measures it took when it was in power. We believe that in particular transport activities could well become eligible and that this would involve a significant increase in expenditure in and expansion of the rebate scheme.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested in this issue as well. If the amendment simply defines or makes a legitimate effort to ensure that legitimate mining activities are not excluded simply because, for example, a beneficiation plant is sited on freehold land rather than leasehold land, that might be a reasonable thing to do, if that is the case, and it is just a matter of clarifying it. The parliamentary secretary has indicated that the amendment will extend the scheme, but unfortunately he has not given us any more details in relation to what this extension means, how it is extended and what are the financial implications of this extension so that I can get an idea&mdash;because I really want to listen to the debate&mdash;of how this is likely to be extended as a result of what Labor are calling a clarification of the definition.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We considered putting forward a definition which would define `the place where mining is carried on'. As I said in my primary remarks, the amendment is not to distort that definition to bring in new areas that were not intended, but to get the definition right. So our intention was never to open the door to other areas, such as transport, as the parliamentary secretary has put. If the parliamentary secretary could demonstrate how that happens and how that might be closed off, we would be amenable to achieving that goal as long as the words that he puts do not somehow detract from the definition of genuinely what is the place. Our definition reads: </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4239">

<PARA STYLE="Para">That seems to me not to open the door to transport in any way and, with those words that I emphasised at the end&mdash;`which constitute a mining operation as defined'&mdash;ought to put the issue beyond doubt. So I think it would be useful if the parliamentary secretary could, rather than just issue these observations as throwaway lines, explain more fully what he actually means. If he can demonstrate that this does do that, if there is a further form of words which do not detract from this definition and does close off that loophole, we would be amenable to it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will give it my best shot, Senator Lees. As I am informed, the act, as it stands, defines the places at which certain activities take place quite tightly. This amendment would broaden it by bringing in an overall definition which brings in&mdash;and I quote from the amendment&mdash;`all mining leases, production leases, exploration leases'. It can easily mean any activity, including transport, that takes place on that mining lease or on that tenement. That is the advice that we have got. It allows for a much broader interpretation of what `place' means. `Place' is defined at the moment under the act, and I refer senators to section 164&mdash;the relevant section which refers to the range of activities that take place under the act.</PARA></TALK.START>

So we cannot tell you whether it will be another $100 million, $50 million or whatever; it will depend on the court's interpretation of what can only be described by anyone who has seen any litigation on these matters as a substantial broadening of the definition.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, I understood the minister to say that section 164 of the act defines `at the place' quite tightly. What is true is that section 164 of the act is the definitions section and that under that section `mining operations' is defined. The definition of `mining operations' goes on for a little more than 3&half; pages. It is quite extensively defined. But, in defining `mining operations', there appear on a number of occasions, for example, these words: `referring to a coal stockpile management for the prevention of spontaneous combustion of coal if the management is carried on at the place where the mining operation is carried on'. Elsewhere it refers to `the person who carried on the mining operation at the place' or `a person contracted by that person to carry out the rehabilitation'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just by twice randomly dipping into this 3&half;&hyphen;page definition of `mining operations' you 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4240"> can see that, in the definition of `mining operations', `the place' is referred to, and it is referred to in quite important contexts. It is for those reasons in the first instance that it appeals to us that `at the place' should be defined. I do not accept what the minister says: that it is defined quite tightly. `Mining operations' is defined over 3&half; pages, but I do not see that `at the place' is defined. It is for those reasons that we have moved our amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming to Senator Lees's point: these words are a subdefinition of the definition `mining operations'. They seek to clarify those sections in this part of the definitions which contain `the place'. So it only amplifies or makes clearer the meaning of `the place'. If `the place', where it is used in one or other of these definitions, refers to something that might tangentially relate to transport or adjoining leases, then all this definition does is make it clear what `the place' means. It does not go to incorporating the next step of whether adjoining leases are acceptable or transport between or within a site is acceptable. Those definitions are already covered here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only point of clarity that is made is where the words `at the place' occur, and then that is now clear. I am sorry if that sounds like a tortuous explanation. It does not seek to change the character of the definition of `mining operations'; it only seeks to make clear what `at the place' means.</PARA></SPEECH>

Perhaps to be more specific, the minister might give me an idea of who might be included and who currently is not included. If we are going to clarify the definition, we need to know which people are likely to be affected. Perhaps the minister can give us an idea of who might be included and who currently is not included under this definition and, alternatively, Senator Cook can give us an idea of who currently is excluded and who legitimately should be, according to him, included. If we can get a picture of that, we might have a better idea of knowing exactly what we are dealing with. At the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite complex and it is hard to make it absolutely clear, but I think giving an example is a good way to do it. Under section 164, particularly under the definition of `mining operations', which Senator Cook referred to earlier, there is&mdash;and the fact that it goes on for 3&half; pages tends to reinforce this&mdash;quite a tight link about the activity and the place. I think Senator Cook and I would both agree with that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we believe this definition would do, and what it would bring in, by particularly referring to a list of leases such as mining leases, production leases, prospecting licences and so forth, is to ensure that these activities could take place on any of those properties&mdash;if we use the more generic term `properties'&mdash;and could be bought into the rebate scheme. That is what we are concerned about. I think everyone has noted in the debate that the courts do spend a lot of time arguing over these things when making definitions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that this definition in itself would go in the opposite direction. We are trying to tighten it and make it more specific. This amendment would create a situation that does substantially expand it&mdash;because of the nature of the definition&mdash;by bringing in all of those different properties where these activities could take place.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts asked me to explain what is left out and what is left in as a consequence of this. Can I go back to what I initially said: it is not intended to bring in anything new or exclude anything new. This definition seeks to define the meaning of the place where the mining operation is carried on. Walking my way through it&mdash;I have done this twice now so I will not do it a third time&mdash;it seems to me that the question is: is a place where mining is carried on the collection of all mining leases? I think that, reasonably, yes, when mining is carried on on a mining lease, that is a place where it is carried on&mdash;and on a production lease and on an exploration lease, and so it goes through all of the particular categories here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My understanding&mdash;I am not a lawyer and if I were, I could not give a legal opinion&mdash;of the legal meaning of putting down each of these particular categories of entitlement means that you limit it to those categories, because this does not have a phrase at the end of it `and all other things that might be

If you read that in tandem with the proposed new section 164 subsection (vii) that this amendment would insert, which brings in production leases, exploration leases, prospecting licences, miscellaneous licences, general purpose leases and similar leases or licences, then it would permit all of those licences to be defined as mining operations, and would basically allow the DFRS to apply it to the construction of roads at any of those properties. I think the word `properties' helps me to clarify it. I think Senator Cook is being absolutely honest when he says that it does not bring in something new but what it does is to allow something that is already defined in 164(o) as an example of those operations to take place on a whole range of other different properties and to be brought in in that manner.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish I had got the call before Senator Margetts. Just on the explanation given by the parliamentary secretary on subsection (o) of section 164, all that the amendment that I am proposing would do is define in subsection (i) `occurs at the place where the mining operation is carried on.' That place would then be defined as being one or other of those areas. If there is a mining operation being carried on there, that is a place within the meaning of subsection (o). It is not to say that all of these areas operate without there being a mining operation carried on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a definition of where a mining operation is carried on, so there has to actually be a mining operation. From that point of view, which, I submit, is the plain person's way of reading it, and therefore the sensible way of reading it, I do not see that the argument that the minister has put stands at all. This is not an extension. If there were all of those areas&mdash;all of those things like prospecting licences, exploration licences, production leases and mining leases&mdash;but with no mining carried on at any of them, there is no place within the meaning of this act and the extension that the government so fears would not occur. That is why I believe and submit that this is a neutral definition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly in support of my amendment. As I said, the opposition supports clause 7C, which concerns the beneficiation of ores bearing manganese minerals. But we have difficulty with 7D and we do not support it. Clause 7D states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In determining whether a particular process to which a mineral, or ores bearing a mineral, are subjected constitutes beneficiation of that mineral or those ores, no regard is to be had to any market 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4244"> considerations that might affect the decision to subject that mineral or those ores to that process.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What we object to are the words `market considerations'. Beneficiation is all about market considerations. The reason why you beneficiate ore is to meet your client's needs for a higher concentrated and better presented ore for their processes. If it is the ore I know best&mdash;iron ore&mdash;then you do it in such a way that it suits the blast furnace prescriptions, which are the formula that the particular client companies want.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Beneficiation is all about, in our view, meeting market considerations. The inclusion of those words, which have a limiting and exclusory effect on market considerations, seems to me to render to almost zero the significance of the particular provision being sought here. There is a lot of controversy associated with this section. Beneficiation is one of the areas that traditionally has attracted the diesel fuel rebate. In the original bill, beneficiation was reduced to a shell of its former self. The government has sought to restore that and this Senate has supported those amendments. The government sought to restore beneficiation to this legislation in its own amendments, which we dealt with the last time this bill was before the Senate. It did so after extensive consultation with industry. But this provision now takes away a lot of what was given then. We think that is wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the other hand, what my amendment will do is provide for the words `technical processes involved' in place of `market considerations'. So beneficiation can then be seen as part of the technical processes involved in preparation of the ore for the market. That, in my understanding, restores this provision to what was the case in the act and overcomes the problem the government has. It reflects the views of industry and it reflects, in my understanding, the outcome of discussions held with the high&hyphen;level negotiating group as well.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is getting to be an argument about the regressive nature of the diesel fuel tax. The first observation I make about what the government is now saying is that if a company moves into downstream processing&mdash;that is to say, the first stage of downstream processing is to beneficiate the ore to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4245"> be able to sell it at a higher value added level than it was in its pure state&mdash;it will, under the government definition, now be taxed, which to me is quite the reverse of what the national interest is in a case like this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, we are dealing with an industry which is a highly competitive international industry and where the technological change is quite rapid, and certainly quite rapid over recent years. The industry that most of all I have in mind here is the steel making industry. Iron ore and coal are the major exports from Australia. The beneficiation of iron ore is something that weighs heavily on all iron ore miners. In order to win and retain an ongoing place in the world market, beneficiation has become an essential step along the way, and, if beneficiation is to be discouraged by virtue of having to then pay the full tax because of market considerations, it defeats the whole process, I think, of maintaining a competitive industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just do not understand the government's argument here other than as a straight money&hyphen;grubbing argument. I cannot see that there is any industry goal achieved. If it is a money&hyphen;grubbing argument, it is also an argument counter to their own interest, because the best interest of this government is served by encouraging greater sales of beneficiated higher quality ore for a greater return to the Australian economy. The more you beneficiate the ore for international markets, the more people are employed in the downstream processing arrangements, and the budget is better repaired, from the income side, because of the growth and development of the industry. If you tax downstream processing, as this measure would now do, you limit the ability for the industry to grow, you reduce the jobs available and you simply make this a cold&hyphen;blooded cost cutting exercise which is negative in its outcome. For those reasons I just have to reject what the government is doing here.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The phrase `no regard is to be had to any market considerations that might affect the decision to subject that mineral or those ores to that process' is quite bizarre. I have noted, in relation to the salt process, that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> virtually every decision to beneficiate a mineral here or elsewhere, to sell it as a value added intermediate or primary ore at various levels of beneficiation, is a market decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that it is true that what we are seeing is a desire to cut back on the rebate, and of course we are happy with that, but it just does not seem to make sense in relation to this. Perhaps it might even have been better to say that regard is to be had for whether the process involves extraction or cleaning of a fundamental mineral or complex of minerals contained within an ore or if it constitutes a fundamental transformation of the mineral into another substance through chemical bonding, or if it constitutes a fundamental transformation of the mineral into a form having other properties through a process such as smelting or crystallisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that we have got a bizarre situation in this bill which is largely fiscally driven. It seems that maybe Finance are driving the definitions; and the definitions do not seem to make sense, so I will be supporting Senator Cook's proposal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Murray pointed out, this matter was dealt with extensively in the Senate Economics Committee hearing on this bill relating to the diesel fuel rebate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment, I regard, is aptly described as being one that tidies up the application of the bill in the way in which Senator Murray has referred to it. The difficulty with the government provision is that it does, I have to say, limit the effect of the diesel fuel rebate claims with regard to any market considerations, whereas this amendment ensures that it takes regard of the nature of the technical process involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate we were having a moment ago was about whether this disclaimer should appear in the legislation at all. The view we took in that debate was that it should not. Now, what we are saying is that the legislation should be modified, having regard not to market considerations but to the technical

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we completed debate on the Reform of Employment Services Bill a couple of weeks ago, we had begun the debate on amendment Nos 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7, which I moved as a group because they all go to inserting definitions of services and other matters into the government's bill. We had some discussion across the chamber as to whether or not there was any prospect of agreement on these matters. I think, from what the minister said, there probably is not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have had another look at our proposals and we are very much of the view that they ought to be insisted upon on the basis that the bill provides just the bare bones of a framework and it is very important in our view that the bill be enhanced to provide a commitment from this parliament to providing services to unemployed persons. We are most concerned that, without the totality of amendments we have moved, those services may not be provided. These amendments are part of the structure we are trying to put in place, the different model that Labor and the Democrats are arguing for which spells out commitments to provide services to unemployed persons in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The actual definitions are those that the government has included in other documentation. But, for some reasons, it sees fit not to include them in the bill. We think it is important that they are included. If we fail in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4252"> this bid to include the definitions, particularly in relation to the definition of employment services, we will have concerns that the bill will not allow the provision of services to those other than those on unemployment benefits.

Since we last debated this bill, we have had the recent unemployment statistics, which confirmed the fact that unemployment remained a serious and untackled problem in this country, that there were more people looking for work than in the previous month and that the numbers of long-term unemployed are increasing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is disgraceful that, in that context, we are debating a move by the government to reduce services to unemployed persons in this country. As I have said previously, the government has not made that all that explicit in either the debate or the bill. But the effect of this bill is to reduce services to unemployed Australians as well as to implement the new competitive market, which the government talks a lot about. So we think it is very important that these definitions are inserted as part of that alternative framework we are seeking to place within the bill.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These are the first of the sets of amendments which seek to incorporate into the legislation the public employment provider, or PEPE as it is more widely known. The government, in originally announcing its move to a competitive market, guaranteed a role for a public provider and announced that that would be contained in the legislation. Some time subsequent to that, the government announced a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> change in policy which provided for the PEPE to be a private corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we see from a review of this bill, there was actually not any mention at all in the legislation of the role of the public provider of employment services. If the bill is enacted unamended, then the government may or may not establish a public employment provider. It may or may not seek to continue that in years to come. The parliament would have no say in that matter. We would have no opportunity to review any decision to wind down the services of the public provider or, in fact, review a decision to wind up the public provider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this year's budget, the government included $180 million for the costs of establishing the PEPE. But, quite frankly, apart from that announcement there is very little detail. On questioning at the Senate estimates, we were unable to get any specific detail about the nature of the corporation and the nature of the advance in terms of whether that money had to be repaid or not. A whole range of issues still remain unanswered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We, in moving these amendments, are seeking to define the PEPE within the legislation and also to define private employment placement enterprises. We have set up a structure where the public provider and other providers are defined and established within the legislation so the things that the government assures us that they are going to do are entrenched in the legislation and, if there is any suggestion to walk away from what they have assured us is going to be the method for the new market, then they will require some sort of parliamentary scrutiny of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see this very much as giving effect to the government's assurances regarding the role of the public provider. It would, of course, be a very retrograde step if, after providing the Commonwealth employment services to the Australian unemployed since 1946, we were to end up in a situation where there was no public provider at all. We are very anxious to make sure that it is contained in the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make the point also&mdash;and perhaps this will be debated a bit later on&mdash;that this is not some mad socialist plot to establish one 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4252"> big gigantic public bureaucracy inside the employment market. In fact, we are accepting that the PEPE will compete on competitive terms with both private and community based organisations and that it ought to be able to find its niche and level in that market. None of our amendments seek to guarantee its share of the market or its role, other than later on seeking to make sure that it provides labour exchange services to those people whom the government currently intends not to fund for labour exchange services. That is the one thing that we do seek to prescribe in a later amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did want to make the point also that I have concerns, not that in some way this will compete to the detriment of the community services sector but that the community services sector will not be funded sufficiently for them to be able to compete. I will be raising that with the minister later. The minister would be aware of a range of letters from skillshares and other providers concerned about their ability to compete in the new market. We do not see the PEPE as operating in a way so as to exclude those groups from the market. In fact, we think that they have got a vital role to play and ought to be encouraged. We are concerned that, under the government's announced arrangements, they may not play the role that I think they ought to, given their expertise and the investment they have made in assisting unemployed persons already.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment seeks to substitute a new clause 9, which reflects the provisions of the government's bill, but adds two further measures. It includes reference to PEPE, as one of the entities engaged to provide employment services, but then adds two new provisions. The first provides that the employment secretary must not engage in an entity that is not an accredited employment placement enterprise. That refers to our attempt to assert in the bill accreditation of EPEs to ensure proper standards are established and maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second provision, contained in subclause (4), seeks to make it a condition of an agreement under this section that an entity, including the PEPE, must not demand or receive any fee or other similar consideration from an employer or a job seeker in respect of employment services provided under the agreement. Madam Temporary Chair, you would probably be aware that there has been a bit of a debate in recent times about who can and cannot charge for services for EPEs. It has been quite well canvassed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) was going to come into the parliament to correct some information that was given in the last session. In this amendment we spell out, in a sense, the role of PEPEs and EPEs. We also make it very clear that, where an agreement is established, neither the PEPE nor the EPE is allowed to charge fees to the job seeker nor to the employer in addition to that being met by the government. So the amendment is to establish that regime.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to repeat the comments of Senator Evans, except to say that I think the two important aspects of his amendment to the Reform of Employment Services Bill, which can be read together with amendment 13, are to focus on strengthening the role of the PEPE and the provision for accreditation. It is really important that we do not let just any old body roll up and say, `I can do this job.' 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> The public has to have confidence in basic standards being set for EPEs to meet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will go into some details later on and will raise some questions about who is going to line up and how this system can be exploited. We want to make sure that, in the balance of things, there is a strong PEPE, that there is as universal access as possible within a competitive regime and that those who want to be EPEs actually can prove that they can do the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is like the child care accreditation debate in many respects: you do not let just anybody do it; people have to prove that they can meet basic standards to provide the services. I want to reiterate something that builds on what Senator Evans said: all Australians, regardless of whether or not they are receiving unemployment benefits, should continue to have access to high quality labour exchange services.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="4253" TIME="8.33 p.m." SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Evans for reminding me: I indicated to a Senate estimates committee that I thought I had misled the public and the Senate on one matter. Relatively speaking it was minor. Nonetheless, I said that some states had legislation which prohibited charging for job placement and some did not, and, in the list of states that had legislation prohibiting it, I incorrectly included South Australia. The basic point remains the same&mdash;some states have legislation prohibiting it, some do not. But the list was incorrect in that South Australia was included on the wrong side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hope Senator Evans has engaged himself in asking Mr Ferguson to go on radio and assure the workers of Newcastle that Mr Ferguson's interpretation of the New South Wales law was, in fact, wrong. It is a very sad thing. There are people in New South Wales, around Newcastle, who are concerned about their future. They have jobs for I think up to two years from now and therefore will be looking to find new work, presumably under the proposed new regime, and will be concerned as to whether they could be charged or not. I have never complained about correcting an error if I have got it 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4254"> wrong. I just wish that the opposition spokesperson would do the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As to Senator Evans's amendments, Senator Kernot says that we have to have a requirement for accreditation because we cannot have any old body rolling up and delivering employment services and that the public must have confidence in basic standards. The inference she seeks to make is that, if we do not have accreditation, any old body will roll up and get a contract and the public will not have any confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, any old body will not roll up and get a contract. When you are putting nearly $2 billion worth of work out to tender, with a very elaborate tender process and with proper outside probity advice, it is unimaginable that any old body on a regular basis would just roll up and get a Commonwealth job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Senator Kernot thinks that little of the Commonwealth's capacity to do tenders, I do not know where she has been for the last few years. Sure there are mistakes in tenders. Sometimes the wrong person gets the job. In a very big contract for $2 billion worth of work, there might be one provider that gets a job that should not&mdash;one or two, some small amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generally speaking, do I have confidence in the capacity of the Commonwealth to tender out this work? Yes. If you tender out the work, do you tender it out to any old body, as Senator Kernot likes to refer to them? No, you do not. You obviously satisfy yourself as to a number of matters, including the financial viability of the people offering the service and the record of service that they have been able to offer in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot also says she agrees with Senator Evans that all Australians should have access to labour exchange services. All Australians will have access to the Commonwealth job vacancy database. They will be able to search that by their local region, by their state and Australia&hyphen;wide. But the government makes no apology for saying that we have designed a system that, in any queue for a job available, an employment placement enterprise&mdash;whether it is a private one or the public one&mdash;will put, where it can, an unem 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ployed person on benefit first. I would like to hear an argument that says that, with so many people unemployed and on benefits, we should not put them first in a queue for a job when it comes up.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="KERNOT" NAMEID="XW4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator Kernot</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nobody's saying that.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kernot interjects and says nobody is saying that but the import of the amendments is such that all job seekers would be treated equally. The fact of what Senator Kernot is arguing&mdash;she does not want to say it this way because it is an ugly reality for her to have to face&mdash;is that this government is absolutely determined to put unemployed people on benefits first in any queue for a job that is available. We are determined to achieve that. I think on that basis senators might see why&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS>  </PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Could I conclude on what I think is one of the very essential points about the new system. Shifting to a tender process means we are going to have a very rigorous tender evaluation process, which will include a check on conformity with the tender conditions, that they are all available; a check on financial viability; and an assessment against standard selection criteria for each of the five services. We are going to rely on surveys of job seekers to assess the performance of service providers against the standards of service established in contracts; that is, we are actually going to go to the unemployed people and say, `How do you think this service is benefiting you?' We have also indicated agreement to a code of conduct, which we think is very important, and a regime of performance audits on how the market is working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To add onto that an additional accreditation system simply means that you will have one bunch of people doing the accreditation, then it will go off for tender and the tender people will have to redo that work. It is simply  duplication&mdash;nothing more. I had thought during discussions I had with Senator Kernot that she appreciated this point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot also makes the point that she wants a strong universal service within a competent regime provided by people who can prove they can do the job. People are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4255"> going to have to prove they can do the job. I believe it will be a competent regime.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a universal service in terms of access to job vacancies but it is not a universal service in terms of all employment services. You do not have that now, Senator Kernot. Australians do not have universal access to all employment services now, so let no&hyphen;one pretend that they do&mdash;they simply do not. What Labor had designed as being case management is not available to all who want it. In respect of funds available, I have no complaint about this because there is no money tree. Labor was not able to meet the demand for case management. There has never been a situation where you could go and knock on the door and ask for whatever service you wanted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition to that, proposed subclause 9(4) seeks to indicate that an employment service provider will not be able to demand payment from an employer or a job seeker. I think that is just plainly ridiculous. They will not be able to demand payment from a job seeker whom the government is intending to assist; that is, an unemployed person on a benefit and young Australians looking for work. Generally speaking, that is a fair description of the category. I do not see why any Australian government should put services for someone who wants to change their job ahead of services for someone who is unemployed, on a benefit and looking for work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had 13 years of unacceptably high unemployment. The community is impatient; we are all impatient. Regrettably, we have to be patient and wait for the results of the changes we have made to fix that. In the meantime, while we are waiting for the effects of the changes we have made&mdash;which we believe will make a difference, will wash through the economy and will start to eat into the intolerably high unemployment we have&mdash;I do not think and this government does not think it unreasonable to put all of our efforts, all of our moneys and all of our care and attention first towards the people who are unemployed and on a benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought members opposite who contributed to putting them there would 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have supported us on that basis, but they do not. They want other people who are not in need of a benefit&mdash;people who have got a job and would like to change jobs, people who want more hours&mdash;to get the same attention as an unemployed person on benefit, and we think that is wrong. We are determined to put unemployed people on benefit first in any queue for a job, and consequently we simply cannot accept these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point is made that an employer should not be able to  be charged. Employers are charged now. They go to Drake Personnel or one of those temp services and say, `Send me someone,' and they are charged. I understand the charge relates to a proportion of the salary. And you want to undo that, presumably, and say that all of this should be provided gratis by the PEPE, and not just by the PEPE but, if I understand your amendment, by the EPEs as well. I do not know where the nirvana land is that you think we have arrived at, because the economic hellhole you put us in means we are quite a way away from being at that point. We have limited resources, and I conclude by saying we are determined to ensure that those limited resources go first to unemployed people on benefit and to young Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to take up a couple of those arguments. I think that the criteria that the minister spelled out are good, relevant criteria, and agreement to a code of conduct is good too, but it all relies on an essential acceptance that governments never get tendering processes wrong. In the public domain at the moment we have two examples&mdash;and admittedly it is at the state level&mdash;where the tendering process has gone awfully wrong. One is the ambulance service in Victoria: there are questions of probity of the process there. And in Queensland it has just been highlighted that a major tourism tender has  been given by the government to two declared bankrupts. I know you are putting in place reasonable criteria but I think it is wrong to assume that you will always get it right and that this extra scrutiny is not required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4256">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You talk about ugly realities. The ugly reality is the choices governments make about rationing. You say there are limited resources, and there are. But governments choose priorities, and your government has really chosen to spend very little on job creation. So we are setting up all these employment service providers for practically non&hyphen;existent jobs at the moment, and I think that too is one of the fundamental problems with this. You say that we are spending a couple of billion to get this process right and you give us a heart&hyphen;rending, `We are going to put unemployed people first,' and that sounds most appropriate. But you are excluding&mdash;very unfairly, I think&mdash;married people or people in a de facto  relationship with a working partner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You are assuming that having some work is the determinant, whether it is one hour a week, two hours a week or four hours a week. That is not much work, and you are saying that that puts them well below the status of unemployed, whereas in this country at the moment there are so many underemployed Australians, and I do not think it is fair that you exclude them from the right to upgrade their job, because underemployment is quite a serious problem.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You cannot get away from it, Senator Kernot. You can think of any other description you like for it, but in the end you must agree that the social security system identifies for us those who are most in need. There are others who are needy, but they are less needy than those who are on benefit. That is why we say one of the key criteria is that, if you are on a benefit and described therefore by the social security system as being one of those most in need, we will put you first.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You stand up, Senator Kernot, and give a heart&hyphen;rending plea for the other people who might also be in need but are less needy. We freely and openly and confidently say that, when push comes to shove in allocating where the resources are going to go, we will give them to the most needy. We will give them to the people who are on benefits and unemployed. We will give them assistance over and above someone who has got sufficient work that they are not on a benefit. I do not deny that someone who has got sufficient work that is not on a benefit might also want more work. I do not deny that. But they are in a better position than someone who is on a benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand very clearly, Senator, the degree to which there is hidden unemployment and underemployment in Australia and in most other countries. This is not something particular to Australia. The hidden unemployed are those who have given up looking for work. They do not show up in the labour force at the moment. They come back in and that is when you see a rise in the participation rate&mdash;that is the hidden unemployed coming back. The underemployed are those people who have got fewer hours than they want and would, if the opportunity came, take more work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not deny the needs of those people but, in the end, the key criterion is, if you are on a benefit, you are judged by the community to be in more need than those who are not. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4257"> That is why we will put the most needy first in the queue. If we could talk about a situation where we had a lot fewer people who were in that position, we might have some resources to distribute around.

I am quite sure it is not; that is why we want to change it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, you are not sure that governments can tender properly&mdash;that they might mess it up. But you forget to mention that the process by which you seek to fix it is by giving the same government another job and that is to accredit them.

Nothing in any of the amendments stops you from providing intensive assistance to those classified as being most in need of assistance. But what these amendments do, is insist that the basic community service obligation of providing labour exchange services to all Australians seeking work is maintained, that the service we have been able to maintain through depression and boom for the last 50 years continues to be maintained. </PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4258"> to briefly respond to what Senator Chris Evans said. Of course, during Labor times, we have had boom and bust. Senator Evans is right. We know that boom is very good for the wealthy and the educated and that bust is very, very bad for the low skilled, the unskilled and the people on the margins of the employment area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Evans would have some experience of understanding what happens in a boom and bust. That is precisely why this government is looking at keeping us away from the boom and bust mentality and getting us back to where we belong, and it is within our grasp to get there. It is within our grasp to get to a long period of stable growth and stable low inflation. That will do more for Australia than the damage done by a boom and bust era.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Evans says that we are taking away services. At the moment, an unemployed person on a benefit is, if you like, competing with all others for the provision of services, and I am talking about something more than simply accessing the database.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An unemployed person would go into a CES, as would other people who are classed as the underemployed, the hidden unemployed or the spouses of people who have jobs. In a sense, the unemployed compete for services. There is not a queue that says, `If you're unemployed and on benefit, come here and we'll deal with you first.' Do not pretend there is, because there is not. They are treated equally with all the others, and they should not be. They should be put first, and we are just the people to put them first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Evans, do not pretend that they get a priority service now. They do not. When unemployed people walk into the PEPE&mdash;the old CES&mdash;Drake Personnel or the Brotherhood of St Laurence, they are seeking help. These people have been on benefits and they want a job, so of course they want help. But at the moment, when they go in looking for help, they have to take what is given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Probably the greatest value of our reform to this system is that these people will be able to walk in with their shoulders back and their head a bit higher because a bucket of money is attached to them. All of a sudden, they will

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We firmly believe&mdash;and you may disagree, Senator Kernot&mdash;that, under the changes we want to propose, the Commonwealth will end the segregation that has happened in employment services. That is effectively what has happened. People on a benefit can go to the CES, but they cannot go to get labour exchange services with Commonwealth help from Drake Personnel, Morgan and Banks or any of the other specialised people. Oh no, that is only for the wealthy. We are going to change all that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of a sudden, unemployed people on a benefit will be able to walk into any one of those places of their choice and we will pay the bill for them. They will not be segregated any more into employment services which are only provided by the Commonwealth. The opposition might think it is appropriate that there be a Commonwealth provider and that that will do for unemployed people on benefit. We do not. We will pay for them to have as much choice in their employment service provider as has any wealthy person. They will be able to choose who they go to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They can look jobs up on the database and, if there is a job offered by Morgan and Banks, they can go there and, if Morgan and Banks get them the job, we will damn well  pay Morgan and Banks. There is nothing in the system that you want to protect that offers

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So disagree if you like, but do not come and pretend that we are offering a lesser service to unemployed people on benefit. We are not. We are going to end the segregation that you would cast them forever into. We are going to give them the opportunities that other people with more money and more resources have been enjoying for years&mdash;opportunities which have enabled them to get first crack at the jobs. They will be able to go into those places knowing that we will foot the bill on their behalf. You can reject our system if you want, but that is the system we want to introduce.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Vanstone, I understand the proposition you are putting. Your whole scheme is about ensuring that people who are bereft of the opportunity of working should get priority. I just wonder whether there is anything in your draft contract that brings that out sufficiently. Is there anything in your draft contract that sends that message out or does your draft contract send out a contrary message?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Page 58 of the exposure draft deals with a specific industry&mdash;that is, the industry of harvesting. Clause 5.1 says that you must provide a service to job seekers and employers for harvest activities specified in item B5 in schedule 1. Item B5 says that you must provide project contracting for a certain

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In clause A you say that you must supply the labour necessary to meet the harvest requirements of growers. You seem to be emphasising in clause 5 the legitimate need of employers. There is nothing in that clause&mdash;indeed nothing in the contract&mdash;that I can see that says that unemployed people or people who have been out of work for a particular period of time should get priority.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney, you turned to, if you like, an exemption or a specialist area of contracting, which is for the harvest trail. As you know, there is a constant problem&mdash;there has been for years; your government faced it and we face it&mdash;with growers needing significant supplies of personnel at seasonal times, a labour demand that exceeds the local capacity to provide. Consequently, we have provided a specialist area for that. That aspect of the contract is separate from the normal labour exchange work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine, I understand your question and, believe me, we have thought about it. But it is almost impossible to police and, therefore, to make effective. We often come in here and pass laws expressing good sentiments. Sometimes people argue the case of the role of law in an educative process. Sometimes we pass laws that X,Y,Z will not be done or that X,Y,Z will be done and we do not have the resources to ensure that that is followed up and that behaviour in the community will match parliament's expectation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4260">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I happen to believe that, as best as is practicable, legislation has more credibility in the community, the law has better standing in the community, if we devise laws that we believe it is possible to implement. In order to implement such a law, a declaration of a government's intent, you would have to devise a regime to see that every EPE, in placing people, put unemployed people first.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have come to the conclusion that that is impossible and that the better thing to do is to say, `Employment placement enterprises might work, as some who will become employment placement enterprises do now, and that is commercially, by charging clients who can afford to pay or by charging the business community for the job placements they make. But we will only pay you when you put an unemployed person on benefit or a young Australian first, when you get them a job. You can continue as you are and get all these other people jobs and help them, as you do at the moment, but we will not pay you for that. We will only pay you when you put an unemployed person on benefit or a young Australian into a job.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is our priority, we think that should be Australia's priority and we think the easiest and most efficient way to do it is to say, `That is when we will pay you.' We do not pay now for a huge range of employment services that go on. The CES only does at the moment about 16 per cent of labour exchange work. That is all the work that the Commonwealth pays for. In the total sphere of labour exchange work it is only about 16 per cent. We intend to ensure that for unemployed people on benefit we end the segregation that they are currently locked into by their low incomes. We will make the full range of employment services available to them and they can choose whom they go to. If they think private providers are the best, they can go to them. If they want to go to the PEPE because they think that does a better job, they can go to the PEPE. We have no preference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we will say to unemployed people on benefit and young Australians is, `We will pay for you to go to the service at the place of your choice. We will give you the choice where you go. If those people get you a job, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> we will pay them the money.' We think that puts unemployed people in a much more powerful position than they are in now, a position of much greater status and integrity and personal confidence in seeking the service because they know that the person behind the counter is not going to get paid unless that person takes a direct interest in whether they get a job. And the person behind the counter will, because the person behind the counter knows that getting a payment from the Commonwealth depends on getting that person a job.</PARA></SPEECH>

I wanted to make the point in response to that speech&mdash;which again I do not think has anything do with the amendment before us&mdash;that the Labor and Democrat amendments do not seek to contradict that last point made by the minister in any way, shape or form. The intensive employment assistance which is prioritised by the government will be given to those people identified as most at risk&mdash;the long-term unemployed and others with special disadvantages.

We do not guarantee a share to the Brotherhood of St Laurence, we do not guarantee a share to Centacare, we do not guarantee a share to the Salvation Army, we do not guarantee a share will go to the private sector, nor should we guarantee a share for the PEPE.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is just unimaginable that the PEPE would be so uncompetitive that it would not get any work, but in terms of the design there is no guarantee for any other single provider 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4263"> or portion of providers. I think that underlines  the remarks I made earlier about a commitment to look after the CPSU more than unemployed people. Your proposed clause 9(3) is the point that has been canvassed&mdash;we have canvassed this point; it is not as if we have been off the point at all&mdash;on accreditation. It would be complete stupidity to have a Commonwealth body credit provider and then another Commonwealth body, a separate group of people, taking up more money that could otherwise be used for unemployed people, go through and do the tendering process and in that tender process go through the sorts of things that I raised earlier that people said were not on the point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether people were not listening, whether they thought we were talking about another amendment, or what. We do not understand why people would want to allocate Commonwealth resources to go through a rigorous tender evaluation process, including a check on conformity with the tender conditions that check on financial viability, assessment against standard selection criteria, use of surveys of job seekers to assess performance of service providers, a code of conduct and a regime of performance audits&mdash;doing that job twice when it should be done once. It should be done properly and the money that this amendment would seek to have expended on CPSU members doing it twice should go to the unemployed.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond briefly to that point and to make it clear to the Senate that all that the amendment to 9(1) does is include reference to the public provider of employment services. The reason that is done is that the government makes no mention of that service at all in its bill. The minister assured us when she announced these changes that it would be in the legislation. Then it slipped out, as I understand it, because of deliberations in cabinet about privatisation policies the government would be pursuing and how it wanted to leave those options open to itself in a range of areas. The effect of that amendment is to include the public provider among those entities which may be engaged. If the minister cannot wear that, it seems to me that it tells us a lot about what she sees as the future role of the public provider in her scheme.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is simply not the case. It is clear to anybody, other than someone determined not to see, that we want to treat them all equally. There is a very strong view especially from the community providers&mdash;not from the private providers, because they are commercially viable now; they are going about their business and they do not need access to this to survive&mdash;and they make it abundantly clear to me, that they believe Employment Access Australia has been getting more than its fair share of the easier to place clients. In other words, the previous government said, `We want to include community providers.' But they were not prepared to set up a system to ensure that they got their fair share of easy and hard to place people. That is what the community providers tell me.

You do not want to look after the unemployed Australians on benefits or young Australians, you are more concerned about looking after the CPSU. You say, `All it does is mention them.' Why would we go to the bother of creating them if we wanted to get rid of them? What a ludicrous prospect. For you to seek to mention them at the expense of others is just paranoia in the extreme, is unnecessary and gives the PEPE a protected place that is not provided to any other employment placement enterprise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer senators to the definition of `entity' in the bill which sets out the other bodies et cetera that can be contracted. All we are seeking to do in this amendment is to provide for the PEPE to be recognised as well. The reason we are conscious of it and we are seeking to do it is that, despite the government's initial announcement, there is no mention of the PEPE anywhere in the bill. Why? The minister has never provided a satisfactory answer to that question. It is not our paranoia. We have looked at the bill and said, `Why would you seek to allocate $180 million of public money and not include it in a bill which establishes that regime?' No adequate answer has been given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, yes, we do seek to include reference to the PEPE, because we want to ensure that, if you do want to close it or fail to provide a public provider, we have a say in that.

As the privatisation push and the deregulation push gathered momentum, we walked away from those assurances and they are not in the bill. So your last comment, Minister, I think gives you away. You say that, by this amendment, we seek to guarantee that there is a PEPE. Exactly. We declare ourselves guilty. We want to make sure that public providers of employment services continue in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you are really saying is that you want to make sure that there is no guarantee of that role. You are saying to us that you do not want this bill; you cannot wear having a public provider guaranteed by this bill. That is the debate. We say that it ought to be guaranteed. You say that you do not want it in the bill&mdash;not that there are any plans to downgrade its role or privatise or abolish it; you would just prefer that it was not there, because it would not be providing a level playing field.

If you want to put in safeguards, move some amendments to guarantee a level playing field and we will vote for them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You say that we want to get rid of the PEPE. Why in heaven's name would a government set up a PEPE, go to the bother of corporatising it, go through the arguments and then seek to somehow get rid of it? In an open tender process, the PEPE will survive or not survive. The strength of its survival will depend on the degree to which it tenders efficiently. In other words, it will have to run as efficiently as Centacare does, as the Brotherhood of St Laurence does, as Drake Personnel does and as the Salvation Army does in their labour exchange and their job placement services. We do not think that is an unreasonable demand of the public employment placement enterprises. To run as efficiently as the others is not an unreasonable demand. That is why we are determined to treat them equally.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Campbell says to me, `Do they have members of the CPSU working for the Brotherhood of St Laurence?' I suspect not. Senator Harradine, we want them treated equally, and that is how they will survive: by performing well. Unlike members opposite, who seem to be in a complete state of paranoia that CPSU members will not perform well, I actually think they will perform far better in the tender process than most people have ever contemplated because they have 50 years of institutional experience in providing these services and they will be a very tough competitor. So what we are saying is, `Don't look to the parliament to guarantee your survival. Look to your efficiency to guarantee it.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point I think comes back to me or whoever happens to be the minister at the time, and that is the community service obligation that is on the PEPE. There is an obligation to provide employment services. That is clearly acknowledged. There may be places where Centapact, the Brotherhood or Drake Personnel do not tender but employment services have to be provided. We have indicated that, in these areas where there might be a paucity of tenders or no tenders, we will shift to a fee for service tender and, if that does not provide appropriate services and if not enough people tender to provide appropriate services for that area, then we have the capacity to direct the PEPE to provide the service and that will be on a cost basis because employment services have to be provided. There has never been any expectation in setting up this market that it would be

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with great regret that I rise tonight to speak about the late Mr David Hong, head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office, whose well&hyphen;attended funeral was held this morning in Canberra. David died, aged 60, in Melbourne on 3 June 1997, less than a week after the Australia&hyphen;Taiwan parliamentary group&mdash;I am the chairman and Senator Cooney, who is in the chamber, is one of my vice&hyphen;chairmen&mdash;had entertained him at our annual dinner. This group is entirely bipartisan and, although unofficial, is one of the largest groups of the parliament. As chairman, I had considerable contact with David Hong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">David Hong was a fine and, I suspect and have every good reason to suspect, a courageous man. In the world of diplomacy where cultural, political and economic priorities sometimes become more important than being a decent human being, David Hong was one of those rare breed who was immediately empathetic. His subtle sense of humour, his nationalism and his determination to put Taiwan's interests first, last and always gave him and the people he served and represented a dignity that we should all hold dear. He was passionate about his country and passionate about developing the relationship between Australia and Taiwan.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A career diplomat, his role in Australia was one in which he strove to promote friendship, understanding and ever increasingly important business links between our two countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">David Hong's long diplomatic career included posts in Sierra Leone, Malawi, South Africa, where he was the consul-general, and ambassador to Belize. He came to Australia to replace the much loved Francis Lee. David was a splendid replacement and built on the work done by his predecessor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">David's role was not an easy one. Australia recognises the one&hyphen;China policy, which left him with the duties and responsibilities of an ambassador but without the accompanying status or formal access. This is especially significant given that Taiwan is one of our major trading partners. In 1995-96, the last 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4268"> full year for which records are known, Australian exports to Taiwan were worth $3.5 billion and included coal, alumina, copper, iron ore, petroleum, wool, salt, beef and other primary industry products. In return we imported $2.5 billion worth of Taiwanese goods, so we had a healthy trade surplus with Taiwan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have always supported Taiwan in its access to APEC and, of course, in negotiations concerning its access to the World Trade Organisation. I was very appreciative that David was always keen to help with tariff changes and concerns that we had. Recently he was instrumental in helping us gain greater access for some horticulture&mdash;apples and pears&mdash;and also beef.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia has long been, in addition, an attractive investment option for Taiwan businesses. Taiwan's `look south' policy has already brought hundreds of millions of dollars worth of foreign investment to Australia in projects as diverse as a potential Tasmanian pulp mill and sugar and steel production facilities. Each new project creates more jobs, enhances local skills and knowledge and means more prosperity for us and, of course, more prosperity for Taiwan. Conversely, major Australian firms such as CSR, Transfield and Readymix Concrete have operations in Taiwan. Others, such as the Australian steel maker Kingstream and Taiwan's An Feng Steel, have entered into a successful joint venture worth over $1 billion in Western Australia. In the Hunter Valley, Formosa Plastics has an investment in high quality coking coal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In purely economic terms, it was and is imperative that ties between Taiwan and Australia are maintained and strengthened. Madam Deputy President, I know that you were one of many who had the opportunity to visit Taipei on at least one occasion. I certainly did as well, as did a number of members of parliament, including Senator Calvert, another of my vice&hyphen;chairmen, who was recently there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It disappointed David Hong to see the vigour with which the People's Republic of China discouraged relations between our two countries. Yet David rarely made public his 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> frustrations; he just kept on working, doing his best under delicate circumstances and making the most of every opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Chairman of the Australian&hyphen;Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group, I had considerable contact with David Hong and his wife Linda. He frequently sought my advice and access to government. I was always impressed at the way that he never lost sight of the main game. For instance, towards the middle of last year David wished to expedite a visa application. Foreign Minister Downer was overseas and for a very short period of time the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), the leader of my political party, was the acting foreign minister. David did not let the opportunity pass. He rang me, requesting that the acting foreign minister issue the visas with urgency. I said, `David, I really appreciate your timing.' I could sense the smile that was coming to his lips at the other end of the phone, but he played his game with a very straight bat and said, `But, Senator, this is just a normal procedure.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the formal handover of Hong Kong to China just two weeks away, even more attention will be focused on relations between Taiwan and China and, inevitably, more scrutiny of our ties with Taiwan, a nation of 21 million people, with a true commitment to free enterprise. Given that the handover of Hong Kong may be seen by some as a blueprint for the possible integration of Taiwan in the years to come, it is a crucial time for the entire region. I am sure that David was looking forward to bringing his considerable diplomatic skills to bear in what will be a very exciting and interesting time for our whole region.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 19 March this year the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr McGauran, spoke at a science careers forum organised by the National Tertiary Education Union and the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies, FASTS. In his speech the minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our part is to convince those within Government, industry and the community of the need for Australian research and Australian commercialisation and it won't be done by shrill, over blown exaggerated whining and wailing. Over-exaggerate the nature and extent of the problem and you weaken the credibility of the science community.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The minister went on to say that there was an attempt to create a climate of crisis in the science community. Understandably, the minister wants us to talk up science careers so that young people can see the wealth of opportunities. He actually cited a number of figures that suggested good career prospects 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for those in the science courses and science based careers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, he said that the career prospects for life science graduates were good because 61.5 per cent had full employment four months after graduating. Of course, this means that 38.5 per cent did not have employment, which by any measure is quite a high proportion who are left unemployed. That figure reminds me of the youth unemployment rate in my home state of South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's speech glossed over the difficult questions facing science careers and science graduates today&mdash;for example, infrastructure decline, salary erosion and funding cuts in higher education institutions, et cetera. He attempted to claim that he was reasonable and that he would respond to reasonable advice which was well researched and well thought&hyphen;out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But how can the science sector communicate the need for support and the concerns they have about eroding our future wellbeing? I thought that Professor Ian Lowe, who was at the forum, gave a well&hyphen;reasoned speech and showed some well&hyphen;reasoned data demonstrating that Australian science and technology is suffering badly. I will not list those reasons here, because I think that speech, which I commend to members of the parliament, is available on the FASTS home page. It certainly was not shrill, overblown and exaggerated whining and wailing. In fact, it was a factual speech demonstrating how the government has cut into this particular sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 7 January this year, the minister stated that science and technology is Australia's No. 1 wealth generator and holds the key to improving all of our lives. Cutting away the resources of our research institutions by reducing funding to such an extent that they are forced to trade off infrastructure expenditure for the sake of salaries, further reducing the scholarship benefits by taxation and removing the 150 per cent tax deduction for research and development spending&mdash;even the promise to spend $12 million to make science more attractive to young people has been gutted by the use of this money for other 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4270"> purposes&mdash;have all made a mockery of the minister's claim on 7 January. These are indicators that this government is not committed to science and technology. In fact, any commitment that it gives is, at best, lip service and, at worst, a short&hyphen;sighted economic experiment for which we already know the result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My predominant concern with the minister's speech in March was that he showed a fundamental lack of understanding of the value of  resources in research and development. He does not seem to recognise that science and technology are reliant on individuals and their unique talents to be creative. Research and development require the nurturing and expression by people who have a special talent for discovering and inventing. The resource from which these advances come is the ability of these people to do the art of inventing and discovering. These resources are stimulated by the opportunity to do their thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Doing their thing requires a commitment on behalf of the government to make the conditions suitable for them. Their needs can be satisfied without demands for unending funding as a matter of right and total control over how that money is to be spent. What they are asking for is a recognition that innovative science and technology is an investment in the future and that the government commit itself to adequate funding commensurate with that of long-term perspective. How much funding is adequate will always, of course, be contentious. But it should not be determined by economic ideology and short&hyphen;term accounting practices which do not acknowledge the long-term benefits and rewards of innovation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australians have quite a considerable natural ability in science. Many people will be familiar with the recent third international mathematics and science study, which found that primary students&mdash;Australian primary students in particular&mdash;were good at science and maths and had very high averages. The foundation of competence and interest should be nurtured with interesting and challenging science education at the school, university and college levels.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A good science and technology education is a key to providing Australians with a base on which to interact with an increasingly technology driven working life. With understanding comes the ability to make informed comment and informed decisions and the ability to interact with technology changes without fear and rejection of the unknown. Of course, as a result of that derives the benefits of jobs, wealth and lifestyle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the United States, the government is moving towards increasing funding for education in an attempt to make it more affordable. I have to say that it is in stark contrast with this government, which seems to be going in the opposite direction. In fact, last month the President of the United States, President Clinton, announced the largest, I think, increase in spending on higher education funding since the GI bill of 1945. This includes $35 billion in tax relief to help families pay for higher education, tax deductible education costs and tax credits to make higher education cost less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The President recognises the importance of education. In fact, in a speech at Morgan State University on 18 May this year, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this agreement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is with the members of Congress&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">contains a major investment in science and technology, inspired in our administration by the leadership of Vice&hyphen;President Gore, to keep America on the cutting edge of positive change, to create the best jobs of tomorrow, to advance the quality of life of all Americans.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Tonight I call on the Australian government to reconsider its attitudes towards science and technology, to try to arrest the erosion that we are seeing in funding for science and our technological base. What we should be doing is looking at the long-term benefits we are denying ourselves by strangling the opportunity of wealth jobs and a better lifestyle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Questions of deficit reduction, free trade and last quarter's CPI will be fairly insignificant when compared to rising seas, clean water, the need for clean air and other natural problems such as famine and disease.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I rise to thank the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) for his decision to amend the Broadcasting Services Act to allow community radio stations to broadcast full-time. On behalf of the community radio operators across regional and rural Australia, I com mend the minister for supporting and expanding the community broadcasting sector. Let me explain why Senator Alston's policy decision is now being so warmly received by community broadcasters, many of which have special interests, including education, religion, sport, the regional community and specialist music interest groups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government did nothing to assist community broadcasters in this country. When we came to government there were more than 100 community radio stations unable to get full&hyphen;time licences to broadcast programs. In 1992 the previous Labor government led the sector to believe that new community broadcast licences would be granted within a reasonable time frame. This turns out to have been a very cruel hoax because this was not delivered by Labor. The licensing planning processes put in place by Labor in 1992 were supposed to be completed by 1996. This simply has not happened. There has been already a 3&half; year slippage in the planning process. This would have taken it, if the Labor government had continued in power, into the next millennium, possibly still with no community radio stations being able to broadcast full time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Their record is appalling and it has created great despair in the community broadcasting sector, mainly because most of these stations were confined to a broadcasting time of only 90 days a year and these had to be taken in separate blocks of 30 days, making continuity of service and the recognition factor an impossibility. This disgraceful block on the advancement of community broadcasting has gone on in this country for 20 years. The diversity and range of community groups 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> having access to this type of broadcasting had been significantly curtailed under the previous Labor government's policies. Unable to get a full&hyphen;time licence, stations and community groups found it difficult to maintain support for their operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The licensing of community broadcasters created by the former Labor government was a total administrative shambles. Under their direction, the planning processes of the Australian Broadcasting Authority were a disgrace. Since 1993 I have pursued this question in estimates under various Labor ministers and I remember well Minister Bob Collins in the 1993 estimates saying that he would actually look into this matter and try to speed up the process. Their planning process for giving out licences involved three teams going around the regions of Australia carrying out inquiries. That process, from 1993, was supposed to take another three years to finish. I suggested to the minister that perhaps if he doubled the number of teams he could halve the time. As I have already indicated, he did not take up that suggestion and the time did not halve&mdash;as a matter of fact, it actually doubled; it blew out from three to seven years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community radio industry is very grateful for the actions of Minister Alston, who has decisively cut through this process. I have raised a number of specific cases with him of radio community broadcasters in the Hunter and Central Coast areas who were frustrated by the previous process but are now greatly relieved that under this government the problem has been fixed. Broadcasters like Rhema FM, Newcastle Christian Broadcasters, Port Stephens community radio and Gosford&hyphen;Wyong community radio actually went backwards under Labor but now can go forward under our new policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The stations summed up the problems of the previous policies in the following way. They were never sure whether they could ever convert to full&hyphen;time licence operations. The start&hyphen;up and turn&hyphen;off cycle that Labor had built acted against the stations building an audience and keeping that audience. Staff training was thrown into chaos and work experience was difficult because of the inter 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4272"> mittent nature of the production. The ability to attract sponsorship funds was often stymied by the on&hyphen;off arrangement that had been set up under the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have been advised that this government has now acted to change this licensing timetable and the community broadcasters who would have been perhaps forced to disband by 1999 will now be able to continue. Senator Alston has acted to allow community radio stations, held back under Labor, to be able to broadcast full time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During this session we will amend the Broadcasting Services Act to allow the majority of community aspirant broadcasters to have the chance to commence full&hyphen;time broadcasting. The practical impact of the amendments we are going to move is to support community broadcast stations that have waited so long for such a sane policy. One effect is that the aspirant broadcasters in a `solus' market, or one where there is only one community radio station bidding for the right to broadcast, will now be able to broadcast full time in the period leading up to the allocation of permanent licences. Additionally, many more stations in markets where competition for the spectrum is greater will have their broadcast hours significantly increased if they can reach sharing arrangements with other broadcasters in their region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Community Broadcasting Association of Australia has warmly welcomed this Australian government's decision. I foreshadow my wholehearted support for the amendments when they come before the Senate. I would like to advise all senators that the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia is warning that it will not countenance any delays in passing the amendments to this legislation. Community radio has long fought for victory and commonsense over bureaucracy. I again congratulate the minister on his very decisive action, which will allow community radio in Australia to flourish.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4272"><TITLE>Housing</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to discuss the important issue of the shrinking supply of affordable housing to people on low incomes. It is now 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> more than two years since the federal government and state housing ministers agreed at a COAG meeting that radical changes would be made to the way housing services are delivered in this country. Two years and a change of government later we still do not have a sound housing policy that properly addresses the needs of people on low incomes. Rather than face the real issues of why people are struggling, the government prefers to preach to one and all that if the states were more efficient, more competitive and more compliant there would not be a housing problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One week before this year's federal budget, the government announced that it would delay its radical plan to shift funding entirely away from the provision and maintenance of public housing stock and, instead, go along with the Commonwealth&hyphen;state housing agreement for two more years. At the same time, it made deep cuts to the actual amount handed to the states under this agreement. On budget night, the Treasurer (Mr Costello) announced a $50 million reduction in CSHA funding this year, $50 million next year and a further $100 million reduction over a two&hyphen;year period thereafter&mdash;assuming, of course, that the CSHA still exists at that time. To add insult to injury, the government also announced that $60 million would be taken from rent assistance for people sharing in public housing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what is the government's housing policy? Is there a plan at all? Most people understood, I think, that the federal government would, in its own words, accept responsibility for housing subsidies and affordability while the states and territories would take responsibility for the management and delivery of public housing services. But in the budget the government significantly reduced the funding that the states require to fund public housing stock and removed rent assistance for some tenants, making a mockery of its promise of housing affordability for the many people on low incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of this, the Commonwealth housing task force has now been disbanded. It was originally formed, as I understand it, to develop a unified approach to housing, and this would be presented to the COAG meet 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4273"> ing, but now it appears that housing has been dropped off the COAG agenda altogether.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conclusions drawn from the Perth housing ministers meeting are that the states intend to restructure their own housing service, regardless of the Commonwealth's agenda or the pleas of thousands of individual citizens for fairer, more equitable housing provision. So the states will do their own thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian government announced last week a drastic cut in the number of housing advocacy groups and housing councils. Thirty&hyphen;seven advocacy groups and 18 councils  will be reduced to just nine for the whole state. Of course, this was done as an efficiency measure, we understand. But a housing council worker from a rural area told me that the needs of the people in the Western District, for instance, would now have to be served by regional housing workers in Geelong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps more significantly, the Victorian government has announced a radical change to public housing tenure. In fact, security of tenure for public housing is to be a thing of the past in Victoria. From 1 July, all new tenants will be subject to tenancy reviews every three to five years. People will no longer be eligible for public housing just on the basis of very low incomes. Rents in public housing will also be increased. Only those who are considered to be particularly disadvantaged&mdash;for instance, the homeless, the aged and those with disabilities&mdash;will be eligible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Victorian government's move has sent shivers down the spines of public housing tenants. At this stage the new rules apply only to new tenants, but they are asking, `Is this the thin edge of the wedge? Will we be next?' I think it is time the government listened to the very real fears of these people, and tonight I want to pass on some of the things they are saying. I have received two very moving letters in the last few weeks from women in quite different circumstances which articulate, in a way that I could not, the realities of the hardships faced by people on low incomes.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One is a widow with four young children. She was forced to apply for government support nine years ago after the death of her husband. She was unable to support herself and her children in their family home and was forced to apply to rent a privately owned house. She describes the discrimination from the real estate agents, who she says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . clearly did not relish the idea of a woman-headed household. This was apart from the discrimination dished out to a welfare recipient.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She talks about what she had to say to get any sort of house:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must admit I spent quite a few years lying about myself and my little family. This is not, however, as simple an act as it may sound, nor an easy thing to do. Firstly, the act of deliberately telling lies, even to a stranger in a real estate office, is a harrowing experience and one alien to my upbringing. Secondly, the fact that I had to try to get a foot in the door, literally, is degrading and dehumanising. What kind of system forces a woman to lie to get a roof over the heads of her children?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We were forced to move often, when the real estate agent discovered I had more children than I had admitted to, or more frequently when we were hit by an unexpected rent hike. Looking back, I wonder how I survived those years of constant moving, my children having to change schools, of begging from charitable organisations, of always dressing from the op-shop, of living in constant fear of being discovered yet again as a single parent with a large family, of hiding children in bathrooms while explaining to them that it was wrong to lie.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Most significantly, she describes the relief of securing a place in public housing. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What saved us as a family was finally obtaining public housing after nine years of searching and waiting. Since 1983 we have had security of tenure and, apart from the bliss of income-related rent, this has been the best thing in my life so far. It is a sad indictment on an affluent society like ours that, for some people, through no fault of their own, not through lack of hard work or courage, there is no way out of the vicious poverty trap except the ephemeral prospect of winning the lottery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obtaining public housing meant no more chopping and changing schools, making friends with neighbours, becoming involved in our local community through voluntary work. It has meant that I was able to finish my schooling and am almost through my university degree. As I now have just two children left at home, I am looking forward to taking my place in the paid workforce at last.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The second letter comes from a women who had a successful career and a good income. She is now in her mid&hyphen;fifties, single, on a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4274"> disability pension and living in community housing. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After rent, telephone, electricity, medical and other expenses, I have less than forty&hyphen;five dollars to feed and clothe myself.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last thing I wanted was to be reduced to this state, or be dependent in any way, which is why I exhausted all my savings and dug deep into Mastercard before I asked for any help.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Eventually, she says, a community housing group saved her from homelessness and saved her life. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I felt physically ill as Peter Costello smiled from the television screen blithely slashing at housing, pharmaceuticals and rent allowances. I was appalled by the persistent implication that the poor rort the system. Amazed that 60 grand could win you an incentive and that the very old would get a cash handout if they don't drop dead on the job. I feared for the families felled by a thousand tiny cuts and the future of children brought up in such insecurity and hopelessness.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final insult came when Mr Costello smugly announced a one billion Federation Fund. Won't all Australians have had a gutful of fireworks so soon after the Olympics? Wouldn't one billion be better spent housing the homeless, giving work to the jobless, and healing the sick? Better still, looking towards the year 2001, why not spend that billion educating the young so they have the intelligence to reject racism and intolerance, the skills to find employment and the compassion to care for the needy?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I beg you to prevent the destruction of public and community housing or privatisation that can only lead to further humiliation and exploitation of the poor and greater homelessness. Those poor homeless who did not even get on the census of this `lucky' country because they had no address.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well I for one would rather be dead than homeless.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The private sector is not the answer for everyone, and for the 300,000 families currently on public housing waiting lists it is not their preference either. My hope is that the government will listen to such people and will open its collective mind to the evidence which is now being brought to the Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into housing. I hope that the government will develop a policy which meets the needs of real people such as these.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="10.23 p.m." PAGE="4274"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 10.23 p.m.</EMPHASIS>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Case management outcomes have been measured in terms of positive exits. Positive exits from case management occur where clients are placed into subsidised work, unsubsidised work or non&hyphen;DEETYA education/training places that extend for at least 13 weeks in duration. To be counted as a positive exit, a job placement must involve an average of at least 20 hours work per week. It is important to note that in view of this criterion and the inclusion of subsidised employment as a positive exit, case management positive exists are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not comparable to positive outcomes as measured for labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Outcomes data have been compiled for cohorts of clients based on their time of entry to case management. Full year data are available for clients who were registered for income support at the time of entering assistance in 1995. These data show that in the 12 months following their entry to case management, positive exits were obtained for 29% of clients. There was no difference in the positive exit levels achieved by Contracted Case Managers and the public sector case management provider, Employment Assistance Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that in addition to the 29% of clients who obtained positive exits through 13 weeks of employment or participation in education/training, around 5% exited case management after failing to apply for continuation of Department of Social Security unemployment allowance. While data relating to the reasons for these additional exits are yet to be gathered, it is likely that a substantial number were associated with clients finding work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">More detailed information on the outcomes and effectiveness of case management will be available in late 1997 as analyses of data from the department's longitudinal cohort study of job seekers and a study assessing the extent to which case management results in improved job prospects are completed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) A breakdown of positive exits by age is provided in Table 1. As can be seen in Table 1, when compared to younger people, positive exits from case management are less likely to occur for those aged 45 years or more.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The 1997 AUSTUDY Income, Assets and Actual Means Test policy guidelines were circulated within the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs in draft form for comment by staff.

As a result, no useful purpose would be served by releasing them.</PARA>

(c) While many of the callers offered comments and suggestions of various kinds, the question of which of these should be regarded as complaints is a subjective judgement. (d) The hotline was established specifically to deal with the Actual Means Test and consequently, I understand that the majority of the calls were indeed about the Actual Means Test.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) There have been press reports about the opening of the Sunbury Christian Community School on the site of Bulla Primary School. However, until an application for Commonwealth general recurrent funding for 1997 and other required documentation is provided by Sunbury Christian Community School, it is not possible to confirm the numbers of students at the school eligible for Commonwealth funding. I understand that the school has only recently received registration from the Victorian authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Government maintains eligibility and statistical information on all non&hyphen;government schools approved for Commonwealth general recurrent funding. In the case of Sunbury Christian Community School, to suggest that somehow a non&hyphen;government school is being substituted for a government school is misleading. The Sunbury Christian Community School commenced planning over two years ago, well before the closure of Bulla Primary School and on a different site.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Commonwealth Government is committed to continuing financial support for schools. The States Grants (Primary and Secondary Education Assistance) Act 1996 (the Act) is providing more than $14 billion for schools over the period 1997 to 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Budget Papers for 1996&hyphen;97 show that funding for schools is estimated to increase each year to 1999&hyphen;2000, with an average increase of just over 4% per year. When total Commonwealth sourced funding (both Specific Purpose Payments and Financial Assistance Grants) is taken into account, funding for government schools will increase at a more rapid rate than for non&hyphen;government schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Between 1996 and 2000, average per capita Commonwealth funding for a student in a government school is projected to increase from $2,263 to $2,668, or by 17.9%. Over the same period, Commonwealth funding for a non&hyphen;government school

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator Parer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The WTO Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures sets out rights and obligations of WTO members in relation to the application of quarantine controls to protect human, animal and plant health. Whether the Senate Committee's recommendations on technical issues would be consistent with the Agreement is a matter for judgement in the context of consideration of all aspects of AQIS's risk assessment on cooked chicken meat imports. The legal conformity of the AQIS position on this issue with WTO rules can be determined only through the WTO dispute settlement mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's recommendation that "the most appropriate assistance measure available for the government's consideration would be the introduction of appropriate safeguard action to allow the imposition of a tariff or quota restriction on importation on a temporary and reducing basis" could only be taken up by Australia in accordance with its obligations as a Member of the WTO.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to the possible imposition of import quotas, this could only be done in accordance with the provisions of Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT 1994) and the WTO Agreement on Safeguards. Under the Agreement on Safeguards and Article XIX of GATT 1994, safeguard action against imports may be taken if, as a result of unforseen developments, there has been an increase in the level of imports of a product as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury to domestic producers of the like or directly competitive product. A finding of serious injury requires a formal investigation, with the process being done according to published procedures with a public inquiry and a published report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Investigations cannot be initiated until there is a circumstance of increased quantities of imports, absolute or relative to domestic production. That is, while measures can be imposed on the basis of threat of serious injury, they cannot be imposed on the basis of threat of imports. Therefore, the Government could not decide in advance of any imports being permitted to introduce an "appropriate safeguard action to allow the imposition of a tariff or quota restriction on importation . . . ." The recourse to safeguard measures, if activated, would require compensatory concessions to affected trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to tariffs, Australia could impose a tariff on imports of cooked chicken meat up to the level of our tariff binding without breaching our WTO obligations. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Alternatively, if we wanted to impose a tariff above the bound rate, we would be obliged to enter into negotiations under GATT article XXVIII with other WTO members having a trade interest in the goods in question. This process involves the renegotiation or lowering of bindings on tariffs on alternative products of equivalent value in order to provide compensation to affected trading partners. In other words, the compensation would almost certainly need to be provided at the expense of another Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) The technical working group met on two occasions with a third meeting being held of the people comprising the working group plus representation from BRS scientists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The meetings of the technical working group took place on 24 June and 29 August 1996 with the third meeting on 22 January 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Members of the working group included representatives from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS), the poultry industry and the Bureau of Resource Sciences (BRS). Industry organisations represented were the Australian Poultry Industries Association and the Australian Chicken Growers' Council.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Reports of these meetings were prepared and provided to the participants. Copies have been provided to Senator Collins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) As a result of discussions between AQIS and industry, AQIS included in its protocol direct reference to the Australian Standard for Hygienic Production of Poultry Meat for Human Consumption as a guide in the assessment of slaughter and processing establishments for approval to process product for export to Australia and the AQIS Code  of Hygienic Practice for the Production of Heat Treated Refrigerated Foods Packaged for Extended Shelf Life as a guide in the evaluation of the processing and handling of product for export to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) The Government's response to the recommendations of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee report on the importation of cooked chicken meat into Australia, tabled in 31 October 1996, is to be provided to the Chairman of the Committee shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The comments of the technical working group were taken into account in the redrafting of the protocol for cooked chicken meat. The redrafted finalised version of the protocol was not circulated for further comment by AQIS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) Most of the international trade in chicken is in uncooked product. Most countries do require area certification from avian diseases in their import protocols because these protocols apply to uncooked chicken as well as to cooked product. The quarantine risk associated with uncooked meat is, ceteris paribus, greater than the risk associated with cooked meat.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) AQIS has not recommended that a requirement for area certification from avian disease be included in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4284"> import protocol for cooked chicken meat as the import conditions apply only to cooked product. On the basis of available scientific information it is considered that the stringent cooking process proposed by AQIS, in combination with other measures such as ante and post mortem veterinary inspection, the presence of a quality assurance system, separate processing of product destined for Australia and food inspection arrangements, effectively minimise quarantine risks associated with the possible presence of avian viruses in chicken meat. Therefore the requirement for area certification cannot be justified on technical grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) The Government/industry working group looking at the economic impact of imported chicken meat met once, on 9 July 1996.
