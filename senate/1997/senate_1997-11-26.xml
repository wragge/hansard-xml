<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Faulkner moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to government business order of the day No. 8 (Native Title Amendment Bill 1997).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a situation where community expectation about the  Native Title Amendment Bill  debate is at fever pitch. What occurred last night is that at last reluctantly the government brought on the bill to commence the second reading debate on a no quorums, no division basis. A time last night which was suggested by the opposition to conclude that second reading debate was utilised by the government to commence it. So the bill came on for debate last night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course what is happening here is that the government is trying to use this very transparent device of the second reading speech for the native title legislation bill to clean up its own legislation program.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a very cynical use of the government's legislation program because I do not believe for one minute that the government would be able to hold government senators here in Canberra after the conclusion of the Wik debate. They know that and that is why they are not willing to bring the debate on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian community as one wants this debate to come on. Senators should read the papers this morning and look at what the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> advertisements are saying. They want to bring on the debate and they are asking the Senate to deal with it. Yet the government steadfastly refuses to bring this matter on for debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Howard said it all. He was the one who put the demands to the Senate earlier and for some time he has been saying, `Bring the debate on. Let the Senate get on with the debate.' But the government will not do so. It only managed a small part of the second reading debate to be conducted last night, which is a time when the Senate does not ordinarily sit. Senators of course know, but perhaps in the general community it is not well known, that the Senate does not sit beyond 8 o'clock on a Tuesday night. Special arrangements were made to allow that debate to commence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We had three hours of debate on the  Native Title Amendment Bill  and three hours after the debate commences, the government is proposing not to continue it. This is possibly the most important piece of legislation that this parliament will be considering. That is indefensible. It is absolutely unjustified for the government to say, `We will commence the debate, but we have no intention of continuing it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many senators who want to make a contribution on the second reading&mdash;and that is right and proper&mdash;including a very significant number from the government. That is absolutely justified. If you do not conclude that second reading debate, then of course the committee stage almost certainly cannot commence this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what the government is saying. It is a deliberate and transparent attempt and device to ensure, using the vehicle of the Native Title Amendment Bill , that the balance of the government's legislation program goes through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The spin doctors of government are up there in the gallery saying, `There is an agreement not to bring this debate on.' That is categorically untrue. The Labor opposition had argued that that debate should commence at 12.30 p.m. on Monday. The government refused to bring the debate on and what we are saying now clearly and definitively is, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9444"> continue the debate that was started last night; the community demands nothing less.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just briefly, I think the real contrast of good faith was the way in which the Labor Party dealt with the Mabo legislation. Instead of bringing it on several weeks before the end of the session, they dealt with their whole program and brought Mabo on on the last day. Then basically, with the support of the Democrats and others, had the Senate continue to sit to almost Christmas to finish it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The contrast is the way in which we have handled this matter. We have brought it on a couple of weeks before the end of the session. We sat last night sensibly to get on with the second reading debate. We are happy to sit tonight to get on with the second reading debate. We are happy to sit tomorrow night. We are happy to sit on Friday. We will sit every night next week. If necessary, we will come back and sit the following week.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, the Labor Party is seeking to destroy the balance of the government's program for this session. There are important bills with starting dates and which must be passed this session. We know 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that it will be impossible to bring those bills on after completion of the Wik debate. That is why sensible practice is to finish those critical bills&mdash;only the critical bills&mdash;use the evenings to get through some of the second reading debates on Wik to get the process started and then get on with the committee stage of Wik.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are many bills on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> that the government has voluntarily removed because of the importance of Wik and the small number of bills that remain. But they have to be dealt with. We are happy to leave the ones that do not have to be dealt with until next year. What is left is just the completion of the sugar bill, on which the debate has been part heard. It has been suggested to me that there is about an hour to go. It has been suggested that the  Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997 &mdash;a critically important bill&mdash;has about an hour to go as well. We would have liked to have got on with the youth allowance bill, but we have deferred that to next year because of the pressures of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe the states grants legislation can be dealt with in about 15 minutes. The last one is the migration bill, on which other parties in this place have already foreshadowed we are going to be defeated. So an expeditious debate could be facilitated and the vote taken. It has to be voted on, however, because the existing migration agents scheme comes to an end at the beginning of the next session. In other words, there is not time to deal with this legislation before the existing scheme ceases. That is why it has to be dealt with at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have about three hours of debate, using sensible debate approaches. It could be completed this morning, and then we are free to get on with Wik. If we get some time opportunities next week, then we would like to fit into those time spaces messages that are coming back on a couple of bills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The four bills&mdash;the sugar bill and the three other ones&mdash;need to be completed this session. The only way they are going to be completed&mdash;as Labor knows; it is interested in wrecking it&mdash;is if they are dealt with this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9445"> morning. That is why we are bringing them on. There has been no secret about that. The Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Campbell) informed Labor at our last meeting that we had to finish these bills and it was our intention to proceed to finish these bills. It is sensible practice. It is sensible programming. I urge the Senate to get on with these debates and get them out of the way.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This action of the government shows that the government has no commitment to pastoralists, no commitment to Aborigines and no commitment to the parliament. It follows the actions of yesterday; constantly this government bypasses parliament at every opportunity they get. They do not want to debate anything in this parliament. They want to sit in a corner by themselves and make the decisions without any scrutiny. That is the problem with this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen it with the debate about sugar, which they dodged for months and which they brought into the House of Representatives by tabling a customs proposal which prevented this parliament from having any real part in the debate about the sugar tariff. That is because they did not want a debate on something which was flying in the face of an electoral promise they made. In the same way, having raised the expectation of the community and given to the community an opportunity to be involved, they said to them, `Go away, you are making too much noise. We do not like what you are saying.' This is the problem.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested in what Senator Faulkner has said because he is right: the government is going around telling everybody that there was an agreement that this is what should happen. The Australian Democrats understand that the Wik debate should have been the primary and the only matter for consideration during these two weeks. There was no agreement. The only 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> agreement the government ever have is with themselves. They sit in a corner and talk to themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you what the Australian people believe: not only should they sit in a corner but also they should have dunce caps on because of their inability to come to this parliament and present business in a way in which we can deal with it&mdash;in fact, withdrawing the most important legislation that this government has put to the parliament in the whole of its term.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to find that finally this government was able to find somebody, in a sanitised advertisement yesterday, to support them on this&mdash;the Business Council of Australia. What I think the government really is afraid of is the fact that yesterday thousands of people&mdash;represented by over 100,000 hands&mdash;said to the government, `You are wrong.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the kind of debate and the kind of opposition that this government cannot cope with. But the people out there spoke yesterday, and the people's representatives in this place want to continue this debate today. The people have spoken and they will not be silenced by this government. The Democrats will support the Labor Party on this suspension of standing orders because that is what the people of Australia want to happen, and that is the only way we can treat this matter with the importance that it deserves. I will say again: this government has no commitment to pastoralists; this government has no commitment to Aborigines; and, most of all, this government has no commitment to the parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens (WA) quite clearly stated on the record last night that we believe this bill should be withdrawn. It is clear that the government has not given its amendments to anybody to look at. We are dealing with an extremely important bill for Australia and its society, and we have not seen the government's amendments. If the government feels that it is necessary to spend more time working on its amendments, what we will be seeing is a new proposed bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9446">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the Senate has time this week to finish the government's program because, quite frankly, if what we are being presented with is a new bill, we should be doing what the Greens and a growing number of people in the community have been saying: `Withdraw the bill. Go back and talk to indigenous Australians. Find out what you are doing wrong in terms of the process. Start talking to those people more fully. Provide information to those people who have been led to believe that it is necessary for them to go into legal conflict when, in fact, that is not necessary. Start providing real information to the constituents.' That is what is necessary. If we have a situation where we finish the rest of the program and the government withdraws the bill, we can all go home.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill made a rather dissembling speech this morning when he said, `The government always made clear it wanted to get this amount of the program through.' That part is true. What he was not able to say was that this side of the chamber was signed up to that. If we were, we would have progressed this, we would have finalised it and we would have kept our word.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Twice in the period 1995-96 I was part of negotiations with the coalition to get a minimal amount of legislation through the parliament. In the process we jettisoned scores of bills. Twice in that period the coalition 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> scabbed on its word, and we did not even get the minimalist position. When Senator Hill comes in today and says, `We should get this amount of legislation through,' he cannot even point to an agreement with the Labor Party, the Democrats or the Greens that we had signed up to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear from the way the Wik debate is going that there will be amendments moved in this chamber. They will be amendments that will require all the drafting skill of the clerks and everyone else. By the time they are transmitted to the House of Representatives, and by the time they are considered there and a message comes back, this chamber will have to wait around for a day to a day and a half.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When precise calculations were given by Senator Hill today that it will only take X amount of time to do one bill and Y to do others, we could have quite easily done that at the end of the session. But we feel let down. It was our understanding that the Wik debate would start at 12.30 p.m. on Monday, and it did not. It was one of the reasons we encouraged the Tuesday night sitting on a no division, no pairs basis to conclude the second reading debate. So we feel doubly let down.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one silver lining in all of this that I enjoy: that is, Senator Hill and Senator Campbell are humiliating the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), and that always brings me a bit of joy. Ten days ago the Prime Minister issued a big statement&mdash;a big BS. He called on the Senate to get on with the Wik legislation. He demanded that this chamber address the Wik legislation. This could not be cheap populism by the Prime Minister. This could not be a Prime Minister that would ever appeal to prejudice and to cheap point scoring. He must have genuinely wanted this chamber to get on with it. He would not have just put out such a statement to puff up his 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9447"> chest and use us as a whipping horse, would he? No, he would not have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ellison acknowledges that the Prime Minister would never do that. Of course not. So how do those opposite reconcile their action with his statements of 10 days ago? He has called upon this chamber to get on with Wik, to debate Wik and to have it resolved in one form or another. This group of coalition senators is totally defying the Prime Minister.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Abetz laughs. I wonder why the Prime Minister has not been on the phone about this issue. He has had time to get on the phone from Vancouver to tell the Manager of Government Business to apologise. He has been able to make that particular phone call. He has picked up all his faxes on the opinion polls of the last two days, we know that. Surely he has had time to pick up the phone and make one phone call to the Manager of Government Business yet again and say, `Get on with debating Wik because it is surely more important than the other seven items of business that you want to have precedence over.' But you will not bring it on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no use talking about intransigence in this chamber. This coalition government has been given more days, more hours and more opportunities to debate business than has been accorded any government in the last 15 years. The average of government business as a percentage time of the Senate is constantly on the rise. The opposition has been responsible in restricting the amount of MPIs and urgency motions to give the government the opportunity to get its legislative program through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the Prime Minister has demanded that we get on with Wik. The only response we have had from the government and Senator Hill is that these other items on the agenda&mdash;the customs, social security and migration legislation&mdash;should all have priority. The only conclusion we can draw from this is that, the moment this chamber finishes debate on Wik, the irresponsible anarchists opposite want to make a run for home because they regard running for home as more important than these seven items of legislation. If they are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> serious, they would stay here after Wik and debate them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond briefly to a couple of points that I think do need to be made clear. Firstly, the coalition has always made its position clear during the last number of weeks in negotiations about how to handle a heavy legislative program, including the so&hyphen;called Wik debate which will, as we now know, include the debate in committee stage of some 600 amendments; I am sure that is some sort of record for a piece of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There have been discussions about how to facilitate that committee stage debate in an effective way between the minister responsible and people on the other side of the chamber. But there is a recognition that, even with the best goodwill and the best organisation in terms of preparation of running sheets and grouping of amendments and so forth, it will be a long and complex debate. One indication given privately to the Special Minister of State (Senator Minchin) was of the order of 50 hours just in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition did make it clear from the outset that we would try to whittle down the core program that we needed to get through by the end of this year. I must acknowledge what Senator Ray says, and it is a point that Senator Margetts made in private meetings and also in the chamber recently, that there may be an opportunity to do some pieces of legislation while messages are going backwards and forwards between the Senate and that other place. The coalition will be seeking to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have whittled down the list now to include only those items on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> today, that is, the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill, the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill, the States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill and the migration bills. We think that those items, if we can get on with them, can be handled almost entirely this morning, and that has always been our intention. It was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9448"> made quite clear to the opposition that that was the government's intention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have compromised by dropping other items off and I indicate to the Senate now that the coalition government will seek to bring on those other matters that are on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>&mdash;specifically, the Productivity Commission Bill, the workplace relations amendment message and the legislative instruments message&mdash;to be dealt with if there is a capability of doing so should there be a hiatus when there is a message going back to the House of Representatives in relation to the Native Title Amendment Bill. They are the four items we seek to deal with. We have always made that clear to the Manager of Opposition Business. I think it is fair to say that the opposition never agreed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also did not agree to one other item which would have facilitated exactly what Senator Robert Ray said. When we sought the extra sitting week we also sought to have an open&hyphen;ended adjournment so that we could facilitate the completion of these items and the native title bill, so that when we got to the end of the session there was not an automatic adjournment of the Senate that was outside the control of the government. We wanted an assurance there and we were denied that; we could not get agreement on that either. That was our part of the contract and the opposition refused to agree to that, and that should be put on the record. That discussion about the adjournment question comes from the letters that were tabled and incorporated, I think by Senator Faulkner, earlier this week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ray has drawn the Senate's attention to the failure of the Senate to deal with some items of the former government's legislative program in the dying days of the last sittings in 1995. It contrasts somewhat with the assurances that Senator Hill, then the Leader of the Opposition, gave to Senator Faulkner, then the Manager of Government Business, in relation to the completion of the former government's program in 1995.</PARA>

I want just to say that, by and large, I am not supporting it at this stage, but I did agree and suggest that we do sit extra times on Wik, and that seems now to be becoming accepted right around the chamber. I am happy about that but, in regard to the items of business the government has got at the present moment, one of the indications given by the Leader of the Government was that the migration legislation agents bills will not take long because he believes that they are going to bite the dust anyhow if the Senate does not support them. If that is his belief I would happily go along with that, but I have been considering these matters carefully and have not made up my mind on them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was in full flight yesterday when time defeated me. But at the time I was talking about the fact that the mantra of international competitiveness has been used to deny everything from environmental protection to native title, industrial awards and basic human rights. So, on balance, I will not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9450"> support the government on this issue. If it can be excised through the ALP's amendment, I will consider voting for the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S111">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</XREF> . If not, there is nothing in this bill that commends strong support. I would be happy to support the other elements of the bill should the government wish to bring them back at another time, but I will not support it in its current state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to say explicitly that, because of the way the Senate numbers appear to play out, it seems that the decision has been given to the National Party senators. If this tariff goes ahead, it will be only because the Nationals have voted for it. If they even abstain, the vote will go the other way and the tariff will remain. The National Party senators have crossed the floor twice in my term in the Senate, and I know they can do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question is, `What are their priorities?' I understand this is entirely their decision. Everyone else has looked into the issue as they have seen it. The fate of the sugar issue rests squarely now with the National Party and they will have to deal with their constituency as they see fit. I guess they are going to have to justify their decisions to their constituencies as well as to their fellow colleagues. That is the issue as I see it. Unless the bill is substantially different from what it is now, it will not get the vote of the Greens (WA).</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Howard government promised the sugar industry at the last election that it would not remove the tariff. There has been debate about that point already. It is clear that it has broken that promise. The government relied on the view of industry leadership to justify the abolition of the tariff. But, frankly, that leadership was put in a very tough position. It was given a choice of a single desk selling arrangement or the tariff. In other words, it was put in a position where it was being used&mdash;pressured&mdash;to give the government the excuse to break its promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no clear evidence to support the assertion that such a trade-off was required. It should be clear from the evidence that was put before the Senate inquiry into the  Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that rank and file canegrowers are very much of a different view&mdash;very much indeed. That is the clear evidence that was put to the inquiry. Rank and file canegrowers want this government to honour its election promise. We even had the member for Kennedy, Mr Katter, present a submission to the inquiry acknowledging that this action was in breach of a clear election promise and that the canegrowers in his electorate wanted the promise kept. Those canegrowers want a single desk marketing structure to be maintained and they also want the tariff to be left in place. They do not want to trade one for the other, nor should they.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not, on the other hand, an action that is required to meet our international trade obligations. We are way ahead on that score. No-one can be critical of us on that score if indeed we maintain the $55 a tonne sugar tariff. So this is a matter of ideological obsession on the part of the drys within the Howard cabinet in the Liberal government. It is also about the National Party leadership being done over once again. Those National Party senators opposite will have to wear that decision in their electorates once again. It is clear Mr Katter from Kennedy is aware of that, because he has distanced himself from the decision of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately Senator Boswell, the Leader of the National Party in the Senate, came in here yesterday to seek to support the government's decision and to attack the position taken by Senator Woodley on behalf of the Democrats. I must say that my interpretation of the way Senator Boswell presented his points yesterday led me to the view that he would have been much more comfortable had he been standing across in Senator Woodley's place and taking Senator Woodley's position on this matter. Clearly he was uncomfortable with the fact that on this issue he is not carrying out the wishes of the electors who support the National Party in Queensland, in particular the sugar industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He had to introduce a host of other factors to seek to downplay the relevance of the Democrats' position to rural industries. He could not play them on the issue because clearly he was playing them on the issue 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9451"> against the interests of his own electors. Estimates which have been put to the Senate inquiry into this bill put the cost of the Howard government's action in removing the tariff at about $3,000 per year per grower. The New South Wales government estimated that around 2,000 jobs in the sugar industry could be placed in jeopardy by the loss of the sugar tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are also a number of other points that the Senate should consider in this matter. The minority report noted that despite assurances from the Australian soft drink manufacturers no plans had been made to import sugar. The ACCC believes that import competition will provide an effective constraint on their pricing decisions. It is also significant that the soft drink industry conceded during the inquiry that savings of around $7 million per annum the soft drink industry will gain from the loss of the tariff will not be passed on to consumers. I want to refer to the evidence given to the inquiry by Mr Gentile. He was asked questions about the impact of the savings of $7 million per year by Senator Forshaw. He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There did not seem to be a difference, but that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Gentile</EMPHASIS> &mdash;I can honestly say to you that whilst there is a saving of over $7 million to the total soft drink industry in Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senator FORSHAW</EMPHASIS> &mdash;Per year?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Mr Gentile</EMPHASIS> &mdash;Per year. That is saving. It is easy to calculate. Whilst there is a saving of that sort of order, the unit cost for one bottle or one can of soft drink is quite small&mdash;the impact of sugar on that can of soft drink is quite small. So, you have got to take it into account in terms of your total cost. You cannot take one ingredient and say that you will reduce the price of that ingredient, so automatically that price on the supermarket shelf will reduce by X. It does not happen that way, and anyone who has been in the business knows that.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So he was saying you cannot say that because we are going to reduce the price of sugar that is going to be factored into the price of a soft drink. We are not going to say that the amount of sugar means that there will be a reduction of 0.5c or 1c to the unit cost, that we are going to reduce the unit cost. Indeed, we are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at his evidence, all he was prepared to say was that the marketing of soft 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> drink led to discounting and that, effectively, somehow the reduction in the cost of sugar would be factored into the discounting cost. In other words, if the market requires discounting, then the industry will recover the cost of that discounting from the savings presented to them by the removal of the sugar tariff and, potentially, the reduction in the cost of the sugar to the processors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, the producers' sugar is sold at a price which factors in the tariff&mdash;or which did up to 1 July this year. They have already lost that. The price of sugar in Australia now should have reflected a reduction consequent to the removal of the tariff, because that has effectively been implemented retrospective to 1 July. In addition, the domestic price of sugar factored in the potential cost of transport of imported sugar from the nearest port, which is Thailand as I understand it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there should have been a considerable reduction in the price of sugar. That should have already been factored in to the price of the products of various producers&mdash;be it the soft drink manufacturers or the confectionary manufacturers, such as Cadbury's referred to by Senator Brown. But no evidence has been presented to us, that I am aware of, that shows that such a reduction has taken place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any suggestion that this measure is going to have a great impact on consumers has not been borne out by the facts as they are able to be demonstrated to date. I repeat: notwithstanding the fact that this legislation has not yet been passed, the tariff was effectively removed on 1 July and the removal of the tariff impact should be measurable at this time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the weakness of anti-dumping legislation, it is possible that future imports of sugar could seriously threaten the viability of the domestic industry&mdash;a concern heightened by the ACCC prediction that there will be a significant rise in the world sugar production and refining capacity in the future. That is the ACCC's view. If that is the case, this is not a rational decision taken in the context of domestic needs and international obligations. It is an irrational decision forced by an economically conservative philosophy taken by members of the government and will be paid 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9452"> for by regional Australia in the form of income foregone and jobs lost.</PARA>

We ask the questions: what motivated the recommendation to remove the tariff, and why following the release of the Sugar Industry Review Working Party recommendations was there no opportunity provided for further consultation with the industry?'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the recommendation was released it was quite obvious that there was an outcry on the tariff issue. I believe that it is on record that we supported, in general, most of the other 74 recommendations. Of those 74 recommendations, most were of an industry nature. There was a lot of disagreement with those remaining 74, particularly the one relating to the changes to the pooling arrangements, but we recognised that that was an industry issue and it was going to take a long time for us to attempt to satisfy all those who had opinions about that.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I make the point that the one opinion that was common to all concerned the recommendation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to remove the sugar tariff. The tariff had value as an anti&hyphen;dumping mechanism. We believe that dumped sugar is a possibility in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was said by the Australian Cane Farmers Association of Australia. That is the body which said basically that the review did not reflect the industry body on that issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evidence of the Chairman of the Cane Growers Association is reported on pages 8 and 9 of the committee report. Mr Harry Bonanno, a member of the sugar industry review working party and the chairman of the cane growers, told the committee, as stated at point 2.10:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certainly the governments, both state and federal, were emphatic that we had to comply with the national competition policy. There is no doubt about that. I understand the English language perfectly, and there were no ifs or buts. It was impressed upon us that it was fairly desirable to have a unanimous decision come out of the review. That is not an easy thing to come up with, a unanimous decision out of a review, when there are such differing views to commence with.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We had to work through all of that and we paid a heap of money to consultants to give us all of the opinions we could lay our hands on to show how we could comply with national competition policy. We had to pass the public benefit test, and there is no way that we could hold the tariff and hold single desk selling and still pass the public benefit test for our industry, especially with the single desk selling.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9453">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On page 9, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When we signed off on the recommendations, every organisation had a representative there. After they signed, some of the organisations chose not to follow, perhaps, the commitments that their chairman, or whoever he was at the time, had made. Frankly, I believe I have made a commitment on behalf of Canegrowers, and the Canegrowers Council subscribe to that view because they have supported me in that determination.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Bonanno is saying that the individuals took a position which they believed reflected the views of the industry. He also admits that when those views became known, in a number of cases the organisations disowned that decision. In other words, the decisions that were taken were not taken with the full backing of their organisation and the organisation was not prepared to support it. That is reflected in the evidence that was put before the Senate committee. There are serious concerns about this matter, in regional Queensland and northern New South Wales in particular, in terms of the impact on some of the regional centres. I have a letter here from Cairns City Council and I will read part of it. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent times, the federal government has seen the reality in consequences of removing the tariff from the car industry and consequently did not proceed with that recommendation. It also appears that the consequences on the Australian textile industry could be disastrous with the loss of Australian jobs. Hopefully these industries will receive a considerate hearing. Council again asks all senators to please consider the consequences on the towns and cities along the Queensland sugar belt which most rely on the sugar industry's viability for their employment. Collectively, this area could lose $18 million annually to their local economies. In the Cairns local authority area alone, the loss would be $1.2 million annually, with $2 million for the whole of the Cairns region.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the view of Cairns City Council. To give an example from New South Wales, the Northern Rivers Regional Development Board Incorporated wrote to the minister. I have a copy of a letter dated 24 September. They said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The removal of the tariff will have a most detrimental effect on the sugar industry in New South Wales and, to a lesser extent, in Queensland. In view of the coalition promises that were made to the sugar industry prior to the election, for example, on February 12 1993, the coalition shadow 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister, Bruce Lloyd promised `the sugar tariffs would be phased down to $15 per tonne by the year 2000 and retained at that level'. Also a declaration was signed at Murwillumbah in June 1992 by Senator Bill O'Chee, Don Beck MLA, Larry Anthony and Mike Emerson opposing any additional cuts to sugar tariff.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I emphasise in relation to the New South Wales situation that the evidence before the inquiry was that they rely more on the domestic price of sugar than the export price of sugar. Queensland exports the majority of its product. That is not clearly the evidence in relation to the New South Wales growers. As I understand the evidence, their product is grown predominantly for domestic use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This decision will have the greatest effect in northern New South Wales. The reduction in the price to the growers will be more keenly felt in New South Wales as compared to Queensland as their price will be reduced the most in proportion to the totality of their crop.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="S111">Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</XREF> . I begin my comments by highlighting the title of the report that was brought down. It was called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Winning globally</EMPHASIS> . These are very significant words. I also highlight in this place the fact that 85 per cent of our sugar is exported. Only 15 per cent is consumed in this country. Virtually the only chance that the sugar industry has to expand&mdash;there is potential to grow&mdash;in New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia, albeit it is in its embryo stage there, is through exporting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9454">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I highlight what has occurred in this particular debate. Just recently&mdash;the decision that has been made here has had a lot to do with whether the sugar industry can expand&mdash;Korea decided to reduce the tariff on Australian sugar entering the Korean market by 40 per cent. That will bring the tariff down to three per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also highlight in relation to this debate the fact that recently Brunei, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Kazakstan, Kuwait, Latvia, Malaysia, New England, Singapore, Slovenia and the UAE have already reduced their tariffs on our sugar to zero. If anybody thinks that that would not have occurred as a result of the decision that has been made, they are fooling themselves. It is part of the reciprocal arrangements in terms of increasing trade. It is a position that those opposite held&mdash;Senator O'Brien shakes his head&mdash;when they were in government. If anybody believes that this would not have occurred if we had adopted a different position, they are absolutely wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I pay tribute to Harry Bonanno for his leadership. In terms of winning globally, Mr Ron Verri, President of the Australian Cane Farmers Association, was a member of that working party. I also point out that they spent over $3 million on the Boston report to come to their conclusions. It is true that there are 74 recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The terms of reference for that working party belong to the previous federal Labor government and the previous Queensland state Labor government. The directions and the letters that were sent belong to the previous government as far as competition policy is concerned. They were signed by none other than Senator Bob Collins. He made it quite clear that they had to abide by competition policy&mdash;your policy. Furthermore, when they made their decision&mdash;this is one which the industry up there supports&mdash;they put more import on the single desk selling system for the domestic market than they did on the tariff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, in terms of this decision, in moving to export parity pricing for the domestic market, you cannot have export parity pricing and apply a tariff by definition. Even if you reintroduced the tariff, it has no effect&mdash;it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> does not apply. We have to realise that when we are dealing with this particular debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decisions, the guidelines and the whole process were put there by the Labor Party. The directions which they had to comply with were put there by the Labor Party. It is true that the report came down after we came into government, but I also challenge those opposite in terms of their policy position. Had they put this report down, they would not have changed their position; they would not have gone against this. We know that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to talk about another aspect of what has to be dealt with in the short time that I have left, one that is very important in this whole debate. It relates to the impact of the merger between CSR and Mackay Sugar. One must not forget that the basic reason that the ACCC changed their position was purely and simply because the tariff was removed. The only anti&hyphen;competitive element went. Let us look at that a wee bit further, because it is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Professor Fels and his officers appeared before us they made it absolutely crystal clear that if the tariff was brought back on, they would have no option&mdash;it is in the committee's report&mdash;but to seriously review the particular decision, that is, the merger. He made it very clear without being able to say it, because it is not a decision of his in isolation, that they would have to review that particular decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The losses from over production in the refining sector are costing Queensland growers somewhere in the order of $22 million a year. It is coming directly out of the pockets of Queensland growers. So we cannot ignore that when we are dealing with this particular issue. As we work through the various aspects of it, one thing is very important. The evidence came through&mdash;what Senator O'Brien said was correct about Mr Gentile&mdash;that you could not identify at the end the savings to consumers. However, what he and other witnesses made clear is that because of the overproduction in the refining business in this country, the tariff had long been traded away. That is borne out by the prices when you compare the domestic prices which exist.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9455">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the reasons for the difficulties that the refining industry has in terms of the current situation in sugar is, purely and simply, that oversupply. Unless that is addressed, not only are the growers going to lose $22 million a year but also the other shareholders in the refining industry in Queensland, which are primarily in the order of 40 per cent, are going to lose a lot more money as well. We must not forget either of these groups of shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So they have got, if you like, a hand in both camps, and they should be protected. To turn around this decision now not only would be not in the best interests of the sugar export industry and of the total sugar industry in Australia; it would cost growers an enormous amount of money, and it has already cost them a lot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a bold report, it was a good report. It was based on the terms of reference set down by the Labor Party. It was based on the directions and instructions that were given by the previous minister, Senator Bob Collins, and if Senator Bob Collins were here I am sure he would be prepared to acknowledge that particular fact. He said only that they had to comply with the necessities of competition policy, which was also in legislation he brought in. So, when you pick the populist route, never forget who put that in place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recognise the pressure of business at this time of year but I believe this is an issue of great importance. As has been clear from the contributions to date, it is an issue of particular significance for farmers in Queensland. It is certainly an issue of importance to the Democrats. As the tariff slashing approach of this government follows on from the tariff slashing approach of the previous Labor government, it is an issue of great concern to the Democrats and, as a Queenslander and a Democrat, I feel it is appropriate for me to make some contribution to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Crane just spoke about the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Winning globally</EMPHASIS>. That is a fairly inspirational title but it is probably important to consider the flipside of that, which is that while some people are winning globally&mdash;it looks to me from this that the big winners 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> globally will be people like Coca&hyphen;Cola&mdash;some people are certainly going to lose locally. Those people are the farmers and their communities in regional areas, communities which have been hit harder than most by the policies both of this government and the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I realise that politics is a curious business and that you do get some strange suggestions being put forward from time to time. Certainly I found it curious and difficult to believe Senator Boswell's suggestion that the reason why the government is breaking such a clear&hyphen;cut promise is that the industry basically came to it on bended knee and said, `Please break your promise and remove the tariff.'</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="PARER" NAMEID="KI4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT6">Senator BARTLETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe that is correct but I tend to believe the suggestion and the evidence that was put to the Senate committee that there was a little bit of a gun to the head when the industry was on bended knee and that might have forced their hand a bit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Boswell also suggested that he was a great believer in maintaining tariffs some years back when the world market was corrupt, but apparently now the world market is no longer corrupt. The suggestion that the world market is no longer corrupt is something that, again, I find fairly difficult to believe. Senator Woodley quoted in his speech sugar beet growers in the European Union who specifically said that if they had to compete at world market prices they would be wiped out. There is obviously a little bit of corruption still out there in the big, bad world and, again, this naive suggestion that we can unilaterally reduce tariffs to zero is something that the Democrats find fairly astonishing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose that, having been following politics for a long time, the fact that the National Party might not actually be following their words with action and doing things that are actually in the interests of farmers but selling them out instead is not necessarily a great surprise to me. I have seen that happen many a time in Queensland over the years. Something I am even more surprised about is the apparent view of Senator Brown, from the Greens, that he is considering supporting the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9456"> removal of the sugar tariff. The vision of Senator Brown joining the zero tariff, free trade, level playing field brigade is one that I find a bit surprising&mdash;auditioning for the new Captain Zero role!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That would increase the profits of multinational companies, like Coca&hyphen;Cola, at the expense of regional communities and farmers in regional areas. I find that quite surprising. I had the understanding until recently&mdash;and I had no reason to think otherwise&mdash;that he would follow the usual approach that the Greens have taken in relation to tariff issues and that Senator Margetts outlined in her speech&mdash;that unilateral reduction of tariffs is not really the way to go. It is a bit surprising that he is apparently thinking twice about that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats acknowledge that there are environmental issues of great concern in the sugar industry and that they need to be addressed. I found it a little bit offensive that Senator Brown in his speech suggested that Senator Woodley was unaware of the environmental impact of the sugar growing industry. Perhaps because it happened predominantly prior to Senator Brown's coming into this place, he is not aware of the ongoing work of Senator Woodley in this area over a couple of years in pressuring both the previous government and the current government about the impact of sugar cane farming on the mahogany glider habitat, in particular, but also the other practices of the sugar industry which impact on the environment. To make that suggestion about Senator Woodley or the Democrats, who have done more than anyone in Queensland to highlight some of the environmental damage that the sugar industry has caused in Queensland, is just mistaken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown's second reading amendment brings up the issue of single desk selling&mdash;something, of course, that the Democrats do support&mdash;but he also said that the single desk selling issue and the tariff cut issue are not linked. The dissenting report from the Senate committee inquiry into this issue also found no evidence to demonstrate that single desk selling would automatically be dismantled if the tariff was retained. Senator Margetts also pointed out that there is no link between the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> issue of single desk selling and the tariff. That is part of the nub of this issue and why there is no justification for reducing the tariff in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts made quite a number of good points in her speech about why it is such a strange way to go, to support the elimination of the tariff, to unilaterally remove tariffs down to zero. As she said, the only real advantage in dropping the tariff goes to big confectionery manufacturers and there are some potential drawbacks for rural communities and for farmers in moving unilaterally to free trade, both in terms of any leverage to get any other nation to lower trade barriers and in moving towards a regulated, fair market system instead of towards a free market system. I implore Senator Brown to listen again to those words before supporting something which goes further down the unregulated, free market track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts again said in her speech yesterday that there appear to be no certain positive environmental consequences either from cutting the tariff or from keeping it there, and that there are potential drawbacks with either option. Trying to link the tariff cut with environmental issues is a flawed approach. No&hyphen;one is saying that there are no environmental issues that the sugar industry needs to address, but the Democrats believe it is a strange way to go to try to get an industry to address environmental problems by kicking them in the guts. If we really wanted to kick them in the guts for that sort of purpose I would suggest to Senator Brown that he might actually want to oppose single desk selling and gut the industry entirely. That approach plays into the hands of those who like to put up the false dichotomy that there is some sort of competition between jobs and the environment. The Democrats have said many a time that that is a false dichotomy and that we need to look at exploring ways that increase jobs while preserving and protecting the environment. In the long term, we know that that is the only way to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We come down to the core issue on this bill of how people are going to vote. As was pointed out in the Senate committee's report, the issue of a tariff is the only one out of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9457"> 74 recommendations of the sugar industry review working party that can be dealt with by legislation. It is the only one that parliament has a chance to consider and address, and it is the only one on which the ordinary cane farmers have had the opportunity to have their views put through the forum of the parliament. It is important to emphasise that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard a lot of talk from the government, from Senator Boswell et cetera, that this is what the industry wants. The cane growers organisation has indicated that, but it seems pretty clear to me that they have done that predominantly because a gun has been held to their head in relation to single desk selling. In as much as they have said that, that is the case. It is quite clear that, in this issue at least, they are not representing the views of the majority of the cane farmers out there or the views of the many people in the broader community in those cane growing areas that the farmers are a part of and who obviously have an interdependent relationship with viable cane farmers in their communities. It is important to emphasise that, despite what one industry body may say, clearly the voluntary organisation&mdash;</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consulted on and that they might be able to get the parliament to look at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess that is a novel concept for a lot of people and for farmers more than most, who are probably used to being steamrolled by the coalition and by the National Party in particular. Maybe they were not expecting to get a chance to be asked. Once they realised they had a chance to put their views they put them loud, clear, strong and long&mdash;and they are still doing it. It is very clear to me and to the Democrats&mdash;and I have met with some cane farmers myself, although nowhere near as many as Senator Woodley, who has clearly demonstrated his strong commitment to regional and rural areas in Queensland over many years&mdash;that the average cane farmer out on the land in Queensland and northern New South Wales does not support this measure, does not believe it is necessary and believes it will negatively impact on them, on the industry's viability and on the local community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we do come down to how we vote on this one issue that the parliament gets to consider out of the whole industry review process. It is very clear that this measure, which adversely and unfairly impacts upon cane farmers and which heavily impacts upon Queensland, is one that both as a Queensland senator and as a Democrat I will be strongly opposing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do make a final call to the National Party senators and to the Queensland National Party senators in particular to show that they are a separate party and not just the irrelevant rump of the Liberal Party. Sugar is a huge issue in north Queensland and there are a lot of angry cane farmers out there who feel&mdash;and quite 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9458"> justifiably so&mdash;they have been sold out by the National Party on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once or twice the Queensland National Party members have shown that they are willing to cross the floor on an issue, as Senator Margetts said. One of those was the issue of great concern to farmers in Queensland of whether or not homosexual acts in Tasmania should be kept illegal. They marched to protect the Queensland farmers on that one. They crossed the floor bravely. This issue, I would suggest, is rather more directly crucial to the future of the Queensland farmers than sex laws in Tasmania. I do ask them, once again, to consider strongly their action on this issue because it is very clear that many people in regional parts of Queensland, not just the cane farmers but all those who have cane farmers in their community, are watching closely to see how they vote on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similarly, I make a plea to Senator Brown. I am not totally sure how he is voting on this issue but I would like to urge him once again not to join the zero tariff brigade. There is no doubt about the environmental impacts of a wide range of industries and, in fact, the environmental impacts of all human activity. Part of what we have to consider is how best to address those issues. But there is no link between cutting this tariff and addressing the environmental problems that the sugar industry causes. In as much as there are any, kicking that industry in the guts is not going in the right direction in relation to those problems. I do urge him to think carefully about how he votes on this issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review of the tariff in Queensland's Sugar Industry Act 1991 was established by the Commonwealth and Queensland governments in October 1995. This was a time of a Labor federal government and a Labor state government. The terms of reference required the review to be consistent with the principles of the Competition Principles Agreement's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> national competition policy principles and specified that the objective of any new Queensland legislation should be to facilitate the sustainable development of an internationally competitive export oriented industry which would benefit both industry participants and the wider community.</PARA>

The working party was chaired by Sir Eric Neale on 1 July 1996 and then by Mr Bruce Vaughan. Membership of the working party included representatives from the grain growing and milling sectors, sugar users, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and Queensland's Department of Primary Industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of the tariff it is important to note how it operated. As imports of sugar into Australia are negligible, the tariff did not act as an instrument for stopping competitive imports of sugar into Australia. Rather it served to redistribute income from consumers to producers via the domestic pricing arrangements operating in Queensland. Prior to 1 July 1997 the Queensland Sugar Corporation priced domestic sales at or close to import parity, which included the value of the tariff. Potential loss to customs revenue is, therefore, not an issue in this case. Duty collected on raw cane sugar in 1996&hyphen;97 amounted to the massive sum of $772.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In endorsing the recommendations of the working party, the government was mindful that, provided the recommendations were implemented fully as a package, members of the working party, including representatives of the peak industry organisations, supported them unanimously. The package of recommendations had already been fully endorsed by the Queensland government. This government considers the package as a significant step towards maintaining an internationally competitive and sustainable export oriented industry. It will position the industry well to meet future challenges from other producers around the world as well as competition from alternative sweeteners and from other crops.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package is designed to provide a framework for increasing efficiency, reducing costs, improving raw sugar marketing services 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9459"> and increasing the opportunities for innovation. It provides for all domestic refiners and industrial users to have access to raw sugar at world prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package of arrangements will overcome a number of current constraints on the performance of the Queensland sugar industry which impact negatively on the overall community. The arrangements represent significant change now. Moreover, they set in train an ongoing process of change which will be driven essentially by the industry itself. As reflected above, the removal of the tariff is consistent with the working party recommendations to set domestic sugar prices at export parity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Making the domestic price equal to the world sugar price will increase the ability of Australian manufacturers of products containing sugar to compete with imported products and will encourage them to innovate, to become more competitive and to reduce prices to consumers. This has been covered by many of the speeches in the second reading debate. Additionally, the transport cost advantage Australian suppliers enjoy will continue to offer a natural path of protection from imports of both raw and refined sugar. Export parity pricing for domestic raw sugar sales will result in the prices received by growers through the pooling arrangements reflecting world levels. If domestic prices are equal to world prices, the tariff is rendered ineffective and will not provide further assistance to sugar producers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In accepting the working party's recommendations to remove the tariff on sugar imports, the government was mindful of its own sugar policy announced before the last election. In that policy the government undertook, `to not reduce the sugar tariff beyond the present level of $55 a tonne', which was set to continue until 30 June 1997. Given that the working party recommendations had the unanimous support of the chairmen of the peak industry bodies, which represented over 95 per cent of cane production, and given the effect of export parity pricing on sugar sold domestically, the government decided to endorse the industry backed recommendation to remove the tariff from 30 June 1997. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senator Boswell covered this very effectively in his speech. He made the point that the industry came to the government and said, `We want to accept that package.'</PARA>

However, in doing so, they really seek to discredit the witnesses who came before the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What we have pointed out to the Senate is that which Senator O'Brien read from in his 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9463"> remarks in the second reading debate. What I read from in my remarks in the second reading debate and what Senator Woodley referred to in the second reading debate was the evidence given to the committee by representatives of the Cane Farmers Association.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to read some of that evidence again for the benefit of Senator Boswell and other senators. This is the evidence which we clearly relied upon in our report to support the retention of the tariff. It was the farmers and their representatives who came to the committee and said that they were railroaded effectively into supporting the recommendation because they had it put to them that there was a choice&mdash;either the tariff or the single desk mechanism. We now know that that is not a choice they should have ever had to make.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will not again read in detail the evidence, because it is in the report and it is in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. But, if you are going to stand up and support the position adopted by the government, at least have the decency and the honesty to recognise that the evidence put to the Senate inquiry from canefarmers' representatives was that they did not want the tariff removed. Their evidence was that they would suffer financially if it was removed. Their evidence was that they did not really get a proper say in the working party process. Indeed, as Mr Allison said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the 75 recommendations that were contained in the Queensland sugar industry review working party report, there was only one recommendation on which this organisation went public, and that was the recommendation in relation to the tariff. That one recommendation was comprehensively condemned by both Queensland and New South Wales alike. To the best of our knowledge, most industry organisations and in particular the two grower organisations did not support the removal of the sugar tariff in their submissions to the sugar industry review working party. We asked the questions: what motivated the recommendation to remove the tariff and why, following the release of the sugar industry review working party recommendations, was there no opportunity provided for further consultation with the industry?</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly, from the time that the recommendation was made, there were expressions of concern being put forward by representatives 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the Cane Farmers Association that they were not happy with the outcome of the process; that they believed that people had actually been put in a position on that working party where they had no choice; and, further, that the cane farmers and the other sugar interests in northern New South Wales, who would be most significantly affected by this decision, really did not have an appropriate voice within that working party process. In our arguments to this Senate, we have quoted the evidence of the witnesses themselves from the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government comes back and says, `Well, this whole process was established by the Labor government.' It is true; the working party was established in October 1995 and, of course, there was an election in March 1996 in which the coalition parties were successful and took government. The working party reported in November 1996, almost nine months after that election. So don't try to suggest that because the process was set up by the Labor government somehow the outcomes were ones that we preordained.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that those in the sugar industry hear this debate because of the misrepresentation of their position. If, as the government argues correctly, the working party process was under way in October 1995, why was it that the coalition went to the election in March 1996 with a policy to retain the tariff and the single desk? One has to ask what the motivation was for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear from the evidence to the committee that significant sections of the industry do not support the removal of the tariff. In fact, when given the opportunity to finally have their say before a senate committee dealing specifically with this legislation, they asked this parliament to retain the tariff. Clearly we are persuaded by their position and, on that basis, we will be asking the Senate to support 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9464"> our request that these provisions in schedule 4 be omitted and that the tariff be retained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will make a couple of other quick comments in regard to the amendments. Firstly, with respect to the amendment that was moved by Senator Brown and dealt with in the second reading debate, it should not in any way be taken that, whilst we did not support that amendment, we are not supporting the retention of the single desk. That is patently obvious. Our problem with the amendment, for the benefit of Senator Brown&mdash;because there was no opportunity in the second reading debate to canvass many of those issues&mdash;was that we believed that, particularly, subclauses (c) (iii) and (iv) were unacceptable. If they had been excised we probably would have been able to support that amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that is the past and we are into the committee stage and the other amendments. Certainly, we are committed to the retention of the single desk and the retention of the tariff.</PARA></SPEECH>

It would have given them the opportunity to have acted sensibly so that we could have separated the sugar issue from the other issues in this bill, but I have not even had a reply to my letter. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> We will certainly support the Labor Party's amendment at this point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a number of statements made by the minister. One of them was in response to my not giving permission to incorporate the press release. Senator Forshaw has already given you reasons why this was so. I did not give leave to incorporate because evidence given by Cane Farmers at the inquiry clearly showed that that one press release they put out was not authorised by the officials of the Cane Farmers and was put out by mistake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very clearly, they are absolutely opposed to the abolition of the sugar tariff, and I will give you more evidence to support that. The Cane Farmers Association itself gave me 5,000 names and addresses of cane farmers so that we could put out a survey to find out what cane farmers really think. The surveys returned show that over 90 per cent of cane farmers are opposed to what the government is doing. So much for the Cane Farmers Association being in support of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister's reference to inheritance tax was a very interesting one, because it is this government that has imposed an inheritance tax on the aged people of Australia through its entry fees to nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also reply to the minister's statement about Canegrowers in Mackay. I understand that the cane growers association in Mackay are very sensitive about this issue.</PARA>

Obviously once again this government is holding a gun at the head of cane growers to ensure that they stay on board with the government. This government is incredibly worried about what is happening with cane farmers in Queensland and New South Wales because it knows it has lost most of them. At the next election, which I can hardly wait for, we will see.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9465">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That might have been Canegrowers in Mackay. At meetings I had with the cane growers&mdash;all members of Canegrowers&mdash;in Babinda, Gordonvale and Ayr they all contradicted what the cane growers in Mackay were saying and what Canegrowers in Brisbane were saying. I do not want to bag that cane growers association, but I know that Harry Bonanno particularly has found himself in an absolutely invidious position because the government has put him in the situation where, instead of representing his growers, he has had to go along with the government, agree with the government and defend the government on something which is totally indefensible. I have a lot of respect for Harry Bonanno&mdash;he is a very genuine man&mdash;but he has been put in an impossible situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister referred to Ian Ballantyne's assertion that my numbers are wrong. Let me tell senators where the numbers come from. They come from figures supplied by ABARE. They come from figures supplied by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy in the hearing that we had and the evidence which they gave to that hearing. They came in further evidence to the inquiry during the hearing that we held in Brisbane. They came in a letter to me from the Australian Sugar Millers Council. All of them confirmed that the figures we have given about the average loss to cane farmers are correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other issue that Canegrowers in Mackay have raised is whether or not the survey was a good one. I would not mind if the cane growers associations conducted their own surveys. If they think the returns that I have been getting are wrong, let them conduct their own survey.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sugar industry were asked to review themselves by the former Goss and Labor Party governments. Involved in that review were people representing all parts of the industry. I will read them out: Mr Vaughan, who was the chairman&mdash;I think he was later replaced; Mr Bonanno; Mr Newton, who is in the box at the moment; Graham Davies, from the millers association; Robert Reilly, who was a member; Mr Gentile; and Mr Verri.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 21 November 1996 a unanimous report was put down which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are pleased to present the unanimously agreed report on the Sugar Industry Review Working Party 1996, signed off within the original timetable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report goes on and has on it the signature of Mr Verri, who represented the Australian Cane Farmers Association in the sugar working party. This was then followed by a press release on 18 December 1996. The press release&mdash;I think Senator Woodley has some misapprehension about incorporating this&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unique, Comprehensive and Achievable were some of the words used by the ACFA executive and Directors in describing the SIRWP Report . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Allison, General Manager ACFA, said that he believed the general industry would accept the Report as a unified, solid approach to the future direction of the industry. In doing so, he believes the report also reflects the maturity of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Allison said, "In digesting the report we should remain cognisant of the fact that this report is the result of a review that was carried out under instruction from Government and within the guidelines of National Competition Policy.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So he endorsed the report. But, further to that, Mr Verri, Mr Bonanno and the chairman at the time came down to the national parliament and had a meeting with all coalition senators and members of parliament who were interested in any way in the sugar industry. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9466"> Larry Anthony and Bob Katter were there; all of us were there. Mr Verri was there, too, representing the Australian Cane Farmers Association. They pointed out that, in the interest of the industry, they wanted us to support the removal of the tariff. I pointed out to them then that it was going to cause some problems. They said, `We've reviewed it ad nauseam. We've had&mdash;' to use the vernacular `&hyphen; a gutful of it. All we want to do is get it away. We want a unanimous report. Let's get back to the job.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But in charges Senator Woodley muddying the water. I can understand Senator Woodley's problem. With the desertion of his leader, he now finds himself going to an election with two per cent of the vote. Where is the biggest vote? It is with the cane farmers in Queensland. He sees an opportunity to go and stir up an industry. This industry is one of the best industries in Australia. It has increased the returns by 124 per cent and there is a 60 per cent increase in production. It is going like a German band it is doing so well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You come in and stir the whole thing up. No wonder I get excited. Here is an industry that is making money, doing well and really forging ahead. It cannot get another stick of cane through the mills it is going so well. It cannot take another stick of cane; it is in top production. You come in here, stir the industry up and send out&mdash;I say this with all due respect&mdash;a very silly survey. If I said to you, `Do you want a trip to New Zealand?' you would say, `Yes, I'd love a trip to New Zealand.' If I said, `Do you want to swim?' you would say, `No.' But you put out the part of the survey that says, `Do you want a trip to New Zealand?' You do not tell them anything else about the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These people have relied on the leadership in their industry to take them forward, and it has been one of the best industry leaderships. But you go down and pull the mat right out from under them, right out from under the second most successful primary industry in Australia, and you wonder why I get excited. It is because you stir them up and you do not tell them the truth.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Forshaw and Senator Woodley, if this government had not removed the tariff, which was a commitment going into the election, and said, `We're going to break our commitment,' I would have fought it tooth and nail; I would have crossed the floor against it. But that was not the case. The industry came to us. First, it said in the sugar industry review package, `Take the tariff off.' Secondly, the Australian Cane Farmers Association and the Queensland Canegrowers Council issued press releases saying, `Take it off.' Thirdly, they personally flew down to Canberra and said, `Take the tariff off us. We've reviewed it ad infinitum. Let's get it away. Let's get it so that we get a unanimous report. We're going into a 90 per cent export market. The rest of the countries in the world have reduced their tariffs. Next year 90 per cent of the product will be going out.' And then someone changes their mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say&mdash;and I exclude Senator Woodley from this, but I do not exclude the Labor Party; I think Senator Woodley is probably misguided&mdash;that the hypocrisy of the Labor Party has to be seen to be believed: to remove all tariffs on everything that moved in primary industry before anyone else had removed their tariffs, and then to come in here when you have done that and, thinking there are a few cheap votes to be gained in the sugar industry, do this. Even the press gallery are flabbergasted at your audacity to do this. If you think you are going to win votes like this and you think you are going to get back, you have no chance. The press will take the long handle to you on this one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you want a constituency, if you want to reconnect with your blue-collar workers, you are never going to get the cane farmers as long as you live. They will never vote for the Labor Party. They will never vote for you. They never have voted for you and, with what you are doing to the 10-point plan, they never will vote for you. After your decisions on Wik, they never will vote for you. Senator Woodley, with due respect to you, they think you are a nice old guy that goes around.

I have never heard anyone try to say that they were supporting, or try to prove that they were helping, an industry by reducing their income.

There are five of them&mdash;and almost certainly there will be six following the redistribution of electoral boundaries under way in Queensland&mdash;which could swing from the National Party to Labor. (In a couple of other Coalition&hyphen;held seats, sugar industry votes can be important.) They are especially vulnerable because the Coalition flagrantly broke a solemn and unequivocal election promise on the sugar industry. It promised not to lower the sugar tariff below the existing $55 a tonne. At that level, the policy said, Australia was already more than meeting its obligations under GATT. The National Party MPs and candidates in sugar seats all ran very hard on that promise. Now, not surprisingly, they are in trouble.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Howard, Anderson and their colleagues use the defence that the sugar industry in Queensland wanted the tariff to go.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a familiar sound; isn't it? That is exactly what Senator Boswell is telling the Senate today. Mr Oakes goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is simply untrue. The industry was mugged&mdash;told it had to choose between the tariff and a single&hyphen;desk marketing system. It decided that loss of the tariff was preferable to deregulation. Sugar industry representatives were also told that the government would be cutting car tariffs and that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9468"> they&mdash;like other rural producers&mdash;would benefit from that decision. Howard himself made the link with car tariffs the day he told the government party room that he had decided (without consulting backbenchers from sugar seats) that the sugar tariff had to go. When several Queensland Nationals remonstrated with him at the end of the meeting, he gave them a guarantee that the car tariff would go as well. That mollified them to some extent but, after the car industry decision last week, they would have searched in vain for evidence of policy consistency.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I can understand Senator Boswell being extremely embarrassed at the position he now finds himself in. The invitation remains for Senator Boswell and his National Party colleagues in the Senate to come and sit with us when we vote for our amendment and we divide and are sitting across there. Senator Sandy Macdonald can look after the interests of the sugar industry in northern New South Wales and join us as well. We will pass the request and send it back to the House of Representatives and the coalition party room can consider the matter again. You can debate the matter again on the basis that, if you were given a promise on the basis of consistency with the car industry, you certainly have a good argument to say that there is a justification to change it. There is. I have heard no argument to the contrary.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to add a couple of further comments to the remarks made by Senator O'Brien. It is a pity that Senator Boswell has not remained, but I can understand it. Apparently he was getting a bit worked up and wants to cool down. I want to refer to Mr Katter's evidence before the committee. He was asked by Senator Woodley:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Katter, in your submission there is the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Mr Borbidge made it abundantly clear to Mrs De&hyphen;anne Kelly, Federal Member for Dawson, that the abolition of the single desk selling mechanism is now no longer an option.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Woodley asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You go on to say that that really should have affected the way the working party sugar review made its decision and that if they had known that at the time they would not have agreed to lose the tariff.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will refer again in a moment to Mr Katter's further comments. The Senate inquiry took place after the release of the report of the working party. The working party was clearly under the impression&mdash;more than the impression, clearly under the thumb&mdash;that at the time the working party was considering its review of sugar industry issues, including the tariff and the single desk and so on, they had to make a choice between the single desk and the tariff. Indeed, the witnesses before our committee said, `Look, if we have to choose between one or the other, we will go with the single desk.' I am sure Senator Woodley and Senator O'Brien will remember that being said. They believed, as was said, that they had a gun at their heads on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That all occurred between October 1995 and when the working party did its work up until, as Senator Parer said, the report was released in November 1996. The Senate committee, which met in the last few months to look specifically at this issue and this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation, is the most up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date position you have.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What came out from Mr Katter's evidence was that people were under a misapprehension. They were under the thumb&mdash;they thought they had to make this choice between the tariff or the single desk. Further on in his evidence, Mr Katter said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the report of the working party, assurances were given by the Queensland government that the single desk was not at risk, that it would stay and that is something that the Australian Labor Party in Queensland is committed to, and that the coalition parties in Queensland are committed to, so whichever government was in power ultimately at any time in the state government in Queensland growers could be guaranteed the single desk would continue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Katter went on and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, the deregulation of the sugar industry is not on the table. There is no reason for us to make this decision because of that. That is not on the table unless the federal coalition, the federal opposition, the state coalition, the state opposition and the other political parties in Australia are all telling the most flagrant, outrageous lies. It is not on the table. So if it is not on the table, why the hell are we abolishing the tariff?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Woodley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So it really is not a choice between the single desk or the tariff, they are not alternatives?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Katter said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No, definitely not. That is not now the situation. However, and I have to say this because I went public at the time and backed the sugar review, I believe that they most certainly had that problem, the sugar review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot blame them for making this decision. If I had been there with Ron Verri and Harry Bonanno, I am pretty certain I would have done exactly what they did.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Woodley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So that is the gun at the head thing?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Katter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, definitely.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That makes it abundantly clear that, at the time, the cane farmers felt they were in that position as were their representatives. So, Senator Parer, they did come down with that recommendation, but you have to look at the circumstances that surrounded it. It is no response to stand up here and say, `Oh well, they had the review,' and because they had a review and, because they made the recom 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9470"> mendation, that gave you the out to change your policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is it that the coalition can say that they were able to change their policy because of the wishes of the working party, but when the growers come along later and say, `Hang on a minute; we actually believe that the original recommendation was wrong, and it was based upon a false premise,' how come they are not allowed to say their position has changed? If you, the government, say that you are entitled to change your position from a policy put before the last election, why don't you give the same right to the growers who came along to the Senate committee and said, `Hang on a minute, Parliament.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What you are relying upon in terms of their support for the working party is falsely based and is no longer the position, if it ever was. That is the real hypocrisy. You want the luxury of being able to say, as Senator Boswell said, that you changed your policy position because you were asked to. But when you were asked later on to stick with the original position because those people were misled in the first place, you said, `Sorry, fellas, it's too late. We'll hold you to your first recommendation but we will not allow you to rely upon the evidence you gave to the Senate committee.' This is not some Labor Party beat-up. This is what Mr Katter said and this is what other members of the National Party clearly also believe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the other point in all of this, to add weight to it, is that the position has changed. There has not just been a change in terms of the people coming to realise that they were forced into making a choice which they should not have had to make between the single desk selling system and tariffs, but also we should look at the evidence given by Mr Allison from the Australian Cane Farmers Association. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sugar tariff as it stood more than met Australia's obligations to the World Trade Organisation, another point we would like to make. However, the federal government policy in relation to the reduction and/or removal of tariffs appears to have shifted, and that is very obvious. That is borne out by recent decisions in relation to the motor vehicle industry, and the clothing and footwear and textile industry. The question has 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> been asked by our members: why should the sugar industry bite the bullet when any reciprocity it might have expected in relation to cost reductions in other industries will now obviously not be passed on owing to a shift in federal government policy?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a fair and legitimate question. Government, quite rightly&mdash;it had to be pushed before it reached the right decision with respect to the TCF and the vehicle industries&mdash;changed its position. If the members of the Liberal Party cannot bring themselves to it, at least members of the National Party may now have the courage to change their position on this issue and support our amendment to retain the tariff in the sugar industry.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since the issue of direct environmental costs is uncertain, I am seeking with this amendment to ensure that unforeseen costs will be minimal. I am attempting to do so by tying the commencement of this measure to the fulfilment of Commonwealth duties, which the government should be fulfilling anyway. I do not see this as an impossible request; I see this as an explicit assurance that the government will fulfil the duties that already exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my proposed subclause 5, I place the responsibility to report to the Senate where it belongs, which is in the hands of the Minister for the Environment whose duty is at least to protect our natural heritage, the diversity and integrity of the ecological system, for the people of Australia. The minister also has a duty to ensure that people are not endangered or affected badly by environmental pollution. I do not ask for an impossibility. The minister has certain responsibilities under Commonwealth law and under international agreements and I ask that there be sufficient regulatory and enforcement measures in place to ensure that these responsibilities can be met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once the minister reports to the Senate that this is in place, the sugar tariff section commences after 10 days, a period which allows 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9472"> some feedback and questions. That is a fairly rapid response. It is only a major delay if the government has not got such measures in place and must put them in place and, in that case, I would have to say any delay is appropriate and responsible to get the regulatory framework right. If it is not there, I guess you would wonder what the government was doing anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my proposed subclause 5(a), my request refers to the need to protect threatened or endangered species. There are a number of such species in Queensland, particularly in the rainforest and mangrove areas being cleared. The mahogany glider is one such species but there are a range of other species: the cassowary, the Proserpine rock wallaby, the Apollo jewel butterfly, the black&hyphen;necked stork, the eastern curlew and the cotton pygmy goose, as well as orchids and other plants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the issue is not just in regard to the direct clearing of habitat. Clearing of mangroves and wetlands releases acid from soils and these are often released in conjunction with other minerals disturbed. These react with aluminium and manganese and heavy metals such as cadmium. Both the acids and the metallic compounds get washed into the wetlands and offshore areas, killing aquatic, wetland and shoreland plants and seagrass, being concentrated up to 1,500 times in filter&hyphen;feeders and the gills of some fish and creating bioconcentrations of toxins&mdash;which we have seen or heard of in relation to red spot; basically the fish is almost rotting away in front of us&mdash;and the death of habitat and the direct poisoning of animals, including those up the food chain, such as the threatened dugong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be obvious to anyone who knows anything about nature or possesses even reasonable intelligence that, if habitat clearance is affecting rare and endangered species, it is affecting ordinary species as well. In fact, one of the greatest critics of the expansion and clearing in relation to the sugar industry infrastructure program, or the SIIP, has been the fishing industry and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Both recognise that the impact of the clearing is often devastating to fisheries. Fish spawning areas and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> coral reef ecologies are focused on the rare and endangered species because they are the ones the Commonwealth has powers to protect although it has powers in relation to some areas of great significance, such as the Great Barrier Reef. But it is important to understand that, while my amendment focuses on specific species and regions, a response adequate to protect them will have a marked effect in terms of protecting other more common species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) specifically look at protecting wetlands, fisheries and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park from sugar related clearing and sugar production. This is important since clearing results in the activation of potential acid soils into actual acid sulfate soils. While Canegrowers, the growers association, thinks clearing wetlands gets you into more trouble than it is worth and is opposed to the clearing of wetlands, the SIIP and Queensland government appear to be clearing in the interest of sugar expansion. While it may not be cleared for sugar, there does appear to be clearing of hundreds of hectares of coastal wetland in North Queensland for sugar infrastructure under the SII scheme. This particular scheme involves the diverting of the Murray River into the Tully River.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The complaints came in from all sectors after clearing of massive areas of protected habitat occurred last July. These included complaints from the head of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the director of the Australian Marine Conservation Society, who said the state government would:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . put one of Australia's best wetlands under threat for a proposal that doesn't even sound like good engineering.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I wonder if this is one of the reasons why the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority are under threat from the government at the moment&mdash;because they spoke up. It would create more problems for the sugar industry than it would solve. General manager of Canegrowers, Ian Ballantyne, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'd swear on a stack of bibles we are not involved and would not countenance clearance of wetlands. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9473">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Veitch, deputy chairman of Sunfish, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's like an atomic bomb going off. It's both economic and environmental vandalism. We're talking about ruining areas that are the breeding grounds for juvenile barramundi, mangrove jack and a whole range of (fish) species, not to mention species like the mahogany glider and the cassowary.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This particular bit of clearing happened two months after another outcry at state government plans to drain thousands of hectares of tropical wetlands between Cairns and Townsville to aid the sugar industry under the SIIP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dr McPhail, chair of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we're concerned about is that, in the development of sugar cane, the costs of the loss of habitat, and the recreational amenity, and the economic benefits through the fishing industry, appear not to have been taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He outlined again the dangers of the cumulative effect of land clearing on the Great Barrier Reef&mdash;on habitat; acid sulfate release, which was linked to massive fish kills; the depletion of fish nurseries; damage to seagrass beds, with effects on dugongs and turtles; and damage to commercial fishing grounds. Again, the Canegrowers representative said they did not know of the plans meant to benefit them and:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certainly wetlands are not favoured areas for going into as far as cane production goes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">My conclusion is that the state government is proceeding with clearing on the basis that big infrastructure projects are really good and that there is no need to consider either the environmental costs or the views of the industry that infrastructure is meant to serve. This is particularly why I think it will not matter whether there is a tariff or not in that respect or whether the sugar industry is doing well or badly. This is a state program with its own moment and objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although the damage and outrage were reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> in both instances I cited in relation to habitat clearing, and in other major papers at the time and on national network television, when asked by Senator Lees on 7 May, the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, responded on 17 June that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> he knew of no problems with the SIIPs, which are partially funded by the Commonwealth, and of no problems with the mahogany glider, although the Commonwealth funds a rescue package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paragraph (e) of my amendment ties the Commonwealth to fulfilling its responsibilities under the various international agreements, including the biodiversity convention, which protects species; the world conservation strategy, under which both species and representative habitats are to be preserved; the Ramsar convention, which is for the protection of wetlands and includes Bowling Green Bay in Queensland and the Ord and Lake Argyle areas in Western Australia; and the World Heritage Convention, under which the Great Barrier Reef is listed. All of these are currently being affected by sugar production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not saying this is the fault of cane growers. If they are honest&mdash;and it is difficult to maintain a lie in the public eye&mdash;then they actually do not support the environmental damage being done purportedly for their benefit. I accept that. The Commonwealth has a duty to ensure that such damage does not continue when it is clearly in the province of the Commonwealth and within Commonwealth powers to prevent or stop such damage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paragraph (f) of my request for an amendment would ensure that measures were in place to ensure that the outcome of this tariff elimination did not mean that growers were struggling and may be tempted or economically forced to use more exploitative practices in growing. Again, land care is a major issue, dealt with under the auspices of the Commonwealth. Rural adjustment schemes are also under effective Commonwealth control. One manifestation of the problem may be farming in areas which are marginal rather than rehabilitating or planting in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another manifestation is excessive water use in areas where ground water is used. The water table is sometimes drawn down to the extent that surrounding areas are affected. In coastal areas, it may be drawn down to the extent that saltwater incursions result and the ground water becomes tainted and brackish.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9474">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet another manifestation may be the attempt to use extra fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides rather than risk losing any production from more environmentally sound levels. Farmers will not use more than they think they need, especially where money is short. But they are uncertain about the effect on sugar yield of reduction of agrochemicals. They will also play it safe and use more rather than less if they are under pressure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In short, there are a number of pressing environmental problems in relation to the sugar industry. In spite of that, it is expanding in Queensland and there are proposals for expansion in Western Australia along the Ord and Fitzroy rivers. The federal government does have powers to protect the environment and so can act in at least some of these cases. My amendment asks it to assure the Senate that it is acting, that it is checking for compliance with any reasonable conditions and frameworks it is setting and that it has the ability and will to control breaches. I do not think this is unreasonable. It is asking the government to do what it should be doing in any case. I commend my amendment to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to endorse this amendment. It is quite tough. It would create extraordinarily onerous conditions for the government, only because the application of environmental rigour is not something that has ever been part of the national government's agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implementation of the biodiversity convention, the World Heritage Convention and the Ramsar convention to protect wetlands, for example, ought to be a thing that is automatic. Instead of that, the continued expansion of cane fields in Queensland&mdash;and potentially from the Ord&mdash;involves the filling of wetlands, the loss of mangroves, the loss of streamside reserves and the process of pushing towards extinction rare and endangered species, many of which are not well known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reiterate that just two years ago I was in the area of Ayr and Home Hill and was distressed to see broadacre clearing of land where rare and endangered orchids and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> butterflies were. There was no investigation, no setting aside of habitat and no protection that could be seen as scientifically or socially responsible. There is a lot to be put in order as far as the industry's expansion is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already given the committee the figure of some 400,000 hectares of land cleared over the last five years. There is the potential for that sort of awesome rate to continue into the future. The industry has been helped along by a quite sizeable injection of Commonwealth assistance through irrigation schemes. Without that, much of the expansion could not proceed. As I said yesterday, the time to discuss the environment has to be when bills like this Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) come before us. They are essentially about such matters as tariffs and the ability of the industry to progress and expand domestically as well as in overseas markets. There is an ineluctable tie between the expansion of an industry like this and the regression of environment. That is what is occurring at a rapid rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The implementation of do&hyphen;it&hyphen;if&hyphen;you&hyphen;will guidelines does not work. It requires government regulation if the national heritage and all that goes with that is to be protected. The magnificence of the diverse ecosystems of much of the eastern coastline of Queensland, for example, is in tatters, due to rapid expansion not just of sugarcane but of a whole variety of modern interests. To protect what is left of those ecosystems and to protect the national interest requires at least as much effort in terms of legislation as is being put into recognising the benefits that can flow to the sugar industry from good regulation. One requires government action; so ought the other. What Senator Margetts is presenting to the Senate here is an effort to say, `Let us look at the environmental side of the good health of this industry and, therefore, at the good interests of local communities and at the national concern for the deteriorating national estate in this country.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was last speaking in the second reading debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R345">Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997</XREF>  I was interrupted by question time, and I note I have four minutes to go before I get interrupted again. So I will try to compound my remarks and finish before we hit matters of public interest, which I am sure will be a matter of great regret to everyone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Previously, I was saying that one of the main thrusts of this bill is to reduce the stigma attached to the sole parent pension. I indicated the Australian Democrats' broad support for that and our concern at the very large stigma that repeatedly was being heaped on welfare recipients around the nation through the media by what can only be described as an overblown and inaccurate series of articles, over a protracted period, which implied that there was a very large problem of fraud and cheating out there involving many hundreds of thousands of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe it is important that that myth be dispelled. We ask the government, if they are serious about reducing the stigma attached to welfare recipients, to speak out a bit more strongly against some of those misleading media reports rather than, as it appears from time to time, fuel them. I simply make that plea to the Minister for Social 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Security (Senator Newman) in relation to that issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Certainly, when the peak welfare body in this country, the Australian Council of Social Service, dared to suggest that the overpayment figures were being dishonestly presented, it got a fairly heavy bagging from the minister for its troubles. The minister reportedly said that ACOSS was putting its head in the sand in saying that there were no people cheating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to put it on the record that the Democrats, as well as ACOSS, I am sure, are not claiming that there is no cheating. None of us supports people who commit deliberate fraud on our welfare system. However, the Democrats are saying that there needs to be an honest representation of the level of fraud that is being committed and reports that have been pumped out in the media over recent months are not an accurate and honest representation of the level of fraud. The reasons for overpayments are numerous, but the important point is that the overwhelming majority are not the result of deliberate actions taken by people who are intent on defrauding the Commonwealth. I suggest that most are due to honest mistakes under an extremely complicated system. Again, I use that to reaffirm the Democrats' support for moves that reduce the complication of our social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats will be moving a number of amendments in the committee stage on a few issues, and I will speak to those at that time rather than go on about them now. I certainly hope that the bill before us goes some way towards reducing the social stigma that may be attached to sole parents and that it leads in some way to reducing the complexity of the welfare system, although I am not convinced that it achieves that aim. I look forward to the minister taking proactive steps to address any similar stigma that attaches to other social security recipients in general.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 November this year, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee handed down its report on the constitutionality of the Native Title Amendment Bill. Throughout its hearings and afterwards, certain elements in the media were engaged in a shameless misrepresentation of the facts. This was done either deliberately or through gross ignorance. Unfortunately, I think it may have been the former.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I raise these misrepresentations is threefold: firstly, to set the record straight; secondly, and, more importantly, to try to disabuse the minds of those representatives of the media who might actually believe what they have written or broadcast; and, thirdly, to request that those involved in the media stop and think of the harm they are doing by adding to the divisiveness of the debate by making the comments that they are making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In seeking to set the record straight, I am fortified in the knowledge that one's standing as a parliamentarian, low though it may be corporately, is still well ahead of media representatives whom I wish to take to task today. The committee was requested by the Senate to look at the constitutionality of the Native Title Amendment Bill, a proper course of action and a very timely one, given that it appears every taxi driver and parish priest has become a constitutional expert overnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was very fortunate to hear from many legal experts, in particular, Dr Gavan Griffith QC, who has been involved in approximately 200 constitutional cases. He happens to be of the view that the legislation is constitutional. As Dr Griffith advised, on one occasion he was in the High Court with 16 counsel against him but he still went on to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> win the day. It is not a question of the quantity of the legal advice but the quality of the legal advice that ought be checked up on and that will ultimately determine the issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The quality of Dr Griffith's advice is recognised by all, I would suggest even by his opponents. Dr Griffith QC was in good company: David Bennett QC, the then President of the New South Wales Bar Association, along with Dennis Rose QC. How were these eminent legal opinions reported in the media? We had stories such as this one that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NSW Bar Association, requested by the Federal Government to give evidence&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">of course it wasn't; it was the committee that requested them to give evidence, not the federal government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">on its Wik legislation, has advised that it is unconstitutional, further undermining the Government's claims to pastoralists that its 10-Point Plan would create certainty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Further on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  reported:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee chairman, Senator Eric Abetz, Liberal, asked for submissions from the Bar Association and the Government's former chief general counsel, Mr Dennis Rose, QC, now with Blake Dawson Waldron.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bar Association president, Mr David Bennett, QC, and Mr Rose advised that the legislation probably was unconstitutional.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As soon as Mr Bennett gave his evidence, he opened up his comments to the committee by saying that that report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>  was incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I spoke to Mr Dennis Rose QC, who agreed that I put on record&mdash;and I did so on page 326 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that he did not agree with the way that his views had been presented in the media. Mr Dennis Rose QC and Mr David Bennett QC were of the view that the legislation was constitutionally valid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my own home newspaper the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> said that it was argued by all but two of the legal opinions sought by the committee. Clearly that was wrong. There was Dr Gavan Griffith QC, Mr Jackson QC, Mr Bennett QC and Mr Rose QC. That is at least four. Where did the journalists get this misinformation 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9478"> from? By regurgitating the Labor Party press release that was put out on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concern is that the public have got a raft of misinformation courtesy of Labor press releases in relation to this committee inquiry. But I believe there are certain journalists who have taken a particular view of this legislation and have written all these stories accordingly, irrespective of the facts. But worse was still to come.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the committee handed down its report, I issued a media release entitled `Native Title Amendment Bill&mdash;Constitutional', in big bold type face on top of the media release. But all the stories in the media the very next day were that we as a committee had found that the legislation was unconstitutional. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> were at it again. They put more spin on the report than Shane Warne could muster on his best day. For the record, let me read the conclusions of the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is of the view that, on balance, the High Court would find that the Bill is constitutionally valid.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Nothing I submit could be clearer. In relation to just terms compensation, we stated that we thought it may be of benefit for the minister to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . review the relevant provisions . . . to confirm that the legislation meets the constitutional requirement for the acquisition of property on just terms.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would have thought that was pretty simple, pretty precise and pretty clear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what galls me is that this misinformation just kept on being put out that somehow this report did not support the constitutionality of the legislation. Then what happens? We hear this myth being reported on the John Laws program. I am not a listener to the John Laws program, I hasten to add, but when it was reported to my office I rang the producer of his show. I said, `I happen to be the chairman of this committee. This is not what the committee found. What made John Laws say that on his program this morning?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Guess where they got it from? By reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. It tells a very sorry tale about the media&mdash;that they feed off each other&mdash;and the authority for that misinformation being spread to literally 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> hundreds of thousands of Australians was the misinformation in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. There was no research, no consideration and no reading of the report&mdash;just a simple regurgitation of an article in a newspaper became the authority for John Laws to announce to his hundreds of thousands of listeners that this report did something different from what it actually did. Unfortunately, the disinformation spreads.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CALVERT" NAMEID="5F4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did they correct it?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="N26">Senator ABETZ</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it was not corrected. Although they kindly did take my number, they never rang back to allow me to correct the issue on air. Some might say that I am somewhat overcritical of the media in relation to this event but, unfortunately, I have seen it in relation to native title in virtually every single aspect. But today I am limiting my comments to the Senate report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What am I supposed to make of a journalist who deliberately misquotes the report in trying to put questions to me? I refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Today</EMPHASIS> program where I was asked a number of questions by Catherine Job, and the transcript makes very interesting reading. Catherine Job said to me, `But you've recommended that amendments be made.' There was not a single suggestion for an amendment in our report. I answered, `No, we haven't made any suggestions for any amendments.' Why would she put that to me?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She then goes on to ask, `So what does this mean&mdash;' and purports to quote the report when she says, `The committee recommends that these possible deficiencies are not only fundamental flaws, but may be easily remedied by amending the bill.' What does the report actually say? Page 43 of the report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the view that these possible deficiencies are not&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I stress `not'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">fundamental flaws but may be easily remedied by amending the Bill&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">All we were doing was saying that some people had come forward with this particular view that it was not a fundamental flaw and we suggest the minister might have a look at 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9479"> those opinions.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> But there was a deliberate misquote when she asserted on the program:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So what does this mean: `The committee recommends that these possible deficiencies are not only fundamental flaws, but may be easily remedied by amending the Bill'?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was a complete misquote of the report and, unfortunately, the thousands of Australians listening to that program would have thought that she was quoting correctly and that I was back&hyphen;pedalling. The truth is she was not quoting the report; she was misquoting the report; and I believe she did a great injustice to the profession of journalism within this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 November last year the new National Party of Australia headquarters were opened in Canberra. The three storey building, named Sir John McEwen House, was opened by Sir John's widow Mary. The National Party moved in. It was on the move. It was in government. It had a new building and the future looked bright. A year later, nearly to the day, the National Party announced that it would virtually close down its national secretariat. The five Canberra based staff were given notice to quit by the end of the year. There were rumours that the new building may have to be sold. As you would expect, they have been denied. The National Party's federal Treasurer and former member for Gwydir, Mr Ralph Hunt, blamed the depression in Canberra for the National Party's financial crisis, the same crisis that Senator Ian Campbell in a speech in Western Australia described as a `fantastic achievement', a statement that his office told the media at 10.30 a.m. on Monday he stood by. A few hours later the Senate was informed that he had issued an apology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apology notwithstanding, the Howard government has waged war on Canberra with 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9480"> devastating effect. It has cut thousands of jobs from the public sector. Those job losses have affected every small business in the national capital. It has brought this economy to its knees. In doing so, it has plunged its coalition partner into a financial crisis less than two years after winning government, a financial crisis from which recovery will be difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the problem for the National Party is not only in Canberra. The level of financial support for the party in the bush has also waned. The problems in rural Australia, like Canberra, are of the National Party's own making. In opposition, the Deputy Leader of the National Party and then shadow minister for primary industries and energy, Mr Anderson, issued a promise a day. He said that the Howard government would give a clear direction to restore profitability and maximise trade opportunities for rural Australia. The future was one of extraordinary opportunity and excitement, he boasted. A Liberal-National Party government would provide and maintain the necessary impetus to ensure that that opportunity was realised. The promises from Mr Anderson and his optimism about what he could deliver in government displayed all the features of the John McEwen House venture&mdash;a grand opening, promising all things to all people, but delivery?&mdash;nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of the restructure of the Australian Wheat Board, at Grains Week `96 the minister outlined his plans for the grains industry. He said that three fundamental principles should guide the process. They were self-reliance, grower ownership and control of marketing, and fully commercial marketing. He was, in fact, progressing a policy initiative of the former government and the industry. In April of 1997, Mr Anderson announced a new commercial venture for wheat marketing. He said that on 1 July 1999 the Australian Wheat Board would be replaced by a grower owned company:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will place ownership and control of marketing in the hands of the growers so the industry can control its own future.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The enabling legislation for the first stage of this process has just passed the Senate. The Labor Party sought to have the bill delayed, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not necessarily because it was flawed, but because we wanted to see the details of the whole Australian Wheat Board restructuring package. We thought it appropriate that the parliament knew exactly what it was signing up to. We did not want to pass the first tranche of legislation and take the rest of the package on faith. After all, we are talking about a fundamental restructuring of a multi-billion dollar export industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A very large section of the industry agreed with this approach. The New South Wales Farmers Association was concerned about the future of grower control&mdash;one of the minister's three principles&mdash;if the model was progressed. Their concerns were ignored. They wanted an answer on how the government planned to tax the Wheat Industry Fund. They were told that an answer would be forthcoming. The Western Australian Farmers also wanted the taxation issue clarified before the process went any further. These two states account for 75 per cent of the nation's export wheat production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Grain Industry Task Force also raised concerns. But Mr Anderson ignored them. Instead, with the aid of the Democrats, who chose to support the President of the Queensland Grain Growers Association rather than the rest of the country, Mr Anderson forced the bill through. Bad luck for the growers in Western Australia and bad luck for the growers in New South Wales. If their concerns about how the model might finally impact on grower control are realised, bad luck for wheat growers generally, because that is apparently the government's position on this matter. We are now told by the government that the taxation regime to apply to the new structure will not be known until some time next year. The government has its legislation through, so the industry can wait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we come to the question of the AQIS charges. Last April Mr Anderson rightly identified the Australian meat industry as a sector crucial to our economic and social well-being. It generates $4 billion a year in export earnings and provides thousands of jobs, mainly in rural and regional areas. He also identified AQIS inspection charges as a significant component of meat processing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9481"> costs. In the 1996 budget there was a subsidy to help meet the costs of AQIS inspection charges for the meat export sector. Again, Mr Anderson was following the approach of the former government by keeping inspection charges for the export sector at a reasonable level while the AQIS reform program was progressed. But in the last budget he was comprehensively done over in the Expenditure Review Committee of cabinet. Thanks to the Liberal dries, out went the subsidy and up went industry charges. In some cases, they jumped by 300 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response of the processors was predictable. They would cover the increased the government charges through lower prices to producers. Gone was the process of progressive reform of the meat inspection service, and with it the progressive introduction of cost recovery to the industry. The government decided that the industry would not only have to meet the cost of its own restructuring but also pay directly for the costs of restructuring AQIS. As with Mr Anderson's approach to the Wheat Board restructure, the government had determined a course and the industry would have to wear it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industry surveyed its members and found both anger and economic difficulty. As I said earlier, some companies faced increases of up to 300 per cent. The minister then responded by attacking the industry, but he was eventually forced to back down because he had no choice. The cost increases he sought to impose on an industry recovering from very difficult market conditions would have been blocked in the Senate with the full support of every cattle producer and meat processor in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what of the beef industry? In May last year the minister announced early action to reform the meat industry. In fact, he was just progressing another Labor reform. Some 18 months later we are told that the reforms of the meat industry, earmarked for early action, are being developed. We were told by a senior departmental officer at the recent estimates hearings that no formal structures have been put in place yet `because of the need to develop structures'. We were told that the amount of funding required to progress 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the new arrangements, given high priority for early action last May, that is May of 1996, will depend on the agreements reached as to what companies will actually do. It seems that we are not even to first base on this matter. So much for the minister's commitment to maintaining the impetus for reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What of the pig industry? In June 1995 the minister gave a rousing speech in parliament in support of the pig industry. He identified two key issues: the question of effective labelling of product must be fixed, and anti-dumping arrangements had to be improved. He described Australia's labelling laws as totally inadequate. He said that Labor's handling of the issue was a disgrace. He said that he would fix it, that it would be given priority on his reform agenda. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what has happened on anti-dumping laws? Nothing. What has happened on country-of-origin food labelling? Nothing. All this minister has done for the pig industry since March last year is approve more imports and threaten to kill off export opportunities by ramping up export inspection charges. He did not even get the risk assessment process for these applications right. The public health risk assessment for imported cooked Canadian pig meat at the request of the pig producers was reviewed by the food science division of the CSIRO and found to be inadequate. The industry's concerns about aspects of that assessment remain unanswered to this day, despite the minister approving the application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nor did the assessment take into account a new disease found in the Canadian pigs, that is, post&hyphen;weaning multi-systemic wasting syndrome. AQIS officers were asked whether they could give an assurance that the protocols approved for Canadian pig meat would provide adequate protection against this disease. They said that no such assurance could be given because not enough was known about the disease. AQIS say they think it is okay but are not prepared to suspend protocol to make sure. Clearly, the minister is happy to take the risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then there is the very important issue of Ovine Johnes disease in the Australian sheep flock. While Ovine Johnes is having its greatest impact in New South Wales and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9482"> Victoria, its eradication is a national problem that requires a national solution. The minister's response is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a question of the state government and their various instrumentalities as well as industry agreeing to a national approach.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Later he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a watertight case with national agreement is a prerequisite to me being able to reasonably put this before the Commonwealth government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This disease is causing great hardship to many farmers and the minister is walking away from the issue. He says he is not interested in helping unless all the states and all industry come to him with a unified position. He did not apply that test to wheat. He simply ignored the views of the vast majority of growers. He did not apply the test to AQIS charges. This time he ignored the whole industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I wish to comment on the minister's centrepiece&mdash;`Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia', or the integrated rural policy package. This package is little more than a rebadging of the suite of rural programs developed by the former government. There is little new money&mdash;the NFF estimated only about $30 million a year. The key initiative in the package, the three year moratorium of gifting provisions, was exposed as almost impossible to qualify for. According to the Department of Social Security, only 600 people out of the 10,000 expected to apply will qualify.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the new Sir John McEwen House, this minister promised much but has delivered little. Is it any wonder rural Australians are as disillusioned with the Howard government as their city cousins? I remind the Senate that this is the minister who went to the last election pledging to revive the heartland. Given his appalling track record, it is little wonder that many people in the bush are asking one simple question: where is the resuscitator?</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9482"><TITLE>National Party of Australia

In fact, I think Senator Conroy will probably just go down as an interjection in the political history of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I rose to speak of today was, in fact, a matter of quite significant importance and some controversy in the wider community&mdash;and that is the assistance which this government is providing, and which has been supported by the opposition, to ensure that the economies of some of our major trading partners are kept in good order. Principally, we are talking about Thailand and Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are some outrageous suggestions going around Australia, both in the bush and in the cities, for example&mdash;Senator Conroy will be aware of these&mdash;claims such as, if we can `give' $1.4 billion to Indonesia, why cannot we `give' money to this cause or that cause, such as the aged, or whatever? The truth is that we are not `giving' any money in this case to anybody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators opposite, such as Senator McKiernan, will well know that I have been very critical of foreign aid and I remain sceptical about much foreign aid. I am very concerned when we give money away to multilateral organisations because I do not really believe we necessarily get value for money back. Also, I believe that often the money does not go to the people who need it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is not a gift of money. Let me make it very clear while we are on broadcast today, so that people out there understand 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> exactly what the government is doing. Principally, in the cases of Thailand and Indonesia, we are involved in a currency swap. What is a currency swap? Basically, we take some of our reserves, being either Australian dollar reserves or US dollar reserves, and we convert them into the local currency. For example, in the case of Indonesia, we take money from the Reserve Bank, we convert it into rupiah and we have a hedge&mdash;that is, a right to convert the money back into Australian dollars at a future date at a set rate. So there is no risk to the Reserve Bank of the currency deteriorating and the Reserve Bank losing out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, as I have said, we convert it at a set rate. What does that do? It ensures that the value of the rupiah is maintained at a high level; in other words, that the value of the rupiah does not tumble any further. Why is that important?Let me explain why that is important. If the rupiah tumbles, then the Indonesians will be less able to afford the things we sell them and, importantly, they are more likely to be competitors in our own domestic market with the things that they produce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know about the dangers of import penetration; we all know about the dangers of imports coming in, attacking our backyard. I do not think that point needs to be stressed any further. If the rupiah goes down, it makes it more possible for the Indonesians to come in and steal our own backyard. We do not want that. Everybody is agreed on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But why is it important to keep the rupiah high so that we can sell them the things that we produce? From my state's point of view, it is very simple: without this package, we will write some $&half; billion&mdash;that is, $500 million&mdash;off the exports of the state of Queensland in the next year. Queensland, more than any other state, stands to lose if we cannot continue to trade with Indonesia on the current basis. Let me give the Senate and those who are listening some simple figures to show why this is the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year we exported from Australia $213 million of live cattle, most of which came from North Queensland and the Northern Territory&mdash;$213 million of live cattle. We also exported $42 million of beef, on top of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9484"> that $213 million of live cattle. All of that beef, I understand, came from Queensland. So I am talking of $42 million of beef, and the lion's share of $213 million of live cattle. But that is just the tip of the iceberg.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Additional to that, we exported $300 million of cotton, most of which came from southern Queensland and northern New South Wales; $132 million of alumina, which has principally come from Gladstone in Queensland; $94 million of copper, which has principally come either from Broken Hill or, I understand, mainly from Mount Isa and Townsville. So you can see just there, before you even take into consideration the impact of other things&mdash;for example, the estimated $&half; billion of wheat from all around Australia&mdash;that, if we cannot ensure that the Indonesians can continue to afford to buy the sorts of things that we produce, Queensland and Queenslanders will be the losers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This package is as much about assisting Australians and Australian jobs as it is about assisting Indonesia. That is why the opposition has supported it. I congratulate the opposition, and I appreciate its bipartisan support on these things. Everybody or nearly everybody in this parliament understands that if we cannot sell the things that we produce there will be no jobs for Australians, there will be no jobs for Queenslanders and there will be no future for primary industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people who oppose this package are people who are saying to us and to the Australian population, `We oppose exports; we oppose selling other people things to ensure that we keep getting money flowing through to Australia.' That is what opposition to this package is about; it is about opposing Australian exports and opposing Australian jobs. That is all that those who oppose the package will achieve. They will achieve economic destruction here and they will not do a damned thing for the people over in Indonesia. It will not do them any good and it will not do us any good. But I suppose that is their short-sighted vision of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fact that, in primary industry on the whole, Australia produces five times more than it can eat&mdash;five times more than it can consume. So, if we say that we are just going 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to turn our back on the world, if we say we are going to pretend that the rest of the world does not exist, we are going to have a major problem. We will be producing five times the amount of food that we can eat&mdash;and nobody else is going to be buying it off us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Is that an intelligent way to deal with this country's economy? Is that an intelligent way to deliver real hope and real opportunity for people who live outside the capital cities, be they the farmers, the meat workers, the shearers, or whatever&mdash;the people of regional and rural Australia? What hope do they have if their prices are cruelled? How many farm families will be forced off the land, how many meat workers will lose their jobs, because some people in this parliament have decided that they want to turn their backs on the world?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we say that we will only bother about feeding ourselves and not worry about the opportunities overseas, this nation will be an economic ruin. Every Australian primary producer will tell you that we need those export dollars, we need those export opportunities and we need to maintain our share of those markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you this: leaving morality aside, if we do not participate in this bailout package, there are other countries that will&mdash;and the countries that will participate in the bailout package are our competitors. They will do it for one simple reason. They will step up to the plate and say, `We'll help you, even though Australia won't, because we're your real friends.' When the economic situation in Thailand recovers, and when the economic situation in Indonesia recovers, as they will, will these countries want to buy from us then&mdash;or will they say, with justification, `You're not our real friends; you're our fair-weather friends'? That is what they will say, and they will be primed to say that by our trade competitors who will be part of the bailout package when we are not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what is at stake when we talk about the bailout of Thailand and Indonesia. We are not giving these countries money. We are not frittering away the taxpayers' dollar. And we are not obsessed with the wellbeing of people overseas at the expense of Australians. In fact, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9485"> this bailout package protects the taxpayers' dollar by ensuring that primary industries that are currently paying tax because they make a profit will continue to make a profit and will continue to pay tax in the future. It protects all Australians by protecting those primary industries. It protects the tax revenue of this country. It protects jobs. It protects export markets.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not rise with a brief from Margo Kingston of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, Catherine Job from the ABC or, indeed, John Laws. I do not believe I have spoken to any of those individuals at all this year. Senator Abetz's intervention here today was another desperate attempt, being made on behalf of the government, to get the government off the hook on that piece of racist legislation, the Native Title Amendment Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know in this place that the government and certain members of the government&mdash;including very high ranking members of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9486"> government&mdash;have attacked the churches and senior figures within the churches in this country for commenting on the contents of the bill. We know that other individuals&mdash;again, at very senior levels of the government&mdash;have attacked the Governor-General of this nation for having had the audacity to make comments about the directions in which he thought this bill was going. Again, the leaders of Australia's Aboriginal people have been attacked by government representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen that even a commercial enterprise, the Body Shop, has been attacked because they had the audacity to put on sale some black, red and yellow ribbons and armbands. There was a call from one member of the other place that indeed that enterprise ought to be boycotted because they had the nerve to sell these colours in Australia&mdash;the colours of Australia's Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Abetz took exception to the reporting on the hearings of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee when they were looking at the constitutional aspects of the Native Title Amendment Bill. I suppose it is a problem that besets all of us in public life, that from time to time we do not get our words reprinted true to form. I had seen some of the reports at the time and they did not cause me any great difficulty as a member of the committee. I had sat through the two hearings of the committee and was interested in the reports and how other people interpreted the evidence that was given to the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important that there is an interpretation given of evidence to the committee, and that interpretation comes to light in the content of the report of the committee. The government members of the committee put one interpretation on the evidence that was given and put emphasis on that interpretation, whilst the opposition members of the committee put a different emphasis on different aspects of the report. We went to great lengths, in the minority report that is attached to the main report, to put emphasis on the differences that we saw in the evidence that was taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I proceed, I might take the opportunity to compliment the excellent staff of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Committee, probably one of the busiest committee secretariats in this parliament, for the wonderful job that they have yet again done on this report. I pay particular tribute to Neil Bessell, the secretary of the committee, who is leaving the committee very shortly. He has not been sacked because we got one meeting notice wrong, he has actually been promoted, and a well deserved promotion it is too. Perhaps we might have an opportunity to say some more about that next week.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Being worn out is a problem, and we do have to give very serious attention to the work of the committees, particularly the work of this committee. They have had an enormous work load to undertake during this year. I am very pleased to see that we have fulfilled the vast majority of it, and one long awaited report will, hopefully, be presented to this place next week. But that is a different subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to return to the content of the majority report. It was, as I thought at the time, a very unusual majority report. Normally when a bill is referred to the committee a majority report will come forward, and this was the case in the time of the previous government, when I was a member of this committee as well. Usually there would be only one recommendation, that the bill be passed. On this occasion, the committee has not recommended that the bill be passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I thought it was unusual at the time. I think it is even more unusual now when the committee chair gets up and seeks to defend a report and attempts in his way to put a particular spin on the recommendations that are contained in the report. He did quote from part of it. But let me deal with each of the conclusions in turn as we go through. There are not many. Conclusion No. 1 in chapter 2 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key phrase threading throughout the evidence to the Committee on the Bill is that `the only certainty in constitutional law is uncertainty'. The Committee accepts this view.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a very strange conclusion, but one can understand it in the context of the debate that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9487"> the committee had been engaged in. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also accepts the view that it is for the Government of the day to develop the policies by which it will govern and accordingly to introduce bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee acknowledges that eminent counsel have provided evidence that it is arguable that the High Court would interpret the scope of the races power as limited to authorising only beneficial legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is of the view that, on balance, the High Court would find the Bill is constitutionally valid.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They have come to a conclusion that they think, on balance&mdash;not as a direct conclusion but only on balance&mdash;that the bill would be found to be valid. They do agree that the only certainty is uncertainty. I move on to conclusions and recommendation in chapter 3:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">only notes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the considered opinion of a number of expert witnesses that specific provisions of the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 may not comply with section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution, relating to the power of the Commonwealth to acquire property on just terms.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the view that these possible deficiencies are not fundamental flaws but may be easily remedied by amending the Bill or by amending the legislation to the extent necessary to take account of any relevant High Court decisions.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is an admission in the committee's conclusions that there is a problem with the bill in the form that it was before the committee. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the Special Minister for State, Senator the Hon Nick Minchin, review the relevant provisions in the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 to confirm that the legislation meets the constitutional requirement for the acquisition of property on just terms.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is hardly a ringing endorsement from the committee of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The final conclusion the committee comes to is in chapter 4. I will quote it in full for the record. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the views presented that the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 may not be supported by the external affairs power because it is racially discriminatory or because it removes protections 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for native title holders considered to be special measures.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It has noted those very important arguments that were put to the committee. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the contrary advice of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet that the Government's view is that the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 complies with the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 and, more particularly, international obligations arising under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the Government's view is that the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 falls within the races power under section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution and therefore issues relating to the external affairs power are not likely to affect the constitutional validity of the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is a very strange conclusion here, and it is the first time I have come across it in my membership of this and other committees. The committee has not reached that conclusion itself. The committee and government members of the committee have not put their reputations on the line by saying, `Yes, we agree with the government view.' They have held themselves back from that and have said, `We note that the government's view is this, and we recognise that the evidence given by the government's own people to the inquiry is this,' but they do not go on and put their own reputations on the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a particular journalist wants to pick up a report such as this and look at the membership of the committee&mdash;and the journalists that I have mentioned before are all experienced journalists, two of whom operate out of the gallery in this building and the other one from Sydney&mdash;they would know the messages that are contained in a report such as this. And, if a particular spin has been put on the story, one has got to compliment the expertise of the individual journalists who do go out and examine the work of parliamentary committees. Indeed, there was a great deal of focus from the media on this committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we met in public session on the night of 23 October, we had before us the Solicitor&hyphen;General of the Commonwealth, Dr Gavan Griffith QC, who was mentioned in Senator Abetz's contribution here this afternoon. Gavan Griffith is held in high esteem by those 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9488"> on this side of the chamber as well as by those on the other side of the chamber. He is a very eminent Australian, probably one of the most experienced constitutional lawyers in this country, and certainly he did stand in the High Court with an array of eminent QCs up against him in one particular case. But let us see how much faith Dr Gavan Griffith, the Solicitor&hyphen;General, had in his own opinion before the committee. I want to give just two short quotes and then I will sit down. He admitted that competent counsel had reached conclusions different from his own, and then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why ask me for an opinion? My opinion is not worth anything. You are going to get it from the court. That is the one that matters.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Later, the Solicitor&hyphen;General repeated his claim when he said, and I will only quote this in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not think my opinion counts for anything in this debate because it is an issue set to be determined by the High Court, and I doubt very much whether any of the other opinions can take the matter any further.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is somewhat self&hyphen;deprecating on behalf of the Solicitor&hyphen;General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Can I speak on behalf of my colleagues, although I have not checked it with the representatives of the minority parties, to put on the record our gratitude to all of those people&mdash;there are quite a few, so I will not get through the names&mdash;who gave their evidence to the committee and assisted us collectively in forming the advice that we have in turn given to the parliament within this report. I think that the debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 is now much more informed than it was prior to the reference of that bill to the committee and the hearing of the evidence given by those individuals to the committee.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9488"><TITLE>Centenary House</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I would not, Senator McKiernan. Like yours, my family came from a different part of the globe&mdash;a few generations before yours, I suspect&mdash;and one of the places the Campbell family actually settled in was the area which is now known as Canberra. In fact, members of my clan built some of Canberra's most appreciated and best buildings long before the founding fathers in their wisdom chose this site as the place for the national capital. The Campbell family chose this site, a long time before the founding fathers chose it, as a good place to run pastoral leases, and two of those pastoral leases are now quite famous in Australian history. One, of course, was Duntroon. The Campbell family set that up and built it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other probably even more famous one is Yarralumla. I found out recently from the Governor&hyphen;General that it was indeed Frederick Campbell who built that magnificent property, which, after many years operating as a very successful pastoral operation, was reclaimed by the Commonwealth, though not in fact to make a Governor&hyphen;General's residence. There is an interesting piece of history here. It was reclaimed because the clay on the property could be used to create the bricks that would be needed to build the many buildings that have since been built in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that was not the purpose of this speech. It was to talk about another building in Canberra, built many generations after the Campbells had their pastoral lease compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth&mdash;on just terms. It made Frederick Campbell a very wealthy man. He did indeed have that property compulsorily acquired in about the 1920s on just terms. The building that I would like to refer to is Centenary House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators who have been around this place know that a couple of years ago I did take a very close interest in the leasing deal at Centenary House. Unlike the situation at John McEwen House, the Australian Labor Party secured themselves a very blue chip tenant in a federal government office, the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9489"> Australian National Audit Office. The Labor Party secured them at the time on what remain the most generous lease terms in Australian history. The lease terms, just to remind honourable senators and anyone else who happens to be listening or following this debate, were that it would be for a term of 15 years. A 15&hyphen;year lease was virtually unprecedented at the time and is almost unsurpassed at any time since, in either government leases or commercial leases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most outstanding point about that lease was that the Australian Labor Party, the landlord, was to receive a nine per cent annual rental increase regardless of market conditions. There was a royal commission into this deal to report things factually. The royal commissioner found the terms of the lease just and not at all unusual. I disputed that at the hearings of the royal commission and I have disputed it subsequently. I said to the royal commission and to the government of the time that they should have an independent panel of valuers make an assessment of the lease. The royal commission did not do that. It had one valuer from Adelaide, whom I am sure is a highly professional gentleman, but I think they should have had an independent panel of valuers assessing the terms of this lease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said at the royal commission and I have said on a number of occasions subsequently that this lease was an unfair and unconscionable contract that really should be renegotiated. I said that as time passed by and the rent increased by nine per cent every year it would become very obvious to any observer&mdash;it was very obvious to me at the time&mdash;that the rent, the deal and the contract were unfair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is particularly unfair to Australian taxpayers. It is worth noting that the rent to the Australian Labor Party from the Australian taxpayer gets reviewed on 23 September each year. The rent was renewed eight weeks ago. I report to the Senate&mdash;I think it is important taxpayers know this&mdash;that the net rent, that is, excluding outgoings, has just risen to the amount, this year, of $580 per square metre. I can put that in context for people who want to know what a fantastic deal the Australian 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Labor Party is getting from the Australian taxpayer. The average rent around Barton, which is where Centenary House is located, is of the order of $230 a square metre. So the Australian Labor Party is receiving a per annum bonus of the order of $350 per square metre from the Australian taxpayer.</PARA>

Not only have they already got to more than double Canberra rents but they are also on a par with the greatest office buildings in Australia's greatest central business district, the city of Sydney.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to Senator Herron, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. As minister responsible for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, do you support the proposal of your colleague Mr Entsch for churchgoers to boycott attendance at churches in protest at the views of certain religious leaders on your native title legislation? Do you support Senator Abetz's alternative proposal for people to stop donating to their churches?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of any proposal from Senator Abetz, but I certainly am aware of Mr Entsch's proposal. I am on the public record as taking the opposite view. I think as many people as possible should go to church&mdash;for two reasons, the first reason being if you want to get a message to your pastor it is better to go to church and talk to him or her. So I think it is a much better tack in fact to go along to church. For that reason they should attend more frequently.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the tragedies in recent times has been the lack of trust in the churches as a whole. I would advocate that as many people as possible go to church so that they can, on 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9492"> the one hand, get that form of communication&mdash;particularly Mr Entsch, who has said that he goes on only a few occasions; for deaths, marriages, et cetera. I have talked to him about it, Senator Mackay would be pleased to know. It is not that I am revealing anything that is of a private nature. I have said to him that I thought that he should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason that I think people should go to church is that, if ever there was a time that we should be advocating reconciliation, now is the time. I have written to the World Council of Churches commending them for their day of prayer in relation to reconciliation. I think that is a positive thing to do. This debate has been brought to a stage where there is a need for prayer, because beaten up by Senator Mackay's party is this racist attitude that is occurring. The determination of saying that there is racism and that it is a racist debate has not come from the ministers or any on the government side. Senator Mackay would have heard nothing from this side that any of this debate is of a racist nature.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We keep hearing from Senator Mackay's party that this is a racist debate and that racism is rampant. I hear that from only one side and I hear from certain spokesmen that we are racist scum. If ever there is a racist remark, that is one. I would advocate that people who use those phrases should go to church, should pray for reconciliation, because it will not occur without that attention to that particular detail.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Resources and Energy. Will the minister explain the impact of the right to negotiate on resource exploration, development and jobs for all Australians?  </PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="9492" SPEAKER="Parer, Sen Warwick" NAMEID="KI4" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Resources and Energy" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There appears to be a fundamental misunderstanding, or perhaps I should say deliberate misinformation, regarding the minerals industry's willingness to negotiate with native title holders. In practice, mining companies always have sought and will always seek to reach a negotiated settlement with any holder of valid title over which exploration or mining titles are sought. In the vast majority of cases, those negotiations reach an amicable conclusion, whether the title holder be Aboriginal, pastoralist or freeholder.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A good example is the Chevron pipeline agreement signed yesterday and the Century Zinc agreement. Senators will recall that in relation to the Century Zinc agreement the Aboriginal community finished up with exactly the same compensation package as was freely offered when it was thought that native title did not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been complemented by a growing awareness by Aborigines of the positive aspects of mineral exploration and the development of Aboriginal communities, including economic independence and the conservation and development of Aboriginal culture. Many of these agreements are models for recon 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9493"> ciliation and positive developments of the nation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bolkus interjects. I want to know, Senator Bolkus, whether you support the remarks about one of the most respected men in this country, Sir Arvi Parbo, from your own state, by Mr Pearson when he called him capitalist slime. Do you support that? It is nonsense what Noel Pearson said yesterday, `That under the 10-point plan companies don't have to deal with Aborigines, therefore they won't.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a fundamental difference between being forced to negotiate with a claimant, particularly where dubious multiple competing claims exist, and negotiating with a land owner with defined rights, with an efficient arbitrated compensation system available should negotiations break down, as is the case already with holders of statutory title. That is why we need a system which provides legal certainty to freely negotiate agreements, which has a threshold test, which limits the rights to negotiate to claimants who are likely to have their claims upheld&mdash;that is, valid title&mdash;and which incorporates a timely, fair and efficient arbitration process where agreement cannot be reached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accounting firm Coopers and Lybrand have estimated that current native title legislation results in a reduction of some 28 per cent in the value of a mining project affected by the legislation. This is equivalent to a reduction in value of $30 billion. The major costs are significant time delays; higher costs for debt, equity and management time; and the delay or even loss of many real jobs, good permanent jobs in remote areas, particularly for indigenous Australians. Only a small proportion of the cost is offset by gains to native title holders. This is the native title legacy which Labor left us&mdash;a legacy of confusion, delay and enormous cost of lost opportunities; a legacy which has failed to deliver to the Aboriginal community the benefits of native title; a legacy of which the Labor Party should be thoroughly ashamed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McKiernan for the question. It is obvious to me that the Senate questioners do not talk to the House of Representatives questioners, because this question was asked at least 48 hours ago in the House of Representatives, if not last week. Don't they talk to each other? I know of the factional problems. The putative member for Gellibrand is concerned. I know that factional problems exist. But, Madam President, you would think that the two chambers would talk to each other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before Senator Faulkner gets up and says, `This is not relevant to the question,' I am happy to provide the answer. The minister said in the other chamber&mdash;I am happy to get the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>; the attendant will get the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to give you the answer by the minister&mdash;that he has been detailing the policy for some time. I suspect Senator McKiernan has brought this up today because there is a report in the papers today that three out of every four new nursing home residents will pay a maximum charge of $4,380 a year. Senator McKiernan, I am sorry to put the record straight.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel sorry because he does not understand the question he has just asked. He has been given a question that he does not understand; so I feel sorry for him. More than one out of every four places nationally, 27 per cent, are set aside for concessional residents&mdash;those who have assets less than $22,500. They cannot be asked to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9494"> pay any accommodation charge at all. So 27 per cent do not pay anything at all. The concessional resident quota is a minimum requirement only. So, in practice, hostels operated by the charitable sector have taken a higher proportion of disadvantaged residents. The critical point is that the $12 per day, $4,380 per annum, contribution is the maximum that a person can be asked to pay by a nursing home provider. The decision as to how much to charge is made by the provider, not by the government. It may well be the case that three out of four persons could be eligible to contribute a payment, but it does not mean that they will be asked to pay the maximum amount.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is also critical is that this reasonable contribution will be used to upgrade the nursing homes, neglected and positively run down by the Labor Party when they were in power. This would not be necessary if they had not neglected it for the 13 years they were in government. We have taken an attitude that we are going to do something about it. The Leader of the Opposition, when finance minister, cut capital funds to nursing homes. Labor's recently found concern for the elderly and nursing homes is once again a charade. It is just another example of Labor saying whatever it takes to look like a party that cares. Labor is in no way the solution to the present problems that exist in nursing homes. They are coming up with this charade of an argument. We have a solution. We are injecting funds. We are asking people to pay for nursing home care according to their capacity. There are 27 per cent who will not be asked to pay anything at all.</PARA></ANSWER>

He will be in Kyoto, as he says, representing the workers. We think we represent the workers, but we welcome his contribution. He said that he will be making sure that the needs of Australian working class people and particularly Australian jobs and incomes are addressed. There is nothing unreasonable in that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In areas where we provide world's best practice in energy efficiency, it is important that we continue to have the opportunity for that sector of the economy to thrive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which I direct to the Minister representing the Treasurer, relates to the IMF rescue packages which have recently given a framework of support through the International Monetary Agreements Bill 1997. How much money has the IMF asked Australia to contribute in various rescue packages in South-East Asia? As participants in the agreement, are we obliged to make the requested loans? Under what conditions could we ask to be excused? Can the IMF ask for more than $1.5 billion per rescue package and under what conditions can we refuse?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Margetts for the question. As she has indicated, Australia has agreed to participate in the IMF&hyphen;sponsored international finance package for Thailand by way of a currency swap arrangement between the Reserve Bank and the Bank of Thailand. Australia's contribution to Thailand is firmly linked to the IMF program. Disbursements under the Reserve Bank swap are conditional upon the Thai authorities meeting the IMF conditions. For Thailand, Australia has agreed to contribute up to $US1 billion. Australia has agreed to provide up to $US1 billion to Indonesia in the form of supplementary financing which would remain conditional on adherence to the IMF program. Australia's assistance would only be drawn down after recourse to IMF financing and would be repaid once the program has ended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been some discussion about a package for Korea.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's willingness to provide assistance to countries in the region is in Australia's interests because this support should help, first of all, address the instability in regional finance markets and maintain growth in the region, which is important to us as purchasers of our exports contribute to the growth of this country and to employment.

What action has been taken by the government to improve the provision of social security, including better service to social security recipients, the simplification of payments and the superbly successful launch of Centrelink?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Macdonald, for a question which is very important to Australians. This government has put in place a number of initiatives to improve the delivery of social security to Australians. It has been widely supported as well. We have put in place better service delivery through Centrelink&mdash;and I thank you for your congratulations on that because many people are now writing to say how much they value the introduction of Centrelink and the changes that that has brought about already. We have introduced simplified payments and we have improved compliance. The better customer service&mdash;the creation of Centrelink as a one&hyphen;stop shop for a range of services&mdash;means that information on all services is under the one roof. Employment registration and income support application are now in the one place, and that is a great help to those who are on unemployment benefits or who have become unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting that, in its platform, Labor says that people will be treated with courtesy, respect and understanding by the people who administer the social security system&mdash;if they ever get back into government. But the interesting thing is that they did not do that while they were in government. We inherited a system which was not focused on the customer, and the introduction of Centrelink has changed already much of the culture. It puts the customer at the core of its service delivery and people are valuing that. The staff themselves like it too.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition government has also substantially improved the teleservice system. After all, that was a matter of enormous frustration for Australians trying to do business with the Department of Social Security, because the Labor government introduced a system that was underresourced. We have put the resources in. People can now get through to Centrelink over the telephone much more easily than they could in the past. It still needs improving, but we have new and upgraded call centres in regional centres and we will have had a thousand new call centre jobs created by Christmas this year, all around regional Australia in particular.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor also says, in its platform, that the social security system should be flexible, and simple and easy to understand and administer. They introduced and gradually developed the most complex, difficult system that anybody would have a job to try and work their way around, whether as a customer or as a member of the Department of Social Security. It is our government, the coalition government, that has moved to make it simpler with the introduction of a parenting payment, the introduction of the youth allowance and the removal of inconsistencies in the treatment of people in similar circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor said it wants to encourage and support people to return to the work force, but it was Labor who opposed the jobseeker diary to help jobseekers meet the requirements of the activity test by recording details of their job search efforts. Labor had to be dragged kicking and screaming to sensible reform of penalties for activity test breaches. So much for their commitment to encouraging people to enter or re&hyphen;enter the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor talks about positive incentives to encourage people to take up work, education and training. This is the same Labor Party that was intending to oppose work for the dole. It is the same Labor Party which wanted to deny young Australians the opportunity to gain skills and to be part of their community. It is the same Labor Party that has been misleading young Australians about the effect of the youth allowance, which provides education and training incentives for young Australians and removes the disincentive

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the 13 years of the Labor government they did nothing about literacy and numeracy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To praise God&mdash;I think we ought to remember that as legislators in this Senate. According to first catechism principles, which most of us learnt at a very early age at Sunday School, what is the chief purpose for which man is created?  The chief purpose for which man is made is to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever. For those who are conversant with the Old Testament, in the Book of Ecclesiastes chapter 12, verse 13 says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man. For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every hidden thing, whether it is good or evil.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is not surprising in this divisive environment that people are looking increasingly to the churches. The problem for the churches is how do they respond? Some to the near north believe, in some cases, that the churches have let them down. There are others who believe that those who are oppressed, depressed or disadvantaged need the church's support.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer to a letter from Bishop, the Right Reverend George Browning. He actually congratulates the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship on a successful year and a successful parliamentary prayer breakfast. He raises the interesting point about whether the Christian voice should be restricted to matters of private piety or private morality. While these issues are important, the Gospel&mdash;as Senator Woodley knows&mdash;reaches out to the wider community, and perhaps to those who are in greatest need, and the underprivileged, the marginalised and those who perceive themselves to be powerless.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is, indeed, a difficult position for the churches, as to their response. As my colleague Senator Abetz said, they do have a right to speak out on issues. But, of course, as always, people view opportunities, deprivation and compensation from different perspectives depending on their location, their environment and the position in which they see themselves to be disadvantaged either by the law or through being persecuted in some way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again I agree with the Right Reverend George Browning when he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I find it is extremely unfortunate that some members of parliament are vilifying church leaders for speaking on matters of deep spiritual conviction.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And I would think that the church will continue to speak out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Both the government and the churches actually recognise the importance for reconciliation, which should be the core of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is unfortunate that the current community debate has been more about myths and misunderstandings about the bill than about its actual provisions and, as such, we have an issue of great difficulty and divisiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also refer to our distinguished Governor&hyphen;General; a man of great religious conviction, steeped in the law and with a great compassion for the poor and the depressed. Sometimes the authority of leaders such as the Governor&hyphen;General is narrowed by the scope of authority, be that persuasive with a nominated appointee, or legalistic though an election to office. If Australia is to have a 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9509"> Governor&hyphen;General who is elected rather than appointed, the question is would his voice be more considered by the whole community in terms of responses to his concerns about the poor and the needy? I ask you all to think very seriously about that in terms of the decisions that a lot of us are likely to make on the future constitutional head of state for this country. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that Senator Abetz raised the issue of Reverend Gordon Moyes. Reverend Gordon Moyes was wrong in what he said about the Uniting Church Assembly, he was wrong in his shameful attack on the Reverend Dr Dorothy McRae&hyphen;McMahon and he was wrong because he had to restore the funding which he threatened to remove. He discovered that within the church what he was saying was wrong and in fact his parish has restored that funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the letter from Bishop Browning, I do admit that Senator Watson certainly read a lot more of the sense of that letter than Senator Abetz did. It very clearly was saying the church has a right, a very clear right, to speak on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the answer that Senator Herron gave to Senator Mackay's question he said that he told Warren Entsch that people should go to church to talk to their pastors. It would be a good idea if Warren Entsch went to church to listen to his pastor, because I am afraid he is not a very good listener.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of people not donating money to the churches, I would like to point out to Senator Abetz that not only would that remove money that the churches spend on Aborigines but it would also remove money which the churches spend, which amounts to millions of dollars, every year in maintaining rural ministries to the very pastoralists that this government says it supports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Uniting Church, just to give an example of one church, through its Frontier Services, which is the successor to the Australian Inland Mission, which established the Royal Flying Doctor Service&mdash;I remind senators that the churches established that service&mdash;provides services to families, to aged care, to education, to student hostels, to patrol 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ministries, to counselling, to hospitals, to health care&mdash;all in remote and rural areas. Does Senator Abetz really believe that people should stop donating to the churches and remove those services from pastoralists? That is the implication of what he has said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron also commended the National Council of Churches in Australia, who had called for prayer for reconciliation. Certainly prayer is important, but he omitted to point out that, in that same press release in which the National Council of Churches called for prayer because it believes it is important, it also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Council's Executive also called on the federal parliament, in amending the Native Title Act, "to ensure equal protection for the rights of all Australians and, in particular, to refrain from treating the rights of native title holders in a discriminatory way".</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, the National Council of Churches was saying two things&mdash;not one but two: first, you should pray; secondly, you should always speak the prophetic word to the contemporary society of the day. Often, unfortunately, people think all churches should do is pray and they forget the example of the whole of scripture in which the prophetic word by the Old Testament prophets and by Jesus himself was spoken to the contemporary society of the day. Always those two things must go together.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to repeat something I said last night, because this whole issue of attacking church leaders is very common but it has been going on for years. Former Premier of Queensland Joh Bjelke-Petersen was good at it. He used to call me and many other clergy `radicals' and `communists'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I am trying to say, in spite of Senator Collins's interjections, is that it is not all the churches and we 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> must not condemn the churches per se because two recalcitrants, whose scant knowledge is based on ignorance, have something to say. That word is very familiar to those opposite because they did have an alleged leader at one stage that used that very same word. I am not backward in using that word because they shrink from it, but it is one that is based on ignorance and it is based on the politics of division&mdash;something that we should not do.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is not what this is about.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bob Collins has the perception that anyone associated with the land, as I am, has&mdash;if I can quote him&mdash;`money coming out of their ears'. That is not true. People associated with the land have enormous problems these days. Pastoralists in particular have gargantuan problems. To say that we cannot speak out against churchmen is something quite extraordinary. Jesus in his day spoke out about churchmen. Senator Woodley, who is now gone and not interested in the debate, should know this. He made a bit of a contribution. He is going to copy it from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and send it out to some of his select people in Queensland. Jesus spoke out about his church leaders.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That there be laid on the table by the Special Minister of State (Senator Minchin), before the adjournment of the Senate on 27 November 1997, copies of all legal advice received by the Government relating to whether or not the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 complies with Australia's international legal obligations and/or is consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act 1975.</PARA></PROCTEXT>
<SPEECH PAGE="9514" TIME="3.47 p.m." SPEAKER="Tambling, Sen Grant" NAMEID="6E4" ELECTORATE="NT" PARTY="CLP" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME><STATE> (Northern Territory&mdash;</STATE><ROLE>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(3.47 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In consideration of the notice of motion to produce and to table legal advice in relation to the NTAB and the compliance with the Racial Discrimination Act or Australia's international obligations, the government has clearly received extensive advice in the preparation of its policy response to the Wik decision. While the government neither confirms nor denies whether it has received any specific advice on whether the Native Title Amendment Bill complies with the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 or Australia's obligations, the government, as has previously been made clear by the Special Minister for State (Senator Minchin), has ensured that our bill takes account of the principles of the RDA. The content of any legal advice which has been incorporated into the government's policy, as reflected in the bill currently before the Senate, is therefore irrelevant to the forthcoming Senate debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, nonetheless, will be opposing this motion in accordance with established principle. The general position is clear. Legal advice provided to the government is subject to legal professional privilege. The Senate is well aware of the position taken by successive governments&mdash;whether ALP or coalition&mdash;that the Senate has no power to demand the tabling of documents which attract either public interest immunity or legal professional privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, it is interesting to note the views previously expressed by Senator Bolkus on the tabling of legal advice in relation to the Carmen Lawrence matter when he was sitting on the government benches. After not tabling documents, which included legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department, Senator Bolkus supported this position by stating:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These documents clearly fall within the accepted boundaries of legal professional privilege and public interest immunity. The Senate has traditionally recognised these claims.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The next day Senator Bolkus went further in referring to the return to order passed by the Senate as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is why your return to order motion is at best vacuous and at worst blatant hypocrisy. It is a disregard of the accepted principles of practice in this place. It is a disregard of the accepted principles of government. You know that but, despite knowing it, you come in here with a wish list that you know any responsible government cannot meet.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The now Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) has also commented on the need to respect legal professional privilege. On 28 August 1995, Mr Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government simply does not make available government documents which fall within accepted boundaries of legal professional privilege and public interest immunity to the Senate. We certainly will not be doing that to a Senate committee. Nor is it the practice or has it been the practice over the years for any government to make available legal advice from its legal advisers made in the course of the normal decision making process of government, for good practical reasons associated with good government and also as a matter of fundamental principle.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The then Senator Evans went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we are not prepared, as I have already indicated, to make available legal advice prepared in the ordinary course for the purpose of the development of government policy or the making of specific government decisions. The confidential relationship between the government's legal advisers is an essential part of the business of government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The claim of legal professional privilege as a basis for not tabling material in the Senate has been used by governments of all persuasions. Other recent examples include Senator Sherry in his then capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy on 1 March 1995 in response to a motion for documents associated with the grant of woodchipping licences. Similarly, the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, on 23 May 1996 also refused to provide legal advice on the basis that it was subject to legal professional privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senators will all be aware that successive governments have refused to table legal advice on the basis that it is protected by 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9515"> legal professional privilege. As has previously been acknowledged by the Australian Labor Party, the availability of this privilege is an essential element of good government. The government therefore does not accept that it can be compelled to provide any such advice, if it exists, as referred to in the motion. Consequently, the government opposes the motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Senator Tambling has come up with a list of quotes. It is fair to say, for people who have been in this place for some time, that for every one quote he can find from our side, we can probably get 10 from your side arguing that, despite professional privilege, the Senate does have a power to try to pursue the matter. All of us would acknowledge that, in many circumstances, governments of whatever persuasion have actually made legal advice available. We say that, in this particular instance, it is important to get that legal advice. That legal advice is not irrelevant to the debate that is going on in this place about the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> , because that advice goes very much to the heart of many of the concerns about the Native Title Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are involved in one of the most important debates that the Senate will see for quite some time. The basis of that debate is whether the government has the capacity to use the races power of the constitution to implement its legislation. There has been a lot of concern about that. Organisations such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the Australian Law Reform Commission and, today, the International Commission of Jurists, as well as the minority report of the Senate legal committee have all claimed that the government does not have adequate power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of claims have been made also about the discriminatory nature of the government's legislation, and that is something that the advice that we are seeking through this return to order motion today goes very much to. I could talk for a long time on this but, as I said, I will not speak for too long. We are concerned that when the Senate proceeds with the debate, it has before it the relevant advice. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It is fair to say that the overwhelming body of advice from outside government makes the assertion that the legislation is discriminatory and has a racist edge to it, and also is in breach of our international legal obligations. We in this place have to be concerned about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In terms of the government advice, you have advice from the Solicitor&hyphen;General, Mr Gavan Griffith, who with respect to the constitutionality based on the races power says two things. Essentially, he says, `I don't think my opinion counts for anything in this debate because it is an issue set to be determined by the High Court and I doubt very much whether any of the other opinions can take the matter any further.' That was, in essence, the bottom line or tenor of his advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other senior adviser to government is Mr Henry Burmester, the Chief General Counsel. The opposition has information that on 25 July this year he provided very clear advice to government indicating that, in his view, in a number of instances the legislation proposed by the government could be in breach not just of the Racial Discrimination Act but also of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to be concerned about honesty. Honesty is important in this. In this respect, the debate in this place should proceed in a manner not like the manner in which it has been pursued over recent days in the media by people such as Mr Entsch, Senator Lightfoot and Mr Marek. To get it right, that advice is necessary; that is why we have moved this motion today.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have not had the opportunity to look at this report of the Procedure Committee. I will be interested to do so when it is available. This matter has been before the Senate on a number of occasions. I must accept some responsibility for that. The committee has reported on the requirement for senators to stand in their seats when entering a debate or when making a vote when they have a pecuniary 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9517"> interest which is affected by the matter before the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, on a number of occasions I have raised the issue of six or eight senators who have shares in woodchip companies and the need for them to declare those shares before voting on procedural matters which advantage the woodchip companies and which could have an advantage to either the share prices or the profitability of those companies, which then flows on to the senators involved. It is a good practice and a very important one. In this day and age it is very important that members do declare their business interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The requirement to make such a declaration came after quite a long debate. The declaration of pecuniary interest was introduced in the Senate in 1994. It was a Labor government move and it had support from the then coalition opposition. So why has opposition now arisen to the implementation of this very wise move? It is because there has been a call for it to actually be honoured. It is because on a number of occasions I and one or two others have said senators ought to declare their interests in a matter before the Senate, and we have had this extraordinary situation where that has upset some senators. It should not have done so. It should be a clear and easy matter for people to observe. It is a clear principle and it ought to be one with which nobody has any difficulty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Earlier this year, the matter was referred back to the declarations on interest committee and it found that nothing should change. The committee looked at it, at the request of senators, and found that the declaration provision should remain. I quote from the report of the chair, Senator Denman, to the Senate on 20 March in which she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In such matters it may be best to err on the side of caution and make declarations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, giving advice to us. She then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not a contempt of the Senate to have a conflict of interest. It could be a serious contempt to fail to declare one.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So there it is&mdash;this provision does not say you cannot speak or you cannot vote if you have got an interest in the matter. It simply says you should declare it. I cannot go along with the idea that the requirement for declaring 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> such an interest should be abolished. I am concerned that there is a concerted effort to achieve that end.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The matter went to the Procedure Committee, and we have its report today. I have not been able to get the results of that report, but let me say that I will take an interest in this; I want to be able to speak on it again. I want to assure the Senate that the Greens stand solidly in defence of retaining the requirement that all of us declare a pecuniary interest when we are speaking or voting on a matter which involves such an interest. We are totally opposed to any move to abolish or water down such a requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a matter that had bipartisan support at the outset. In fact, it was the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, who, while in opposition, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We actually support disclosure, and that is why one of our foreshadowed amendments specifically requires senators in debate to disclose interests that might amount to a conflict of interest, and to disclose on a vote in this place.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Pointing to his amendment, the one that created this provision in our standing orders, Senator Hill said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My fifth amendment is the one that I mentioned a little while ago, specifically requiring senators to make declarations at the beginning of a speech and also after a division. I understand, from what the minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the then Labor minister&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">told me yesterday, the government will support that, and I am pleased it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has come to the party on that and recognises that it is important.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The problem is that when someone comes along and says, `Let us implement this requirement for disclosure,' the move is on to abolish it. It is a very peculiar situation, to say the least, and I hope that both the government and the opposition, which were strong in support of this measure of exemplary accountability just three years ago, are going to remain in support of it now.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second report of 1997 of the Procedure Committee, of which we are taking note, also has a recommendation that there be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9518"> no change to standing order No. 50. Standing order No. 50 provides for the President of the Senate to open each parliamentary day with a public prayer to God for guidance, with the Lord's Prayer to follow. Senator Brown proposed that the public prayer to God be abolished. I am very pleased to see that the Procedure Committee has recommended against that motion. At this time of all times, we need the guidance of God and that is what standing order No. 50 has us doing, and I would like to express briefly my response to the attempt by Senator Brown to remove public prayer from this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The leaders of all nations must recognise that they do not have the power to rule absolutely. Failure to acknowledge this actually leads to human rights violations. Great minds formed in the Judaeo&hyphen;Christian ethic largely influence the terms of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, whose 50th anniversary we celebrate on 10 December next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prayer for Guidance and the Lord's Prayer, publicly recited by the President on behalf of senators, is a humble, public acknowledgment that parliament itself is subject to a higher law; that unjust and immoral laws are unjust and immoral, even if correct procedures are followed. The Our Father is as close to a universal prayer as exists in human culture. All religions accept the existence of a guiding, benevolent influence in human affairs if only we hand control of our destiny to the Creator. Given our heritage and history, it is entirely appropriate that we symbolise this in the public recital of the Our Father. The preamble to the Australian constitution itself also declares our intention of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . humbly relying on the blessing of the almighty God . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">To be secular is one thing; to seek to deliberately and publicly expunge recited prayer in the Senate is quite another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The acknowledgment of the Divine is deeply embedded in our culture. To whom do our civic leaders publicly turn at times of crisis or national mourning? Look at what happened after the Port Arthur massacre. To whom did we turn, publicly? We turned to God. I recall hearing from a Salvation Army 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> chaplain who was consoling those affected by the massacre down at Port Arthur. He said that one person came running down and angrily thumped his, the Salvation Army officer's, chest and said, `Where is your God now? Look at what has happened. Isn't he supposed to be in control?' The Salvation Army officer said to him, `Have you given control of your life to God?'  Half an hour later, that man&mdash;a strong, strapping fellow&mdash;came back and burst into tears. He recognised how much things would be better if only we gave control to the Creator.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Society loses coherence if the foundation upon which our society is based&mdash;fairness, justice and human dignity&mdash;is rejected. If democracy is about the harmonious arrangement of the civil order, the better to achieve a more humane society, then best we publicly appeal to the one who endowed each member of the human family with an inherent dignity. What comes next? Do we change the weekend because Sunday is a Christian holy day? Do we create consequentialism day for Christmas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased that the procedure committee recommended against changing standing order 50. Standing order 50 does have the Prayer for Guidance. Perhaps there needs to be a minor change in words in there and in the Lord's Prayer, because the Prayer for Guidance says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Almighty God, we humbly beseech Thee to vouchsafe Thy special blessing upon this Parliament, and that Thou wouldst be pleased to direct and prosper the work of Thy servants to the advancement of Thy glory, and to the true welfare of the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">`Vouchsafe' is not commonly used and I would have thought a word such as `grant' would do equally as well. The Lord's Prayer starts with:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our father, which art in Heaven, Hallowed by thy name.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would have thought that `who' might be more appropriate there. I foreshadow that, at some future time, I will be moving to have the word `grant' for `vouchsafe' and the word `who' for `which'. If anybody else has any suggestions I would be grateful to receive 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9519"> them. I do appreciate the work of the procedure committee in upholding standing order 50.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One thing I would like to say, because we are taking up the time of the Senate now, is that, had the government not been so curmudgeonly as to deny me leave, this matter would have been finished by now. It occurs to me, as the person who moved the motion, that it is a motion we ought to get considerable opportunity to discuss. It is not a motion to abolish prayers but a motion to abolish the current form of prayers and replace it at the start of each day with a modern, up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date invitation to people, so that they are able to either pray or reflect on their duties to Australia&mdash;to the states and territories which they represent and to future generations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the biggest issue on our agenda. It never will be. But my fellow Tasmanian, Senator Harradine, has just foreshadowed a move to change two words in the current prayer, and I will support his opportunity to do that. So I think that after this move to not allow me to speak on the matter now, my move to have it debated before the end of the year is a reasonable one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a matter that has attracted some public attention. It has been discussed by the churches. There has been criticism from Catholic bishops, for example. However, there has been quite strong and positive feedback,

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has consular sharing arrangements with Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are some constraints on consular sharing, notably the imbalance in consular capacity of the four partner countries. There are also indications that host officials in some countries will not co&hyphen;operate with some forms of consular service sharing. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) needs to ensure that any arrangements we enter are balanced and do not result in Australia assuming an unbalanced workload on behalf of a consular sharing partner.

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honorary Consuls significantly increase Australia's representational network overseas. Our experience is that Honorary Consuls play a useful role in promoting Australia's interests into areas which are either not served or not easily served by fully accredited High Commissions or Embassies. Currently, Australia has 30 honorary consuls and the Prime Minister recently announced the establishment of a further six Honorary Consuls in Indonesia, namely, Ambon, Balikpapan, Kupang, Medan, Surabaya and Ujung Pandang. This is a firm recognition of the importance to Australia of the relationship with Indonesia. Arrangements are also under way to establish a further eleven honorary consulates in Bratislava, Christchurch, Copenhagen, Guatemala City, Durban, Karachi, Kingston, Luanda, Maputo, Panama City and Skopje and more may be established in the very near future.

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFAT agrees that it could use its locally engaged staff (LES) more effectively by enabling them, in appropriate circumstances, to perform notarial acts. This would deliver cost efficiencies and relieve Australia&hyphen;based officers, from what is essentially routine work, to concentrate on higher priority functions. Notarial acts form a large part of the consular functions performed by Australian posts overseas (over 32,000 were performed in 1996/97) and are becoming an unsustainable burden on Australia&hyphen;based officers at our overseas posts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, domestic and international law precludes LES from performing notarial acts. As a first step towards implementing this recommendation, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Consular Fees Act 1955</EMPHASIS>  has been amended to provide for  the appointment of LES for the purposes of charging prescribed fees.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to ensure that the Government can effectively discharge its fundamental responsibility to prevent the entry and stay in Australia of non-citizens who have a criminal background or have criminal associations. In considering this bill, we must remember that the vast majority of non-citizens who come to Australia are in fact law-abiding people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a world of rapidly increasing people movements, our immigration arrangements must be designed to streamline the entry and stay of all genuine visitors, students, business people and permanent residents. However, a small proportion of non-citizens seeking to enter Australia do have substantial criminal backgrounds or criminal associations. Others commit crimes while they are in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Steps to improve the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs' ability to detect visa applicants with substantial criminal backgrounds or associations are being taken including consultation with law enforcement bodies overseas. For these steps to be effective, however, they must be complemented by legislative provisions to ensure that non-citizens with criminal backgrounds or criminal associations can be refused a visa. The provisions must also enable the Government to remove those non-citizens who are detained following convictions for crimes committed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Experience over recent years has shown that the existing legislative provisions are inadequate for this task. This is despite the fact that they were amended as recently as 1992 with the express purpose of improving the Government's ability to deal with visa applicants and visa holders with a substantial criminal background. In broad terms, the bill seeks to enhance the Government's ability to deal with non-citizens who are not of good character in three ways:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Firstly, decision&hyphen;making in routine cases will be improved by:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> deeming that certain levels of criminal sentences will lead to an automatic finding that the non-citizen concerned is not of good character; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">-<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> allowing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to give binding directions to decision&hyphen;makers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Secondly, in exceptional or emergency circumstances, the Minister, acting personally, will be given powers to act decisively on matters of visa refusal, cancellation and the removal of non-citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Thirdly, information provided by Australian and international law enforcement agencies will be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9531"> afforded more effective protection so that such agencies can be confident about passing information to immigration decision&hyphen;makers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now describe the major provisions of the bill in more detail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The character test</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed in this bill introduce the concept of a character test. Under this test, the onus will be on visa applicants and visa holders to satisfy decision&hyphen;makers that they can pass the test. This will redress a significant deficiency in the legislation arising from the changes made in 1992. Since that time, decision&hyphen;makers have been required to establish that a person is not of good character before they could refuse a visa to an applicant or cancel a visa. This has meant that, whenever there has been doubt about the criminal background or criminal associations of a non-citizen, the doubt has been resolved in the non-citizen's favour. I understand that this was not the intention of the 1992 amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill then takes us back to the situation that existed before 1992 by placing the onus of proof on the visa applicant to demonstrate that he or she is of good character. This means that where there are real doubts about the criminal background or criminal associations of a visa applicant or visa holder, the objective of protecting the Australian community will take precedence in immigration decision&hyphen;making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Deeming provisions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also seeks to establish clear benchmarks for criminal behaviour that would automatically lead to a non-citizen failing the character test. Non-citizens who have been convicted to a single sentence of detention of 12 months or more, or where the length of several sentences aggregates to two years or more, will fail the character test. This will truncate the character assessment process and cover most non-citizens of character concern who come to notice. This will provide more certainty as to who is able to pass the character test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Binding directions on exercise of the discretion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once it is established that a visa applicant or visa holder does not pass the character test, decision&hyphen;makers will have to decide whether to refuse the application or to cancel the visa. Exercise of this discretion will need to take into account a wide range of factors including: the non-citizen's links to Australia; the nature of crimes committed; and any international law obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will enable the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to give precise written directions on what weight is to be given to each of these factors. These directions must be binding on all decision makers, including merits review 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tribunals, to ensure a consistency of approach. The written directions will be tabled in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Protection of criminal intelligence </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Criminal intelligence and related information is critical to assessing the criminal background or associations of non-citizen visa applicants and visa holders. At present, it is difficult for the Department to use such information in making character decisions because its disclosure might be threatened. Australian and international law enforcement agencies are reluctant to provide sensitive information unless they are sure that both the information and its sources can be protected. Greater protection for such material would complement broader national and international strategies to counter transnational crime and the activities of those associated with it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill increases the level of protection for such information. I cannot overstate the importance of this protection to the job of preventing the entry of foreign criminals to Australia. This was highlighted in the Minister's recent discussions with officials of international law enforcement agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Merits review </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunity to appeal character decisions to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) will be retained. However, there is a critical need to reform these arrangements in two main respects: firstly, in terms of speeding up merits review processes; and, secondly, in terms of ensuring that merits review decisions reflect community standards and expectations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Merits review streamlining and time limits</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a non-citizen who is already in Australia is refused a further visa or has their visa cancelled on character grounds, it is essential that merits review cannot be used to prolong stay in Australia at taxpayers' expense. The average time currently taken for such cases at merits review is 227 days from the initial notification to a final decision. Many cases take even longer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During this time, the non-citizens involved, many of whom have committed serious crimes, either will be in detention at great cost to the taxpayer or will be at liberty in the community. Quite frankly, this must stop. This bill introduces more streamlined procedures for dealing with such cases. It also introduces a strict 42 day time limit for the conduct of merits review cases involving character where the non-citizen is in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been argued that a delay of 90 days is required to achieve justice. All this does is lead to risks to the community, cost to the taxpayer, and for non&hyphen;citizens in detention&mdash;a slower resolution of their case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will ensure that all relevant documentation necessary for the AAT to determine the matter will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9532"> be provided quickly, at the outset of the process. The amendments will establish a new process where the Department will be required to provide two copies of  the relevant documentation to the applicant at the time of the decision. Then, at the time the appeal is made, the applicant only has to lodge one copy of the documentation with the AAT. The need for strict time limits is consistent with other review processes in the immigration area where delay can prejudice both the applicant and the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision will result in a more streamlined process, with the applicant, the Department and the AAT using less time and resources to obtain the necessary documentation. Currently much effort is devoted to, and delay arises in, pursuing papers and documentation from non&hyphen;citizens and the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The strict time limit will prevent non&hyphen;citizens from further attempts to delay the resolution of their case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Minister's power to intervene or set aside Administrative Appeals Tribunal decisions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the past 12 months, the AAT has made a number of character decisions that are clearly at odds with community standards and expectations. The AAT has found a number of non-citizens, who have been convicted of very serious crimes, to be of good character, and has ruled that they should be granted a visa. This has alarmed the community and I might say the community, when they are aware of these decisions, hold the Government and not the AAT responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is essential that the Minister, acting personally, have the power to intervene or set aside such decisions in the national interest. The Minister should, however, continue to be required to table the making of any such decisions in the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Emergency cases </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From time to time, there will be emergency cases involving non-citizens who may be a significant threat to the community. These people may be threatening violence or some other act of destruction or have a prior history of serious crime. In these emergency circumstances, the Minister, again acting personally, should have the power to act without notice and have them taken into detention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once the visa is cancelled, the non&hyphen;citizen will have a right to make a submission to the Minister as to why the cancellation should be revoked. Natural justice will apply in such cases. However, if they cannot satisfy the Minister that they pass the character test, they should be removed immediately. Parliament should be notified of the making of such decisions but the decisions should not be subject to merits review because of their national significance. The Minister is very accountable for his actions&mdash;to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Parliament, his colleagues, and to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision is similar in nature to other provisions already present in the Migration Act&mdash;Subdivision F of the Migration Act (section 128) provides for cancellation offshore without notice and the right of the non&hyphen;citizen to make a subsequent submission as to why the cancellation or refusal should be revoked. This Subdivision was inserted in 1992 by the previous Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill sends a clear and unequivocal message on behalf of the Australian community. The Australian community expects that non-citizens coming to Australia should be of good character. To discharge this expectation, the Government must have the ability to act quickly and decisively, wherever necessary, to remove non-citizens who are not of good character. This bill meets our election commitment to the Australian people to strengthen the character provisions of the Migration Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the House of Representatives, the Opposition said that they supported the bill, and that their proposed amendments were minor and would not affect the integrity of the improvements we are making. This is not the case. These key provisions are in response to the community's legitimate view that in emergency situations, such as if we are dealing with terrorists, the Government can act decisively and in the national interest to protect the community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997 is, for the most part, nothing but a further attack on one of the cornerstones of our society&mdash;the family. Families are being slugged with extra costs for child-care, extra costs for aged care and extra costs for medical care as a result of this government's slash and burn approach to health, housing, education and social security. This bill really does bring us back to a fairly fundamental question: what kind of society is it that we want to be living in as we approach the 21st century? Cuts to the aged, unemployed, and those who have children with disabilities have amounted to more than $10 billion in the last two budgets. The government's so-called `reform process' appears to be being driven by polls from talkback radio. I think Mr Howard has spent too much time lately talking with Alan Jones, John Laws and their ilk.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge all of you here today: please do not diminish our nation. The very things that we fight for and stand for in Australia, like a fair go for everyone and egalitarianism, are seriously under threat. This bill is value laden to the point that the government's key focus on the social security system is one of blame&mdash;blame the unemployed and those who are poor. The underlying view of the exponents of this bill is that those on social security are not accountable enough and are getting too much. I do not understand why families with children with disabilities are regarded as bludging off the welfare system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As one who has established ongoing communication with people with disabilities and the organisations which represent them, I have had some very disturbing letters in recent times from organisations and individuals who are greatly concerned about some of the actions of this government and how they will impact on them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The management committees of organisations which support people with disabilities often are made up of volunteers, and such organisations often depend on volunteer workers in other areas of their operations as well. We as a community owe them a great 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> deal. They carry out many of the functions for which people in other organisations receive payment. These mean&hyphen;spirited actions adversely affect the lives of people who have the right to dignity, self&hyphen;respect and independence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The focus of this bill, according to this government, is on ensuring that only those who are most in need get assistance. I ask you just how needy do some of these people need to be before they qualify for assistance. Some of the examples I would like to raise in relation to this bill really show up the government for what it is&mdash;a non&hyphen;egalitarian government which really is interested only in governing on behalf of all of us who have money and do not require support from the state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am concerned about the amendment to the Social Security Act to introduce a new income support payment called the parenting payment, which aims to replace the sole parent pension and existing parenting allowance. Single parents will be the big losers here; 900 sole parents will be excluded as a result of the change from a tapered assets test to a sudden death approach to asset assessment. In addition, over 7,000 more sole parents will lose from the imposition of an income maintenance waiting period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is dishonest of the government to make these changes under the guise of simplification. I seriously have to question whether these arrangements in practice would be simpler anyway. They certainly will not be fairer. I think that simplification is really just a guise for cuts in services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of the proposed changes to the qualification provisions for child disability allowance are also of concern. These proposed changes would mean that, from 1 July 1998, eligibility for the allowance will be based upon a prescribed list of disabilities and a child disability assessment tool, details of which are yet to be provided, and child disability allowance arrears will be cut from 12 months to six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is estimated that over 4,000 families with young children who have disabilities will have their access to the child disability allowance denied next year as a direct result of the proposed changes. Over 4,500 will lose up to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9534"> six months arrears of child disability allowance because of the proposed reduction in arrears from 12 months to six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has argued that the number of child disability allowance claimants has doubled over the last five years and has had the temerity to insinuate that this is because people who do not deserve the allowances are rorting the system. This insinuation is blatantly dishonest as well as being a sleight on those parents claiming child disability allowances. It ignores the fact that there has been no evidence of parents rorting the system. The fact is that the education campaign carried out by the DSS was effective in that it alerted people to the fact that there was assistance for them. Consequently there have been more claimants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most insidious part about it is that, true to fashion, the government is proposing that these changes not happen now&mdash;when public outrage is at its highest and public opinion can be most effectively mobilised&mdash;but in nine months time, when the media are busy addressing other issues. If you are going to be so cold&hyphen;blooded, at least have the honesty to bring in changes at the time they are legislated for so that people can really judge you on your record at that appropriate time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These proposals form part of a sustained attack on people with disabilities by this government and are reminiscent of similar actions which saw 30,000 Australians lose their eligibility for financial assistance for hearing aids. These allowances are a small amount to pay to give people the chance for independence. They should be seen for what they are&mdash;an investment in people's lives, not a liability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 3 makes 255 amendments to the Social Security Act to change the name `family payment' to `family allowance'. This will require a large amount of reprinting of information products and forms&mdash;all at taxpayers' expense. I believe this money could be spent a lot better by supporting families who have children with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's continuing assault on families with children with disabilities is breathtaking and outrageous. Schedule 4 should be amended to remove the requirement 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that severe financial hardship has arisen because of unavoidable and essential expenditure. The requirement for severe financial hardship to have arisen because of prescribed unavoidable and essential expenditure is too harsh.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A person with liquid assets of less than two weeks payment&mdash;about $350&mdash;and no prospect of payment is desperate regardless of how they arrived at this situation. In reality, those who will be affected by this provision are either families who have less than $600 in the bank and no prospect of income or single people with less than $350 in the bank and no prospect of income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The underhanded and misleading presentation of the proposed changes is offensive in the context of provisions supposedly designed to provide stability and support for those most in need. Schedule 5 is designed to allow children with disabilities who no longer qualify for CDA to keep their health care cards. This would seem to be a reasonable and egalitarian measure, enabling greater access to services by people suffering from a wide variety of disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, schedule 5 contains another provision which bases eligibility for a disadvantaged person's health care card on income averaged over eight weeks rather than four weeks. This particular measure will result in over 4,500 people becoming ineligible for the card. Hence, while schedule 5 is supposedly designed to enhance service provision for those in need, it is actually enforcing further restrictions on the already stringent eligibility criteria. I think it is somewhat devious of the government to try to promote aspects of the bill that enhance service provision while ignoring aspects that will inevitably counteract any such measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this context it is particularly noteworthy that the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee produced a substantial minority report on this bill. The minority report opposed the imposition of an income maintenance period for sole parents. It highlighted the fact that sole parents are the group of social security recipients most likely to be in poverty and that employment opportunities for these people are continually restricted by the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9535"> demands of balancing work and family commitments. Consequently, provisions designed to assist sole parents should not be excessively punitive or difficult to access.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minority report also condemned the proposed reduction of the maximum period for which CDA arrears are payable. Evidence provided to the committee indicated that payment of 12 months in arrears of CDA is still justifiable because parents often spend an extended amount of time seeking appropriate diagnosis and treatment for their children. In the context of such ongoing family upheaval, many find it difficult to adjust quickly to the requirements of social security agencies. The recommendations of the minority report, therefore, represent an appeal to the government to reconsider their approach to social security and aspire to a platform more conducive to the maintenance of the egalitarian values held dear by most Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 6 of the bill raises new concerns with regard to privacy. It replaces references to specific social security payments in the Data&hyphen;matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act with a generic reference to payments made under the Social Security Act. This provision would ensure that data matching can continue when the government either changes the name of a current payment or introduces a new one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 6 would also enable data matching information to be transferred between agencies by online computer connection. This provision is of particular concern, despite government assurances with regard to the security of personal information. The actual bill does not outline any measures designed to make such an online connection secure. This is a matter of considerable importance and concern for many Australians. Consequently, Labor's amendments in the Senate will insert the requirement that the transfer of data must be carried out by secure online connection. The opposition are also particularly interested in the possibility of intervention by the Privacy Commissioner with regard to these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the aged care legislation, the government is forcing this legislation through without providing the detail of the list of disabili 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ties and the child disability assessment tool. The new parenting allowance may remove the stigma of the sole parent pension, but at a price. And most of the losers will be sole parents. The government's argument that it will be simpler is dubious. The new payments essentially reproduce existing arrangements but as subtypes of a payment rather than separate payments. Hence, this bill represents an attack by the government on those least able to defend themselves: sole parents and the disabled.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senators Neal, Bartlett and Gibbs for their contributions to this debate. At the outset, I would like to welcome the indications of support which the opposition and the Democrats have given for the generality of this bill. The measures in the bill are a continuation of the government's efforts to build a simple social security system that is fair to those in need and fair to taxpayers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to very briefly mention two of the measures. The introduction of the new parenting payment says to all parents, `We value your contribution. We know looking after kids is a real job too.' One consolidated payment highlights that that is what it is all about. The role should not be stigmatised, whether you are a lone parent or whether you have a partner. Core conditions for lone parents have, of course, been protected. As Senator Bartlett has requested, I am happy to say that the government undertakes that the pensioner education supplement will continue to lone parents receiving the single rate of parenting payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I turn to the child disability allowance. These changes are ones which have been six years in gestation. Since 1991 my department has been diligently reviewing the adequacy of assessing CDA. After a very thorough consultation process, it has brought forward these proposals; proposals in which the previously highly subjective assessment criteria are to be replaced with a test that more objectively measures the true level of disability. These changes have been welcomed by a large number of child disability groups and the medical profession. We are also proposing to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9536"> change the period in which CDA can be back paid from 12 to a still generous six months. I will say more about that during the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Allison gave notice of a motion calling on me to make an official statement regarding data on CDA recipients. While I have already answered a question on notice for Senator Allison on this issue, I would again like to make the situation clear. The facts are that in 1995 the department misinterpreted data supplied by the ABS, and this misinterpretation did not come to light until July this year. It was not obvious that the data had been misinterpreted because other data held by the department also indicated that at least 21 per cent of children qualifying for CDA did not have a disability in the same functional areas as measured by the ABS survey of disability, ageing and caring.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These corroborating data were taken from an analysis, by Coopers and Lybrand Consultants, of a sample of children who qualified for CDA in 1994. It was found that 29.7 per cent of parents and 27.2 per cent of treating health professionals rated the CDA child as having mild symptoms which did not stop the child from doing most things done at their age. Then in 1996&hyphen;97 Ernst and Young, when field testing the new CDA assessment tool, found that 22.6 per cent of children were rated by their parents as having no identifiable disability in the functional areas of communication, self&hyphen;care, social and community living skills, and fine and gross motor mobility. These areas correspond to the areas described in the ABS statistics. So, while the ABS survey of disability, ageing and caring cannot be used to measure the level of handicap of children who qualified for CDA in 1993, the other studies fully vindicate the use of a figure of at least 21 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the interests of saving time I will not go into the other schedules, but I remain happy to answer any questions. I do thank senators again for the constructive approach that has been taken on this bill so far, and I look forward to its continuing in the committee stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You may recall, Minister, that there have been concerns expressed by the opposition about the loss of the tapered assets test. It has been changed from that situation to a sudden death assets test. It seems, on the information from the department itself, that there are 900 sole parents who will lose as a result of this change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also have a great deal of a problem with a sudden death assets test. I think, in many cases, it discourages sole parents from trying 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9542"> to improve their positions. It encourages them in fact to rely on social security and not to make other efforts. So I have a real problem with these sorts of changes. There is also another group that appear to be losers as a result of schedule 1 of the government's bill and that is the 7,300 sole parents who will lose from the imposition of an income maintenance waiting period. It is of particular concern that the government has confirmed that a person will have to serve an income maintenance period when transferring from a partnered to a single rate of parenting payment or, indeed, at any time that they receive a leave payment of a lump sum. This could include a normal holiday period. I think this is a matter of great concern, and I would be pleased to hear from the minister as to why she thinks it is reasonable that, when they get their normal holiday pay, sole parents should lose the benefit that they are receiving.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In answer to Senator Neal about the 900 sole parent pension recipients who will have their payment cancelled, I think it is important to note at this stage that they are not full sole parent pensioners. In fact, they are part pensioners receiving an average payment of $200 per fortnight. But the reason that they get caught by this change is that, to lose payment under the measure, they have either got to own their home plus $125,750, or own $215,750 all up. By anybody's assessment, they are people with some personal wealth, and I think it is not without relevance that this will produce estimated program savings of $4.887 million in the first year alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The parenting payment aligns a number of conditions that currently vary between the existing payments, and alignment includes this measure&mdash;extending to lone parents the non&hyphen;tapered assets test that currently applies to the parenting allowance. So it inevitably means

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also of the view that, in that circumstance and in putting forward that proposal in the spirit that I do, it is incumbent on the government to give a commitment that it will bring the  Native Title Amendment Bill  on for debate as of the commencement of government business tomorrow. That seems to me to be a very reasonable approach in this circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put to the Manager of Government Business that I think we have reached the stage where there is a need for us to provide a level of clarity and certainty about sitting times for the remainder of this week's sitting period. I really think it is now overdue that the matters that have been discussed informally amongst senators are clarified and that we make some clear decisions in relation to how the Senate approaches the remainder of this week's sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think what I put forward on behalf of the opposition is a very generous proposal, and I do it in the spirit that I understand there are a very significant number of speeches to be made in the second reading debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill . Obviously, a long and complex committee debate has to be carried out in this chamber, and I believe it is essential that we get to that committee debate as soon as possible and commence the work that I think senators right around the chambers have acknowledged needs to be done as soon as is possible or practicable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We really have to honour that commitment we have to the broader community to deal with what I believe and have said previously 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> is one of the most important pieces of legislation that this parliament will have to deal with, if not the most important piece of legislation, during the life of this parliament. I put forward that proposition to the Manager of Government Business. With general business time tomorrow, if the Senate sits on Thursday evening and on Friday, it will really provide quite a significant amount of time to deal with these important matters before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I also believe the government needs to give a commitment that that time that the Senate can utilise for government business will be dedicated to the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 . I believe it is appropriate in these circumstances also that the manager gives a clear commitment&mdash;that the government shows its bona fides and demonstrates that it is also fair dinkum about this debate&mdash;that the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997  will be brought on for debate as the first item of government business tomorrow.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The Democrats fully support the bringing on of the native title debate as soon as we possibly can. We support sitting through tomorrow night&mdash;I presume we are talking about 10.30 p.m.&mdash;and dealing with government business all day Friday. I know that the government has to get at least two of the other bills through. But there will probably be about six senators carrying the bulk of the work as we move into the committee stage of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . I am sure they would appreciate a couple of breaks through the next week as we  sit through I do not know how many hundreds of amendments&mdash;I think we are up over 500. Other government business can be slotted in for an hour or two at a time as we work our way through the committee stage of native title.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I think it is extremely important that we continue with the second readings uninterrupted and that all senators who want to have their chance to speak are able to do so, if possible this week. We have probably close to 1,000 people here, who would not normally be in Canberra, waiting for this debate to come on. We saw how many people were in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9544"> the gallery last night. I have been approached by a number today, particularly from the Aboriginal community, who are worried about their resources if this bill just drags on and on. We as a parliament have to think about the resources of those people who have come, I feel, to make the democratic process work a lot better. I felt last night, as we sat here with so many people in the gallery, that it is a shame they do not come for social security bills and a whole range of other legislation. But obviously this particular bill is seen by the community as one of the most important bills we will deal with this year, if not the most important bill, and I think we should get on with it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The issue of the disempowerment of indigenous people is quite clear when it comes to the way this legislation has been put together. But there is no reason to compound that error by making sure that those people who come to see, at the very least, the second readings and the start of the committee stage do not have the chance to see that at this time. If people want to put the debate into quiet times in backrooms, you can only wonder why. Perhaps it is because the tide is turning in the community debate. Perhaps the government sees the need to be in the dark, in the quiet and on the quick. But that is not what the community deserves. The very least we deserve is to now deal with the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been mentioned, there will continue to be times during this debate when we will need time to take a break from the legislation. There will be opportunities to do other committee stage work during that time if we have to wait for messages from the House of Representatives and so on. We do have the opportunities to do that. There is absolutely no excuse for not getting on with what we are now in fact being forced to do by the government, which is to consider the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 . But we at least owe it to those people who have been disempowered from the process of decision making to at least let them hear what excuses people have for the positions they are taking.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At this stage&mdash;and I think people recognise this; certainly Senator Lees did in her contribution&mdash;the government does need to complete the piece of legislation we have interrupted for this short debate, that is the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997 . We do need to have the  States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 . I do not think anyone would deny that we cannot go without that; I am sure the states would not. I think there is a recognition from Senator Lees that the migration agents matter needs to be resolved. If it is not resolved, then there is no regulatory scheme for migration agents in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Lees, it may be the case that there may be some sort of hiatus or interregnum at some stage during the native title debate. However, it is very hard to envisage that at the moment. As much as you might think it is a good way to say, `We'll give you a wink and a nod and we'll fix it up at some stage next week,' we have taken the view that it will be better to get these things done, then  get into native title and keep it going non-stop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot agree totally to what Senator Faulkner sought in relation to our saying that we will commence native title at a specific time. However, we will seek to make that agreement before I bring a motion forward. We will seek to find an agreement on these remaining items.</PARA>

We were hoping to deal with that if there is any hiatus in the native title committee stage.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thought we were coming to a consensus before Senator Carr got to his feet. We have been over all of those matters that Senator Carr raised. Those sorts of comments are not helpful. I must say that I am rather anxious to get on to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> .

If we do not resolve or deal with in some way the  Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1997  and related bills, the sunset clause will come into effect and the whole thing will hurtle over the edge and there will be a free-for-all in that particular area. That will be a great problem. So we have to deal with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we deal with it is another question. If there is a hiatus at some time during the Native Title Amendment Bill considerations, I think that hiatus has to be identified at some stage beforehand so that we know that we will be going off native title to wrap up the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These amendments, and those following that are foreshadowed on the running sheet, deal with the income maintenance period. They need to be moved separately because of the logistics of the situation. The income maintenance period is being proposed by the government in relation to sole parents. It is widely acknowledged that sole parents are the group of social security recipients who are most likely to be living in poverty. That is something the Democrats are always very conscious of when considering any legislation that alters payment rates or conditions for sole parents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I indicated in my speech on the second reading, the Democrats' initial response to the legislation was one of some concern. It 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9566"> seemed that sole parents had much to lose from some of these proposals and little to gain. As I said previously, the minister's office was able to reassure us on a number of issues&mdash;and I do thank them for that&mdash;most particularly that the rate of payment to sole parents would be maintained at the pension rate and pegged to average weekly earnings and that sole parents would continue to receive the pensioner concession card.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is fair to say in light of those undertakings that the peak body representing sole parents, the National Council of Single Mothers and their Children, broadly supported the introduction of this payment, but it is true that they have a number of outstanding concerns nonetheless. One of those is the effect that an imposition of an income maintenance period will have on sole parents. They point out, and the Democrats support them, that this move is likely to increase the level of poverty amongst sole parents, who are undeniably those who are most likely to be living in poverty in the community. I highlight the fact that sole parents are more likely to have a broken connection with the work force as a result of their need to balance work and family responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Broadly speaking, the Democrats have not been overly keen on income maintenance periods in any case, so I suppose to that extent it is not surprising that we are not too keen on this one either because we believe it reinforces the potential for poverty traps. Given the particular poverty levels of sole parents especially, the Democrats are opposing the imposition in this legislation of an income maintenance period for sole parents.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments moved by Senator Bartlett for the Democrats are joint amendments with the opposition and concern a matter that I mentioned earlier in discussion. There are some 7,300 sole parents who are going to be worse off because of this measure. I am particularly concerned about the matter I raised earlier. There may be some sole parents who receive a pension and also work who might be adversely affected such that when they take their annual holidays they lose their payment. I would like the minister 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to deal with that matter in particular, because I could see that as causing great hardship if, every time these sole parents take a holiday, they suddenly substantially lose part of their income. That will mean that they cannot take holidays. It seems to me a particularly harsh provision, and I would really be pleased if the minister could explain that.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to those who are taking leave, I understand that that is the position that already exists. That is not a change for them. I will try as simply as I can to deal with what I think is some confusion about how the income maintenance period works. If you leave a job and you are paid out for accumulated leave, the payment is treated as income as if you earned it over the period of the leave, just as if you were still in work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, Barbara is on a parenting payment at the single rate. She works permanent part-time, earning $200 a fortnight. She accordingly receives a part rate of the parenting payment of around $315 a fortnight. If she leaves her job and is paid out $200 for two weeks accumulated leave, in the two weeks after she has left work, she is assumed to have earned $200 in that fortnight and will receive a part rate parenting payment of $315. In the following fortnight she will be assessed as having no income and will receive the full rate parenting payment of $353.20.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Examples show that some of the claims about an income maintenance period are simply wrong; they are inaccurate. You do not have to spend all your leave pay to qualify for benefits. All it is saying is that if you have been paid out for leave, you are effectively earning income in that period of leave. All we are doing is extending to the leave payments the normal income testing that has always applied to lone parents. This measure currently applies to all allowees. It is inconsistent to apply it to these other income support recipients leaving jobs but not lone parents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is those sorts of ad hoc exemptions that have made the social security system even more complicated. I know that Senator Bartlett is very keen to see simplicity in the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9567"> system. Consistency of treatment of people who are in like circumstances is surely a basic in making this system simpler. This is not a cruel or unconscionable measure. I think the opposition to it has perhaps been based on misunderstandings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge senators to support the income maintenance period applying to lone parents because it is fair to assess all income that they receive, whether it is in the form of a wage or leave payments. You would have no problem assessing it as to their wage. Surely it is fair and reasonable that their leave payments, which are for a specified number of weeks, be treated in the same way. If they were simply taking leave and staying in work, it would be taken into account. If they are leaving employment and getting leave payments, surely it should also be taken into account, as it is for allowees and people on allowances.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is obviously an area where there can be great emotion. For families and for parents, having a child that has developed a disability or has been hurt in an accident is a traumatic experience. It needs to be acknowledged that my department and Centrelink have made it as easy as possible for parents to claim CDA. Something that I feel ought to be well understood in the Senate is that a specific medical diagnosis is not needed for CDA eligibility. The cause of a disability does not need to be known, only the effect on the child's functioning. After all, the parent does know that early on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Centrelink do try to make sure that knowledge of the availability of the CDA is as widespread as possible. In the years of your government, Senator Neal, you made a major effort and spent quite a lot of money to make sure that parents, sisters in maternity wards, paediatricians and other people who work with children were aware of the introduction of the child disability allowance. I think you did a very good job; the existence of the allowance is now very well known. Some of the rationale for having a long arrears period in the early days was so that you could make sure that families did not miss out. I do not think that situation exists now. Families do know of the existence of the allowance and so do the health care providers. Centrelink is continuing to make sure that the knowledge is as widespread as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just me saying that. Mr David Fisher, who is the senior researcher of the Carers Association of Australia, gave evidence to the community affairs committee inquiry. He was asked about the arrears measure, and he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Six months is not really a long time; it is a reasonable period of time. Some social security payments cannot be backdated at all. This one is now six months, if this is passed into law. I guess it is like all of these things&mdash;you would like it to be longer, but if you have to make a relative choice of where money is spent, it is probably not too harsh a provision to have. Six months is a reasonable period.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Later on he said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One thing we have noticed though in our dealings with Centrelink&mdash;and just observing around us, as I am sure you all do&mdash;is that there seems to be quite a lot of additional effort going into promoting the existence of their services and the support that is available. In fact, Centrelink has been actively involved with the Carers Association in trying to make the existence of the carer payments better known within the community. We all think that is very helpful for carers and probably likely to lead to fewer problems in back payments . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I welcome the fact that the Carers Association&mdash;and we are all concerned about them&mdash;acknowledge that six months is an adequate period for parents to learn about the child disability allowance and to apply for it, especially in the context of the efforts which Centrelink is making to publicise the allowance to all family payment recipients, at hospitals, to paediatricians and the like. I would urge the committee to listen to the Carers Association and support the measure that is in the government's bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The evidence from the department clearly is that they are losers from this measure. There are 4,500 children with disabilities who would lose out because of this measure. With respect, Minister, I think you are misstating the motivation of the Labor government when they introduced this legislation in having it backdated for 12 months. It was not because there was a lack of knowledge. Though that was true as well, it certainly was not the sole reason. One of the reasons why it was backdated to such a length was that sometimes the disabilities that children have are not obvious on the surface. It may be that a child appears on the surface to be quite perfect in a physical sense. Often where the problems arise, and where parents become aware of the difficulties their children face, is when they start school and they find that they do not pick up things as quickly as their peers do. That is why it is quite common, even if parents do know about the child disability allowance, for them not to claim it immediately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Often, you have a child of five or six that goes to school and suddenly it is discovered that there is a hearing problem, an eye problem or a speech problem or that they have some sort of learning difficulty. That is when 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9570"> they discover that they can claim the allowance and they can get some assistance in remedying the problem. That is one of the major reasons why Labor, when in government, had the period of 12 months. Certainly, it is a very common situation. I would be very interested to get a full copy of the transcript of the document you were quoting from&mdash;I was not really clear as to what the source was&mdash;to see where it was in context, because it is very hard to make sense of it when someone just reads out small portions of a discussion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest to you, Minister, that the group of people who are represented by the individual you were quoting are generally those individuals with disabilities that are quite obvious early on. What he may not have turned his mind to is the situation of children who do not have obvious physical disabilities on the face of it but who have disabilities that, if not dealt with or not treated, may cause severe difficulties for that child as they grow up and develop.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the child has a hearing problem that is not treated, it may well be that that child will never properly learn to read or write. It may then be difficult for them to live a full life and have a career. It may be that they need speech pathology and that, if they are not treated, their whole capacity to develop as an individual, to grow and to have a career, will be limited. So it is not just a question of how soon the parent is aware that this benefit exists; it is how soon and at what point they become aware that their child has that problem.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to prolong the debate, but I think there is a misunderstanding here. We are not talking about whether there is a disability or not; we are talking about whether there is a functional problem. Since your government introduced the CDA, the child has had to be qualified for 12 months and to be receiving `substantially more care and attention' over that period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the example you were just giving, Senator Neal, if the child's disability or the effect on the support that was needed from the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parents, for example, was not known for some years, the whole purpose of the payment would not be called into operation. The payment was designed to deal with the functional problem that the child needs substantially more care and attention. If the parent does not discover the child needs more care and attention until one, two, three or however many years down the track, it is not until the time they make that discovery that they become eligible for child disability allowance. That is not because there has been a disability that has not been diagnosed before that. There is no eligibility for an allowance if there has been no requirement for substantially more care and attention. It is only once substantially more care and attention comes into play that eligibility for child disability allowance comes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the parents have needed to provide substantially more care and attention for eight or nine months, say, but do not claim until the end of that period, there is some rationale for having arrears. But in the example you just gave there was no recognition of what the problem was; only when the recognition came was there a need for that extra care and attention from the parents. The eligibility for the allowance should only start then, so that does not really answer what we are trying to do here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised&mdash;and I am not certain that this is 100 per cent accurate&mdash;that, when your government introduced this in about 1987, it was then not restricted to a period of 12 months. There was unlimited arrears. You then, at some stage, reduced it to a 12&hyphen;month arrears period. If that is the case, your government must have recognised that unlimited arrears was not sensible, and you brought it down to 12 months. It has been in place for a lot longer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments we have in this Social Security (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill will give an objective assessment tool which will help in determining the requirement of the family for assistance in a better way than anecdotal evidence has determined to date. In veterans affairs there is an objective assessment tool, and this is very similar in intent. I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9571"> think it will be a much better system of child disability allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With that, once again, the length of arrears is surely not needed nowadays. I think 12 months is now excessive, and it is time to move on. I do not want to repeat what I have already said, but I hope that has helped the committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Schedule 2 of the Social Security (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill makes general changes in relation to qualification provisions for the child disability allowance. The Democrats broadly welcome this move, for some of the reasons the minister was outlining. It makes it a more objective and transparent assessment process for those who are applying for the child disability allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a previous life I was a social worker at Social Security. I had to assess children for their suitability for child disability allowance. With the assistance of all the wonderful other people in the Department of Social Security, who, I am sure, are just as wonderful today as they were then, we usually managed to get it right, but it was a fairly subjective thing trying to weigh that up. I think the direction in which this change goes, in consultation with the various affected groups, does seem to be the way to go. Certainly the evidence before the Senate committee hearing into this legislation did give that impression as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should indicate that during that committee evidence it was pleasing to hear that there was a reasonable level of satisfaction from those groups about the extent of consultation that has occurred to date. That does not always happen, and it should be acknowledged when it does happen, because it is very important. I want to encourage the minister, as I am sure she will encourage her department, to continue that consultation process as this change works its way through. There have been concerns raised about specific components of the assessment tool, as I am sure the minister and the department are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> aware, and we do urge the minister to continue to carefully re&hyphen;examine those conditions as the procedure starts to be utilised, looking at which ones are listed as manifest conditions, et cetera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the 12&hyphen; and six&hyphen;month arrears periods, it is worth putting on the record the Democrats' concerns about this change and our reasons for not supporting it. We opposed the change that was attempted last year, when the government tried to reduce this to a three&hyphen;month arrears period and asked the question at the Senate committee hearings recently. Certainly ACROD gave a strong indication that they were not very keen on that reduction to six months happening, partly for the reasons that Senator Neal outlined and also, I think, for the reason that this is a savings measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that money has to be saved where the opportunity arises, but parents with disabled children do face significant costs. It is clear&mdash;certainly evidence given to the committee made it clear&mdash;that in many circumstances the amount paid through the child disability allowance is inadequate. I recognise that budgetary constraints are the way of the world but, given that it is the case that the amount available is often not adequate, any move that restricts it even further is something the Democrats are not too keen on supporting. It would make it difficult for many families. It also fails to take into account the fact that for many families it is difficult to obtain an accurate diagnosis of a child's disability and then have to adjust to what that diagnosis means to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister quoted before from evidence the Carers Association gave to the committee, and that quotation fits with my recollection of the evidence they gave. It is a fair enough point to make. I would like to quote from a letter I got from the executive director, Anne Marie Mioshe&mdash;who appeared before the committee&mdash;in relation to the 12 or six months issue. It is a short letter, written to a number of senators:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to let you know that we&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the Carers Association&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">would support any amendments . . . in maintaining the 12 months period of arrear for the child dis

<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, ACROD&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and we believe the arguments they presented to the Senate Committee in relation to maintaining the arrear period at 12 months are sensible and reasonable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The argument of the Carers Association before the committee was based on the fact that arrears payments do not exist for other carer benefits such as the domiciliary nursing care benefit. It is important to put that on the record. Whilst I am sincere in congratulating the government on the consultation they have done to date, the very short time frame the Community Affairs committee had in which to consider this legislation was a little disappointing. I know that ACOSS and Welfare Rights, for example, found it impossible to get submissions together in time for the public hearings, et cetera. That does make it rather difficult for people in our position when we have to consider all these measures in the very complex world of the Social Security Act.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments relate to schedule 4 of the legislation and deal with applying consistent hardship rules to ordinary waiting periods, liquid assets tests waiting periods and income maintenance periods. As I have said a couple of times on this bill, consistency is a wonderful thing and is to be much encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having had a bit to do with social security legislation issues off and on over the years, the utilisation of the word `consistency' has sometimes caused me to develop a bit of cynicism about it being a cloak for saving money. Therefore, it was quite pleasing to see in the explanatory memorandum and from further discussions with the minister's office that this, as I understand it, is a utilisation of consistency which is going to be of some benefit to people. It will be around $10 million in a couple of years' time. So my cynicism has now been reduced, which is much appreciated. I thought it always got worse when you got into parliament, but I will turn it around, at least for the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments that the Democrats are putting up basically ensure that the measure is more likely to end up operating in the way it is intended. We still have reservations about the use of the term `unavoidable and essential'. I understand that the reason why this is going to result in slightly more payments to people, as is put forward, is that the current provisions have been strictly interpreted, or interpreted in a strict way. This new wording will be interpreted in a way that will enable more people to receive payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe that it might be safer to utilise the wording that we are putting up here, which is `unavoidable or reasonable'. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It is still a subjective assessment but one that is less open to a strict interpretation and perhaps more likely to provide clearer guidance to the hardworking officers in the department when they have to interpret these subjective clauses.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been an amendment&mdash;of course, I do not need to move it&mdash;which has been circulated and it relates to schedule 5. There is a restriction that we are opposed to and it is in the health care card eligibility component within that section. The provision says that, for the purposes of assessing eligibility for a health care card, the income of a person is averaged over eight weeks rather than four weeks. I suppose that, on the face of it, you can argue that that is reasonable. But the consequential effect is that you have to wait for a period of eight weeks rather than four weeks before you can get your health

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats and I acknowledge that the proposed change would indeed make it more difficult for people to indulge in manipulating the circumstances in a way that would avoid the test as it currently operates. But it seems to the Democrats that, as is often the case with social security legislation, the change will catch out a large number of innocent people and disadvantage them. For example, those people whose casual work hours are significantly reduced may still qualify for the health care card but will have to wait longer for it. So, for those reasons, we feel that, on balance, it would be better for this change not to come into place. We will be opposing those items.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am disappointed that this amendment is being pursued by both the opposition and the Democrats, because it is quite clearly based on a misapprehension of the true situation. It does not mean that there is an increase in the waiting period. I will work through this and perhaps then you will understand why I say that. It is pretty clear to me. I certainly reject any allegations that it will affect low income earners or constitute any waiting period in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a person earning less than $286 a week applied for a low income health care card today, they would get it. If this measure is passed in the Senate and the same person enters a Centrelink office, they would get the card. There would be no waiting period at all for a card that is effective for six months. There is no waiting period, no change in the threshold and no change in the government's wish to assist low income earners.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we are changing is the period over which we look back from the date of application in order to assess the person's average income. The period that we look back is currently four weeks, but we believe that is too short a time for a few reasons. For example, it means that a person who earns a perfectly adequate income in the course of a year but does not work over a three-week Christmas shutdown could get a card&mdash;three weeks of low income; six months of a concession card.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another situation in which these provisions can be used for purposes for which they are not intended. Senator Bartlett talked about these great people who worked for Social Security and who now work for Centrelink. I agree with him. It was people like that who told me about what I think is a misuse of the card: that is, TAFE students who apply for a low income health care card over the Christmas holidays simply so they have the evidence to get a reduction from state governments in their TAFE fees. That may be a worthy outcome, but it is not the purpose for the which the cards were intended. I think that is a distortion of the system. It is something which was probably never thought of when the low income health care card was produced. That is what we are talking about. We are not talking about people on benefits; we are talking about people who have been on low incomes and who currently have only their previous four weeks income averaged. If their income level is eligible, then they go on to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Assessment over eight weeks will ensure that cards are going not to people for whom low income is an anomaly but to people for whom low income is a reality. Every genuine low income earner remains fully protected. Let me reiterate that: it will not make for a waiting period. Assessment is in the weeks prior to the application, not after. So not one low income earner will have to wait for a card any longer than at present. I urge the opposition parties to reconsider their amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

I came back to the department and said, `Do you know that this is one of the uses to which our low income health care cards are being put?' They are designed to provide health benefits and health assistance for people who are on low incomes. These are not necessarily people who have been on low incomes at all. For example, they can be on a break before they go to TAFE and have little or no income at all. That is a fact. It is not a rort. It is allowable under the current system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, people employed in industries which have shutdowns over Christmas are also eligible. It is not a rort, but surely it is not something that should be continued. These are people who are in employment and who happen to have a lay&hyphen;off period. It might be for three weeks, but that means that over the four&hyphen;week period their income fits them into the category of making them immediately eligible for a low income health care card. Do you think that was really what was intended with this? Surely it is an opportunity to make sure that it is not misused in this way. It was designed for people who are on low incomes for a continuing period.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment is an accountability measure and again seeks to protect grants to the states by requiring that the Treasurer, before he makes payment of any general revenue assistance to the states, is satisfied that the state government has in place an independent state Auditor&hyphen;General, and for almost a century, every state has met this criterion with some ease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But that all changed in Victoria late last week, when the lower house of the Victorian state parliament passed its legislation which will see that the Auditor-General is deprived of his auditing function and will no longer be able to conduct financial or performance audits himself. His role will be one of a contract administrator, in effect. He can appoint private auditors, prepare specifications 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9578"> for the audits and terminate the appointment of an auditor who does not perform but he cannot himself conduct any audits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Premier of Victoria claims that the Auditor-General will have complete discretion in the exercise of his functions or powers. However, the separation of the policy and services functions of the audit office comprises the real regulatory role of the Auditor-General. I suggest that, in order to be truly independent, the Auditor-General must retain that operational oversight of all the functions fulfilled by the Office of the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Kennett government further compromises the independence of the Auditor-General by insisting that the government has a role in appointing the board of management of Audit Victoria, which is the corporatised, I suppose, body that once formed the Office of the Auditor-General. The incumbent, Mr Ches Baragwanath, has maintained his very strong opposition to these changes and described the new role late least week as imposing enormous restrictions on operational independence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's plans have been attacked by just about everyone this week&mdash;the Chairman of the Victorian Bar Council, the Victorian Council of Churches, the Good Shepherd Youth and Family Service and many others. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald&hyphen;Sun</EMPHASIS> ran a telephone poll on 30 October and it demonstrated that 94.5 per cent of respondents supported the continuing independence of the Auditor-General. The state council of the Liberal Party also voted overwhelmingly in support of this objective, and about 50,000 Victorians in all have so far signed petitions and written to Mr Kennett to oppose this policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I strongly commend this amendment to the committee in order that we can ensure that Victoria cannot change the mandate of its Auditor-General without risking its federal grants. I remind the committee that this amendment is constitutionally valid because the states have no right to financial assistance per se.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that the opposition did not support us on this amendment back in September, when the last states grants bill came through the Senate, but I urge them to reconsider this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> position. The situation has become much more pressing now that the legislation has moved through the lower house and progressed to the upper house. So I strongly urge the ALP to think very carefully about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to quote a couple of ALP members of the Victorian state parliament. The opposition leader, John Brumby, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition regards it as the greatest threat to the rights of Victorians and to democracy that this parliament has witnessed in its more than 140-year history.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition regards the proposed legislation as corrupt and as being introduced by a government which is corrupt. It is rotten legislation; it is tainted legislation; it is dishonest legislation; it is morally indefensible legislation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The deputy opposition leader, Mr John Thwaites, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the legislation proceeds, in future years backbenchers, ministers and public servants will end up being subject to criminal action because the climate of corruption that will be created will lead to a situation in which government members will be the losers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So it is very clear that there is widespread opposition to this provision and that there are dangers inherent in its passing in relation to Commonwealth funds which flow through to the states.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No doubt the Mitcham by-election will be used by the ALP as an opportunity to point out how opposed they are to these changes. I want to say to the ALP that support for this amendment will send a very clear message to the electorate in Mitcham about how serious the ALP are about supporting their position on the independence of the Auditor-General and therefore the accountability of governments. Clearly, support for this amendment would give support to their state colleagues, who have been so very outspoken on this issue.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleague Senator Allison. The Australian Democrats feel very strongly indeed about this issue. As she has clearly outlined, we have consulted at length with the association&mdash;if that is the proper term&mdash;of the Auditors-General at large in Australia and they, as with many people in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9579"> Victoria, feel alarmed by the changes that Premier Kennett has wrought in that state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We recall, as Senator Allison just has, that we moved this amendment to a previous states grants bill. I recall clearly Senator Carr and Senator Conroy from Victoria appearing in that debate and making very impassioned speeches against the perfidy of Premier Kennett and his policies. Then the ALP voted down, not to our surprise, this amendment which would have required accountability in terms of the Auditor-General and how Commonwealth moneys are dealt with in Victoria. At that time the Labor Party said to us that that was not the appropriate forum, that the preferred package to deal with this was the Auditor-General's package. So we brought that amendment to the Auditor-General's package and we were not surprised that the Labor Party voted it down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think now is judgment day. Either the Labor Party are going to be accused of posturing and of not being capable of executing proper accountability measures which are constitutional and which will protect the Commonwealth or they are going to support us in this measure. If the ALP have an alternative we would certainly gladly consider it, but we feel that the most important accountability mechanism that is available to any parliament in Australia which protects the public purse as far as that is possible is the Auditor-General. It is a fundamental matter which is of critical importance to all parties and all sides of the parliament, and it is only in one state of Australia that this onslaught has been conducted against an Auditor-General. We think it is appropriate for all parties to be supportive of the intention of Senator Allison's amendment, which simply says:</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">All that says is that the amounts paid by the Commonwealth to a state will be audited and that the auditor will be independent. I would expect that sentiment as well as the amendment to be fully supported by every party and every Independent in this place. I strongly support Senator Allison's amendment and I hope that you will find it in your hearts to be accountable and to strongly support it, too.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the opposition, might I make a few points to the chamber concerning this matter. I do appreciate the deep concern there is in Victoria about the fate of the Auditor-General. There is a by-election being fought in Mitcham on 13 December. As I understand it, the people of Mitcham will express very grave concerns about the way in which the Auditor-General has been treated in that state. On numerous occasions we have expressed the opposition's view about the treatment of the people of Victoria by the government of Victoria with regard to basic issues of public accountability and democratic decision making. Perhaps at a later point in this discussion I will need to go through those in some detail just to be clear so that those following this matter do understand the depth of deep concern that the opposition has about the way in which the government of Victoria is pillaging that state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also, however, are concerned to make sure that there is a proper discussion of the legislation that is actually before the parliament. As I understand it, this is the  States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 , which seeks to give assistance and a response to the states and territories to alter their share of revenue replacement of payments for tobacco under the safety net arrangements that came about as a result of the High Court decision on various tobacco tariffs. This is a measure which seeks to provide assistance to the states for a whole range of services. The consequence of denying those services also needs to be weighed up pretty carefully and to be considered quite carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I draw the committee's attention to the amendment which the opposition will move to the motion that the report of the committee 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9580"> be adopted. The amendment seeks to add the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`and that the following matter be referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit for inquiry and report by 30 June 1998:</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">To propose that we should support the Democrats' amendment on the basis that we are concerned about the situation in Victoria is in itself a fairly superficial argument. What we would like to put to the committee is that this is not necessarily the most appropriate means of expressing that concern. I do not think there can be any doubt about the general view as to what is happening in Victoria and how inappropriate it is that the Kennett government should seek to muzzle the Auditor-General. But, equally, I do not think it is appropriate that the Senate be used as part of the leadership battles of the Democrats. It is fair enough that both the candidates are here today, and I trust that they are enjoying the full support of the Democrats in their campaign.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much, Mr Temporary Chairman. The issue of the appropriateness of this measure is at the core of the contribution I am making. The political significance of it cannot be lost, however, in terms of the present timing of the disputes 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> within the Democrats themselves. We do understand. Senator Allison has sent letters around concerning my behaviour on this matter. She has drawn attention to my voting record on this matter in Victoria, which she is fully entitled to do. Equally, I am entitled to point out her particular interest in this matter at this particular time. It is only appropriate that the Senate is acquainted with all of the facts in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also has to be understood, Senator Allison, that your deep concern about the Auditor-General is widely shared within the Victorian political community, except within the Liberal Party itself. This is a question the government has to address: to what extent is it prepared to stand up to what is happening in Victoria and to defend appropriate levels of integrity and probity in public affairs in this country, particularly when it concerns Commonwealth moneys?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I just do not believe that this is the most effective way in which this matter can be pursued. The Labor Party proposes that this issue is more appropriately dealt with through reference to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts for inquiry. This is in fact the parliamentary committee specifically charged with this responsibility. It has already undertaken inquiries in a range of related matters and only recently has been charged to increase its level of review and activity in the issue of public accounts auditing. It is a responsible committee which ought to undertake an inquiry of this particular type. It has recently undertaken inquiries into the issue of the  Charter of Budget Honesty Bill 1996 . It has undertaken inquiries into the Commonwealth Auditor-General's packages. It is therefore suitably qualified and is the appropriate body to investigate the issues concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Democrats are proposing is that we should follow the same argument that they have presented to the parliament on a number of occasions, which the opposition has consistently opposed. Let me put it to you that the opposition is very concerned about the attacks on the Auditor-General in Victoria and the activities of the Victorian government when it comes to the issues of public financing.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9581">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We respect and totally support the need for an independent and properly resourced Auditor-General's office. However, we cannot see that the federal parliament should be using this particular bill to seek to pursue that political agenda. What we believe is that the issue should be separate from the general matters being discussed in this particular bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Sherry, on previous occasions, has stated the position on behalf of the opposition whereby we have sought to direct the Democrats to the more appropriate courses of action that are available to them. We say that the relevant committees of the parliament are the more effective way of securing agreement around this general proposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would suggest to you that, in the case of Victoria, the upcoming by-election in Mitcham is another opportunity for the people of Victoria to express their clear intentions and to support the Labor Party's candidate Mr Tony Robinson in that by-election. It will probably be the most effective of all means of expressing disappointment and displeasure at the actions of the Kennett government and its high-handed treatment of the public sector in that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that the Auditor-General has exposed deep&hyphen;seated corruption within the state of Victoria. He has quite clearly exposed the actions of the Victorian government in regard to the ambulance contracts. He has exposed the deep&hyphen;seated corruption in the education in that state and the casino licences. He has equally been able to highlight just how inadequate and systematic the corruption is in that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, that is not to say that this parliament ought to use the  States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 , which is aimed at providing revenue sharing in relation to the payment of tobacco excises, as the vehicle to express the displeasure of this parliament at what is quite clearly the blatant abuse of political process in the state of Victoria.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just need to make a couple of points about my colleague Senator Carr's remarks. We had this debate back in September when the ALP said, in their view, that the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R367">States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997</XREF>  was not an appropriate bill. So we then moved on to the next bill, which was said to be more appropriate&mdash;that was the Commonwealth Auditor-General's bill. That turned out not to be appropriate either. We put up some terms of reference for inquiry, as suggested by the ALP. That also was not appropriate. I do note that Senator Carr has now put together some terms of reference for an inquiry. I want to indicate that the Australian Democrats will be supporting this. We will do whatever we can to see that there is some action taken in this respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I also need to put on the record that one of the reasons why our terms of reference were not supported by the ALP was that there had not been enough prior warning&mdash;that they had not been circulated and there was not a chance to talk about them. That is what has happened tonight with Senator Carr's amendment. That is not to say that we will oppose it. As I have already indicated, we will support this. It is interesting to note that when the Democrats do it, it is not acceptable, but when the opposition does it is okay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Carr has quite rightly given us a list of the matters which the Auditor-General has raised about the current Kennett government. But we know that Mr Baragwanath was just as unpopular with the former Labor government. He uncovered a number of serious problems with the administration of the Labor 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9582"> government. In fact, it is probably fairly well acknowledged that it was the undoing of the Cain and Kirner governments at the time. Having said that, I think this is probably the end of the debate, from our point of view, on this amendment. I commend it to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, 25 November 1997, marked the 20th anniversary of the judgment in the landmark case of Clark v. University of Melbourne &amp; Others. In that case, His Honour Justice Kaye ruled that the University of Melbourne did not have the legal power to levy a compulsory union fee on students. He went on to rule as illegal and improper a large number of payments made by the Students Representative Council and its national affiliated body, the Australian Union of Students. The impact of that decision sent shock waves throughout every extreme left&hyphen;wing group on every university campus in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So who is this Robert Clark, who had taken on and defeated the full might of the most  privileged university in Australia and the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9586"> financial resources of the bloated Australian Union of Students with a multimillion dollar budget? Robert Clark was a gifted student, winning a scholarship to University High School before going on to enter the combined law&hyphen;commerce course at Melbourne University. Robert was the son of immigrant working&hyphen;class parents from St Albans, in the heartland of Melbourne's western suburbs. He was a person who had come to his strong, personally held belief in liberalism and freedom by discussion, debate and deliberation. He joined the local campus Liberal club in 1975, when he started at university.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1976 Robert was elected, along with two other members of the local Liberal group, to a position on the executive of the Students Representative Council and took office as honorary treasurer on 1 December 1976. With one other moderate student generally supporting the students against the more esoteric views of the four extremists, the executive that year was deadlocked at four votes all. The significance of this electoral victory cannot be overemphasised. Back in 1976 the campus mood was venomous towards Liberal students. The activism of the late 1960s over the Vietnam War and the drug crazed peace movement had been rekindled by the justifiable sacking of the Whitlam government in 1975. Yet Robert Clark and his associates had managed to take 50 per cent of the positions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For student politics, in many ways 1977 was a watershed year. Nationally, a coalition of centre&hyphen;unity ALP, Jewish, Christian and Liberal students were clamouring for a more representative and responsible national student body. Meanwhile the communists, Trotskyists and Maoists, who ran the Australian Union of Students, were resisting moves to directly elect their office&hyphen;bearers and remove a notorious electoral gerrymander and vote rigging. In a scene reminiscent of Nero's feast, they fiddled the books and sent compulsorily collected student fees to extremist causes they supported, such as the Bangsu Moro Liberation Front and the Panak People's Independence Movement, and passed resolution after resolution of the most vitriolic condemnations of Western society.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Perhaps the most memorable resolution was one supporting terrorism and hijacking as a legitimate political tactic in the struggle for a people's state&mdash;memorable not just for its inane content but also because at that time the Australian Union of Students owned the largest student travel company in the world. I suppose they took it as a badge of honour that they were the only travel proprietors to support hijacking of their own planes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no wonder a person as principled and fair&hyphen;minded as Robert Clark found it increasingly difficult to stomach these abuses. When he raised the issue of the legality of payments being made at the student executive and submitted unequivocal legal advice that supported his position, he was censured. Ultimately, it left only one course of action: litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In most places, taking legal action is a democratic right. However, in the frenzied environment of the Australian Union of Students, dominated by the opponents of Western style democracy, it was a very risky proposition. Already that year two students, Michael Danby from Melbourne University and Peter Costello from Monash University, had been physically assaulted and, in one case, hospitalised. You might think it strange that a leading member of the ALP like Michael Danby, whom I understand to be a frontrunner for Melbourne Ports preselection, was linked up with Peter Costello, an evangelical Christian and Liberal supporter. But that gives you an idea of the unrepresentative nature of the AUS leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The university had its lawyers, the SRC had its lawyers and the AUS had its lawyers all pitted against a student, Robert Clark, and his meagre legal team. The final result, however, represented nearly a complete vindication of the position argued by Robert Clark. For the first time in living memory, students on enrolment had a choice as to whether they would pay student fees. Despite the university bludgeoning students with the threat of legislation to make the fee compulsory and backdate the payment for the full year, students voted with their dollars. About half did not pay, even though it meant they were denied student services until they did.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, in one of the most perfidious and disgraceful moves ever by a Liberal government, Alan Hunt, the then minister for education, introduced legislation to make the fee compulsory again, but introduced a provision to make membership of student unions voluntary. In effect, you had to pay, but you could choose whether you got any benefit from paying. All those students who had not paid and had not used the services for the intervening period were forced to cop the full year's fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am embarrassed that this action was taken by a Liberal government. Alan Hunt infringed the freedom of association principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. What is the situation 20 years later? Even though we have coalition governments in five states, two territories and federally, not much has changed. The vice&hyphen;chancellors of Australia still act as the shop stewards of the radical Left student unions in almost every state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not even the allegedly hairy&hyphen;chested government of Joh Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen in Queensland moved to make student union fees voluntary. Sir Joh must have enjoyed the vitriolic abuse hurled at him so much that, `Golly, never you mind', it was okay to conscript National Party students and Liberal Party students into paying for the rotten eggs thrown at him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greiner and Fahey Liberal governments did nothing in New South Wales, and I do not see Premier Carr doing anything either. In South Australia, the Liberal government is sitting on its hands. In Tasmania, the governing council of Tasmania University has spooked the government into inaction by amending some of its own statutes to allow only a limited power of conscientious objection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most regrettably, in my home state of Victoria the normally `can do' government of Jeff Kennett has failed to deliver on its 1992 election promise to make student union fees voluntary. In fact Haddon Storey, in a repetition of the deceit and treachery of Alan Hunt, introduced a totally ineffectual piece of legislation that has explicitly made the fee compulsory, even though it sets some limit on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> how the fee can be spent. I can say, without any fear of contradiction, that thousands of Liberal students rejoiced that Haddon Storey chose to retire at the 1996 election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only in Western Australia&mdash;your state, Madam Acting Deputy President Knowles&mdash;is there any half&hyphen;decent legislation. It asserts that membership of and payments to student associations are entirely voluntary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Federally, the Australian Democrats have totally ignored the views of their founder, Don Chipp, who is a passionate supporter of voluntary student unionism. They have joined with the ALP. In effect, as my colleague Senator Abetz has stated on more than one occasion, the ALP has rewarded with extra federal funding the least popular and least representative organisations. The more you fail to attract members, the more money you get. Some $14,578,974 was paid by federal taxpayers in 1995&hyphen;96 to prop up these campus relics of the Stalinist era.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, following the election of the Howard government in March 1996, my Senate colleague Amanda Vanstone stopped the abuse and refused to approve any more grants. The new Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the Hon.

The statement was published on the front page of yesterday's edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Morning Bulletin</EMPHASIS> in Rockhampton.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Marek is worried about any possible compensation bill arising out of the Howard government's Native Title Amendment Bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I find this comment totally offensive. On any measure, it is a racist statement&mdash;not a word that I throw around with gay abandon, as honourable senators and others know. It should be repudiated immediately by the

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of free speech, I want to conclude tonight by reminding the Senate of the extraordinary direct attack made on the Governor-General last week by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron). The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, in an extraordinary attack on the Governor-General, told him to back off making any statements about Aboriginal affairs in Australia and said basically that he was stretching the envelope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have noted carefully all of the statements made by the Governor-General since he was appointed to that position. I am aware of the statements the Governor-General has made about the need to further and advance the reconciliation process in Australia, the need to improve the appalling health situation of Aboriginal Australians, the right of Australians to free speech, the right of church leaders to comment on matters other than helping us all to get into the bosom of Abraham at the end of our lives&mdash;not an unreasonable position when you consider that the mainstream churches in this country carry the lion's share of the burden of social welfare in Australia and think they might have a comment about it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a matter which I have raised a number of times already in this place but which I also took to the Australian Local Government Association's national assembly this morning. It is the matter of electromagnetic fields generated by power and telecommunications industries, our current standards and the relationship between those fields, the proliferation of breast cancer, childhood leukaemia and brain tumours, greenhouse gas emissions and sick buildings. I suggested to the Local Government Association that there are relatively simple solutions to some of these health and environmental problems. They are: unground cabling, easements between power and radio transmission and human habitat and the development of standards which take account of the risks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is enough evidence to show us that the Australian human exposure standards, that is AS 2771.2, do not actually protect us from cancer. I find it extraordinary that governments have been prepared to accept the increasing incidence of cancer without insisting on a better understanding of what is leading to this increase.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have tended to buy the line from the industry that all is well, and the propaganda from vested interests has been given the same or more weight than independent research. The public at large has become quite complacent in the knowledge that early detection and better treatment of cancer is reducing early mortality rates for most patients. But we are not asking why it is that more people are getting cancer or what might be the cause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The electrical power standard in Australia is 1,000 milligauss, but cancers are known to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> occur with exposures in the two milligauss to four milligauss range. Exposure to 10,000 milligauss is acceptable for up to two hours, according to our standard. Fortunately, nobody ever faces such levels. The standard for radio frequencies is 200 microwatts, but cancers are evident at 0.02 microwatts to eight microwatts. In other words, our standards are many times higher than we know to be safe. It is not just cancer that we need to worry about. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Lou Gehrig's disease are also linked to exposure to magnetic fields.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our regulations are set by the National Health and Medical Research Council, which adopted those of the International Radiation Protection Agency. It is an entirely voluntary exposure standard with no enforcement or verification program either at state or federal levels. I have said before that the evidence worldwide is mounting, and the very considerable library of material in my office, mostly from overseas, leaves me in no doubt about the risks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, given the growth in electromagnetic generating technology over recent decades, we have a very dismal record, both here and overseas, in conducting independent research into the subject. The federal government agreed a year ago to allocate $4.5 million to a 4&half; year program of research, but so far the only money which has been spent has been on public relations damage control. Of course, this happened quite early in that period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Research is very costly. Telstra, for instance, spent more than $500,000 on just one study on the effects of mobile phone emissions on mice. They were surprised to find that the rates of lymphoma were twice as high in the exposed group. When it finally emerged, the study was pretty well buried, and the Minister for Communications, the Information Economy and the Arts (Senator Alston) made jokes about the inadvisability of mice using mobile phones. That was when I asked him what the implications of this study were for health and safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is time the government got out of the pockets of the industry and got tough on electrical and telecommunications utilities. It 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9591"> is now time to introduce regulations which would protect public health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some local governments have already given up on state and federal governments and have begun to set their own standards, developing much better regulatory and planning regimes. Moreland in Victoria, Pine Rivers shire in Queensland and Sutherland shire in New South Wales are some examples. They are setting standards of two milligauss for electrical power and two microwatts for radiofrequencies. Of course, power utilities have operated in a virtual vacuum of regulation, and we also know that that was the case in telecommunications up until quite recently too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Sweden, the government acts on the presumption that exposure to power frequency electromagnetic fields is a cancer risk, and its prudent avoidance policy means that no new children's facilities are to be built in areas where ambient fields exceed two milligauss to three milligauss. In New Zealand, local government introduced radiation exposure limits in its Resources Management Act. Electromagnetic radiation is designated as a contaminant in New Zealand because it changes, or is likely to change, the physical, chemical or biological nature of the receiving environment. As a contaminant, it is controlled and restricted by regional councils.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the past 18 years evidence has been mounting about the occupational and childhood cancer risks associated with electrical magnetic fields. A rational approach to this would be to change the way that we plan and locate human habitat in relation to electrical power. The Democrats would like to see a national urban undergrounding plan developed over an agreed period of time, and we think that the utilities should be contributing at least 80 per cent of the cost of that undergrounding. In other words, we would adopt the polluter pays principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After some pressure, the federal government set up a national working party on undergrounding, which seems to have gone underground, as far as I can see. The question that needs to be asked is whether electromagnetic radiation is on their agenda. As far as I understand it, it is not. As long as it is not 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there, then polluters will evade paying their dues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Western Australian government together with the WA local government association has an undergrounding strategy. In Western Australia the storm damage is another reason for a more robust electrical distribution system. Of course, other states in the east may well face similar conditions as we experience more cyclonic and changing weather patterns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Magnetic fields are a problem for houses located near corners where there are pole transformers and where there are high and low voltage convergers. But where is this in our standards? Our standards do not deal with the health risks for librarians, for instance, yet code scanners in libraries create very hazardous electromagnetic fields. This is something that the unions are aware of, but it is not something that is taken care of by our own standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this country we have a very poor record on verifying compliance, even with our very loose standards. Last year I wrote to mobile phone carriers and phone manufacturers asking for their emission levels for the phones that they sell. They said that they could not answer my question. They did not carry out any tests and all they knew was that their phones complied with Australian standards. They said that it was up to Austel to monitor compliance. Austel, it turned out, had no testing capacity and accepted the assurances of compliance too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand that for the first time a low emission mobile phone has now been developed and is being promoted in Europe. For a defensive and an evasive industry which denies that there might even be a problem, this is a very important breakthrough. One might talk about it in terms of breaking ranks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If Australia is to be taken seriously as a clever country, gearing up for high-tech markets, it must recognise that research into technology which reduces electromagnetic emissions is the way of the future. What do we know in this country about shielding alloys? This is a manufacturing industry with huge potential for new skills and new jobs. But first and foremost we need simple and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9592"> transparent standards. We need to be confident of compliance and we need to be given informed choices so that, at the very least, consumers can make judgments for themselves about prudent avoidance.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9592"><TITLE>Waterfront Reform</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Few would argue that one of the major reforms this government has introduced is in the area of industrial relations: namely, the Workplace Relations Bill. The thrust of the government's workplace relations legislation has been to free up the old rigidities of the workplace in order to link wage negotiations directly with productivity improvement and to give employers and employees the primary responsibility for determining matters affecting their relationship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very clear break from the past, when the emphasis was on centralised determination of wages and conditions through awards determined by the Industrial Relations Commission. However, down on the waterfront, reform is non-existent, to the detriment of the rest of Australia. This is detrimental not only for Australian exporters and importers but also for so many Australians that seek genuine and secure employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inefficiencies and outright rorting occurring on our waterfront are such that the flow&hyphen;on effect is found in increased business costs which affect the ability to employ. Product costs eat into the family household budget, and waterfront inefficiencies and strike action deter new investment in this country. The level of industrial action on the waterfront is unacceptably high. In 1996 there were 1,250 working days lost per 1,000 employees compared with an all industries average of 131 per 1,000. That is a ratio of 10 to one. Australia, with two per cent of the world's shipping trade, has the highest level of industrial unrest with 23 per cent of days lost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While all sectors are affected by Australia's disgraceful waterfront, I particularly single out the farm sector&mdash;a major export industry. Given the major markets to which we export and the fact that these markets require on&hyphen;the&hyphen;spot delivery dates, every time the Marine 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Union strikes, our reliability as a supplier is diminished and frequently markets have been lost. It is true to say that the flow&hyphen;on effect goes right down to the farm gate, where asset values of the farm itself are affected. It was found with the improvement of ports in New Zealand over the past decade it could be calculated that the asset values of properties in New Zealand rose.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a competitive international market, reliability is everything. I want to refer to one particular industry in the rural sector, the wool industry. This industry was responsible for $3.2 billion in export earnings in 1995-96, and even a marginal improvement in waterfront performance promises substantial returns. Wool represents the largest containerised export from Australia, with about 40,000 containers of wool exported per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Wool exporting is a very complex operation. The coordination involved is further highlighted by the typical requirement for wool to be shipped from the export port within two weeks of purchase. Many consignments include multiple containers loaded at more than one port. They face financial penalties if the wool misses the ship, as they are not paid until all of the consignment is delivered to overseas mills.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Exporters experience frustration when, after successfully organising their own part of the logistical task, they are unable to have their consignments delivered on time to overseas mills because of delays and inflexibilities on the Australian waterfront. Difficulties occur at two stages at the port terminals. Firstly, at some terminals wool exporters experience difficulty in obtaining time slots for trucks delivering containers to the terminals. The second type of difficulty concerns the reliability of ship schedules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inefficiencies on the waterfront are well documented. In fact, they are folklore. One notable benchmark is the crane rates per hour, which is a vital statistic given the obvious flow&hyphen;on effects to ship turnaround times, truck delivery times and stevedoring charges. The added costs are obvious. Let us consider the flow-on effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In September 1997, the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics' publication 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9593"> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waterline</EMPHASIS> reports that the five-port average is 18.3 containers per hour. On the basis of the available information, the government considers that a reasonable achievable initial target and the basis for continuing improvement in Australia is the five-port average crane rate of 25 containers per hour, not the existing 18.3. Such an improvement could be expected to reduce typical ship turnaround times by the order of one day. The flow-on effects are obvious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Industry sources suggest that delays in Australian ports accounted for an average of 1.5 days delay per voyage. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waterline</EMPHASIS> article indicates that there were average delays of approximately three hours per ship visit at overseas ports in 1995 and 1996. Using those figures, the three&hyphen;hour delay estimate is the best practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An achievement of best practice in Australia would result in a reduction of port delays of one day per voyage. This would flow on to a reduction in voyage times and ship tie&hyphen;up times which is estimated at $16,000 per day. This one&hyphen;day saving equivalent then would also flow on to stevedoring charges, and it is estimated that a saving of about 10 per cent would be achieved under the 25 containers per hour benchmark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A 10 per cent reduction in stevedoring charges would amount to about $20 per container. This modest reduction in stevedoring charges would result in savings to the industry of $42 million per year. This then would have a flow-on effect to the road transport charges, or truck slot times, with the delivery of containers, where truck turnaround times have recently averaged 1.5 hours compared with the agreed achievable target of 30 minutes; so truck times would fall from 1.5 hours to 30 minutes. This has been estimated as a saving of around $14 million per year at the Sydney port alone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The core of the problem, needless to say, is the Maritime Workers Union. It has taken on the attitude of invincibility. It is no exaggeration to say that the MUA, backed by the ACTU, run the ports. The two stevedoring companies are hardly in control of operations. Consequently, their profits are underperforming, if not in the negative.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The extraordinary rorts that occur on the wharves were best highlighted in a paper produced by the minister in charge of the waterfront, Peter Reith, focusing on what was considered to be one of the better ports, Cairns, and the payments received by members of the Waterside Workers Union. For example, on a Sunday, it was recorded in Peter Reith's paper that the average hours actually worked were only 4.5. It was also recorded that some of the employees regularly go home two hours before the end of the shift but still receive the same pay; they are paid for up to 22.05 hours on a Sunday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year the average grade 3 waterside worker in the same port&mdash;that is, Cairns&mdash;earned nearly $84,000, and spent almost one day in five at home on full pay. Waterside workers are on a 35&hyphen;hour week, and have been for many years, but the effective rate is really 31 hours. The total of days available to work the 6.25 hours in a day is 175.5 in a year. The number of days absent on full pay is 85.5, or 17.1 weeks. So Peter Reith's paper goes on, naming every rort from being paid during tea and meal breaks to walking time, dust time, and so on. As I said in my opening remarks, the matter of the waterfront is folklore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not convinced that the existing stevedores can be relied upon to bring about change, even for their own good. The answer lies more in there being new entrants into the industry, new ports and privatisation of ports, and new unions in competition with the old, or workplace reforms. While the task is great, it is necessary.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9593"><TITLE>Mr Alan Hunt</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Synon tonight made a very nasty and vicious attack on a very honourable Victorian Liberal by the name of Mr Alan Hunt. Alan Hunt has been a member of the Liberal Party&mdash;and still is&mdash;for something like a duration of 40 years. He has served the Liberal Party loyally and well. I say that he deserved better than to be described tonight as treacherous. He has always had the respect of the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than delay the Senate, I just give notice that tomorrow night on the adjournment I not only intend to defend Alan Hunt from the vicious attack made on him tonight by Senator Synon; I also intend to have a close look at Senator Synon's political links in Victoria and how the Kennett government rewarded her not only in terms of employment but in terms of putting her in this place.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="7.55 p.m." PAGE="9594"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 7.55 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>
