<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will support the proposal that has been moved by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Ian Campbell) that government business notice of motion No. 1 be postponed to a later hour this day. I draw the Senate's attention to the implications of this for the Senate's program. I am particularly concerned that the government has not brought the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  on for debate today and, according to the order of business, has no intention of bringing that particular government business order of the day on for debate today. In fact, it does not propose to bring the legislation on for debate until after the dinner adjournment tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be of concern to all senators that, on the first day of the last week of the scheduled sittings for this year, the government is still not proposing to bring the bill on until late tomorrow. Not only has the government not brought this important legislation on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for debate, it has listed some nine bills or packages of bills ahead of the Native Title Amendment Bill on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> today. That ought to be of massive concern to the Senate and to the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone with an interest in the native title issue should take note that in the government's view all this other legislation is of higher priority and of more importance than the native title bill. The Senate is entitled to an explanation from the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Hill). I request, Madam President, that Senator Hill provide the Senate with an explanation after question time today as to why it is that all these bills are, in the government's view, of higher priority for debate than the native title bill. That goes for the superannuation package, the  Wheat Marketing Amendment Bill 1997 , which I understand has only a short amount of time remaining for debate, the   Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997 , the  Social Security Legislation Amendment (Parenting and Other Measures) Bill 1997 , the  States Grants (General Purposes) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1997  and the migration legislation package. Perhaps Senator Hill could inform the Senate after question time today why it is the government's view that the  Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1997 , the  Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Bill 1997  and the  Migration Agents Registration Renewal Charge Bill 1997  are all of higher importance, of greater significance and priority, than the native title bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While he is at it, he could deal with the other bills that are on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> and that are to be considered before debate is scheduled for the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997&mdash; the  Productivity Commission Bill 1996 , the  Productivity Commission (Repeals, Transitional and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1996  and so on. It is of concern to me that we have the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) saying to the Australian Senate that we ought to get on with the job. On 16 November, Mr Howard said, `Tell the Senate to get on with the job.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>  program on 21 November 1997, Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9204">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The average Australian I speak to is heartily sick of this issue&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Let me interpolate&mdash;the issue is the issue of the Wik legislation. Mr Howard said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The average Australian is saying to me, `Get the thing through. Get it out of the way. We are fed up hearing about it.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We are saying to the government, `Bring the bill on. The time has come; get it out of the way.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me also say that there had been an understanding that the government would be using the time after the dinner suspension tonight, on a no divisions no quorum basis, to get right into the second reading debate on this bill. There was also an agreement on a no divisions, no quorum basis to continue after the dinner suspension tomorrow night so that we could conclude the second reading debate. The committee stage of the native title bill could then have commenced on Wednesday morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to the government's own order of business, we do not have any other intention from the government but to start the second reading debate on this legislation on the same basis&mdash;that is, no divisions, no quorums&mdash;after the suspension of the sitting for dinner tomorrow. There are at least 14 speakers from the government alone who flagged their intention to speak on this bill, and probably an equal number from the opposition. No doubt, many minor party senators and Independent senators also want to make a contribution, and I do not decry that in any way. This is amongst the most important legislation that will be dealt with during the life of this parliament, and I am sure senators on both sides of the chamber would agree with that. There is a significant number who want to make a contribution and there is a need for them to be able to do that in the time that is available. But it is not satisfactory to have this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It ought to be noted that the Manager of Government Business, Senator Campbell, wrote to all parties in the chamber on 22 October seeking agreement to sit an extra week. He said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government intends to deal with the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 in the week commencing November 24th.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These two sitting weeks will provide over 40 hours to debate the Native Title Amendment Bill.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator Robert Ray</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sixty-six per cent last week.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, last week 66 per cent of the Senate's time was dedicated to government business. This is just unheard of in the Senate. We have a situation where the government is applying this sort of leverage to the Senate to say, `We'll get on with an important piece of legislation that Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, demands the Senate get on with. We'll get on with it after every other piece of legislation and everything else the government in the Senate determines it wants to do, but only then.' Mr Howard should get the message across to those in the Senate who are responsible for ensuring that his will is carried out. Quite clearly, the government in the Senate does not seem to have the same intentions as the Prime 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9205"> Minister. This is a very serious issue for all of us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask that the Leader of the Government in the Senate come forward after question time today and in a brief statement outline to the Senate the government's intentions in relation to the  Native Title Amendment Bill . I think the Senate is entitled to an explanation from Senator Hill as to why this other legislation has priority over the Native Title Amendment Bill  and why the government proposes to commence debate on the second reading stage of this legislation on Tuesday evening when senators agreed informally that it would be appropriate to allow that particular time. That is extra sitting time too, I might say. As you would be aware, Madam President, the Senate does not normally sit on a Tuesday evening. It was informally agreed that that time would be used to conclude&mdash;on a `no quorums, no divisions' basis&mdash;the second reading debate on this bill so that the committee stage of the bill could commence on Wednesday morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would know, Madam President&mdash;and I am sure all senators in the chamber would know&mdash;that unless we do what the Prime Minister asks&mdash;that is, get on with the debate as soon as possible&mdash;it is going to be extremely difficult to conclude it in the time remaining for the Senate. The opposition has already said, `Yes, sure, sit an extra week to allow the last two weeks of the sittings for this year to be effectively dedicated to this important issue that remains to be dealt with by the Senate.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe that Mr Howard's entreaties, which were for the Senate to get on with the job, are ones that Mr Howard's colleagues over here ought to take seriously. I am disappointed that the government in the Senate appears willing to defy the commitment that the Prime Minister has given and the intentions that the Prime Minister has so clearly expressed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While the cat's away, the mice will play.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is probably right. But I think the mice are playing games other than just this one, as you would know, Senator Ray. I understand that the phones are running hot in Mr Reith's and Mr Costello's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> offices at this time, and no doubt we will see a lot of grandstanding. I predict that in the House of Representatives in question time this week we will see a lot of posturing from those who are tilting as alternative leaders of the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the serious issue here is that Mr Howard has said to get on with the job and that is what ought to be done. I think Senator Hill owes the Senate an explanation and, through you, Madam President, I ask that he provide the chamber with that explanation after question time today. I do not think that we can take seriously any contribution that might be made on these issues by the Manager of Government Business. That is why I think the Leader of the Government in the Senate ought to come down and explain to us what is happening. I think that is not unreasonable in these circumstances, particularly given what the Prime Minister has said in relation to the importance of this debate and the public expectation that the Senate will start to deal with the Native Title Amendment Bill  as soon as possible.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall not be long because we do need to focus on the matters that are before us. But I must say in fairness to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Ian Campbell) that he has made it perfectly clear to me in all events&mdash;whether he has made it clear to anybody else I do not know&mdash;that the government was looking at reducing to a bare minimum the number of pieces of legislation it wants the parliament to have considered by Christmas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last week we did have a quite extensive debate on Public Service and other issues, but that was unavoidable. I hope that the minister concerned understands that we did have a look at that and looked at the amended legislation on its merits. I believe the government, if it examined the amendments that the Senate has passed, could live with them. If the legislation does come back here, I hope it does so in a form that we can deal with with due alacrity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, I say in fairness to the Manager of Government Business that he has made that very clear. This may well take a little more 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9206"> time. I indicate to the Manager of Government Business just as an aside that it is a little surprising to me that the Wik bill is to be adjourned till after the superannuation legislation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator Ian Campbell</NAME></TALKER>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry. It is on. That is fine. I do not intend to do anything other than my best to honour what I thought was my response to the government, recognising that it has concertinaed its legislative program to deal with the essential matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Native Title Amendment Bill  is an extraordinarily important piece of legislation that is coming before us. We will need to examine that and discharge it in the manner in which we have responsibility to do so. We are the legislators. We need to respond to not only Wik but also Brandy and a couple of other decisions. I think those amendments that will make the Native Title Act fully workable will be welcomed on all sides of the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need to respond to the Wik decision. We should bear in mind Graham Hiley's preface to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wik Case Issues and Implications</EMPHASIS> by Butterworth:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wik decision</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All that the decision did was to hold that the granting of a pastoral lease, whether or not the lease has now expired or has otherwise been terminated, did not necessarily extinguish all native title rights and interests that might otherwise exist.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Bearing that in mind, and bearing in mind the fact that quite a large range of questions arise from that for us and not the courts to determine if we are to act as legislators, we will need a considerable amount of time to deal with that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is my view and I think the view of most of us that the legislation should be determined before Christmas. I make it perfectly clear that I am prepared to meet on Friday of this week and Friday of next week and every night this week, next week and the week after as well if that is what it takes to deal with this matter properly and effectively and with fairness and justice. I am prepared to sit as necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine makes the point that the government is entitled to its concertinaed legislation. I agree with that basically. But I do reflect back, Senator Harradine, that on two occasions in the period 1995-96 we actually had agreements from the then opposition to get to a certain point in the program before we departed. On both occasions their word was betrayed. On both occasions the chamber got up before we got to that&mdash;that is, after I and others jettisoned off a whole range of legislation to get the program down to a minimum. On two occasions we did not even get to the minimum. On one occasion Senator Hill told us we would, and then he disappeared off overseas and the rest of the coalition went home. So that happened on two occasions towards the end of the Keating government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is about leverage. This is about saying, `Wik is essentially so important that we can take the opportunistic tactic of putting everything else on before it rather than after it.' You ask yourself, `Why not get on with Wik and put these other legislative items on afterwards?' The simple reason is that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Ian Campbell) cannot hold his backbench on this. He knows that when they get the smell of a water hole they will be off home. That is why these particular bills have been shoved in before Wik, because he cannot control his own backbench. `Shove them all in now' is the argument.</PARA>

In fact, I would keep a bit of a low profile, if I were you, after your grand statement hidden away in Western Australia about the wonderful region of Canberra. I would hide from that and from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Times</EMPHASIS>  article exposing your horrible past with the left&hyphen;wing Democrats.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the things we feel a bit annoyed about is that we were approached to sit on Tuesday to conclude second readings. You are proposing now apparently to not start second readings until Tuesday night.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And you accepted it. I see; you do not have to keep your word when you accept an offer, only when you make one. That has established a new principle in managing this particular system. Nevertheless, it is unrealistic on your current program to finish second readings on Tuesday. One wonders, given the fact that you have other government business on Wednesday, when exactly you will finish the second readings on this particular matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I suppose what irritated me the most was reading in the press the grandstanding by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on the Senate and Wik. The implication of what he was saying is, `Nasty old Senate won't deal with Wik. Why don't they get on with the job? Why doesn't the Senate address this legislation and dispose of it?' We have had the answer today. We will not do that, because these opportunists opposite want to use Wik as leverage to get other legislation through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, has made a very valid point. We will not deal with it now, but we at least expect Senator Hill to come in and outline to the Senate when in fact the government intend to deal with Wik and how they intend to deal with it. That would be useful for the process and progressing of the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 . But it is disappointing, as Senator Faulkner has pointed out, to find that the Prime Minister so lacks authority these days that even the humble 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Manager of Government Business can snub his nose at him while the Prime Minister is in Vancouver and not bring this on for debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make only two other points. I thought we had been relatively cooperative in the government's legislative program. The opposition has not moved any urgency motions or MPIs for two or three weeks. We agreed to sit later on Tuesday and later on Wednesday night and to give up Wednesday general matters of public interest across the non&hyphen;controversial legislation. So, having done that, we have tried to get this particular program going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But it raises one other question. Normally, before today's performance, we would have been willing to give up our general business on Thursday night or make arrangements to take government business through to a certain point and start general business a lot later, on the same sort of no divisions no quorums basis. We are going to have to revisit that, because we do have at least one important item that we want considered this year. Rather than give that up, we may have to reconsider that. If you want to get cooperation on these particular matters, you should be fairly transparent with us on exactly what you intend to do. The questions for Senator Hill to come down and answer are when is he going to start Wik, when does he anticipate the second readings to be completed by and when is the committee stage to start.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I just wanted to as briefly as possible put the government's point of view. It has been made clear, as Senator Harradine said, from the outset, when negotiations for an extra sitting week began some weeks ago, that the government's agenda, as it was put down at that stage, envisaged commencing debate on the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  today. That was prefaced on a program that allowed time for the debate of a range of other bits of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The record of the Senate shows that in that time it has made reasonably good progress with a number of bills. However, last week we had a program that had a number of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9208"> pieces of legislation on it and the only difference between the program of the Senate at 12.30 last Monday and the program of the Senate at 12.30 today is that the Senate was able to deal with effectively one piece of legislation&mdash;that was the Public Service Bill. We finished the child-care debate, so that was passed within the first hour or so last Monday. Apart from that, the Senate sat for one entire day plus two half days and dealt with one piece of legislation. The record will show that the consideration of that legislation was lengthy. I have the statistics on how long each speaker spoke for during that debate. All the people involved in that debate have indicated that the debate went for much longer than it should have gone for.</PARA>

Just about everybody is in Canberra already; you could have had a no divisions/no quorum situation and actually got three hours of second reading debate out of the way by now. But the opposition said, `No, we don't want to do that.' We made them an offer to actually start the native title debate at 9.30 this morning. That was rejected, so they are not particularly serious.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Faulkner, I would commend that you look at that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> . The coalition at that stage&mdash;the opposition&mdash;guaranteed the government its entire program. Senator Hill, the then Leader of the Opposition, signed off a list with Senator Faulkner, the then Manager of Government Business in the Senate, and said, `We will complete all of this legislation.' At 4.09 on that day&mdash;the final scheduled day of sitting&mdash;Senator Gareth Evans came into this place and brought on the native title debate. He brought it on after we had completed every other single piece of legislation. As I recall, after the native </PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All the coalition ever said is that we want to allow a full debate on the native title legislation and we also want to get these other pieces of legislation done. We have also, as Senator Harradine was kind enough to point out, taken out of the package every single piece of legislation that we can do without. We need the super bills, and senators involved in that debate know why. We need to debate all of the other packages. They could all be debated fairly quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite frankly, from what I have been told, had we started the legislative program at 12.30 p.m. we would have already completed the wheat bill by now. We would now have been debating the superannuation package and been well on the way to debating native title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I ask senators to respect the fact that we can only put a program forward and we can suggest how long each item should take. But ultimately, when the native title debate starts&mdash;or when the debate on any bill starts&mdash;is entirely in the hands of senators. If you want to talk ad nauseam on any bill, we could be here forever. The priority that senators give to each piece of legislation is not entirely up to the government to determine.</PARA>

If that is the priority you gave native title in 1993 and you want to compare our record, please feel free to do so. Senator Chris Evans, in supporting Senator Faulkner, has made a stupid and pathetic comment in regard to the way in which the importance of the native title legislation should be assessed. He says, `Oh, the importance of the legislation is where we put it in our program.' If that is the case, the Native Title Bill in 1993 was ranked about 149th because that is where you brought it on.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government continues to seek agreement to adjourn the sittings of the Senate at the conclusion of consideration of the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, including any messages received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have indicated that the Labor Party is prepared to sit the extra week (commencing December 1st), but has not agreed to the adjournment resolution which aims to deal with the Bill this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have consulted the relevant Minister and confirm that the Government has not received an undertaking from the ALP about the Senate concluding consideration of the Native Title Amendment Bill prior to the conclusion of these sittings. I request a re&hyphen;consideration of this position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You may recall that at the end of the Autumn and Winter sittings (despite indications to the contrary) the Opposition denied the Government the opportunity to complete its program. On both occasions the Government had reduced the number of bills for consideration, but nevertheless key legislation was not dealt with. This is despite the fact that extensions of just a few hours could have accommodated their consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, I refer to the Senate's failure to deal with the Superannuation package and the message on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill at the end of the Autumn sittings along with the subsequent failure to deal with the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill No. 3 1997 at the end of the Winter sittings. This was a contrary to requests that we adjourn at the conclusion of consideration of these bills and undertakings that the ALP will "look at how we are going closer to the time".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In previous years the former Government was not denied its program. In 1993 the Senate continued to sit until the Native Title Bill was passed, even though there were over 200 amendments and the Bill was not brought on for debate until the final scheduled sitting day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our proposal allows approximately 40 hours for debate of the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, with more hours available should parties decide they are necessary.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I write in response to your letter of 29 October about the legislation program for the Senate for the remainder of this sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, I reiterate that the Opposition is prepared to sit during the extra week from 1 December if this is necessary to conclude debate on this bill, subject to the Government agreeing to the necessary supplementation of travel and staff allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware we have already given an undertaking in writing that we will cooperate in dealing with this Bill. I am therefore puzzled by your representation of the Opposition's position on this issue and can only assume that at the time of writing, your colleagues in the House of Representatives had not seen fit to inform you of that undertaking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you anticipate, presumably on the basis of your negotiations with the minor parties, that two weeks or more will be needed to deal with the Bill, you might consider bringing the Bill on before 24 November. It is now available for debate in the Senate and we see no reason why it should be delayed until the last week of the scheduled sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With two and a half weeks of scheduled sittings remaining we certainly do not see the need to sit for more than one additional week. You should know that agreement to an open&hyphen;ended adjournment is an invitation to dilatoriness and filibuster. As I have already informed you, if debate is not concluded by 5 December, the Opposition remains open to discussions with the Government for additional time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to the argumentation in your letter, I cannot let it go uncontested. If  you examine the record when Labor was in government you will find that we often ended a sitting period having to carry over essential legislation to the next sittings. In at least two cases, commitments given by the then Opposition as to the completion of the program were reneged on.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You imply (incorrectly) that a short extension of time at the conclusion of the Autumn sittings would have enabled the Senate to deal with the Superannuation package and the message on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was at the leaders and whips meeting when the issue of the timing of the start of the debate on the second reading of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  was discussed. At the time I wanted to clarify with the Manager of Government Business and the Leader of the Government in the Senate what the program was that they wanted to get through. They said, `We want to get all of these bills through.' I made the suggestion at the leaders and whips meeting, which was agreed to, that we could start and endeavour to finish the debate on the second reading on Monday and Tuesday so that people knew when that would be taking place. Given that it was likely that there would still be committee stages of other bills left over, that gave us the leeway to deal with those after the debate on the second reading of the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Amendment Bill 1997</XREF> . It is inevitable that there will be extra toing&hyphen;and&hyphen;froing on  amendments or&mdash;and I absolutely guarantee this&mdash;in dealing with such a complex and difficult issue, there will be times in the debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill when we will need to break and there will need to be legislation to go on with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I asked this in case we were to be required somehow to finish every other piece of legislation on the government's wish list before starting the native title debate&mdash;like kids: you have to eat your greens before you get your dessert. Not that I ever thought we should be forced in this way&mdash;as you know, I voted against dealing with this legislation because I do not believe that there has been proper consultation or that we should force it on in this way. Given that, I said it was reasonable for the people in the community to know when the second reading was going to be debated. That was actually agreed in the leaders and whips meeting. It was agreed that we could, if necessary, go back to the finishing&hyphen;off stages of other bills once we had finished the debate on the second reading of the Native Title Amendment Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether we have had any further meetings; I am sure that I have not been at any meetings since then where the government has got a new agreement from the people there. It was made quite clear that the parties' agreement in relation to the timing and the extra week was on the basis that that would be the start of that debate. I was here in 1993 when the filibustering went on and on. I cannot see anyone in this chamber who has any great desire to filibuster during the committee stage of the bill that we are meant to be dealing with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to point out that the original agreement, as I understand it, on the Friday and Thursday swap was that it was the Friday that was being held back for estimates hearings. I was quite surprised, as you know, to find out that we had a Thursday estimates hearing instead of leaving that for Friday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I actually asked the government, at that time, why they brought it on so quickly and why they were so eager to put that through on behalf of the opposition. They could have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9213"> stood up against that. There were potentially the numbers in the Senate to deal with that and to say, `Okay, let's go back to the original agreement; let's use Friday for estimates; let's use Thursday for this.' It was not a matter of whether or not we sat during Senate estimates times; it was a matter of whether or not the Friday that was being left aside for Senate estimates was used for Senate estimates instead of swapping over to Thursday. But it was put through so quickly that we did not have a debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there are a lot of very silly things going on at the moment. All I can say is that if, at the end of this fortnight, someone puts a motion that the Senate do now adjourn, I will probably put my hand up and say, `Okay, let's do what we should do and sensibly deal with this legislation.' If the government cannot do the right thing and keep to agreements that it has made at leaders and whips meetings, it is a wonder anybody bothers turning up. We should at least deal with the second reading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bit much for the government to suggest that we go on to second readings of other bills that they want on next year's agenda if we get to a gap in the program in dealing with the Native Title Amendment Bill, which we are certain to do. It is very rich indeed if they are suggesting that we should go on to next year's program rather than sensibly deal with any leftovers from this year's program during any gaps of proceedings in the Native Title Amendment Bill debate. This does not make any sense at all, and is going against any agreements that we have made.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments that I draw your attention to relate to the issue of ministerial patronage. We as a party are concerned&mdash;and I believe that we as a Senate should be most concerned&mdash;to ensure always that ministerial patronage has appropriate constraints. It is one of those areas which has increased in focus as the accountability drum has been beaten harder around the democracies of the civilised 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9214"> world. It was the Nolan committee in the United Kingdom which, after years of what can be regarded as an art form in the United Kingdom&mdash;that is, the ability, arising from government patronage, to put your mates into appropriate positions&mdash;finally felt that they had had enough and laid down some principles and procedures whereby ministerial patronage would be constrained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem with having appointments based purely on ministerial discretion, which can of course be terminated when governments change, is that political patronage can move along eventually to the American model where administrations and people in the boards, authorities and committees which are so vital to our administration are changed over at will. That does not accord with our view as to independence and probity whereby boards and committees should be invested with appropriate persons. Ministerial patronage of that sort conflicts with the notion of having statutory authorities which are independent of and at arm's length from government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I have here in amendments builds on the recommendation of the Nolan committee in the United Kingdom, which was accepted by the Conservative government there, but it is a watered&hyphen;down version, because I am aware from previous debates that government is sensitive to protecting its ability to appoint to boards and authorities. In moving these three amendments, I should say that what we have focused on is the issue that appointment should be on the basis of merit. At page 45, item 53, clause 15A, appointment of ordinary members, the bill says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The Minister must not appoint a person as an ordinary member unless, in the opinion of the Minister, the person has expertise in one or more of the following fields:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the production, marketing or processing of grain;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the production or marketing of other products;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) business management;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) product promotion;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) finance.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) In appointing persons as ordinary members, the Minister must endeavour to ensure, as far as practicable, that there is among the ordinary members a balance of skills in the areas of production, marketing and finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Before appointing a person as an ordinary member, the Minister must consult the President of the Grains Council in relation to the appointment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So we see a limited form of consultation and we see the spelling out of a functional approach to appointments but not a merit based approach. My amendments seek to do the following, and I will read them to you:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Minister must by writing determine a code of practice for appointments to the Board that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> sets out general principles on which appointments of ordinary members to the Board are to be made, including, but not limited to:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (iv)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> openness and transparency;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those I have taken directly from the UK Nolan committee's recommendation. The amendment continues:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> sets out how these principles are to be applied to the selection of members.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So we still leave it within the minister's purview, but the minister must do it against a set of criteria which establish merit, independence, openness and transparency. Ministers will universally say to us, `Look, that is how we do things anyway.' That may be true of some ministers but it is not true of all ministers. Ministers vary in quality and ability, as we all do in this place, and it is appropriate for legislation to lay down the criteria and standards that are necessary. My amendment goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> After determining a code of practice under subsection (1), the Minister must publish the code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Not later than every third anniversary after a code of practice has been determined, the Minister must review the code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In reviewing a code of practice&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Not in drawing it up but in reviewing a code&mdash; </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9215">
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Minister must invite the public to comment on the code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A code of practice determined under subsection (1) is a disallowable instrument . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Particularly important is my amendment to 15C, independence of the board, which says:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In appointing ordinary members, the Minister must ensure that the balance of interests on the Board is such that no one interest may dominate the Board or derogate from its independence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So the two hands on which this amendment rests are the hand of transparency, openness, independence and selection on merit; and, secondly, not only does it say independence but it says that the board should not be subject to capture by any one interest, either through appointment of political interests or commercial interests or of particular professional interests on a board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Everyone in this place knows that within the farming community there has been in the past concern that particular boards and authorities have been captured by particular interests. It is my belief that the farming community as a whole would like to be assured that that is not possible. So I have retained or left the ability for the minister to exercise his or her jurisdiction but I have qualified it in terms of accountability measures which set out appointment on the basis of merit and independence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those, as a result, do nothing to take away from the intention of the bill and do nothing to take away from the determination that the bill makes in terms of the appointment of ordinary members in terms of their functional skills, but it does add considerably to the bill in terms of reassuring the community and the farming organisations and farmers affected that appointments will be made on a proper independent basis and one based on merit. I therefore commend my amendments to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Murray for his comments, but I would also like to make some comments on his amendments, which the government will not be supporting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The key consideration in appointments to the Australian Wheat Board is obviously the highest level of capability in specified areas of expertise. These are covered very well in clause 15A, which outlines the expertise that Senator Murray did summarise. Board members must be skilled in those areas, and this is provided for in the bill. I should point out that normal practice requires that those people who are to be appointed also provide the minister with written statements that their appointments would not cause any conflict of interest and that their tax affairs would not cause any embarrassment. This amendment would add very little to the present process and the intent of the proposed board selection is to simplify the process, not make it more complicated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate should also recognise that the appointments outlined in this would only be from November 1998 to the end of June 1999, when the statutory board expires along with the government's borrowing guarantee. Consequently, the full&hyphen;blown separate selection process is not warranted, and it would be extremely costly and time consuming. Indeed, after 1999, the board will no longer have responsibility for financial or marketing aspects anyway. This matter was not raised in the Senate report and therefore the government will not be supporting the Democrat amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would indicate, on behalf of the opposition, that we will not support the amendments moved by the Democrats. Firstly, I should say that we do not have any argument as such with the substance of what Senator Murray has put with respect to what should be the case when members of boards are appointed by ministers or by governments. We all agree that all appointments should be on the basis of merit and should be on the basis of endeavouring to ensure that various interests are represented. They should not be on the basis of pure political patronage or for favours owed or for some other criteria. Clearly, the person who is appointed should possess the skills warranted for the task at hand. </PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9216">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the amendments put forward by the Democrats are essentially window&hyphen;dressing. The Democrat amendments still leave it clearly within the gift of the minister to make the appointments and to actually determine what the code of practice should be. Whilst it is proposed in the amendments to set out general principles, I would suggest that those general principles are ones which, given the need for flexibility in these circumstances, are nevertheless what are in place and should be followed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there are issues that arise in due course about the performance of board members of any government authority, statutory authority or whatever, then they are able to be taken up by members of parliament through the parliamentary process, the Senate estimates committees and so on. We fail to see how the Democrat amendments will do anything to enhance the objectives that Senator Murray has espoused. As I said, we do not argue that these are important considerations but we say that they are essentially already in place. These amendments do not take the matter any further one iota.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murray, despite all of your pious words and noble objectives, you are still saying very clearly that it is the minister who actually determines the code of practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to make a couple of other points, and Senator Troeth, the parliamentary secretary, has raised the obvious one; that is, what we are dealing with here in this legislation is the first part of a two&hyphen;part legislative change that will ultimately see the abolition of the Australian Wheat Board and the functions of the AWB taken over by listed companies on the Stock Exchange. I would have thought, Senator Murray, that if you had concerns about this issue you may have been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prepared to support our amendment, which was moved in the second reading debate. That was to postpone further consideration of all of this legislation until we saw what was in the second tranche of legislation to come next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are concerns about the future structure of the companies that will manage the marketing of wheat and there are concerns, as we and the farmers groups have pointed out, about taxation considerations. But Senator Troeth is right in making the point that, under the proposals as they are at the moment, the AWB will cease to exist in June 1999. So your amendment is related to a body which has a very short life span left and, in that sense, is rather insignificant in terms of what is really to follow&mdash;that is, the new structure under which wheat marketing will operate in this country. Of course, under the new structure, the companies that will be put into place will be listed on the Stock Exchange. Shares will be traded and directors of the companies will be elected by the shareholders or by the members affected. So, as Senator Troeth has said, this proposal, at the end of the day, is irrelevant for the purposes of the future structure that will exist in the wheat industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are all of the comments I have on this aspect. I do have some other questions that I wanted to ask the parliamentary secretary. If anyone wanted to comment on this they could or I could proceed to those questions.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the inference from Senator Forshaw was that I should wrap this up so that he can proceed to other matters. In response to the parliamentary secretary, these amendments would add very little cost to the process of appointments, but they would add a great deal of probity and merit to the method of appointment. With regard to the fact that the board expires in 1999, I think we should still endeavour to ensure that the very best board is available until that date. I am sure that the parliamentary secretary would agree with that. You would not want to have half-timers or part-timers, without their hearts in the job, governing the board until that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9217">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to come back to Senator Forshaw's remarks. One of the advantages of being a Democrat senator is that there are so few of us that each has to do a great deal of work across a large number of portfolios. So I recall events in other portfolios which you might not have had access to, Senator Forshaw. One of those events was the debate on the CASA board. In that debate, I introduced much tougher amendments&mdash;and Labor, as expected, then knocked them over.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I will be doing from now on, every time a board or authority comes up, is producing amendments of this sort, varied according to the circumstances. I am going to push the noses of both major parties up against the windowpane of accountability. Frankly, the executive on the right side of the chair and the executive in waiting on the left side of the chair enjoy the business of political patronage, enjoy giving jobs to mates. They will resist anything which seeks to constrain that, and they will find all sorts of reasons. Over time, I am going accumulate your reasons. You will give such reasons as `oh, badly drafted' or `oh, not relevant' or `oh, but you've still given it to the minister.' I will accumulate all your excuses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end, all it will come to is a fat zero on accountability, because the Labor Party is incapable of overturning a system which benefits it when it is in government. And the government certainly will not want to overturn a system which, after 13 years, will allow it to try a little bit of patronage of its own. That is an area which, as I say, is being addressed in other civilised democracies worldwide. In this particular case, the Democrats will lead the agenda again, and again, and again, until eventually we get the government to submit in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So do not think that this area of independence, of probity, of appointment on merit, of the destruction of the culture of mateship, is going to end with this bill. We will come at you again and again. I commend my amendments to you.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I invite you to read the speech made by Senator Woodley in the second reading debate. Senator Woodley, on behalf of the Democrats, stood up in this chamber and said that he had great concerns about the issue of the future taxation arrangements with respect to wheat growers and their equity in the wheat industry fund. He said that he had great concerns about the fact that the government was seeking to put through only the first stage of legislation, and nobody had yet had a chance to see the second part of the legislation. He referred to the fact that that is what the growers and the industry in Western Australia and New South Wales were saying. They were pleading with the Democrats, as they were with other members of the parliament here, to delay this legislation because of their serious concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is in Western Australia&mdash;your home state, Senator Murray. The people vitally affected by this legislation, Senator Murray, were asking you to stand up for their rights and their interests. Senator Murray, you ignored them; you squibbed it. Between those two states, those people represent somewhere around about 75 per cent of wheat marketing and exporting in this country. But, in the end, the Democrats voted with the government, and I invite you to read Senator Woodley's 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9218"> comments. He said that he voted with the government at the end of the day because he had listened to the Queensland wheat growers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With all due respect, Senator Murray, where were you when the Western Australian wheat growers were asking you to support our amendment to delay this legislation until next year when we will see the full text of the bills, the second part of the legislation, and until their interests, their particular, legitimate concerns&mdash;and they are legitimate because it is their money in the wheat industry fund&mdash;about taxation have been dealt with?

Senator Murray made the technical point that apparently he received communication prior to or at the time of the second reading debate and has not received any since. The issues that were drawn to his attention at that time, and to the attention of all senators, included having the tax liabilities issue clarified. It still has not been clarified.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the final minutes before the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) concludes the debate, it is appropriate to stress a number of things here and that is that the government is concerned to maintain a sensible and consistent taxation approach to superannuation. It has been one of the concerns that the government has had and the government has been working very hard to try and get a result which is consistent and fair and which does not put anybody in a particularly advantageous position by virtue of their being on the public payroll, nor does it seek to create a situation were people are unduly disadvantaged simply by virtue of the fact that they happen to be in a constitutionally protected scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government is saying is that there basically has to be consistency across the whole of the community, so that rules that apply to those who are outside constitutionally protected schemes also apply to people who are on constitutionally protected schemes. This is part of a wider philosophy of this government which is that we believe in the basic principle of tax fairness. It would have been absurd to have a situation where we said, `Look, we are going to allow high income earners to get particular advantages that wage and salary earners cannot get.' It 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would have been hypocritical of us to say within a category of high income earners generally that certain people should be advantaged and certain people should be disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is the philosophy with which this government approaches the problem and the philosophy that needs to be borne in mind at all times when we consider this debate. I see that the very able minister has entered the chamber and I am sure that he is in a much better position to close the debate on this matter than I am.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of legislation complements the surcharge package passed by the parliament earlier this year. The package includes legislation which will strengthen the equity of the surcharge measure by ensuring that the superannuation contribution surcharge for high income earners will apply to members of constitutionally protected superannuation funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was not an oversight in the original surcharge package, as suggested by Senator Cook. The government was honouring its undertaking to discuss the application of the surcharge to state schemes with the states to achieve a workable outcome for their schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For constitutional reasons the Commonwealth is unable to impose the surcharge on certain state superannuation schemes. Accordingly, the legislation will impose liability for the surcharge directly on members of these constitutionally protected schemes. Otherwise the collection mechanism under this legislation is similar to that which applies to members of unfunded defined benefit superannuation funds under the previously passed legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The package also includes legislation which amends a number of acts to give effect to: the application of a surcharge to members of Commonwealth superannuation schemes; consequential amendments arising from the legislation dealing with members of certain state superannuation schemes; technical amendments to clarify the operation of the surcharge and improve the administration of surcharge; and amendments to correct techni 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9222"> cal deficiencies in amendments made to the original surcharge legislation during its passage through the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that during the debate several speakers referred to evidence given to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, alleging that many low and middle income earners would be caught by the surcharge. I made it very clear in my statements that no low or middle income earner need pay the surcharge. All they have to do is supply their tax file numbers and, if I have said that once, I have said it many times. I am pleased to say that no&hyphen;one has ever challenged that as a correct statement of fact. No acknowledgment was given by Mr Downed in his evidence to the committee or by speakers during the debate&mdash;including somewhat surprisingly Senator Allison&mdash;to amendments moved by the Democrats to the main surcharge legislation, which in effect quarantined existing accounts from receiving modest levels of contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was stated before the committee that a particular firm had only managed a 23 per cent response rate in the collection of tax file numbers. I note that this is not indicative of the collection of tax file numbers for the industry as a whole. I have been advised that many funds have achieved far better collection rates and that a response rate from a first round mail&hyphen;out of around 65 per cent is being used as a benchmark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook also referred to problems funds may have in meeting the 15 December reporting deadline. The key point here is that the government has already extended the reporting date from 31 August to 15 December. Senator Cook is also well aware that this package includes provision for superannuation funds to apply to the Commissioner of Taxation for deferral of reporting. If this is a legitimate concern of the opposition, then they can assist those funds which might have difficulty in meeting the deadline by passing this legislation. I seek leave to continue my remarks.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Cook mentioned, the proposed assistance packages by the IMF are to Indonesia and Thailand. In relation to Indonesia, the government welcomes the IMF program for Indonesia which was announced on 31 October. The program is a demanding one, involving monetary and fiscal adjustment, restructuring of the financial sector, significant deregulatory measures and trade reform, which will improve the efficiency, transparency and governance of the economy. Australia has agreed to provide up to $US1 billion to Indonesia in the form of supplementary financing which would remain conditional on adherence to the IMF program. Australia's assistance would be drawn down only after recourse to IMF financing and would take the form of a loan which would be repaid once the program ended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and the US, as well as some other countries, have also pledged support.

However, we have stressed&mdash;and I think the Treasurer said it before&mdash;that it is necessary for the Thai authorities to be totally committed to the reform process.</PARA>

Disbursements under the Reserve Bank are conditional upon the Thai authorities meeting the IMF's conditions.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the question. Australia is playing a constructive role in the international greenhouse negotiations taking place at present. As I have said before, our objective is to contribute to a better global outcome in relation to greenhouse gases and to carry our fair share of the burden, but not to assume a responsibility beyond that fair share of the burden. I should remind you, because it is sometimes not well appreciated, that we contribute only about 1.3 per cent or 1.4 per cent of total global greenhouse gases. That does not mean that we should not be taking prudent action to restrain emissions growth; we believe that we should.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That position was reinforced last week by the statement of the Prime Minister, who announced a $180 million package of domestic measures to strengthen our domestic 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> response in this very important matter. Of interest, this response goes beyond Labor's no regrets policy, which we have built on in our first 18 months of government, and for the first time will include some action that will be at economic cost. On balance, we nevertheless believe that it is worth doing that. One of the most pleasing aspects of the package, which is also not well appreciated, is that it will now reduce our emissions per capita to four per cent below 1990 levels. If we had maintained our 1990 population we would now, after the implementation of this package, be four per cent below 1990 levels, a very substantial improvement on the graph of business as usual.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It demonstrates how much Australia is doing. The no regrets policy and the voluntary business cooperation policies have reduced our business as usual graph significantly. The announcement the other day will further substantially reduce it by about another one&hyphen;third. In particular, the package announced the other day which covers most of the sectors includes $60 million for the commercialisation of renewable energy technologies&mdash;great opportunities in that area&mdash;$27 million for the expansion of the successful greenhouse challenge office that I mentioned a moment ago, which is the voluntary business program, in which I believe we lead the world; $13 million for the cities for climate protection programs, to enlist the support of local government and local communities; increased vegetation through the bush for greenhouse programs; getting our corporate sector to back tree planting and revegetation initiatives through the Natural Heritage Trust; a range of measures in relation to the motor vehicle industry; energy market reform and energy performance standards for houses and commercial buildings. In some of these areas, when we are not able to achieve our desired outcome through voluntary means, we would be prepared to go to regulatory means for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is Labor's response to this? Labor says that they could do better and they could reduce greenhouse gases to 1990 stabilisation rates. The only way Labor could do that is with a substantial carbon tax. They would 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9224"> build upon our initiatives by adding a substantial carbon tax to the detriment of all Australians, both directly and indirectly&mdash;a tax which has been estimated by the Electricity Supply Association of Australia at some $2 billion.</PARA>

These amendments were announced in the 1997-98 budget and will apply to assets acquired after 13 May 1997.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The rules will achieve this by reducing the cost base or index cost base and asset to the extent of any net deductions, such as depreciation, already allowed to the taxpayer. However, the government has recognised that the amendments may unintentionally catch taxpayers who have purchased land or buildings before the budget announcement and who have, for example, incurred expenditure by constructing new buildings on the land after 13 May 1997. This is because the capital gains tax rules may deem the new construction to be a new and separate asset from land acquired before the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has introduced transitional rules to ensure that the new provisions exclude expenditures on pre-budget land or buildings which create separate assets. The transitional measures will apply to expenditure incurred after 13 May 1997 but before 1 July 1999. This will minimise the impact of

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The validation regime in the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R299">Native Title Amendment Bill 1997</XREF>  is one of the most important parts of the bill. It follows quite closely the validation regime provided in the current Native Title Act, although it is much more restricted in that it does not generally validate legislation, it only validates acts that took place on pastoral leases. It does so because it was the clear basis of the law, following the passage of the Native Title Act, that the Native Title Act did not apply on pastoral leases. That is evident from the debate that occurred at the time, from the statements made by the Keating government and from the assurances given by the Keating government. That was clearly evident in the provisions of the Native Title Act and clearly evident from the decisions of the Native Title Tribunal and the Federal Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What happened was that the Wik decision changed the basis of our understanding of a pastoral lease. Sir Gerard Brennan, the Chief Justice of the High Court, made it clear in the Mabo decision in the lead judgment that leasehold land extinguished native title. It was therefore proper for all governments, including the Keating Labor government and the Goss Labor government, to operate on the clear presumption that the Native Title Act did not apply on pastoral leases.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Sure. We now know, as a result of the Wik decision, that that presumption was incorrect. Nevertheless, governments acting in good faith issued mining leases to a whole range of interests over pastoral leases in 1994, 1995 and 1996. We now know that that was done contrary to the Native Title Act. But, as was the case 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9228"> with the Native Title Act in 1993, it is absolutely essential to the economic security of this nation, to investor confidence and to sovereign risk that we take action to validate those titles. We have done so in exactly the same way as the current Native Title Act does so. We have used the same category A, B, C, D regime of validation. We have provided just terms compensation wherever there is impairment or extinguishment of native title as a result of the validation of those particular titles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Any suggestion that we should not validate those titles issued in good faith and involving millions of dollars of investments exercised in good faith would be, in our view, economic vandalism of the worst kind. If companies could not proceed on the basis of validly issued titles in that three-year period, and now have the situation where every one of them could be subject to challenge as being legally invalid because the provisions of the Native Title Act were not followed, it would be utterly reprehensible and simply unacceptable to any Australian government or parliament to operate on that basis. That is why I expect the ALP will be generally supporting the validation regime, because it is remarkably consistent with and similar to the validation regime provided for in the current Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do think it is very important for the minor parties to understand the very serious economic consequences of any suggestion that this parliament not validate those titles issued where they may affect native title and to remember that full just terms compensation is payable for any effect on native title. No mining leases issued in that period will extinguish native title. They impair native title for the period of the issue of the lease, as is the case with the current Native Title Act. So I do call on the Democrats and the Greens to think very seriously about any suggestion of not supporting that validation regime.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the opportunity to reply to the question from Senator Stott Despoja. Senator, I did read the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> , or at least a summary of it.

The banks presumably will respond as to whether that is accurate or not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the financial markets, I think your question missed out that the government is already delivering very substantial benefits to Australians. The most important benefit in terms of financial markets, I think all Australians would agree, is the very large reduction in interest rates which has occurred since this government came into office. There are a number of reasons for that very large reduction. One is the fact that we have been able to put our fiscal house in order. We were left with a dreadful overhang from the previous government, the Keating government, and in our first and second budgets we set out to repair that problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another reason why interest rates are coming down is the increased competitive arrangements in money markets. These benefits have flown through to a very large number of Australians, including young couples who are home owners and people in business who borrow money. I would have thought that it was widely recognised in the community&mdash;apart from in the Labor Party, who moan about everything&mdash;that this government, by putting its fiscal house in order and by encouraging greater competitive arrangements in financial markets, is delivering very substantial benefits to Australians.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9233">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In financial markets, of course, there is a whole growth area occurring in bodies apart from banks, and employment is being created in those areas. Mortgage originators is one area which has seen very substantial growth. It is true that you can point to certain institutions which may be cutting their staffing. Equally, there will be many other institutions in the financial area which are putting on money, in part because of the very dynamic environment that this government has helped to create.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think you can point to particular problems in particular areas regarding services. Where those occur in the market there will be other bodies which will be moving in to pick up where you might think some of the major institutions are cutting back. It is a very dynamic and progressive market. It is one which is creating jobs. In your statement you just stated the jobs which you felt the major banks were cutting back on, but you did not quote the very substantial job growth which is occurring elsewhere in financial markets. We, of course, are very anxious in the Wallis reforms to ensure that Australia has a world&hyphen;competitive financial system, a properly regulated financial system and a system that delivers a very wide range of effective services to consumers.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">University students are going to be among the winners with the youth allowance. It removes the inequity that currently exists in financial support for young people, depending on whether they are unemployed or whether they are university students who are continuing in training or education. It is in our national interest to provide incentives for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> young people to develop skills. Unskilled jobs are disappearing all around the developed world. It is definitely not in our national interest to let them just drift off onto the dole queues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Students will understand that; they have been getting the poorer deal. They can spend several years doing their course. Currently, their Austudy is means tested. But, if they qualify for Austudy of less than $1,000 a year, they do not get anything. Their friends on the dole get more money in their fortnightly payments and access to a range of other benefits which are not available to full-time students. That sort of arrangement sends the wrong message: that you are better off on the dole than in training or education&mdash;that is, getting skills that will help you to get jobs. After all, that is the message we want to send to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anybody who wants to get that sort of message around to young people today&mdash;the message that it is better to be on the dole than to be in training&mdash;is doing them a grave disservice. In fact, they should be condemned because they are quite probably condemning those young people to a life of unemployment and the margins of the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the youth allowance, there will be significant gains for students. For the first time they will be getting access to rent assistance where they have to live away from home for their studies. That is going to benefit an estimated 70,000 young Australians who, on average, will get an extra $31 a fortnight; but they could be getting up to $75 a fortnight extra, depending on their circumstances. That is, of course, a real boost for young people from rural and remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The $1,000 minimum entitlement requirement for Austudy will be abolished, and that is going to benefit 41,200 students. The independence criteria for youth allowance will be more lenient than applies under Austudy currently, and that will benefit 16,600 students. All youth allowance recipients, including university students, will have access to the $500 loan advance, which is currently only available to newstart recipients. Students will also have access to the pharmaceutical allowance and to the remote area allowance.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9235">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also introducing an income bank for full-time students, many of whom earn an income during their vacation which they use to support themselves through the academic year. That income bank works like this: students will have an income&hyphen;free area of $230 a fortnight before their youth allowance is affected; and a student who does not use up all the income&hyphen;free area can credit the unused part to their income bank up to a maximum of $6,000 a year. It is truly good news for students in Australia. It will mean that young people will see the virtue of going for job skills rather than accepting a life on the dole.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) to questions without notice asked today.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">According to advice given to a Senate estimates committee, Senator Kemp&mdash;as well as his other duties as a frontbencher for the coalition&mdash;is in charge of the detailed design of tax policy. What we have had today is another, I have to say, breathtaking display of incompetence in terms of Senator Kemp's range of knowledge of the subjects under which he has the authority to reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last Wednesday we had a series of questions put to Senator Kemp on taxation, just as we have had today. On both occasions, last Wednesday and today, Senator Kemp put most of those questions on notice. He does 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9236"> not know fundamental answers to questions about tax policy. But what we do have to acknowledge he is good at is waffling, he is good at evasion, he can draw a red herring across the path. But can he answer a straight question with a straight answer? The answer to that is: no, of course he cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is another case of the `Jim Shorts'. We had a former Assistant Treasurer in this chamber who resigned. I might say that what was catching up with him very quickly was a reputation for incompetence. This is another example of another minister equally so. It is about time that we had the `Come on down, John Watson' call because, the most competent senator on the coalition side when it comes to matters of taxation is unquestionably Senator Watson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ten days ago at a Senate estimates committee, the question of the government's proposal to reform the tax system came up, with reference being made to the taxation reform task force. Everyone in Australia knows that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has boasted long and loud in this country that tax reform will be something that he will be seeking a mandate for at the next election. We know from what Mr Howard has said that a GST will be a key feature of that tax reform. We know that the government, from what it has said via press release, has set up an in-house secret committee within the Department of Treasury to prepare a document for that tax reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also know, from evidence given by Dr Ken Henry to a Senate estimates committee 10 days ago, that that tax reform committee reports to the Treasurer (Mr Costello), it reports to the Prime Minister, and it reports to the cabinet. But does it report to the minister whose job is the detailed design of tax policy in Australia? The answer to that question is: no, it does not. When asked specifically, `Do you report to Senator Kemp?' Dr Henry said, `No.' Senator Kemp then brightly chimed in&mdash;and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record of this estimates committee will reveal this as a fact&mdash;`That's right, he does not report to me.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the person whose job it is to design the tax policy of this nation is not included in the chain of reporting for the most fundamental 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> review of the tax system the government has ever promised&mdash;the jewel in the crown of the government's forthcoming election policy: the total review and overhaul of the Australian tax system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why does the minister not get involved in this process? As has been demonstrated in this chamber over the last several days when questions on tax policy have been put to him, he does not know the answer. There is one conclusion: he is not in the loop because he is incompetent. He does not know the answer. He has no original information to bring to the issue. And it does not stop there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had questions on IT outsourcing. We have had questions on the drawdown of the IMF pledge to Thailand and Indonesia. I think you will find that is an answer which he will have to amend at some future time. We have had questions on a range of issues associated with discretionary trusts and non-fixed trusts concerning rollover relief. We have had questions on the range of provisions of the fringe benefits tax and on artificial capital gains to shareholders&mdash;the way the 45-day rule in trading and franking credits works. All of these things have a degree of technical element to them, but all of these things are, front and centre, what a minister in this place should know about. They are subject to press releases by the Treasurer, and they are matters on which the minister should be able to be fluent in answering. He is not.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the series of questions comprehensively responded to by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), I must inform you that, in relation to the IMF and Indonesia, surely all thinking Australians recognise the need of the importance for good relations with that country. The Indonesian archipelago 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9237"> nation is the fifth most populous nation on earth, spreading 5,000 kilometres from east to west, to Australia's near north and is our second nearest neighbour. Indonesia is strategically very important to Australia. It has an emerging economy with all the problems that involves. Fortunately, Australia is doing the right thing by our Asian partners: it is going to assist Indonesia and also Thailand and Korea through the IMF. I applaud the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and his government for such far-sighted initiatives. Such measurers are important not only today but also in terms of future relations between Australia and the Asian countries which we all know are so important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Conroy also asked the minister a question in relation to the Commonwealth Bank buyback arrangements. If I recall correctly, the senator asked very similar questions to the Australian Taxation Office at the Senate estimates hearing into Treasury and the administration of the ATO last week. In fact, at the estimates hearing the Chief Tax Counsel, Mr Michael D'Acenzo, advised that it was difficult to give complete and full details because of the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which prevents officers from making public information in relation to taxpayers' tax returns and affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the scheme was first announced by the CBA, it appeared particularly generous for investors because it offered two types of tax benefits. It offered franked dividend benefits coupled with capital loss deductions. It was not surprising that, under such circumstances, the Australian Taxation Office intervened, describing such arrangements as `inappropriate'. Following that intervention, the ATO arranged with the bank to substantially reduce the leakage of revenue that could have eventuated from the $650 million original proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments proposed seek to block schemes devised by companies to stream the payment of dividends or other distributions to shareholders so as to give the shareholders who benefit most from the franking credits a greater franking benefit or credit than those which would not have benefited to the same degree. The CBA, therefore, will modify the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> original buyback scheme to reduce its capital gains tax advantage and the amount of the payout of franked dividends. The sale price will now be deemed to be $7&mdash;up $5 from the original $2 proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to take this opportunity to commend both the ATO and the CBA on such a speedy resolution to what could have been a long litigious dispute. I commend the capable minister, the Hon. Rod Kemp, for the comprehensive answers that he provided not only to Senate estimates but also to the Senate this afternoon.</PARA></SPEECH>

The reason why is obvious to anyone who pays any attention to or has an interest in question time in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was extremely interested today in the non-answer that he gave not to questions from the opposition but to a question from Senator Stott Despoja on staffing levels in the Commonwealth Bank. The minister treated that question in a very dismissive manner. He wiped it aside as a matter of no account and of no legitimate interest. He went on to say, again to my great interest, that he was slow to be provoked otherwise he would have given Senator Stott Despoja a real caning for daring to ask a question about restructuring in the Australian banking industry and indeed staffing problems in banks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No opposition member was more assiduous in criticising the then government for ministers not having the detail to detailed questions than was Senator Kemp. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record indicates, no member of the then opposition, the coalition, was more assiduous than Senator Kemp in traversing this particular matter during the Senate estimates proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was astonished by Minister Kemp's answer to Senator Stott Despoja. I recall only 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9238"> too well the huge fuss Senator Kemp made in 1995&mdash;Senator Stott Despoja may not be aware of it, because she was not here in 1995, so she might like to have a look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record&mdash;when he raised, as a matter of great importance, the question of restructuring in the Australian banking industry and attempted to lie that at the feet of the then government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja might want to refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 6 June 1995, when a motion was moved by Senator Kemp in this chamber. It was a formal motion which demanded the presence of Commonwealth Bank officers at Senate estimates. Why was Senator Kemp extremely concerned about it then? I will tell you why. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have a particular interest in this because I am a Victorian. It is very clear that there have been massive retrenchments of Commonwealth Bank officers in that state and a large number&mdash;some hundreds, maybe up to 1,000&mdash;of forced redundancies.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He wanted to question the bank directly here, in the Senate. In what was a very prolonged speech when he moved that motion, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Bank, I believe&hyphen;&hyphen;and the figures demonstrate this&hyphen;&hyphen;has got itself into one awful mess in Victoria. It has in an arrogant way been carrying out a massive restructuring of the bank without properly taking the public into its confidence and involving itself in compulsory retrenchments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I sat here with some amazement today in question time, knowing the enormous importance that Senator Kemp&mdash;always renowned for his interest in matters financial; he was formerly a member of a think tank&mdash;placed on these matters. Even when he was in opposition he had a massive interest in bank restructuring and staff losses in banks, as the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  record will show.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But today in his usual style&mdash;his usual incompetent, arrogant and contemptuous way&mdash;he dismissed Senator Stott Despoja's question out of hand and in fact went further, as we all here in Senate question time today recall, by saying that, if it were not for his great forbearance&mdash;this is his condescending way&mdash;he would have really given Senator Stott Despoja a caning over raising the issue 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of staff retrenchments in banks. I suspect that, having been reminded of his own concern about this when in opposition, we will not be hearing any more on the subject from this particularly incompetent minister.</PARA></SPEECH>

That is what you said.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out of many of the questions that were asked during the estimates, which are recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, there are some real highlights. Senator Conroy, certainly towards the end of the estimates for economics on Thursday, when we were getting close to the end of some 33 hours of sitting, asked a broad range of questions of the Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Ted Evans. It got to the stage where, having asked three or four of these questions in a row, Mr Evans said, `This, Senator Conroy, is not a question for estimates.' That was very typical of the sort of questioning that went on for a considerable length of time during the estimates process. It is that process that I want to make some comment on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very sorry that Senator Lundy has left the chamber because she put on quite a turn on Thursday at estimates. She felt that she had been gagged, to use her own words, from asking questions. I put the case very clearly to her that the time frame that had been arranged was allocated by her colleagues, not by me, and I agreed to that time frame. Yet, when it came to 1.30 p.m., when the time had 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9239"> run out&mdash;the time for finishing that was suggested by her colleagues&mdash;she put on a turn and said that she had been gagged, that this was without precedent&mdash;I think that that was quoted in the paper&mdash;and that all that she had asked for was five extra minutes for questioning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I looked at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record this morning and saw that she did ask whether we could recall officers for 30 minutes of questioning. That was her request after lunch. I said to her that, if she could not arrange with her own colleagues a better arrangement of time, it was no fault of mine, because her colleagues were the ones who selected the time that we should finish questioning of the Department of Industry, Science and Tourism so that we could get on to Treasury, which was an important matter that was coming up, and the questions that Senator Cook referred to, which were asked of both the departmental officials and the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you, Senator Cook, that one thing that came out of your questioning at estimates of Dr Ken Henry, who was involved in the tax reform task force, is that this government is determined to progress the issue of tax reform. There is no other issue that confronts the Australian public today like the issue of tax reform. An overwhelming majority of the Australian community say that we have a tax system that must be reformed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government will not shy away from that reform process. It is doing this in two particular ways: one, by having a tax reform task force, which involves professionals who look into the intricacies and effects of certain decisions should they be made; and, two, by having a government members task force, which I am very pleased to be a part of, which will allow people from within the community to make submissions to that task force, and the government members will listen to all of the arguments put forward by all of the groups within the community that want to have an input.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government listens and is going to listen to the community particularly on this issue, which is something that the previous government never did. It never listened and it never bothered to consult with the com 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> munity, all of whom have a particular view on the issue of tax reform.

It was raised by Minister Kemp as a means of deflecting attention away from what he should be applying himself to, namely his answer to a question in question time. Let us have a close look at what Minister Kemp provided to us in question time today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before I do that I want to refer to Ross Gittins' explanation about the situation referred to in estimates. He said that, whilst much concern has been raised about the use of certain language in Senate estimates&mdash;and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9240"> I agree with that concern and Senator Cook has certainly already apologised in relation to that matter&mdash;we also need to look at what was involved in the situation and the extent of the provocation about Minister Kemp's lack of answers in relation to questions about a very important Industry Commission report that remains confidential. We still have no answers to those questions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his performance today Minister Kemp has certainly lived up to his reputation for&mdash;I pick up Ross Gittins's comment&mdash;being the `Minister for Ducking'. We have certainly called him the `Minister for Waffles'. In fact directly to the minister I have threatened to drop into the supermarket during one trip and actually distribute some in question time. The Minister for Ducking is the title given to him by Ross Gittins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Today when listening to his responses I thought that he is actually becoming more the minister for attacking the man rather than answering the question. That was certainly today's performance. Let us look at some of those attacks on the man. He attacked Senator Conroy for his supposed behaviour in estimates. He did not actually refer to anything explicit, although Senator Ferguson made a few later comments. He attacked Labor's position on R&amp;D syndication, despite the fact that recent evidence is showing the dramatic decline in R&amp;D as a consequence of this current government's policies in relation to R&amp;D. He attacked Senator Schacht and said he had not asked Senator Alston any questions in relation to communications. It was a question that was quite clearly about the handling of the Telstra float by financial institutions. How that pertains to Senator Alston is well and truly beyond me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we start at the very beginning, the first question he had to take on notice and was on the issue of drawing down Australia's contributions with respect to Indonesia and Thailand. He gave no answer in relation to Senator Bob Collins' question as to whether there would be different rules for revenue and capital expenditures in relation to the capital gains tax transitional arrangements. I have already mentioned his attack on Senator Conroy. He also did not answer Senator 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Conroy's question about whether the proposed dividend distribution component of the buyback in relation to the Commonwealth Bank would qualify for the savings rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have already mentioned his answer to Senator Schacht and that was to deflect the issue of communications to Senator Alston. If we look at his answer to Senator Faulkner's question in relation to the Canberra recession, he did not answer the issue of whether Senator Ian Campbell's comments about the Canberra recession were endorsed or not. Sure, he read a statement of apology, but then he attempted to justify this recession by saying, `We are governing for all Australians.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course what is frustrating the Labor senators and causing them to vent their spleen against Minister Kemp is that he is denying Labor the opportunity to create political mischief because he is giving sensible answers to the questions rather than answers which they can use to create political mischief. Of course, as a consequence of that Labor has launched this vicious and quite 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9241"> unjustified attack on Minister Kemp. This is just another aspect of their campaign to frustrate much&hyphen;needed tax reform in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Australia today, we have a tax system that was designed in the 1930s for an economy that operated in the 1930s. We desperately need a tax system for an economy that is developing for the 21st century and that will successfully take us as a competitive nation into the 21st century. Labor continually attempts to frustrate that process of much needed tax reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is worth noting how this contrasts markedly with the attitude adopted by the Liberal and National parties when we were in opposition. During that long period of Labor government, the Liberal and National parties gave wholehearted support to any needed and sensible reforms that were introduced by the then Labor government. Let me give a few examples: reform of the financial system and the banking system, reform of industry policy and tariffs, and labour market reform to the limited extent that Labor was allowed by its union masters to move on that issue. All of those much needed areas of reform that were addressed at various times when Labor was in office were given wholehearted support by the then Liberal and National parties in opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now that Labor are in opposition, they steadfastly refuse to adopt that commonsense approach that was adopted by our parties in opposition. In opposition, Labor are doing nothing more than adopting an attitude of wrecking and frustrating. They are refusing to act in the interests of the Australian community, and the whole process of reform is being frustrated. That is at the heart of their attack on Minister Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have sat here and listened to Senator Kemp's answers to the questions that have been asked by the opposition, and I have also sat here and listened to answers that he has given to questions asked from senators on our side of the chamber.

That is the real issue. </PARA>

If the Labor opposition continue with their attempts to frustrate the reform process not only by their attack on Minister Kemp but by their absolute refusal to consider a range of policy options for taxation reform, they will stand condemned by the Australian community well into the future for adopting this attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, probably the major area of reform remaining to be dealt with in this country is the area of taxation reform. Unless we have a taxation system that meets the needs of industry and commerce as well as PAYE taxpayers as we move into the 21st century, this country will not go forward; in this area it will remain uncompetitive with the international community.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Health Insurance Determination HS/2/1997. The Committee is concerned at the advice in the last paragraph of the Explanatory Statement and would be grateful for your advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that the payment of retrospective increased benefits is appropriate in the circumstances but is disturbed that privately insured patients will not be eligible to claim "gap" benefits during the same period. This would appear to breach the rights of those patients and is particularly inequitable when the Explanatory Statement apparently advises that this is due to a departmental oversight. There have been several previous problems of this type and the Committee suggests that it may be appropriate to review the enabling Act with a view to amendment to remedy the difficulty. Such amendment should not be a blanket endorsement of retrospective instruments but should be limited to situations similar to the present.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I appreciate the Committee's concern in this matter. While the Determination does provide that private health insurance organisations are not obliged to pay fund "gap" benefit for the retrospective period in respect of services to privately insured patients, it is highly unlikely that they would refuse claims by members. In practice, if a fund receives a claim for gap benefits in respect of a hospital in-patient service and a Medicare benefit has been paid, the fund will pay the relevant 25 per cent gap amount.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">On behalf of the Labor opposition, I would like to make a few brief remarks in relation to the amendment to Senator Margetts's motion. The Labor Party cannot support the motion in its current form. That is why we have proposed the amendments that we have. An explanation of those amendments, which I understand are circulated in the chamber and therefore before each of the honourable senators present, is that, although Australia did not approve of the way in which East Timor was incorporated into Indonesia, successive Australian governments have recognised Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor since 1979. At the same time, Australian governments have continued to acknowledge the right of the East Timorese people to self-determination while recognising that any form of such self&hyphen;determination will need the cooperation of the Indonesian government itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While acknowledging the efforts of the Indonesian government to address unsatisfactory aspects of the situation in East Timor, Labor in government also made representations concerning the desirability of a significant reduction in the size of the military presence in the territory; enhanced respect for human rights and religious tolerance; and administrative arrangements which would accord more influence and autonomy to indigenous East Timorese people. All these policy positions continue to be held by the Australian Labor Party today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The language contained in our amendment concerning East Timorese self-determination has been the subject of careful consideration by Labor's National Security and Trade 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9248"> Policy Committee. It expresses a view with regard to the process likely to be necessary to achieve a lasting solution to the conflict in East Timor. The reference to self-determination is made in the context of `a process of negotiation which, of necessity, must involve the cooperation of the Indonesian government'. This language should not be construed for anything more than what it in fact says. It is not something that the Labor Party would or could seek to impose on Indonesia. The manner and circumstances in which this view is expressed will always need to take into account our fundamental commitment to the cooperative bilateral relationship with Indonesia&mdash;a relationship which must be based on mutual respect and understanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">East Timor is an issue of deep concern to the Australian Labor Party. Equally, Labor recognises that this is an issue which is part of a broader relationship of immense importance to both of our countries.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the 12th of December, 1996, then Minister for Small Business, Mr Geoff Prosser, in responding to the Willett Inquiry Report, said that the Government would be reducing the days for dealing with anti&hyphen;dumping matters from 245 to 215.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And that the Government would be referring the whole issue to the Productivity Commission for further review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now Madam President, that was in December 1996. It is now the 24th of November, 1997 and when I last checked, the Productivity Commission had not received any reference from the Government in relation to Australia's anti&hyphen;dumping and countervailing measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And, despite numerous representations from Australia's manufacturing industry, it would appear that the Government has taken no further steps to deal with what is a very serious and important issue for Australia's industry and the thousands of jobs that go with it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, in my home State there is one manufacturing industry&mdash;that of paper making 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9251"> which has been subjected to dumping by overseas manufacturers and currently has anti&hyphen;dumping applications against manufacturers in 23 different countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Customs' final finding for these was handed down only last Friday and can I say, was less than satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two mills in my home state, one at Wesley Vale and one at Burnie, are in the main, marginal operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wesley Vale mill is the only coated paper making mill in Australia and without appropriate anti&hyphen;dumping measures this mill could well be forced to close.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President I can recall seeing Mr Chris Miles, Liberal Member for Braddon, appearing on the front page of the Advocate Newspaper, receiving petitions from the workers of the two mills concerned. And Mr Miles saying he would be working very hard to ensure the protection of the workers in his electorate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well what has Mr Miles done?  Not much it would seem. Indeed it is difficult to see that he has done anything at all, other than make the statement he made in the Advocate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And, Madam President, when Mr Miles was asked whether or not he would support Labor's initiative through the introduction of this Bill, Mr Miles failed to respond, except to say "we have international obligations".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, let's deal with Mr Miles' concern for our international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, all of the measures in this Bill are consistent with Australia's international treaty obligations under GATT and the World Trade Organisation. The only thing that this Bill will do is provide greater protection for Australia's manufacturing industry and the workers in it against any dumping activities of overseas manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President I would like to take this opportunity to thank the people who were involved in the drafting of this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It came about through consultation with industry representatives, in particular, industry solicitor Mr Chris Gillis and union representatives from the CFMEU and AMWU.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, this is an important piece of legislation deserving of government support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It does not resolve all of the problems associated with product dumping and consistent with the Willet recommendations Labor will be looking at the wider issues with a view to further amending the Customs Act's anti&hyphen;dumping and countervailing measures.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA THE HON JOHN HOWARD MP</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SAFEGUARDING THE FUTURE: AUSTRALIA'S RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20 NOVEMBER 1997</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since its election the Government has addressed the critical issue of global warming in a way that effectively promotes Australia's national interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those interests lie both in protecting Australian jobs and Australian industry whilst ensuring that Australia plays her part in the world wide effort needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the start, we have made it plain that Australia would not accept an unfair share of the burden. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9253"> have rejected and will continue to reject mandatory uniform targets which advantage many developed countries to the distinct disadvantage of countries such as Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have also made it plain that we are not prepared to see Australian jobs sacrificed and efficient Australian industries, particularly in the resources sector, robbed of their hard&hyphen;earned, competitive advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, we have persistently stressed the need to involve developing countries as their participation is crucial to any lasting solution to the global warming problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These principles have guided our approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is now clear evidence that Australia's campaign for equity and realism has won wider support and so, far from our country being isolated on the issue, there is growing international support for the view that the approach of, say, the European Union is both unfair and unachievable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have an obligation to defend and protect Australian interests, Australian jobs and Australian industry. We also owe it to future generations of Australians to play an effective role in the global reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's approach to development and the environment has been balanced and far sighted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That approach is reflected in the $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust. The Trust promotes practical ways to rejuvenate the land, rivers and oceans and is the most profound commitment of any government to the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The same balanced approach is behind our Regional Forests Agreements where the practical commitment to equally boost jobs and protect forests has resulted in 409,000 hectares of additional reserves through the two agreements signed so far.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That balance is also reflected in the protection and management of our seas and oceans through the development of a national oceans policy. This will build on the $106 million already provided through the Natural Heritage Trust for restoring the ocean environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This same consistent balanced and far&hyphen;sighted approach has been applied to the greenhouse gas challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today I announce the largest and most far&hyphen;reaching package of measures to address climate change ever undertaken by any government in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package carefully preserves a unique environment and lifestyle for our children's sake, defends wealth creating efficient industries and promotes lasting employment  into the future. It provides a durable framework to promote Australia's national interest towards the year 2010 and beyond. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a comprehensive manner, it replaces and far exceeds the random, disjointed projects of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The world's climate scientists have provided us with a clear message&mdash;that the balance of evidence suggests humans are having a discernible influence on global climate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is required is sober, sensible but forward&hyphen;looking action to reduce greenhouse gases and this is the approach my Government will adopt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although Australia contributes only 1.4 per cent of the world's greenhouse gas emissions we want to play our part in meeting this challenge. But pulling our weight doesn't mean carrying more than our share of the burden. Only with all countries working together, carrying equitable burdens, can we achieve an effective global outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will require creativity, persistence and in some instances, sacrifices&mdash;but the benefits of preserving our environment and quality of life for the sake of our children are too important to forgo.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PLAYING OUR PART&mdash;NEW DOMESTIC GREENHOUSE MEASURES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For various reasons Australia is unique.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our economy has evolved on the basis of our abundant supply of natural resources and efficient production and processing of fossil fuels and mineral resources. Fossil fuels  currently provide 94 per cent of our energy needs&mdash;far more than other OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our population is expected to grow by 30 per cent from 1990 to 2020 compared to less than three per cent in Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will continue to experience stronger economic and employment growth than most OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our cities are decentralised and widely separated, resulting in high transport use per capita compared to the smaller, closely populated European Union countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our trade profile means that about 20 per cent of our greenhouse gas emissions are embodied in our exports (notably aluminium and agricultural products)&mdash;double the OECD average and the highest in the industrialised word.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our emissions profile is also unique amongst developed countries where the energy sector accounts for about half of our emissions, compared with an average of 80 per cent for OECD countries; and where land use and forestry account for around 20 per cent of Australia's emissions. This reflects the significance of agriculture to our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, Australia has a responsibility to export the resources necessary to fuel the growth of her regional partners and to provide the food required for their people. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9254">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For all of these reasons our emissions are projected to grow faster than other countries. Uniform target proposals that do not take these circumstances into account will place an unfair penalty on Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reducing emissions growth is therefore particularly challenging and is more costly for us than for most other industrial countries. But we are still committed to playing our part in cutting emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without further action, Australia's emissions are expected to grow by around 28 per cent from 1990 to 2010. This is based on a comprehensive approach excluding land use change. Emissions from the energy sector alone are expected to grow by around 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package I announce today will achieve a dramatic reduction of a third in our expected net emissions growth from 1990 to 2010.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures will reduce our net emissions growth from 28 to 18 per cent in that period, or some 39 million tonnes of emissions.  This is comparable to the emissions from all the electricity used by households right across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a realistic, even conservative, calculation of the emission benefits. The benefits from plantations and land use changes, for example, could well be greater than we have estimated. With the most effective implementation of the package, the full support of industry and the community, and the best contribution of the States and Territories we may well achieve even greater reductions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taken with greenhouse measures Australia already has in place the package will mean Australia's effort broadly compares on the same basis to what the United States and the European Union are proposing. Moreover, we are not waiting for others to act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None of us should underestimate the commitment required to achieve these outcomes. They will require hard work from all of us. The package gives the lie to those who make exaggerated but ultimately empty claims that fine sounding targets can easily be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures have been developed against the background of our national circumstances and our national interest. They also have been developed against achievements by Australia to date such as reform of our electricity and gas markets, halving the amount of waste going into landfill by the year 2000 compared to 1990 levels and the efforts of particular industries such as the aluminium industry which will reduce emissions by more than 20 per cent over the same period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is seeking realistic, cost effective reductions in key sectors where emissions are high or growing strongly while also fairly spreading the burden of action across our economy. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package will allow us to improve the performance of our highly competitive energy dependent sectors while also stimulating new sectors such as renewable energy. It will demonstrate we can improve the environment whilst generating new jobs and exports. Far from risking 90,000 potential jobs, as would be the case if we accepted some proposals, the measures I announce have the potential to create wealth and jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They address emissions across many sectors&mdash;residential, industry, transport, energy, agriculture, forestry and government operations&mdash;in an integrated, effective, and above all, fair way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are prepared to ask industry to do more than they may otherwise be prepared to do, that is, to go beyond a `no regrets', minimal cost approach where this is sensible in order to achieve effective and meaningful outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is providing $180 million over five years for these measures. This is a significant sum by any standards and a substantial increase in funding. This package far exceeds the efforts by previous governments on addressing the greenhouse problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of this expenditure will be spent on completely new measures, while some existing programs will be substantially expanded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, the level of Commonwealth expenditure does not represent the whole story. These initiatives will stimulate additional actions and investment by the States and Territories, industry, and in some cases, consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our measures build on those in the draft National Greenhouse Strategy. State and Territory leaders have indicated their support for our greenhouse response and have agreed to work with us co&hyphen;operatively in implementing it and in considering further action of their own.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me outline the specific measures.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Renewable forms of energy currently contribute about six per cent to Australia's total  energy needs, an amount comparable to the OECD average of 6.4 per cent. The Government will be committing $65 million to ensure this level is increased.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By contributing $21 million, we will create a specialist renewable energy innovation investment fund to provide government and private sector venture capital for companies with high growth potential.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So that we can capitalise on our skills we will provide a $30 million loans and grants programme for the development and commercialisation of the renewable energy industry. This will directly support the creation of new businesses, jobs and exports. This funding represents a huge increase on the $4.8 million over four years spent by the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9255"> previous government on the Renewable Energy Industry Programme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And we will also provide $10 million for some leading edge renewable energy `showcase' projects in areas such as tidal power solar thermal power and photovoltaic technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will work with the States and Territories to set a mandatory target for electricity retailers to source an additional two per cent of their electricity from renewable energy sources by 2010. This will accelerate the uptake of renewable energy in grid&hyphen;based electricity and provide a larger base for the development of commercially competitive renewable energy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This enormous boost to renewable energy development is a huge improvement on programmes such as the Energy Research and Development Corporation which had been overtaken by changes in the energy sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our new programmes will stimulate innovative technologies and wealth&hyphen;creating businesses and energy suppliers who provide power to communities, employ Australians and export to the world. It is an action&hyphen;oriented approach.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that like our national effort, the international response to climate change must be effective in terms of meeting the environmental challenge, equitable in terms of the costs to be borne by individual countries and least damaging as possible to the living standards and employment prospects of our people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For these reasons Australia has proposed that individual targets for industrialised countries be differentiated according to national circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Uniform target proposals based on a 1990 base year would impose a disproportionate burden on Austral 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ia. The cost to our economy of meeting a uniform target of the order proposed by the European Union would impose a cost on all Australians that other countries would not accept.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some industries fundamental to the health of our economy would be hardest hit. The non&hyphen;ferrous metals, iron and steel and coal industries would be seriously affected, and future investment and employment growth would be jeopardised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even stabilising our emissions at 1990 levels would put at risk $68 billion of energy intensive projects and the tens of thousands of potential jobs that go with them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Significant regional dislocation would result in places like the Illawarra and Hunter Valley in New South Wales, the Bowen Basin and Gladstone in Queensland, Geelong and the La Trobe Valley in Victoria, Port Pirie in South Australia and the Kwinana region of Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, the European Community is not asking its own members to reach a uniform target. Portugal for example, would be permitted to increase its emissions by almost 40 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We reject this approach of punishing Australian industries to carry a burden that other countries are not prepared to accept. It is far more sensible and responsible to improve the performance of existing industries and build new green industries to provide for both jobs and the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe the way forward is for all countries to play a fair part, with flexibility in the methods used to reach the targets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We strongly support a comprehensive approach to setting targets which covers all greenhouse gases, emission sources, sinks and sectors. The wider the coverage the greater the flexibility to maximise environmental benefit and minimise economic cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia also believes that an international emissions trading regime would help minimise costs of reducing emissions. We would support emissions trading on the basis of a satisfactory initial allocation of emission entitlements and a practical resolution of the administrative difficulties involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Joint implementation measures whereby developed countries can work with developing countries on emission reduction projects can achieve worthwhile outcomes. Australia is looking to Kyoto to support joint implementation as a means of engaging developing countries in the global effort.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All along we have argued that climate change is a global problem and all countries should contribute to the solution. Action by developed countries alone will be ineffective. Over time, developing countries must become involved&mdash;as by early next century they will account for over 50 per cent of global emissions.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Kyoto outcome should provide for procedures and timeframes for negotiating targets by major developing country emitters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's proposal for negotiated, differentiated targets is the best basis for a fair outcome which has a prospect of  actually being put into practice and improving the world's environment.  It is also the best basis for encouraging developing countries to take on commitments to reduce emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has said it would not agree to legally binding targets until their nature and content and implications for Australia are clear. We will not agree to any targets that impose substantial costs on Australia that are not faced by other OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the package of measures I have announced today, the Government is not posturing for negotiating purposes with theoretical targets but is already taking practical steps to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a package that goes well beyond what any previous government has sought to do. It is a package that puts Australia at the forefront of international action. And it is a package that Australia will implement even if the international community fails to reach agreement at Kyoto.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have demonstrated to date, my Government will continue to stand up for our national interest, jobs and economy in the international negotiations.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Government has had some success in our efforts to argue the case that an effective result at Kyoto will require an equitable approach. We have managed to shift the international debate. As a result of our efforts, there is greater recognition of the need to take into account individual national circumstances if there is to be a successful outcome&mdash;as the British Prime Minister, Mr Blair, acknowledged in our recent discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also greater recognition of the need for flexibility to ensure countries can make a contribution to the global effort&mdash;as President Clinton acknowledged in my meeting with him in June.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the South Pacific Forum and most recently at CHOGM we were successful in gaining acceptance of the need for global engagement by both developed and developing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, let there be no doubt the Kyoto negotiations will be difficult.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's Environment Minister, Senator Robert Hill, who will be leading our delegation at Kyoto, will be doing his utmost to secure an agreement that will both be fair to Australia and be effective in reducing global emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ultimately, the success of our domestic measures depends upon the goodwill, commitment and action by ordinary Australians, consumers, families, firms and industry groups, as well as Governments Federal, State, and local.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. I am aware of the amount of legislation we have before us today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to make it very clear that, on looking through this document, the best one can say is that it is hopelessly inadequate. As you go through you see that what is being put back, whether it is financial or in terms of ideas, does not match what this government has taken out in successive budgets. If you go through the document and then go back to the budget cuts, you will see that they are probably close to $100 million short. If you look at the cuts to energy research and development and conservation, you see that in 1996&hyphen;97 it was $33&half; million; this year, $16.6 million off forward estimates; and so it goes on to total $101 million.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is the $21 million for the ethanol bounty which they scrapped. There is the abolition of the Energy Resource and Development Commission&mdash;that is some $37 million&mdash;and there is a national energy efficiency program. We also have to acknowledge the cuts to local government, particularly the better cities program which was scrapped. A lot of that money was going into improved public transport and some interesting and innovative ideas for housing. So all in all this government are well short, whether in terms of finances or in terms of ideas, of where this country should have been.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As you go through it you see that very little of it is new and very little of it is in any way exciting. As you read through you see that it seems the best they can come up with is to go to Kyoto promoting an increase of some 18 per cent in emissions above our 1990 levels. I would like some confirmation from the minister as to whether or not this really is the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9263"> case. Are we seriously going to be the only Western nation that goes off to Kyoto and asks for an increase in emissions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will quote one of the comments that the Prime Minister has made. He says he is `not prepared to see jobs sacrificed and efficient Australian industries, particularly in the resource sector, robbed of their hard&hyphen;earned competitive advantage.' That totally ignores the fact that if we do nothing there is going to be a significant impact on industries like the coal industry. After all, most of its product is exported and there is going to be an impact if countries such as Japan and many of the European countries decide that they are going to move from fossil fuels to renewables. So we will be exporting less and they will certainly want to import less of our coal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is nothing here about new technologies and new ideas. There is nothing here about sunrise industries or looking at co&hyphen;generation, for example. A whole section on public transport is totally missed out. All the Prime Minister keeps going back to is the old jobs, which we know are going to be affected anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you look at this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, you will get some idea of why the Prime Minister is stuck in the past. The people he is taking advice from, the people he is talking to, are those who are supporting and pushing the old technologies and the old industries&mdash;the burning of fossil fuels. He is not talking to the many scientists and experts we have who can fill him in on what is really happening in regard to climate change and also point out what Australia stands to gain by adopting new technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He is not even talking to the many organisations, such as the Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace and the WWF, which represent far more accurately the wishes and the concerns of the Australian people. No, he continues to talk to the people who are prepared, I must admit, to put money into research but who are living basically with old industries that they are protecting at any cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at what is happening in other parts of the world. China has often been cited as one of our concerns because it may be 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> allowed to keep polluting. Let us look at what it is actually doing. Oil subsidies in China have been reduced by 96 per cent and coal subsidies by 22 per cent since the 1980s. China is now producing one quarter of all primary energy from renewable resources. Yet, the Prime Minister's statement talks about an extra two per cent from renewables&mdash;about the lowest of any country in the Western world&mdash;building on our only real source of renewable energy so far, and that is hydro&hyphen;electricity; a scheme which we have managed to corporatise without really knowing exactly what we expect of it in the future, particularly in regard to water.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look through the document and compare it with what is actually happening, we will see that the old jobs he is protecting&mdash;the ones that he has held up as being so important&mdash;are going anyway. BHP Utah have retrenched 1,648 of their 2,000 workers in the last five years. North Broken Hill has already retrenched 4,729 of 7,000 workers; CRA, 2,256 of 15,000; BHP Steel has retrenched 6,106 of its 20,000; and BP has retrenched 1,761 of its 4,000. According to an article in todays <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>, the coal industry is heading for massive retrenchments again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we look at who is not being heard, some of the people that the Prime Minister is not prepared to talk to include the head of the CSIRO. I quote from one of today's papers:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Yes, I'm frustrated," said Dr Pearman, chief of the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If you look at many of the comments that Dr Pearman has made about the lack of interest in Australia and the frustration because we are moving backwards, you really wonder who put this speech and this paper together for the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why is the government constantly talking to us about the jobs that will be lost? In the statement, the Prime Minister does not address the issue of public transport. In Germany, a new petrol levy of 12c per litre is going towards public transport initiatives. The document does not talk about issues such as recycling. It does not talk about getting Australian households to move through the process of looking at energy needs and  mov 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9264"> ing towards energy conservation. The Democrats have put together a document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Saving face in Kyoto</EMPHASIS> which has clearly points out that public transport generates less than one per cent of the emissions of self&hyphen;drive commuting and that we urgently need to increase the attractiveness of public transport in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ethanol is another issue that the Prime Minister has raised in his document. The ethanol bounty was one of the first things that was cut with great relish by the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer, in the very first budget. As a result, there is now a modern ethanol refining plant sitting half&hyphen;built at Manildra. The plans for a pilot program have been on the drawing board for several years,  unfunded again and again by successive governments. At least we see in this package one of the few positive signs that they are moving at last to start catching up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to the Bush for Greenhouse project, the Prime Minister states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . companies will have a method to offset emissions created by their activities elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I have to ask whether this is going to give very big landholders in particular a great incentive to continue wholesale land clearing on the understanding that they can invest elsewhere; that they can put money into revegetation activities in other parts of the country but continue with wholesale land clearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, one of the big gaps in this package&mdash;one of the big sinks that we seem to have lost sight of&mdash;is the fact that we have again done nothing about land clearing. We missed the opportunity when the Senate debated the Natural Heritage Trust legislation and the minister refused to close the gaps and to stop states funding activities that worked against the interests of that program. Here again we failed to plug the sink&mdash;to halt land clearing. If we are going to be clearing some 400,000 to 500,000 hectares per year in Queensland, what is the point of various initiatives to actually plant trees? We can never keep up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you again compare us internationally, which is becoming more and more embarrassing, the comparable rates of clearing in some 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parts of the Amazon are roughly these: we are comparable with the worst aspects of what is going on around the world. What is happening in the Amazon has led to international outcry and condemnation. But here we are going off to Kyoto with a package that effectively allows wholesale land clearing to continue in this country. If you look at this government's policy on forests, which it has tried to twist around as a positive in this document, you will see that wholesale clear&hyphen;felling for woodchipping is actually increasing in this country, not decreasing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To put it mildly, this is an extremely disappointing and poor effort on the part of this government. If this is the best we can do in the lead&hyphen;up to Kyoto, we really are going to be the international pariah; we really are going to be a huge embarrassment. I just hope that we do not manage to destabilise world agreements, as our coal industry is working so hard for.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to speak briefly to this document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Safeguarding the future: Australia's response to climate change</EMPHASIS> . It has often been said that Australia produces&mdash;usually when the coalition is speaking&mdash;`only' 1.4 per cent of the world's emissions of greenhouse gas. Considering we have only 0.3 per cent of the world's population, that makes us amongst the highest per capita greenhouse gas emitters in the world. That is not something to be proud of. There are reasons for that in the way our industry has developed, but for future directions is it smart that we continue to be this dependent on fossil fuels? Is it smart that we continue to be this dependent on fuels which create such a large amount of greenhouse gas? For many reasons the answer is no.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken in the Senate in the past about the fact that it is likely that within the next decade there will be a substantial increase in the cost of petroleum because we are getting near the halfway point in the world's petroleum resources. So it is smarter for us to be doing the things now which make us less dependent. Those things include helping to design the way our cities and transport structures work so that we are less 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9265"> dependent on road transport. It is smarter also to be looking at industry in the longer term. As an export economy, we are largely talking about volume exports  like woodchip, iron ore and coal. Over time, as the rest of the world signs on to improving their greenhouse performance, there will be less demand for coal and that will have an inevitable impact on the price of coal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, we will find that much effort will be required on behalf of individual consumers to reduce greenhouse gases. Individual consumers will be more and more dismayed if the government continues to put in coal fired power stations expecting that individuals and households will reduce greenhouse emissions and look at smarter ways of using passive solar and other forms of energy conservation efficiency, which, of course, create lots of jobs. They will also be pretty annoyed if, at the same time, the government is promoting and assisting the production of energy through coal power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In Western Australia we have electricity powering our trains so we do not have pollution coming from the trains. But when we look back to the source of the electricity we find that a few years ago we transferred a gas power station in Kwinana to coal, so we actually increased our greenhouse emissions because of a choice by government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The six nations in our region represent 44 per cent of the world's population. The three largest of those nations, representing over a quarter of the world's population, have annual per capita energy consumption levels as follows: China, 24 giga&hyphen;joules per person; India, nine giga&hyphen;joules per person; and Indonesia, 10 giga&hyphen;joules per person. Australia's energy consumption is 215 giga&hyphen;joules per person. What kind of impact are we having, not just on Australia, if we are acting as a pariah in the international arena? What kind of impact is this sabotage of international agreements going to have?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yes, Australia is calling for less developed countries to be involved, but what kind of chance are we going to get to encourage less developed countries and other energy guzzling countries in the world to be involved now and in the future if Australia is holding out and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> pulling the debate away from greenhouse targets? Not only are we having an impact on Australia's emissions but we are also likely to have a negative impact on other world countries, especially within our region. This is not responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Global climate change is a world problem. We may have a small population but we are disproportionately affected by climate because of our large land mass, large exposure to weather and our proximity to the El Nino southern oscillation. If only we could start thinking cleverly about the future, our options and employment strategies which build in energy conservation efficiency we would find that we would not only be climatically and environmentally better off but we would also be better off economically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is not one country in the world that I know of where industry did not go kicking and screaming to energy conservation efficiency measures which were legislated. But I do not know of any of those parts of the world where it was a dreadful thing for industry, in the end. It meant a more efficient industry, and profit levels improved when industry had to think about how they cut down their cost on energy. It is traditionally and quite well known that you have a very short payback for energy conservation efficiency measures. You may have to make some investments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government have it wrong. They think a `no regrets' policy means `no effort'. Sometimes it does require an investment. Sometimes it  requires incentives for people to be involved&mdash;consumers, industry and even people in offices and buildings&mdash;but you have to take that step. Often it means having regulated and legislated changes and standards. That is the kind of change people are looking for from Australia, both within our region and worldwide. I certainly do not want to be embarrassed by continuing to see Australia holding the kind of irresponsible position they have taken.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report I have just tabled deals with eleven treaties, including one, on economic and commercial cooperation with Kazakhstan, which we have recommended should not be ratified at this time. The latter approach is a committee first&mdash;more on that in a moment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have recommended ratification of the remaining ten treaties as proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in the case of one of them: the agreement on trade and economic cooperation with Malaysia, we have recommended also a study to establish whether any other trade or financial agreements are required. In particular, the need for an investment protection agreement needs to be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A double taxation agreement with Malaysia was signed in 1980, and the study we have recommended should consider whether this needs to be revised or replaced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of our reports, and accompanying tabling statements, have made comments about a lack of consultation in the process set up after last year's reforms. Unfortunately, that shortcoming persists with some of these treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, consultation with at least two of the states about the medical treatment agreement with Ireland appears to have been perfunctory and did not take up their concerns. We have made some comments on the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the amendments to the Asian&hyphen;pacific postal union's constitution, there was no consultation with postal unions or philatelic organisations which might have been interested.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, we will keep consultation under review until it reaches and maintains a satisfactory level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand, it is pleasing to be able to mention a particularly good national interest analysis: for the agreement on the network of aquaculture centres in Asia and the pacific, or NALA. This shows evidence of widespread consultation with the many groups with an interest in that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9268"> agreement. More importantly, it included sufficient detailed information for us to grasp easily what the agreement set out to do, and where there were difficult issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that all of my colleagues on the committee would join with me in saying that those responsible in the department of primary industries and energy did a very good job on this NIA. They were very responsive also to suggestions from our secretariat during the inquiry process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NALA agreement will provide a means for this country's aquaculture industry both to contribute to and receive knowledge in this rapidly growing industry. As the section on this agreement in chapter 4 of the report shows, this is a substantial subject.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During our hearing on it, concerns were expressed about the future of Australia's quarantine regime as a member of NALA. We were advised that membership `would not affect our sovereign rights to set our level of quarantine protection'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the evidence we were given about diseases in some parts of the Asian aquaculture industry, this latter advice is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I return to the agreement on economic and commercial cooperation with Kazakhstan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of itself, this is not a very significant agreement. However, it is important because it is the first time we have recommended that a treaty should not be ratified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Briefly, Telstra was operating within the law in Kazakhstan but found that its licence for a joint venture arrangement was revoked, suffering a loss of some $A7 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although Telstra is not the only Australian company operating on a joint venture or other basis in Kazakhstan, the way it has been treated sets a generally unacceptable standard. To ratify this agreement would send the wrong message to Kazakhstan about what is acceptable in commercial relations within Australia and internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have recommended against ratification at this time because, while we do not think that any agreement would have protected Telstra totally, we do believe that it has been treated in an unacceptable way. It is difficult to be clear about the position in that country, but Telstra may, just might, get its money back. It certainly wants to remain operating in that country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have recommended also that this agreement not be reconsidered for ratification unless and until there are demonstrations by Kazakh authorities of good faith in its trading relations with Australia. We believe that either re&hyphen;entry into the market, or payment of compensation, would be appropriate ways of showing much&hyphen;needed good faith in this situation. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The situation in Kazakhstan may change, and ratification of this agreement could be proposed at some time in the future. If so, we have recommended that a new NIA outlining the reasons for the change should be tabled to allow the committee to consider the matter further.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second chapter of the report reveals that we were not happy with all aspects of the evidence given to us by DFAT on the Kazakh issue. This was especially so at a hearing on 1 September, when pertinent evidence was not presented&mdash;something out of character for that department which has set a high standard in the evidence it has given.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is one further point I would like to make on the Kazakh agreement. We were concerned that the minerals council of Australia was approached to give evidence but decided to leave this to individual member companies. This was very disappointing, as we believed it could have made a useful contribution to our understanding of the situation in central Asia, as it affects a range of Australian companies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the request of Senator Bolkus and pursuant to notice, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Family Law Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1997 No. 157 and made under the Family Law Act 1975, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Family Law Regulations (Amendment), as contained in Statutory Rules 1997 No. 157, represent yet another broken promise by the Howard government. In the budget, the government said that it would implement a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> $40 dollar per hour fee for voluntary mediation and counselling provided by the Family Court. This fee, which was due to commence on 1 January 1997 but which was delayed to the commencement of these regulations, was estimated to raise some $0.835 million in 1996&hyphen;97, rising to $1.9 million by 1998&hyphen;99. These regulations, made possible by amendments to the Family Law Act passed earlier this year by the Senate, implement that measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concern that the Labor Party has about the introduction of these fees is twofold. First, there are the access to justice implications of slugging families in crisis with a $40 fee for the provision of a service which in fact ultimately saves the government money because it helps to reduce the overall rate of divorce. Secondly, we are concerned at the longer term objectives underlying this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996&hyphen;97 annual report of the Family Court shows that the court's counselling and mediation service dealt with 25,869 counselling cases in person and 13,809 telephone counselling cases, crisis calls and intake assessments. During the period, 57,599 interviews in person were held and 35,506 telephone interviews, crisis calls and intake interviews were also conducted. As many as 47.1 per cent of cases came to the service on a voluntary basis. This is down on the almost 60 per cent figure in the 1995&hyphen;96 financial year. In all, 18.6 per cent of the cases were referred by the court for counselling after an application for a parenting order in relation to residence, contact or specific issues was filed but prior to the matter first coming to court. A further 28.7 per cent were referred by the court after the first directions hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the estimates hearings last year, and consistent with research into the effectiveness of the service, it was revealed that 75 per cent of those cases were successfully resolved by the counselling and mediation service. Were it not for the provision of these services, one can only wonder how many more divorces we might have had. By comparison, and quite regrettably, might I say, there were 52,466 divorces last year, up on 49,700 in the year before. For the first time last year, the so&hyphen;called crude number of divorces reached 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9270"> exactly half the crude number of marriages. I do not want to suggest that any number of divorces is desirable, but clearly that number and that percentage is simply too high. We need to find ways of reducing the number of divorces in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is in this context that the imposition of cost recovery on this service is simply bad policy. Despite the fee waiver and refund provisions which will protect the poorest in our society, most Australians who access these services will have to incur this fee. No doubt some of the government members will point to the figures that some 40 per cent of cases received some remission of the fees under these provisions. However, these figures still ignore the very real hardship experienced by those who are not poor enough that they are on a pension or receive some form of government benefit or health care card. Increasingly, there are the working poor, whom this government continues to ignore. To say to families who earn less than $40,000 a year, parents who may be struggling to feed and clothe themselves and their children on that amount of money, that they should pay a fee to help save their marriage is obscene.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To place a barrier to accessing a service that ultimately helps keep families together and reduces the number of cases in the Family Court is simply not good policy. Not only is there the very real personal pain and financial cost of divorce; our entire society suffers when families come asunder. There are very real signs already that this cost barrier is having a substantial effect. The registrar of the Family Court advised Senator Bolkus by letter dated 20 November 1997 that, comparing the June and September quarters of this year, voluntary counselling cases have reduced by 9.9 per cent. At the same time, court ordered counselling before the first directions hearing has increased by 29 per cent and court ordered counselling after the first directions hearing has increased by 20.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The figures are both disturbing and yet clear. Parties are putting off taking up voluntary counselling and, as a result, more cases are waiting until they are formally brought before the court. Not only does this waste the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> court's and, through it, the community's resources but it also decreases the prospect of these marriages surviving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a disastrous policy and even the early figures following its implementation are demonstrating that. By contrast, there are positive things this government could be doing. I note that Mr Kevin Andrews, the chairman of the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, has suggested that all new couples should be given a voucher that would provide free marriage or relationship education. Why? Because, as he rightly notes, this would build and strengthen more successful relationships. Surely, then, the process of helping to keep families together is just as worthy of such a sentiment. Or does the government believe that families in crisis should be treated differently&mdash;that they should be punished in some way for the failings of their relationships? We submit that they should not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The move to introduce these fees is a clear breach of the government's election commitment to the Australian people. In its law and justice policy, the coalition promised to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . support and implement moves to increase counselling, conciliation and mediation options in the resolution of disputes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A measure such as this one, which makes it harder for people to access mediation and counselling services, hardly supports or increases the options that are available to Australian families in crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his second reading speech on the Family Law Amendment Bill the Attorney sought to defend the government's introduction of these fees on three grounds. The first was by referring to the need for fiscal consolidation, a problem that exists largely in this government's mind alone, with the exception of the $3 billion hole their bungled handling of the economy has cost us. It is a fiscal consolidation which, it has been shown, simply went too far and thus has brought the Australian economy to its knees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second was by claiming that the previous Labor government had foreshadowed that it might consider such a proposal in the 1995&hyphen;96 budget statements. Indeed, the portfolio budget statement for that year did state that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9271"> the review of court and tribunal fees initiated by the previous government would examine the suitability of fee regimes for voluntary or optional services which a court might provide. However, what the Attorney failed to say was that the previous government, in light of that review, rejected the introduction of fees for these services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, the Attorney argued that failing to impose these fees was a form of discrimination for people living in rural and regional Australia. This argument ignores the fact that the Family Court provides extensive mediation and counselling services in rural and regional centres, either through permanent offices or via circuits. Upon closer examination, the Attorney's rhetoric on this point is not only hollow but it is also hypocritical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Attorney really cared about providing services to people in rural and regional centres he would not have cut funding to the Family Court by $3.5 billion last year. Nor would he have cut the provision of family skills training services that were to be opened under Labor's justice statement this financial year in the Richmond&hyphen;Tweed area, central Murrumbidgee, Shepparton, Mooroopna, Bendigo, Ballarat, the Gold Coast, Wide Bay, Burnett or the Green River region. He would not have cut the adolescent family mediation services that were to be provided this year and next year in Newcastle, the Clarence, Geelong, Whyalla and Preston, nor would he have cut the family mediation services which were to be opened in Gosford, Newcastle, Wollongong, the northern outer suburbs of Melbourne, Geelong, Bendigo, Ipswich, Wide Bay, Burnett or the Perth south&hyphen;east and metropolitan areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the Attorney's insupportable arguments do not end there. In a desperate attempt to further defend his floundering case the Attorney, in reply to the speeches given by my colleagues Mr Melham, Mrs Crosio and Ms Macklin in the other place, argued two further points. Firstly, he argued that it was necessary for there to be greater coordination between the counselling and mediation services provided by the Family Court and those provided by the community sector. However, the Attorney failed to give any reasons as to why the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> imposition of a $40 per hour fee would encourage such coordination. That is because there is no causal nexus between the two, nor obviously could there be. Secondly, he argued that there was something inconsistent about trying to encourage people to use mediation and counselling services to avoid going to court and having those services co&hyphen;located and administered by that court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The logical failing in this argument is manifestly obvious; it demonstrates clearly the Attorney's complete lack of understanding of the role the services actually play. His arguments ignore the reality that many people facing difficulties in their relationships turn to the Family Court as a first point of call, simply because they do not know where else to go. Co&hyphen;locating a service which can deflect people in crisis from the doors of the court or which provides them with another option from proceeding with a case is one of the best forms of intervention and, ultimately and hopefully, resolution that is available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further, by his comments, Mr Williams seems unable to understand the very simple point that the referral of people to the Family Court's mediation and counselling services means that these matters are decided outside the courtroom. The Family Court and the court's mediation and counselling service are different yet complementary services. Co&hyphen;location of the services is one of the very real reasons why the counselling and mediation service is so successful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For this Attorney&hyphen;General to pretend that this bill will mean fairer access to justice when he has cut over $320 million from access to justice programs over the next four years is the height of hypocrisy and must be rejected by the Senate. However, I am afraid there is a more sinister agenda afoot here. The introduction of these fees is, I believe, the first step in a campaign to remove from the Family Court its ability to provide mediation and counselling services altogether. The release by the Attorney&hyphen;General of his discussion paper on the future of the counselling and mediation service is testament to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Attorney&hyphen;General has said that he would like to see mediation and counselling become the primary means of dispute resolu 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9272"> tion in Australia. The truth is that, well before this government came into office, the Labor government was well on its way to establishing that ideal as a reality. Only five per cent of Family Court cases are resolved by way of court imposed solution. In the overwhelming majority of cases the parties reach an amicable solution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality of modern family law is that the court imposed solution is now the alternate dispute resolution mechanism. But, in the last few months, public attention has been focused by the actions of this Attorney on the role of mediation in our court system. The Attorney indicated his view on 2 October 1996, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would like to see a reduction in the volume of mediation and counselling services provided in the court and the transfer of those to the community.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This was a view he did not derogate from in his more substantive speech to the National Press Club on 15 October 1996. Whilst he did back down somewhat from his previous comments by committing himself to extensive consultation on the issue, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is much to be said for the view that the Family Court should be freed up to concentrate on its primary function&mdash;that is, to hear and determine legal disputes in family law matters.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This approach is at odds with the well recognised need to further integrate mediation into court processes. Chief Justice Brennan, in his speech to the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration on 24 September 1996, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mediation and arbitration will continue to be familiar and prominent features of the system of dispute resolution in the future. There is no reason why, in the vast majority of cases, mediation should not be compulsory in the sense of being a condition of the right of any party to have the dispute brought to trial. But let it be court attached mediation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and I emphasise those words&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&hyphen; either the mediator should be a court officer or a private mediator selected by the parties by lot or by rotation. In either case the fees should be a charge on public revenue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In direct response to the Attorney's comments and in support of the approach suggested by the Chief Justice that I have just read, Ms Jenny Boylan, the Chair of the Family Law Council, has also publicly stated that the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> council had already advised the Attorney that the court should retain its counselling services. She did this by way of letter of advice to the Attorney on 30 June 1996, and that letter is annexed to the council's 1995&hyphen;96 annual report. Quoting from Ms Boylan's comments when talking about the Attorney's recommendations, she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If implemented, this recommendation would destroy the successful conciliation aspects of the court's operation. It would hamper the settlement of matters, particularly those involving children, and result in the loss of a significant degree of expertise within the court which has benefited the interests of children as the legislation requires. The recommendation ignores the important role played by court councillors, mediators and registrars and omits any reference to the extent to which the conciliation services are integrated with the litigation process. It fails to differentiate between voluntary and court related counselling, each of which requires particular skills and knowledge which the court counsellors have acquired and built over the two decades of their operations. The council believes that what is required is the provision of appropriate primary dispute resolution processes at both the community and court levels rather than the either/or approach adopted by the JSC.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Earlier this year the Chief Justice of the Family Court, Mr Justice Nicholson, pointed out that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent research being conducted by Professor Brown and others at Monash University has demonstrated that the only intervention which clearly leads to an early and long lasting resolution of disputes involving child abuse allegations is a reliance on family reports prepared by court counsellors and the use of child representatives. When both are used together they are even more effective. Primary dispute resolution services provided by the Family Court have obvious and direct benefits to very vulnerable families.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We often talk in this place of the need to establish world's best practice in the administration of our Public Service; it should be no different for our courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that the government of Singapore recently decided to review the use of alternative dispute resolution services attached to its courts. After studying various models in the United States, Europe and New Zealand, Singapore has decided to adopt conciliation counselling and mediation services based on those provided by the Family 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9273"> Court of Australia. Fiji and South Africa also are currently examining the Federal Court model. Surely if these services are good enough to export, if they are thought by others to be worthy of imitation, we should retain those services here in Australia. But unfortunately it seems that Mr Williams, the Attorney, does not understand this. Rather, the Attorney prefers to disregard the plethora of expert advice warning him against this approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President and Senators, we can put into practice the advice that this Attorney fails to listen to. We can stop the passage of this bill and, in doing so, we can send a strong message to this government that its old&hyphen;fashioned view that `a court should be a court and nothing but a court' is simply inappropriate in this day and age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The primary object of any dispute resolution service, such as that provided by a court, must be timely, efficient and fair resolution of disputes. We as legislators are obliged to put in place the best mechanisms available to enable ordinary Australians to sort out their problems for themselves as quickly and as cheaply as possible. Counselling and mediation is an integral part of the Family Court. It is a service that must be accessible to all. The imposition of the fees is already creating a barrier to accessing a service which saves both individuals and the public purse money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Williams has said that, on average, families in crisis will only have to pay $240 to access this service. But, even with the exemptions that are proposed under the regulations which will protect the most impecunious in our society, $240 is still a significant amount of money for your average Australian family to find at a time of crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Surely it would be better to invest this money in saving our families now rather than paying for the considerable human and economic costs of divorce. This is particularly so when the service in question is successful in 75 per cent of cases&mdash;a standard equal to, or better than, that of its private sector counterparts. This is a demonstrably regressive measure, and I urge the Senate to support this disallowance motion.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I want to highlight that the proposals to consider charging fees for counselling and mediation services in the Family Court were contained in the portfolio budget papers of the former government for 1995-96. That was not something which one might have easily picked up from Senator Forshaw's contribution. Nonetheless, proposals to consider charging fees for these services were contained in those papers. The proposals were also considered as part of the review of fees and charges in Commonwealth courts and tribunals&mdash;which was again commissioned by the previous government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cost of running the Family Court is now in the vicinity of but exceeding $100 million and has increased in recent years. The introduction of these fees needs to be seen in the context of the deficit crisis that we inherited from the previous government&mdash;Beazley's black hole of some $10 billion. The public purse can no longer continue to shoulder  such an expensive burden. Groups such as Relationships Australia, Centacare and others like them have traditionally charged fees for similar services to those offered by the Family Court. These are community groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Prior to 1 July this year, there were no fees payable for the counselling and mediation services provided by the Family Court. That was not an equitable situation because it meant that some people could get a service for nothing while others were paying. It was often residents of rural and remote locations who had to pay. Despite Senator Forshaw's comments, people are not conveniently placed around family law services. It was done purely on the basis of geography, because they did not have access in the same way that metropolitan people do to the Family Court's free services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 1 July this year fees for the voluntary use of counselling services and mediation services provided by the court were introduced. The fees for counselling are $30 per person per session, which is, as I understand 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> it and am advised, on average, 1&half; hours when two people attend. The fees for mediation are $50 per person per session, which is, on average, 2&half; hours. In community based organisations I am told that the average fee for counselling and mediation is about $40 an hour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the fees that are payable for the counselling and mediation services provided by the Family Court are equivalent to the average fees payable for the services provided by community based organisations. There are, however, some differences and it is appropriate to point them out. The main one is that in the Family Court there is a flat fee for counselling or mediation sessions, whereas in community based organisations there is usually a sliding scale of hourly fees, with the fee per hour dependent on the level of income of one or other of the parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Family Court, as Senator Forshaw pointed out in a somewhat dismissive way, there are significant numbers of people who are exempt from paying the fees&mdash;as they should be&mdash;for counselling and mediation services, including people who have been granted legal aid, people who hold a card issued by the Department of Social Security or the Department of Veterans' Affairs that entitles them to Commonwealth health concessions, people who are in receipt of Austudy or Abstudy and people who are under 18 years of age. Payment of fees can be waived if the payment of the fee would cause financial hardship to the person. In addition to set categories of people who do not have to pay fees, there is provision for fees to be waived if there is hardship. As I am advised at the moment, about 45 per cent of all fees are waived by the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Family Law Act the parties can go to counselling either by consent or when ordered or directed to by the court. However, parties only go to mediation by consent. So attendance at mediation is always voluntary and fees for this service are therefore always to be payable. It is important to note that fees for counselling services provided by the Family Court are charged only when those services are used on a voluntary basis.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9275">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was not here for all of Senator Forshaw's speech, but I did not hear him draw that distinction. Let me repeat it: fees for counselling services provided by the Family Court are charged only when those services are used on a voluntary basis&mdash;that is, when the parties consent to counselling. Parties can consent to go to counselling either before having filed an application in the court or after.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Family Court reports that approximately 50 per cent of the people who use the court's counselling services do so before they have filed an application in the court. Therefore, they use the court's counselling services without having made any contribution to the costs of providing the court services&mdash;they have not even filed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After an application has been filed, the court can also order or direct, without the consent of the parties, that counselling take place. In these circumstances, as I have highlighted, no fee is payable. If people wish to avoid paying fees, they can voluntarily choose not to go to counselling and can wait for the court to order counselling after an application has been filed. However, when people file an application, in most cases they are required to pay a fee. So, even if they do not pay the fees for counselling and mediation services, they will have made some contribution to the costs of providing the court services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most people want to resolve their disputes as early as possible, especially where children are involved. It is clear that many people see counselling as a valuable process and will attend voluntary counselling even if fees are charged. After all, many people have been choosing to go to community based counselling services for which they traditionally have had to pay fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government believes there should be a greater reliance on the prevention of disputes arising, and on alternative dispute resolution rather than court actions. We are providing money for marriage education to try to give people the necessary skills to better deal with conflicts in a marriage situation. In addition to that, we are maintaining the expansion of the community mediation programs to assist 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people to resolve disputes at the local level without the need for courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, it is a case of people paying fees for voluntary counselling not being required to pay fees for court ordered or directed counselling. Those people who are undertaking court ordered or directed counselling do not pay. Out of all of those who are choosing to pay, there is a large group which automatically is exempt, and in addition to that there is a waiver opportunity. I repeat that this puts the users of those services more in line with the users of community based providers of those services.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3M6">Senator MURRAY</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(4.47 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, I thank you for your helpful remarks and thank the opposition for theirs. At the heart of this debate are two questions: one is where the burden of the cost of justice should fall; the other concerns the modern temptation&mdash;maybe it is a practice&mdash;to treat justice and the practice of law as a business. I separate those deliberately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First, it is the Australian Democrats' position&mdash;I think it has been an Australian tradition&mdash;that the cost of justice should fall on the community as a whole. That is to ensure that those who need access to justice, those who desire or have to use the services provided in our legal systems, will be able to access justice as cheaply, as easily and as freely as possible in the interests of the community and in the interests of greater social cohesion. I think that principle goes back a very long time in history and is fundamental.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue is the modern practice of treating justice, or the practice of law, as a business. It is true that in many respects the profession is dead and the business reigns. But that is not so throughout the practice of law and has certainly not been so in our courts. The philosophy of treating justice and law as a business produces an inclination, a motivation, towards user pays kinds of doctrines and towards recovering costs wherever they can be recovered. The Minister for Justice (Senator Vanstone) quite rightly makes the point that justice costs a great deal. She quite rightly makes the point that the bucket is not limitless and that the pressures on our 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9276"> judicial system are affected by other budgetary and fiscal needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This area of family law deals with one of the three great institutions which hold our society together. The resolution of contractual disputes&mdash;that is what it is&mdash;needs to be treated in as careful and sensitive a manner as possible. The minister has made it clear in her remarks that the imposition of fees is conditioned, if you like&mdash;or the effects are limited&mdash;by exemptions and waivers so that up to 45 per cent of users under the present system are not required to pay fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She makes the point that it is the voluntary services which will attract fees, and so on. She made a comparison with community based services. Of course, community based services frequently have no other means of funding, apart from donations, some government largesse and fees, whereas government has access to the coercive pressure of the taxation system. Whilst I hear a reasonable discourse from the minister, the Australian Democrats remain wedded to a long and committed view that the cost of justice should fall on the community as a whole and we remain opposed to a user pays mentality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We opposed these fees in, and the second reading of, the Family Law Amendment Bill 1996. In particular, we paid attention to one of the themes that the opposition picked out, which was the theme that five per cent of cases before the Family Court are now litigated; in other words, 95 per cent are not. That is an extremely attractive percentage to retain and maintain and I personally, on the precautionary principle, would not like to see the introduction of fees put at risk counselling, mediation and the non&hyphen;litigation resolution of such matters. We should see counselling and mediation as preventive measures, we should see them as preferred to the adversarial system and we should see them as buffers against costly and time consuming litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I regret, Minister, that despite your observations&mdash;many of which are very sound&mdash;we will continue to hold the view that fees in this area should be minimised or, if possible, not present at all. Accordingly, we will support the opposition in their motion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And thereafter, yes. I am also interested in what has occurred as a result of questions at the estimates committee hearings. But, before I go on to that, I want to look at some matters that Senator Forshaw has raised in his speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true, as the minister said, that there is difficulty in maintaining services where cost cutting measures needed to be implemented to overcome the problem with which the government was faced. She commenced her comments in opposition to the motion put forward by Senator Forshaw by clearly saying that this is a question of costs and that we have a deficit crisis. She questioned whether it is appropriate for persons accessing the conciliation and mediation services of the courts to do so on the public purse, particularly as there are exemption provisions and that 43 per cent&mdash;I think that is the figure she mentioned&mdash;of the persons who access this service have their fees waived. The minister will clarify that at a later stage if she wishes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will come back to that question in a moment but, before I do, I want to note that Senator Forshaw indicated that 47.1 per cent of cases came to the service on a voluntary basis, as compared with 60 per cent last financial year. I take it that those figures are since the court fees were introduced. He also indicated that 18.6 per cent of cases were referred by the court after applications for parenting orders, orders in relation to resi 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="9277"> dence and certain other aspects, and that 28.7 per cent were referred by the court after the first directions hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not sure whether the minister can clarify in her response whether the 18.6 per cent who were referred by the court after applications for parenting orders would have been required to pay an application fee. I imagine that is the case in regard to parenting orders and orders in relation to residence, contact or specific issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They would fit in with the concept that was being advanced and expressed by the minister in her response when she said that, at least, those who access the counselling services of the court should pay something to the system. That is one way of looking at it, I suppose. Senator Forshaw says, `What about looking at it another way? What about the costs saved by voluntary access to the mediation services of the court?' He said that, as a result of questioning at the estimates committee last year, it was revealed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . 75 per cent of those cases were successfully resolved by the counselling and mediation service.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Were it not for the provision of these services, one can only wonder how many more divorces we might have had.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I presume Senator Forshaw meant how many more contested and litigated divorces we might have had. The point was that account was not being taken by the government of the savings that would be made in court costs as a result of the work of the mediation services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Other figures emerged from the estimates committee hearings and these figures were mentioned by Senator Forshaw in his speech. They are worth being considered by the committee. It is not for me to repeat them but, nevertheless, they do give an indication that there has been a considerable drop in the number of persons accessing the mediation counselling services since the fees were established on 1 July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From memory, there was almost a 10 per cent drop in the number of persons voluntarily accessing the mediation services. I put it to the minister: isn't it better to have more people voluntarily accessing mediation ser 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> vices? I was impressed with Senator Forshaw's reference to His Honour, Mr Justice Brennan, of the High Court. Judge Brennan said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mediation and arbitration will continue to be familiar and prominent features of the system of dispute resolution in the future. There is no reason why, in the vast majority of cases, mediation should not be compulsory in the sense of being a condition of the right of any party to have the dispute brought to trial. But let it be court attached mediation. Either the mediator should be a court officer or a private mediator selected by the parties, by lot or by rotation. In either case, the fees should be charged on public revenue.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Chief Justice of the High Court made this comment which, of course, we are not bound to observe. As you would know, Madam Minister, it was not a judgment; it was a speech to the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration. There has been a lot of nonsense talked about our being bound by certain specific aspects of the common law, but that will be for a debate down the track&mdash;possibly in the next two weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I put it to the minister that in the latest figures that have been obtained through the estimates committee there has been a drop in the number of voluntary requests for mediation and conciliation. Obviously, we would like to see more emphasis on reconciliation counselling. The more that can be done for that, and for marriage education, the better. Let's face it: this was a neglected area in the administration under the previous Labor government. It was shameful. On marriage education, we need to constantly bear that in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe, quite frankly, that where you have voluntary mediation, you obviously are likely to get a better outcome. That clearly stands to reason. Whether it is in the industrial relations area, whether it is in this area or whether it is in other areas, it does not matter. If you have a voluntary approach, you are more likely to get a more satisfactory outcome which those accessing the mediation counselling are prepared to accept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been indicated, the estimates committees showed that since the introduction of the fees not only has there been a drop in the voluntary access to mediation counselling but 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9278"> also there has been a substantial increase in the number of orders to the parties for conciliation. I want to put those figures to the Senate again. The Registrar of the Family Court has stated that, in comparison to the June to September quarter of this year, voluntary counselling cases have reduced by 9.9 per cent. At the same time, court ordered counselling before the first directions hearing has increased by 29 per cent and court ordered counselling after the first direction hearing has increased by 20.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my mind those figures show that we are going backwards. It does not uphold the well&hyphen;known view that voluntary efforts for mediation and conciliation are more likely to prove successful than compulsorily directed counselling and, indeed, are more likely to save other costs involved with court proceedings in the long run, particularly in this case. I intend to support the motion.</PARA></SPEECH>

The first are the figures referred to by Senator Forshaw, which anyone can find at page 28 of the annual report of the Family Court. You mentioned that Senator Forshaw points out that as many as 47.1 per cent of all cases seen came on a voluntary basis. Apparently, he compared that with last year's figure of 61 per cent. You take that to be a reduction in people going voluntarily.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those figures are figures up until 30 June this year. They have no relationship to the fees imposed. I do not recall hearing&mdash;I might have been here&mdash;that portion of Senator Forshaw's comments, but these fees were

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Forshaw interjects that they were contemplated to come in from 1 January. Nonetheless, it does not detract from the point that the fees were not introduced until 1 July. Senator Forshaw, I will take the opportunity to go back to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  to see what you said. I would hate to think that you were trying to mislead people. I am not suggesting that you did, but I will take the opportunity of having a look. For Senator Harradine's benefit, he was the one who referred to these figures and that is what I understood him to be saying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then Senator Harradine referred to the registrar of the court, I think in estimates, referring to a drop of about 10 per cent for voluntary counselling for the June and September quarter compared to last year. There are a number of things I would urge you to take into account in that respect. First of all, as I am advised, the use of counselling and mediation does fluctuate. Whenever you take a small period of time and compare it with a small period of time in a previous year, you will necessarily get aberrations. I am not at all confident therefore that we can rely on that comparison. As I am advised, there are quite noticeable variations and fluctuations during the year, for which there is no apparent explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, if that voluntary counselling has gone down, we certainly cannot assume that those people are therefore not getting counselling. They may have gone off to Centrecare. Faced with a choice, they may have chosen the community provider. That is another aspect that perhaps has not had as much concentration in this debate as I would have liked.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a case of charging for a service that only the Commonwealth can provide, where people are restricted and must come to court counselling and must come to court mediation. They can go to the community service providers&mdash;not that it is the Commonwealth's job to redirect clients in  order to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9279"> keep community service providers going. Equally, on the other side of that coin, it is certainly not the Commonwealth's desire, let alone task, to provide such services free to take away the market, if you like, from community providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge the figures that were provided at the estimates committee, but with their being based on such a short period, neither you nor any of us can rely on them as a clear indicator. Secondly, even if we could, we do not know that those people have not got counselling. We simply know that they are not doing it voluntarily through the Family Court. They may be going to community providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine referred to the increases, apparently, as I understood him to say, that the registrar referred to. As I indicated in my remarks, where there is court ordered counselling no fee is payable. We are talking here about a fee for voluntary counselling&mdash;not court ordered counselling.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just making a point as a consequence of the figures that you raised. Because it is voluntary, people can choose to go to the Family Court or to the community service providers. We say in those circumstances where it is entirely voluntary&mdash;it was not court ordered and therefore paid for by the court&mdash;people can choose where they go and they can choose to go to a community provider and pay and, if they choose to come to the Family Court, they should have to pay something there. But we recognise that there needs to be an acknowledgment of those who simply cannot afford to pay, and that is why there is such an extensive range of people who are excluded from payment or for whom waivers of up to around 45 per cent, which is the figure I quoted, can be provided. So I encourage Senator Harradine to reconsider in this matter on those bases.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Joint Treaties Committee is looking at the Convention on the Rights of the Child. There has been a remarkable interest in the community about those matters. In my view, one of the worst things that can happen is for parents to get into ongoing legal cases in the Family Court. I am sure judges do not like them. I am sure the community cannot afford them. I am sure it brings great tragedy to the parties and to the children involved. In cases involving two or three marriages, the children are all mixed up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The best way to dispose of contention, as Senator Harradine said, whether it is industrial contention, contention over the land&mdash;we are about to debate that in the Wik matter&mdash;or, most importantly, contention over matrimonial relationships, is for parties to agree when it is fundamental to the concept of law under which we operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, if I recall correctly my catechism as a youth, Luke has Christ saying that if you are off to court make sure you settle on the way, otherwise you are going to get into all sorts of trouble. It seems to me that this is the sort of issue we face here. Surely to goodness, if parties can get together on a voluntary basis or with the help of other people and settle the matter, isn't that a good thing not only economically, as has been pointed out, but also socially and for the marriage and the children involved?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And good for the economy, as Senator Forshaw says. The other 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9280"> point I want to make before I sit down is that this, again, is a restriction by government on money necessary to run that part of government involved in settling disputes. It is an essential part of the function of government. Making laws is what we do; carrying out those laws is what the executive does; and interpreting the laws and applying them is what the third arm of government does. Conciliation and mediation is a central means by which that is performed, and we are starving that section. People in community legal centres are desperate for funds. I freely acknowledge the situation in Victoria, but the situation down there is getting so bad that it can no longer be tolerated and the whole system looks like toppling over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are not going to provide proper assistance for people to go to court&mdash;I take up what Senator Harradine and Senator Forshaw have said&mdash;surely we can at least help people take a course in mediation and conciliation, which is cheaper than going to court.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reply, I will clarify something I said for the advantage of the Minister for Justice (Senator Vanstone), because I think she said that she did not hear that part of my speech. At the outset I quoted from the 1996-97 annual report. I quoted statistics which related to the number of counselling cases dealt with in person by the service, the number of crisis calls, the number of counselling cases and the number of interviews. Then I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As many as 47.1 per cent of cases came to the service on a voluntary basis. This is down on the almost 60 per cent figure in the 1995-96 financial year. In all, 18.6 per cent of the cases were referred by the court for counselling after an application for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a parenting order in relation to residence, contact or specific issues was filed but prior to the matter first coming to court. A further 28.7 per cent were referred by the court after the first directions hearing.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is precisely what I said. I then went on and, as Senator Harradine quite correctly noted, referred to the advice provided at the estimates hearing and since the estimates hearing by way of letter dated 20 November 1997 from the Family Court of Australia's chief executive officer. As Senator Harradine quoted, in that letter the statistics were 9.9 per cent in relation to the reduction in the number of voluntary cases from June to September; in the same period, a substantial increase of 29 per cent in court ordered counselling before the first directions hearing; and 20.5 per cent after the first directions hearing.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="656">Senator FORSHAW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was a suggestion that you had not heard it but you thought you had better go away and check. I will jump up and defend precisely what I said; it is here in writing if you want to have a look. The other point I made at the outset was that originally it was intended to come in on 1 January.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will make just a couple of other quick comments. You stated, Minister, that the previous government had considered fees. Again, I did actually deal with that in my remarks. I referred to the fact that this issue had been foreshadowed in the 1995-96 budget statements. There was a review of court and tribunal fees initiated by the previous Labor government. However, as is quite clear, the previous government rejected the introduction of fees for these specific services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think I need to respond to anything else. I think it has been adequately dealt with by the remarks of Senator Murray, Senator Harradine and Senator Cooney. I make the final point&mdash;as has been said I think by all 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9281"> the speakers in support of the motion&mdash;that this is ultimately about what is good public policy. It is about ensuring that those who wish to voluntarily access the service can do so free of cost or of charge that in many cases is an impost upon them at a most inappropriate time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day, the statistics show that that service very often leads to successful outcomes. That may be successful outcomes in the prevention of contentious litigation or in reconciliation or in establishing sensible and appropriate outcomes for the custody of and other arrangements for children. All of that, at the end of the day, is something that is in the interest of the community and in the interest of the economy. Frankly, to resort to the arguments of black holes and budget deficits only really is no support for the measure that was contemplated here, given the obvious social and economic benefits that the service currently provides.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality with the Administrative Building is that both sides of this chamber recognise&mdash;the Australian Labor Party certainly did when it was in government&mdash;that the building does need to be refurbished, that it can be put to better use and that it can achieve an economic return as office space once it has been refurbished and brought up to a commercially occupiable level. Clearly, as part of that, repairs to and retrofitting of the building are required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Anyone who bothers to go to look at the building will see that the removal of the parapets is absolutely essential to the repair, rectification and modification of the building to fit it out as a suitable modern office environment. This particular motion is seeking approval to remove these parapets, which is basically the bricking up of a number of windows. I am told that this removal work will allow light to come back into this section of office on the second top floor of the building and make it habitable office space.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ray, when you find some waste in relation to office space and show us a case where we waste money, you tell us and we will fix it. This is not one of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> story, one of the things they did when they ran our space waste stories was that they always got the Minister for Administrative Services on to give the alternative point of view&mdash;they always had Senator McMullan, when he was Minister for Administrative Services, and even Frank Walker once. But when the minister, Senator Nick Minchin, offered to brief <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> and put the government's point of view the program took absolutely no interest whatsoever.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed when I was watching that program last Thursday night that they said that the parliament had approved this money. Again, they did not pay any cognisance to the information the government had put to them. I can only say that they join with the Labor Party in supporting the fact that this money should not be spent. They want to make sure that the rental return on that space&mdash;the value&mdash;is not maximised. So to save $98,000 they would prefer to see the rental return rate on this property reduced to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars over the life of the building. That is the economic absurdity of what these people are proposing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is an analogy which even Ray Martin and possibly Senator Robert Ray may be able to draw on. This is the best way for people to understand the famous parapet issue. The analogy is: when you are going to buy a three&hyphen;bedroom house in your suburb, how would you value a house that had most of the windows bricked up to above eye level compared with a house that had windows that you could see out of and that let the light in? That is the comparison. Those blokes say, `Look, we have this building and in the interests of the Commonwealth let's knock down these parapets and let the light shine in.' Those opposite say, `No, don't spend that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9283"> money'&mdash;even though the value of the house may improve massively because light can get back in through the windows, people can have their desks by the windows and actually see and it can be commercially viable office space again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Ray's lunatic economic assessment of this is that because it is a Commonwealth lease of a Commonwealth building you do not have to actually improve the rental value of it. He is saying to Commonwealth public servants who might go and work in that building, `Sorry, it is okay for everyone else in this building or any other Commonwealth building to have offices with windows where light can come in but, if you are going into this building, it is bad luck. You can work in a bricked&hyphen;up office&mdash;you can have your windows bricked up.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we should do for Senator Robert Ray so that he appreciates this issue is get the Parliament House services company to go around and brick up his windows&mdash;put a few parapets in his windows&mdash;and see how he likes it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had Senator Campbell exposed as a Canberra basher. This is the man who was delighted that, as a result of federal government policies, Canberra found itself in a recession. Eventually, as a result of the opposition exposing Senator Campbell, Senator Campbell was forced to apologise. Did he come into the Senate chamber and apologise himself? No. Of all people, he got poor old Senator Kemp, struggling, as we know, at question time, to come in and present the apology on his behalf. That was problem No. 2 for Senator Campbell today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Problem No. 3 for Senator Campbell today is the fact that he has been exposed as a strong supporter of the Australian Democrats, if not a member of the Australian Democrats, earlier in his political career. It really does put the lie to all the attacks we have heard in the chamber over all the years from Senator Campbell about his political opponents in the Australian Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now problem No. 4 for Senator Campbell on this most inauspicious day for him in his parliamentary career is that he is now proposing to have to defend on behalf of the government the government's plan to spend what we were told was $185,000 to adjust the parapets on one of Australia's most historic&mdash;certainly one of Canberra's most historic&mdash;public buildings just to provide apparently a more pleasant view for a few senior bureaucrats who will have to occupy that floor of the Administrative Building. What we say is that it is absolutely indefensible. It is a ridiculous proposition at a time when Australians are being punished by a raft of government decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does Senator Campbell do today? He comes in and says, `Look, there are a whole lot of reasons to do this.' It is a pity that, when the opposition asked for details about this particular proposal, those reasons did not appear. There is only one reason that appears in the official documentation attached to a minute to the minister which was received by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the opposition. I quote directly from the document:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The works are considered necessary to improve the amenity of the 4th Floor of the building as the present height of the parapets currently obstructs the views to the north and south from substantial parts of the proposed office space floor area. The lack of amenity has caused concern with prospective tenants. This is the main reason given by the DPG&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, the Domestic Property Group&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for the current inability to find a tenant prepared to commit to a lease over the area.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is what the official documentation of the government says. In the same official documentation, on the last page, under the subheading `Cost of works', it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Domestic Property Group estimate the cost of the proposed works at $185,000.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Magically, that estimate has now changed. It is now, magically, a different reason why they want to remove two courses of stone. Let me explain the situation. There are two courses of stone around these parapets with a stone capping. The idea is to remove two courses and put the capping back on. We found these figures in the government's own official documents. We found the reasons, the argumentation in support of this particular proposal, in the government's own official documents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does Senator Campbell do? He comes in and attacks the messenger. He decided he would attack <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS>. He asked why <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> did not ask the responsible minister, Senator Minchin. Possibly one reason is that Senator Minchin is not the responsible minister; it is Mr Fahey. Mr Fahey was asked by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS>, and what did Mr Fahey do? He refused to give any information to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS>. He absolutely refused to provide any comment because, in his own words, $185,000 of taxpayers' money was a trivial amount. But I do thank Mr Fahey, who invited me to go on an inspection of the building, which was a kind offer that I took up. I was accompanied by a member of Mr Fahey's staff. This might all be of interest to Senator Campbell, who knows nothing about the issue which we are talking about.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9285">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I went down and had a look. Do you know what I thought? I thought that $185,000 for what was proposed would, for example, cover a number of up&hyphen;front fees for elderly Australians to enter a nursing home. That is what I thought. When I inspected the site on Friday, I was not at all impressed by the new arguments that had been put forward by the government in the House of Representatives debate last week. I have seen the work area there, and the truth of the matter is that there is plenty of light pouring into it. Any attempt to use occupational health and safety reasons is just unacceptable; it is a nonsense. Is the government seriously maintaining that there are occupational health and safety questions involved? This is something that the Labor Party always takes seriously. Unlike this mob on the other side of the chamber, we care about these sorts of issues. If they have got any evidence, put it up. There is no evidence, and in the official documentation we have received none.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same government that sacked 30,000 public servants in its first two budgets, purportedly to save money, is now proposing these completely cosmetic changes to a historic, heritage&hyphen;listed building in Canberra&mdash;an important building&mdash;just to improve the views.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ray raises the issue of the bus shelter. I am glad you did, Senator Ray, because that gives you an idea of the priorities of this government. What is the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet concentrating on? The big issues of the day; those particular issues that are causing the Howard government to unravel? No, he is putting all of his effort into communicating with&mdash;or heavying, really&mdash;the ACT administration to get them to remove the wall from the back of a bus shelter. Those are the priorities of the Howard government: changing the size of the parapet and removing the wall at the back of a bus shelter. That is where they can really get some action. They cannot fix the major political issues of day. Mr Moore&hyphen;Wilton may not be doing much of a job on any of the key

No, we should not spend this extra amount of money just to improve the amenity. This is a loony scheme that the government is proposing.

So I do not think that is a valid comparison to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Heritage Commission, on whom governments depend for advice on these sorts of issues, has raised concerns with the government that the lowering of the parapets would adversely affect part of the national estate; that is, the architectural integrity of these buildings. We heard the government, in the House of Representatives, try to say, `Look, really those parapets were put around there for security concerns at the time ASIS occupied the top floor of the building.' Oh, really, is that right? Of course not; it is another furphy, another lie and another deliberate attempt to deceive us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth of the matter is, as the Australian Heritage Commission have confirmed in their documentation&mdash;and, I am pleased to say, it was confirmed at the inspection on which I went with a member of Mr Fahey's staff on Friday of last week&mdash;that the parapets have been there since the building was built in the 1940s. That was the information I was given. I am sorry that a senior minister has misled the House of Representatives on that issue. No doubt an apology, such as the one Senator 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9286"> Campbell made today, will be forthcoming in the not too distant future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This building previously housed the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but it is being refurbished for the Department of Finance and Administration&mdash;DoFA. That particular department is going to occupy part of the building. This is the government department that is so keen to make all other government departments cut back their budgets. But, of course, under Mr Fahey, the minister responsible for finance, they splurge on themselves. The same principle does not apply to the Department of Finance and Administration itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only reason that we are being asked to give this the tick is so a few senior bureaucrats sitting on the top floor of that building can see a few more treetops. That is what it is about. Well, the Labor Party will not have a bar of it. It is a waste of taxpayers' money. The government stands condemned, having had it exposed by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was criticism by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS>&mdash;the unjustified criticism of journalists taking an interest in a matter like this. The government laugh off the issue of a waste of taxpayers' money as not being serious, but I reckon that ordinary Australians, whether it is $185,000 as the government once said it was or whether it is over $90,000 as they now say their estimate is&mdash;they got it wrong in the first place&mdash;would think that that sort of expenditure was unjustified on a matter like this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No, we do not accept what the government says on this. No, we are not going to tick off on expenditure for these absolutely preposterous reasons. No, we do not support the motion before the Senate. But, yes, we do believe that Senator Campbell, having been struck out for the fourth time today, really ought to go around and have a look at whether he is in the right place at the right time doing the right job.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook in his remarks also accused the government of undermining confidence in superannuation through the introduction of a surcharge. I have to say: I wonder what evidence Senator Cook had to make this assertion? Certainly, statistics produced by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission suggest that last year was, as they say, `a super year for super'. By the end of June 1997 superannuation assets had passed the $300 billion mark&mdash;in fact, Senator Cook, during the year, they were growing by almost $1 billion a week. Contributions, Senator Cook, also grew strongly during the year, rising by 12 per cent, with the strongest growth coming from member contributions, which increased by 17 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Allison noted in her speech that Democrat support for the surcharge had been 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> on the basis that low and middle income earners would not pay the surcharge and that the government would consult on reducing administrative problems with the legislation when they arose. On the first issue, I have already noted that the Democrat amendments to the legislation will act to achieve this goal. I reiterate that collection rates of tax file numbers are currently in line with expectations at this stage of the process, and this is before the tax office undertakes the expensive and time consuming processes which resulted from the amendment moved in the Senate. On the second issue, a number of amendments to the bills are being made in response to industry concerns raised during the significant consultation both the government and the ATO had with the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think Senator Conroy raised any new issues in his remarks. I think he quoted at some length the responses given by the government and officials at the Senate select committee hearings, although he was conspicuous by his absence at those hearings. Senator Cooney suggested that the bills undermined the security of tenure of judges. The government does not agree with this proposition. Current judges are exempt from the surcharge because, under the constitution, their remuneration cannot be reduced. However, as the constitutional protection does not apply to newly appointed judges, they will be subject to the surcharge like all Australians. Applying general measures equally to judges does not offend the principle of judicial independence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his contribution to the debate, Senator Quirke commented that elements of this package of legislation would favour Commonwealth employees and parliamentarians over their state counterparts. I note for the information of Senator Quirke that the government has already indicated that it will be moving an amendment which will address any such perception on this issue. I would urge senators, if they believe strongly in the question of equity, as I assume most senators do, to support this legislation and its passage through the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One comment from the opposition which I thought was of particular interest was that of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9288"> Senator Evans, who has just returned to the chamber. If I am summarising his views correctly, he said that the Labor Party would keep the surcharge but would look at alternative ways of collecting it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that will be of interest. I have to tell you, Senator, that your party looked with great effort at finding an alternative collection mechanism. In fact, right up until the last moment the Labor Party was going to move some amendments in relation to an alternative collection mechanism. In the end I think they wisely decided&mdash;for reasons which were not stated but I assume for reasons of which we were aware&mdash;that this mechanism would be impossibly complex. So those amendments were not ultimately moved. I will restate those lines in your speech, Senator, because when I read them I thought they were quite significant.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am just saying that if they have been misinterpreted, we note your comments. Equity is important. As senators would know, it has surprised me that there has been a vigorous debate on this issue, but ultimately the Labor Party opposed the imposition of the surcharge. For a party which highlights as one of its key values the value of equity, I have to say that that came as a surprise not only to me but also to many Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Evans referred to correspondence of the Select Committee on Superannuation from the Institute of Actuaries which suggested that it was not possible to apply the surcharge equitably to defined benefit funds. Firstly, the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government disagrees with the assertion that its intention that no member of a defined benefits scheme pay the surcharge of more than 15 per cent cannot be achieved with the current legislation. Advice to the government is that the trustees are the appropriate people who have responsibility for ensuring that the surcharge is applied equitably to members of defined benefit funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to place on record that the Institute of Actuaries has been working with the government throughout this process. In particular, on 29 July 1997 the institute advised the government:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is appropriate that the standard for the calculation of an NSCR should be published by the government.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The institute is of the view that a fairly prescriptive approach is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In addition, it said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The institute supports this approach as appropriate in the circumstances and in line with our recommendations to the government in broad terms.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The institute wrote to me recently, following its earlier letter to the committee, saying that it recognises that there were some ambiguities in its letter to the committee. It has now stated that it is not claiming that it is impossible to introduce a surcharge. The institute has also acknowledged that it has been extensively consulted during the whole process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I repeat that the measures in these bills improve the equity and efficiency of the operation of the surcharge. Many of the measures in this bill arose from comments by stakeholders and industry, so the bill in itself represents the end product of a high degree of consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate on these bills has been delayed for too long. We had been anxious, as I think senators will attest, to have this debate earlier. For reasons which people in the chamber will know, this unfortunately was not possible. It is time that we enacted the measures in this bill. As I have said, they resulted from consultations with industry. We believe that these bills are an important equity measure. In this context, it is important both for the sake of the industry and for the sake of ensuring greater equity in our superannuation system 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9289"> that the legislation be passed as quickly as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will be supporting both these amendments to the <XREF CLASS="BILL" XREFID="R350">Superannuation Contributions Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Assessment and Collection Bill 1997</XREF> . I would like to say a few words about the government amendment concerning the 15 per cent cap on state constitutionally protected funds. Labor will be supporting this amendment. The amendment relates to the 15 per cent cap which these amended bills appear to apply to some undefined benefit schemes, particularly Commonwealth superannuation schemes and some state superannuation schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Specifically, two of the amended bills in this package, the  Superannuation Legislation Amendment (Superannuation Contributions Tax) Bill 1997 and the Superannuation Contributions Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Assessment and Collection Bill 1997, impose a 15 per cent cap on the surcharge tax liability which a fund member is liable to pay. However, the wording used to apply the 15 per cent cap in the two bills is quite different, and it is unclear whether there is an inconsistency in the operation of the cap between the Commonwealth schemes and the state schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Commonwealth schemes, the 15 per cent cap seems to apply to the surcharge tax liability which is accrued after 20 August 1996, which was when this measure was 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9290"> announced. In other words, a member will not have their superannuation benefits reduced by a surcharge tax liability of more than 15 per cent of the employer financed component of that part of the benefit accrued after 20 August 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 15 per cent cap in the state superannuation schemes affected by these amendment bills appears to operate in a different way, which may still see the cap apply, but to benefits accrued both before and after 20 August 1997. This amendment will apply the 15 per cent surcharge tax liability cap to those benefits accrued in a constitutionally protected superannuation scheme after 20 August 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this amendment does provide some consistency in the 15 per cent cap to the Commonwealth and state defined benefit schemes, it is still quite noticeable that the cap does not apply to all funds, and we will be interested in asking the government why this is the case. However, we will be supporting this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, I have looked at your amendments and I think they probably solve the problem that I raised the other night, but I want to be absolutely certain. Can you confidently tell the committee that no person, in any of these schemes which are being legislated about tonight, need have any fear that it will be made retrospective to before 20 August 1996? It was put to me that Commonwealth persons in these particular defined schemes were given an explicit legislative protection which indicated that they would not be subjected to the surcharge, or any part of the surcharge, before 20 August 1996 which, as I understand, was budget night and when this was announced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments that were circulated earlier today are, if I remember rightly, amendments to clause 12 of the first bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The  Superannuation Contributions and Termination Payments Taxes Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 introduces a requirement into the Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997 for accumulated benefits superannuation funds to report contributions which are made to a member from allocated surplus reserves. I wish to stress that this is a new requirement, introduced by these amendment bills, which 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9291"> is supposed to operate retrospectively from 20 August last year. Until now superannuation funds and fund members did not have this liability to meet. I understand that the government claims that this measure is designed as an anti&hyphen;avoidance measure which will stop certain superannuation funds from avoiding paying the superannuation surcharge contributions tax by going on a contributions holiday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If that is the intention of the government's proposed amendment, we support that in principle because we believe that some high income earners should not be able to avoid tax by virtue of being in a certain type of fund. However, we believe that the way this measure has been designed not only puts an additional complicating burden on superannuation funds by requiring, for the first time, accumulated funds to use the services of an actuary, but also will unnecessarily increase compliance costs, which will be passed on to low and middle income earners. In addition, the design of this measure will tax superannuation fund earnings, even though this is supposed to be a tax on contributions and it could also be a double taxation burden.</PARA>

Labor's amendment is designed to apply the tax on allocated surplus reserves from 1 July 1997 with further foreshadowed amendments to apply a simpler anti&hyphen;avoidance measure from the same date. This will make things simpler for funds to administer. It will be less retrospective and more reasonable given the long period of time which has passed. It is also designed to reduce the compliance costs on superannuation funds and also to stop the double taxation of contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that many accumulation type funds have what are called investment fluctuation reserves which are built up in the years in which there are high investment earnings. In those years, when the fund earns well, the trustees do not credit the whole of the investment earnings to the members' accounts. Rather, some of those investment earnings are set aside in the investment fluctuation reserve or what the government has called allocated surplus reserves. Then, in years that the returns to the fund are not so high, trustees transfer amounts out of the allocated surplus reserve into members' accounts. That is what this amendment bill, if allowed to pass unamended, will tax: the transfers out of the investment fluctuation reserves into members' accounts for high income earners or for others who do not supply their tax file numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In evidence to the Senate superannuation committee, Mr Ray Stevens from William M. Mercer recommended that this measure if introduced apply from 1 July 1997, which would reduce the retrospectivity and allow time to sort out and publicise what is really meant by the measure and how it would be administered. He went on to give his reasons for that recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Otherwise, I believe we will have chaos and delays with returns for 1996&hyphen;97 for accumulation funds, and an ongoing reaction from members and former members who are advised they now have a new tax liability they were not previously advised of.

As Senator Cook said, representations have been made suggesting that the allocated surplus amounts in the accumulation funds should be included in surchargeable contributions so people do not enter into behaviour to avoid the surcharge.

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments would be colloquially known as the golden handshake amendments. The purpose of these amendments relates to inconsistencies in the surcharge tax treatment of eligible termination payments financed by an employer&mdash;payments that are known as golden handshakes&mdash;when taken as cash or when rolled over into a superannuation account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This issue has been raised by Labor in several forums and was the subject of a submission to the recent hearing of the Select Committee on Superannuation looking into these bills. When a golden handshake is paid to an employee by an employer, that employee may choose to take that payment in cash or may choose to roll it over into a superannuation account. If an employee takes the golden handshake in cash, only the post-20 August component of the payment is subject to the surcharge tax. Of course, the payment itself is subject to a range of other taxes which an employee would have to consider when deciding how to take the payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, if the employee chooses to roll his or her golden handshake payment into a superannuation account, the entire payment&mdash;that is, the pre- and post&hyphen;20 August component&mdash;is subject to the surcharge tax. This is clearly an inconsistency in our view which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the government should have fixed itself. It is also an unfair measure in that it is a retrospective tax on benefits already accrued, something which should send alarm bells ringing amongst all the other senators in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the government has exercised a sleight of hand in implementing this inconsistency. The press release of the Treasurer (Mr Costello) of 20 August 1996 did not mention anything about there being a different surcharge tax treatment depending on whether the golden handshake is taken as cash or whether it is rolled over. For example, the Treasurer's 20 August 1996 press release, in describing the surcharge tax, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes are entirely prospective and do not impact in any way on already accumulated superannuation benefits . . . or `golden handshake' . . . with respect to service before today's announcement.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The press release went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This surcharge will not affect people already in retirement nor will it affect already accrued superannuation benefits, including all past contributions and earnings on those contributions. Further, it will not affect benefits paid under an unfunded or constitutionally protected scheme or `golden handshake' with respect to service&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">before the budget announcement. However, by 5 February 1997 the Treasurer had 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9295"> changed his mind. In the Treasurer's press release issued on that day, the government announced that it would be treating golden handshakes differently in that they would be subject to a five-year transitional period. That meant that golden handshakes received after 20 August 2001 would be fully subject to the surcharge tax&mdash;that is, the post-20 August 1996 component and the pre-20 August 1996 component.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now, of course, the government is entitled to change its mind about the way it treats golden handshakes. In fact, we expect this government to change their mind because they are becoming known as the government by press release: they announce a policy measure, realise after the event how wrong they have got it, then change it by issuing a press release. However, on this occasion they have not fixed the matter up. The announced five-year transition period for golden handshakes does not fix the inconsistent tax treatment when a golden handshake payment is taken in cash or is rolled over. These are important consequences for Australia's national savings levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Noel Davis, superannuation lawyer with Clayton Utz, has pointed out&mdash;that is the law company of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)&mdash;this measure will impact on the superannuation system and our country's national savings. Davis said of the inconsistency:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will encourage people to take the money out of super, which does nothing to encourage long-term savings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This government has shown that it does not have much regard for national savings. If it did, it would not have abandoned Labor's three plus three superannuation contribution scheme, which would have added some $3.7 billion to Australia's national savings. But it did abandon Labor's measure and in its place it introduced a savings rebate which will benefit mainly high income earners at the expense of low and middle income earners and, as Treasury officials admitted in Senate estimates committee hearings, will do little to assist national savings levels. So it comes as little surprise that this government has given little regard to the impact its surcharge tax measure will have on national savings.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many people have been affected by this anomaly. The Senate superannuation committee heard evidence from Mr Bruce Harris who, acting on the advice in the government's press release of 20 August 1996, rolled his golden handshake into a superannuation fund. Much to Mr Harris's dismay, when the surcharge tax bill came into force on 5 June this year, he discovered that his decision at the time, made with knowledge based on the Treasurer's press releases, would actually see him paying more total tax than if he had taken the payment in cash. This is a particularly galling issue for Mr Harris because he has worked in the superannuation industry for some 10 years and considered that he knew it and its rules and regulations quite well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That leads us to assume that, if this happened to Mr Harris and indeed several other superannuation experts who we know have been affected by this measure, there can be no doubt that many other people who may not have such in-depth knowledge of superannuation will also be affected. Here, again, like the many low and middle income earners who will have to unnecessarily pay the surcharge tax, we have another group of people who have been disadvantaged by this shambles of a measure. But what the inconsistent treatment of golden handshakes means is that it is more tax effective to take a golden handshake as cash rather than rolling it over into a superannuation system. This has potentially devastating consequences for superannuation as a savings vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That particularly disappoints Labor, given the efforts and successes we have had in building up superannuation as a savings vehicle which greatly contributes to achieving Australia's economic goals while contributing to building better retirement incomes for all Australians. Our amendments simply ensure that golden handshake payments are treated on an equal footing regardless of whether they are taken as cash or rolled over into a superannuation account. I commend these amendments to senators.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to Senator Cook's comments on national savings, national savings collapsed under the Labor government and national 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> savings were plundered by the massive deficits which the Keating government ran. There is no argument with that. One of the ways we have been able to repair national savings is by returning the Commonwealth budget to a surplus. So Senator Cook lecturing on national savings is a little out of court, to be quite frank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook mentioned the Labor Party proposal&mdash;the co-contribution, the three plus three. My understanding is Labor has dropped that scheme. Former Senator Evans, if I recall correctly&mdash;and if what I am saying is incorrect perhaps a Labor member can indicate it&mdash;has indicated that it is unlikely that the Labor Party would proceed with that program and that the unions have lost a degree of enthusiasm for it. So that scheme, which followed the l-a-w tax cuts, was never able to be implemented and my understanding is that the Labor Party has dropped it. So it adds little to the debate to raise that in this context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments moved by Senator Cook will add pressure to the ability of funds to meet the reporting date. Funds will be required to calculate the post 20 August 1996 component of golden handshakes rolled over so they can report the appropriate amount to the commissioner by 15 December. Such a change in the reporting requirements at this late stage of the proceedings, frankly, may cause confusion about what has to be reported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments treat golden handshakes rolled over consistently with those taken in cash. Golden handshakes rolled over are essentially the same as employer contributions to a superannuation fund and therefore should be treated the same as an employer contribution to a superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments will encourage employers to defer superannuation contributions until retirement and give an employee a golden handshake at that time. In contrast to what Senator Cook said, this could impact on the amount of money going into the superannuation system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also, the amendments will cause complaints from people who took golden handshakes in cash after the surcharge legislation was introduced, because they made a choice&mdash;they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9297"> preferred cash rather than the superannuation implications of rolling over. These people may well feel that they have been unfairly treated. From the government's perspective, these amendments are preferable to the Democrat amendment because they recognise the five-year transitional rule for golden handshakes taken in cash. We will be opposing the amendments. If we could hear what the Greens are going to say, that would decide whether we will call a division or not.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This is probably the most important amendment that we will be moving. It seeks to extend the reporting date for the 1996-97 financial year by two months. All superannuation funds have reported great difficulty in meeting the reporting deadline. No doubt we have all had a great number of letters on this subject. The problem is particularly acute for defined benefit funds, which are required to complete at what are at times very complex actuarial investigations, particularly if their scheme has more than one benefit design, prior to 15 December.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be pointed out that the legislation passed in May technically failed to require defined benefits funds to report, with the result that many trustees have not commenced the work of complying with the reporting requirements because they are not legally compelled or even allowed to do so. While the ATO has indicated that it will be lenient with funds facing genuine problems, I think it would be very poor policy in this first year to set an unreasonable deadline and ask the funds to comply. My concern is that the government will not be as lenient as it should be, because of the desire to collect the revenue in this financial year.

The actuaries have really only recently devised anything like an appropriate system. In fact, the actuarial guidelines are still being questioned, as late as this debate.

That is, the regulations tabled in the Senate could or would be disallowed by the Senate if it chose to do so. The Senate may choose to do so if indeed the regulations are too onerous on funds.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The commissioner may make a decision not to collect a tax liability after considering a range of factors, including whether the cost of collecting the tax liability would be more than the liability itself.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reason is that having superannuation funds act as the Taxation Office is also not a desirable situation. That is what the Democrats' amendment will, unfortunately, do. If a fund believes that there is information which, had the Australian Taxation Office known about it, it would have issued a different surcharge tax liability, then the Democrat amendment would give the superannuation fund the power to adjust the tax liability before the Australian Taxation Office has had a chance to adjust its assessment.

They claim that, given that the notional surchargeable contributions are based on averaging principles, it is possible that some people will pay more than the 15 per cent of final benefit. The government's response is that the funds can pay this out of reserves or surpluses or other income, or the employer can make up the difference.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment goes to another of the inconsistencies which exist as a result of this complex legislation. In this case, the inconsistency is that some defined benefit superannuation funds have a 15 per cent cap on the surcharged tax liability in respect of the benefit payable to the individual but others do not. This is an issue that was raised in the Senate superannuation committee and is yet to be answered by the government. I might say there are a lot of other questions that were raised in that committee on the surcharge tax issue which are also yet to be answered. However, in that committee, evidence given by Mr Ray Stevens of Mercer that putting a cap on all superannuation funds would only make the situation more complex and potentially less workable is, in our submission, notable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While this Democrat amendment appears to apply only to defined benefit superannuation funds, it fits into the unworkable category. For example, how would the Commissioner of Taxation know `the value of the superannuation benefit that would have been payable to the person if the surcharge amounts had not been deducted'?

I think it provides a detailed reply to the issues which were raised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to this amendment, the Commonwealth public sector funds are generally defined benefit funds. The amending bill ensures that the defined benefit payable to a particular member of a Commonwealth public sector fund can be reduced to reflect the amount of the surcharge payable. The 15 per cent cap on the amount of surcharge payable by a member of a Commonwealth public sector fund allows the trustee of that fund to ensure the impact of the surcharge on a particular member is imposed equitably. The trustee is still liable to pay the full amount in the member's surcharge debt account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is moving an amendment to ensure the 15 per cent cap on the amount of surcharge payable by members of constitutionally protected funds is the same as that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9304"> which applies to that operated by the Commonwealth. A 15 per cent cap is not necessary where the liability is on the fund because the trustee of the fund is able to ensure that the impact of the surcharge on a particular member is imposed equitably. Senator Cook gave some of the evidence in relation to this matter before the committee. The trustee of a private sector superannuation fund could place a 15 per cent cap on the amount that could be drawn from a member's account to pay the surcharge. Before the Senate select committee, witnesses indicated it would be very difficult to apply a cap of this nature on private sector funds. With state funds, the imposition is on the member. With regard to the Commonwealth funds, the amendments are to the act under which the scheme is administered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that covers the matters that you raised, Senator Cook. You asked for a response to the Institute of Actuaries letter. With the concurrence of the committee, I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a letter addressed to Senator John Watson, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, regarding the correspondence received by the committee from the Institute of Actuaries of Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear John</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to your letter of 17 November 1997 on the correspondence received by the Committee from the Institute of Actuaries of Australia, I have sought the advice of the Australian Government Actuary. This letter reflects that advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the Government disagrees with the assertion that its intention that no member of a defined benefit scheme pay a surcharge of more than 15% cannot be achieved with the current legislation. While the letter may be misconstrued as raising issues which relate to the implementation arrangements for the surcharge as a whole, this 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> interpretation would pay insufficient attention to the flexibility provided to trustees in dealing with implementation issues, particularly equity issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the development of the taxation ruling (SCR97/1) which sets out how the NSCFs are to be determined this issue was discussed with actuaries. It was well understood that there would be cases where the equity of the surcharge would need to be dealt with. The question was whether this should be addressed in the determination of NSCFs (through notifiable events and such like as well as a more rather than less flexible calculation methodology) or whether it would be more effectively addressed in determining the application of the surcharge to benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was the advice of the actuaries to the Government Actuary and to the Government that the NSCFs should be more prescriptive rather than less so and that the treatment of equity in such cases should properly rest with trustees and the application to benefit alteration.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">"Without specific attention, it is likely that some members would effectively pay the surcharge on benefits which they never receive. For example, in a scheme which provides relatively poor resignation benefits and generous retirement benefits, those who resign may have their benefit reduced by surcharge liabilities on contributions which actually benefit the other members who stay on to retirement." The advice went on to suggest "that fund trustees should take responsibility for ensuring that the surcharge is applied equitably in these circumstances."</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Francis' letter also relies on a particular interpretation of the SIS Act and of terms such as "fair" and "equitable". Clearly, there is scope for a range of views as to the precise application of these obligations by trustees. But it has been the advice to Government that it is trustees who are the appropriate people to undertake this responsibility and that trustees will be aware of their responsibility to ensure that the surcharge is applied equitably to members of defined benefit funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">regulation </EMPHASIS> of a particular approach for the reduction of benefits would have the following problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Such an approach would restrict trustees (and employers for single employer funds) in the manner of benefit alteration which could be administratively more complex than allowing greater flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A prescribed approach would mean that members of some schemes could be burdened with greater difficulties in communicating the benefit impacts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Where schemes were to apply a prescribed approach it could be less equitable than if 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9305"> trustees were able to take into account the individual circumstances of schemes.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Some schemes may choose to absorb the surcharge and not adjust benefits. Representations were received that this should be an allowable, but not compulsory, option. Many employers contributing to defined benefit funds took this route when the previous 15% contributions tax was introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I stress, in contrast to an impression that may be given by the letter, that the Institute of Actuaries has been working with the Government and its advisers throughout the process. In particular, on 29 July 1997, the Institute advised the Government that "it is appropriate that the standard for the</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A copy of the Institute's letter to all members is attached.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Institute continues to believe that a standard is necessary for this calculation, and has discussed the  detail of the basis for the calculation with the Government officials. In addition, the Institute is of the  view that a fairly prescriptive approach is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The prescribed approach includes a specified funding method (generally Projected Unit Credit),  economic assumptions and an objective methodology for determining decrement assump

The amending bill ensures that the defined benefit funds payable to a particular member of a Commonwealth public sector fund can be reduced to reflect the amount of the surcharge payable. The 15 per cent cap on the amount of surcharge payable by a member of a Commonwealth public sector fund allows the trustee of the fund to ensure the impact of the surcharge on a particular member is imposed equitably.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should be remembered that the surcharge tax is a tax incurred by the actions of an individual, a superannuation fund member, but payable by a third party, the superannuation fund.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If an individual's adjusted taxable income is above the surcharge tax income threshold, the fund has a liability to pay the surcharge tax. The fund may then pass that liability on to the individual member. However, as this is a tax accrued by an individual but payable by a third party, it is important that the third party has an opportunity to object to the extent of the tax liability in the first place. This opposition amendment will give the third party superannuation providers the opportunity to do just that. They may or may not choose to use the opportunity but, given the complexity of this legislation, it is appropriate to have this particular safeguard in place.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">What I am about to say will relate to both opposition amendments 5 and 6. I foreshadowed the amendments earlier. They are designed to simplify the complex definition of allocated surplus amounts which will reduce the need for accumulation funds to use an actuary and also introduces an anti&hyphen;avoidance measure which prevents superannuation schemes from avoiding the surcharge tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the amendments will alter the definition of allocated surplus amounts to something simpler but which still achieves the same anti&hyphen;avoidance purpose the government intended. Secondly, Labor's amendments will introduce new anti&hyphen;avoidance measures into 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9312"> the bill, which are designed to prevent some superannuation funds from avoiding paying the surcharge tax by virtue of taking a contributions holiday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor is concerned the measure to tax contributions from allocated surplus reserves could effectively be a double tax on fund members. If a member's contribution is surcharge taxed on the way into a fund then some of that contribution is set aside in an investment fluctuation reserve and it will be a double tax if it is further surcharge taxed again when it returns to a member's account. Labor believes this measure will impact adversely on members of accumulation funds and is an unnecessary complication on top of what is already a complicated policy. In addition, it will further increase the collection costs of the surcharge tax, which will be passed on to all fund members regardless of their income. Our amendments are intended to fix this policy measure while achieving the same policy intention the government is hoping to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, these amendment bills put a new burden on superannuation funds to calculate the amount which is transferred from an allocated surplus reserve to an individual member's account. This is something which superannuation funds did not know they had to do until these amendment bills were introduced into the parliament a short time ago. If the measure is designed to prevent superannuation funds from avoiding the surcharge tax while on a contributions holiday then we support it in principle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the way the government has decided to go about achieving its policy objectives is more complex than it needs to be; that is, something which is consistent with all of these bills though, I guess, the government response to this measure is no different from any other. Mr Noel Davis, lawyer from Clayton Utz, gave evidence to the superannuation select committee on this issue. Mr Davis's evidence is worth revisiting because it is quite instructive on the nature of this measure. About it he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will read you the definition of an allocated surplus amount, because that is what the bill will tax. What you are being asked to pass is a defini 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion of an allocated surplus amount that is in this form:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Allocated surplus amount in relation to a member of a superannuation fund in relation to a financial year means an amount that is allocated by the relevant superannuation accumulation benefits provider for the benefit of the member in respect of the financial year other than an amount paid for or by the member to the provider to the extent to which the allocated amount exceeds an amount that in the opinion of the eligible actuary, according to Australian actuarial practice, is reasonable having regard to the amounts paid by or for the member to the provider in the funds investment earnings related to the member's interest in the fund and any other relevant matters.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What does that mean? Some people are going to ask me for advice on what that means and I am going to have to tell them that I have no idea. It may as well have been written in Russian. It is rubbish! Yet it is being put to you, having been passed by the House of Representatives, as legislation that you should pass in exercising good government. What bunkum that is!</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Davis went on to say that what this additional taxation on accumulated surplus amounts now requires is that accumulation funds that have never needed the services of an actuary are going to have to incur the expense of obtaining an actuarial expert on what is the taxable allocated surplus amount for members of the accumulation fund. Mr Davis also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How bad can this legislation get when that sort of concept is being put in it? You will notice, if you were listening, that it has in it a requirement that the actuary `determine the taxable amount having regard to actuarial practice'. Of course, there is no actuarial practice. You are being asked to pass legislation which, again, is unworkable.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That evidence, it has to be said, is pretty damning. I would have thought that the government may have wanted to respond to the issue. To my knowledge, the minister has not yet done so. However, Labor's amendment is designed to simplify the definition of allocated surplus amounts to include only those amounts credited to a member's account which have been used to offset contributions which would have been otherwise payable. In addition, we are proposing to insert an anti&hyphen;avoidance provision which specifically prevents persons from undertaking schemes which would allow a superannuation fund to

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to opposition amendment No. 5, we believe that the proposed anti-avoidance measure is not necessary. It is uncertain when the provision may apply and how the courts would interpret the provision. The provision seems to be directed to surplus amounts allocated before 1 July 1998. If surplus amounts allocated from 1 July 1997 are included in surchargeable contributions, the provision is unnecessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment implies that a superannuation provider will be penalised if he or she enters into an avoidance scheme. If that is what is intended, the amendment needs to have a penalty clause inserted to be consistent with other provisions in an act. A penalty of 60 penalty points&mdash;that is, 6,600 for an individual trustee and 33,000 for a corporate trustee&mdash;would be needed if the logic of the penalties elsewhere applies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment does not cause the government undue concern. However, it is unclear when it would be applied and, frankly, whether it can be applied effectively. As I said, we do not think opposition amendment 5 is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to opposition amendment 6&mdash;the definition of an allocated surplus amount&mdash;the concept of a surplus in a fund is an actuarial 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> one. Therefore, an actuary needs to be involved to determine whether the surplus is surchargeable when allocated to the member. The current definition ensures that surpluses in accumulation schemes will be treated consistently with surpluses in defined benefit schemes. It is unclear whether the amendment will achieve the same outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commissioner of Taxation, in consultation with the Australian Government Actuary, will issue a ruling to identify the circumstances in which a fund may have an allocated surplus amount. Certification from an actuary will be required only if a fund makes an allocation from surpluses. The ruling will also outline the methodology for working out the amount of surplus that is a surchargeable contribution. In broad terms, surplus amounts allocated to a member will be surchargeable contributions only if they are sourced from employer contributions. The current definition achieves the outcome sought by the opposition amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment proposed by the opposition is vague and does not reduce the degree of uncertainty. The commissioner will still need to issue a ruling to clarify its operation. The opposition amendment relies on an anti-avoidance provision which is equally vague and uncertain. The amendment's very vagueness may allow the commissioner to issue a ruling to explain its operation. However, in the government's view, the current definition is far preferable.</PARA>

I have had a look at the definition of an allocated surplus amount on page 23 of the bill and at clause 43, which contains the definition proposed to be inserted by Senator Cook. In regard to the latter, I am a bit confused about what is before me. Proposed section 43, if we are dealing with amendment No. 6, is to actually substitute the definition that is in the bill at present with the opposition's definition, which seems to be simpler but, it appears to me at least, does not take up all of the matters that are contained in the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment refers to military retention bonuses. This amendment is similar to the amendments that were moved in the Senate when the legislation was first presented to this chamber&mdash;the original first tranche of legislation dealing with superannuation contributions and termination payments taxes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose of this amendment is to exempt from the calculation of income certain payments that are received by members of the Australian Defence Force. These are payments that are received as retention bonuses. Retention bonuses are made available to members of the services for very good reasons of requirement of the government. These are bonuses paid to people in the services to retain the services skills that are in short supply, and individual people who the services have determined are important to be retained. These individuals are being asked to continue their service in the defence of Australia and, in consideration of their willingness to serve future years, are receiving a financial payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has already determined that retention bonus payments are to be included as income for surcharge tax purposes, which will place virtually all of the recipients over the threshold above which the additional superannuation tax will by incurred&mdash;that is, unless this amendment is supported. In our submission there is no justification for, on the one hand, asking service personnel to give extra years service and, on the other, hitting them about the head with an extra superannuation tax. In the case of, say, pilots in the RAAF and in the army and air traffic controllers, where there has been an acute shortage for some years, the government has actually gone out of its way to entice those people to stay on by offering them a special superannuation bonus. Having offered them a special bonus, it intends to slug their superannuation when they finally get it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is particularly galling about this measure is that no advice is being given to people in the services about the effects on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> their superannuation of accepting the bonus. It is bad enough that the government is actually doing this, but what is absolutely underhand is that the government is not even advising the service personnel that, if they do what the government asks them to do and stay on in the service of the defence forces, they are going to get hit with extra tax on their superannuation benefit, which for many people in the services is a fundamentally important condition of service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are not even being given the advice that their superannuation is going to be reduced if they agree to stay on. You have to ask yourself how honest that is. You have to ask yourself what would happen if the government actually came clean with those pilots, air traffic controllers and people in other key positions and told them, `You do what we ask you to do. Stay on and fly a Hercules aircraft or an FA18 for us instead of going off to Qantas or Cathay and earning big buckets of money, because we want your special skills.' But the government keeps tight lipped about what it is going to do with their superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to understand that these payments that the government is going to include&mdash;which will take people over the income threshold for superannuation tax purposes, which will reduce their superannuation payment because the government is going to grab extra tax from them&mdash;do not actually contribute to their superannuation benefit. Yes, they get a cash payment. They get a bonus on their income. But that bonus is not actually included to improve their superannuation benefit at all. So it is not as though it goes into their income calculation to boost their superannuation benefit&mdash;and then you take a slice of that. They do not get any superannuation increase out of this money. What they get is extra tax imposed on them by virtue of this legislation, which will strip away some of their superannuation benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government is not willing to support these amendments, it should at least be honest and open with the defence personnel of Australia. When it says to them, `We want you to stay on and we will offer you a bonus,' it should at least be honest and open and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9316"> say about it, `And if you accept it you will go over the threshold and incur an additional tax on your superannuation benefit.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The retention benefit is available also to those service personnel who are in the MSBS, which was introduced by the former Labor government in 1991. The scheme provides that people with 15 years service who undertake a further five years service also get a retention payment. That bonus is not given to them just for length of service. It is given to people selectively on the basis that they have skills to contribute that we want to retain. The simple fact of life is that the government of the day and the chiefs of the Defence Force identify individuals whom they want to retain. In just about every one of the cases, those people are individuals who have some very marketable skills. The reason the government offers them a retention bonus to stay on is precisely that they have marketable skills that see them highly sought after by the private sector. There has been a drain of those key persons and key positions within the defence forces.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact then remains that the government provides a significant financial incentive to keep those people, because they have very marketable skills that the private sector head hunts. If they agree to stay on in the service, they will have an additional 15 per cent tax on their superannuation imposed on them. Many of those people do not currently go over the $70,000 threshold; their wages are not that high. Some will, but many will not. It is precisely those people whom you are going to slug with one hand as you try to entice them with the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">People in the defence forces, particularly the ones we are talking about, are not stupid. They may not be aware of the pea and thimble trick you are playing on them in this legislation when they sign on. But one thing is certain: as they draw closer to their retirement from the services, they will become aware of it. They will think back on the deception that you have perpetrated and will be very disgruntled long-term service personnel. There are enough problems with morale in the defence forces at the moment because of decisions that this government has taken 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and the ineptitude in the whole range of areas in terms of policy development and structural reform. That ineptitude is causing its own set of problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I seek from the government, if it is not willing to support this amendment, a clear statement about its intentions as to the advice it will provide defence personnel, those who have already accepted a retention bonus and those who will be offered the retention bonus in the future. I seek from the government a clear commitment that it will provide full details to each of those individuals who is offered a retention bonus of the impact the acceptance of that retention bonus will have on their superannuation and, in particular, the impact this 15 per cent superannuation tax will have on them. In the course of the debate, I would appreciate a clear statement from the government on that important point of principle. I urge the Senate to support this amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats cannot support this amendment from the opposition. It seeks to remove the retention bonuses from the definition of `assessable income' for the purposes of the superannuation surcharge tax. The argument is that these bonuses paid after 15 years of services in the armed forces and then every five years bump many service personnel into the surchargeable range for a single year. We recognise that problem; but we do not believe that exempting retention bonuses is completely fair, given that they are part of salary and they are income. I foreshadow our amendment No. 10, which is a compromise and I think solves the problem in a much more satisfactory way&mdash;that is, that bonuses would be averaged out over that five-year period.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had this debate before. Generally, allowances, including military retention bonuses, form part of assessable income of taxpayers. There really is no rationale to exempt bonuses paid to one group of people from the income test for surcharge purposes. There are many people who receive allowances for a variety of reasons. Members of the defence forces who receive a retention allowance in a financial year, as stated, may well be high income earners in that year. The surcharge was intended to apply to high income earners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To exempt military retention bonuses will create significant administrative difficulties as, I am advised, there is no ready way of identifying this particular allowance. This will be a particular problem in the period 20 August 1996 to 30 June 1997. The government opposes this amendment. We think people have failed to develop the rationale for it. There may well be seen by other groups an inequity because allowances which they receive may be included as part of assessable income of the taxpayer. We are opposed to this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one could say one thing in its favour, it is slightly preferable to Democrats' amendment No. 10 for administrative  reasons. The Democrat amendment requires the bonuses to be averaged over five years. I think we would have to see how that could be best achieved. But we are opposed to both amendments.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What needs to be clearly understood here is that, while a retention bonus is paid and certainly while that forms part of income for taxable reasons, the defence forces make no superannuation contribution on behalf of the recipient of the retention bonus to their superannuation fund. I think that is an important point to weigh in consideration when this matter is voted on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have a reservation, since we are in anticipation of the Democrats' amendment, which also relates to the point touched on by the minister, that is, that you average it out over five years. By doing that, in certain circumstances it could conceivably push a person into a bracket in which the surcharge tax is 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> payable as opposed to a year on year event when it may not in some years do that. I think that is a defect in the Democrats' amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Having said that, in my remarks in introducing this amendment I drew attention to the fact that when retention payments are offered to key personnel to retain them in the services of Australia's defence&mdash;these are people who are sought after in the private sector and are actively head hunted&mdash;no indication, on my advice, is given to them that the retention benefits will have this impact.

I am advised that the recently issued information statement sent to all members of the Australian Defence Force included information about the superannuation surcharge.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Labor will not be supporting this amendment. It is important to remember why we moved our amendment in the first place. We moved it to exclude military retention bonuses from income for surcharge tax purposes. Military retention bonuses are paid to encourage serving military personnel to be retained in the military for a further period of time. Therefore, taxing it additionally is contrary to the purpose of giving it in the first place. Once armed forces personnel become aware that their retention bonuses are going to be subject to an additional tax, which if they are low or middle income earners they would not normally be required to pay, that could adversely affect their decision to stay in the armed forces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what is completely inconsistent about including military retention bonuses as income for surcharge tax purposes is that these bonuses are not included as income used to determine an employer's superannuation obligation on behalf of an employee. That means that, according to the government, it is okay to tax these bonuses but it is not okay to give an employee an additional superannuation contribution based on their higher income level. That is an inconsistency which disadvantages military personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats' amendment misses the point by suggesting that military retention bonuses should be averaged over five years. In addition, the averaging of retention bonuses over five years could see someone just under the surcharge tax income threshold limit pushed over that threshold for five years in a row instead of for one year only. So there is a potential for this amendment to make it worse for those military personnel just below

<PARA STYLE="Para">These amendments are necessary because of the continued insistence of the government to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9319"> disregard the orders of the Senate. These are amendments that call the surcharge a tax. When these bills were last in this place the titles of the bills were amended through an agreement between the government and the Democrats to reflect the reality that the measure which the government was calling a `surcharge' was in reality a tax. Because the word `tax' is in the title of the acts of parliament governing this measure one would think that that is what the government would use when describing it. But that is not the case. Senator Kemp continually refers to this measure as a `surcharge' when he knows full well it is a tax. In recent advertising campaigns run by the Australian Taxation Office we see the word `surcharge' continually used instead of `tax'. I showed Senator Kemp a copy of that ad in the estimates process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The advertisement is reminding people that if they do not quote their tax file number they will be subject to the superannuation tax. I have a copy of the ad here. The tax office has chosen the slogan, `Don't make an expensive mistake'. That is an appropriate slogan to use because we all know that it will be an expensive mistake for a low income earner who does not quote his or her tax file number. They will incur the full 15 per cent superannuation tax on their superannuation contributions. Even if they do quote their tax file number and do, by some miracle, avoid paying the 15 per cent superannuation tax they will still end up paying for the superannuation tax through higher fees and charges as a result of the government's mistake in the collection method.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the advertisement is misleading. It says that you can avoid paying the superannuation tax by providing your tax file number to your superannuation fund. But that is not true. Many people will pay for this tax in many different ways and there is no way to avoid it. There is no way to avoid the tax unless the government wants to reconsider changing the collection method it has chosen for this measure&mdash;which it seems very reluctant to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, this approach tries to inject some further honesty into the government's approach to this measure by inserting into the many bills which govern the superannuation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tax measure the definition that wherever the word `surcharge' appears it means a tax. This definition is currently in only one of the superannuation tax bills, the Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997, but not in any of the others. This amendment might help the Australian Taxation Office itself to get the message right because it seems a little confused as to whether the super tax is a surcharge or a tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer to an ATO press release of 9 September 1997 launching the Australian Taxation Office's tax file number advertising campaign entitled, `Quote your tax file number to avoid 15 per cent tax'. I have a copy of that here should honourable senators be interested in seeing it. According to the title of the press release, the tax office seems to think that the government's surcharge is a tax. But even the ATO is a bit confused on this one because further into the press  release it calls it a 15 per cent surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the ATO is confused about what this measure is supposed to be, what about ordinary taxpayers who may not be across the ins and outs of the debate on this issue? Perhaps they think they will be slugged for two measures&mdash;a surcharge of 15 per cent and, in addition, a superannuation tax of 15 per cent. We hope that this amendment will clarify any confusion the ATO may have, but more importantly, any confusion that may be in the minds of individual taxpayers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The environmental problems being experienced in some Asian cities are enormous, but I am pleased to say that I believe that the governments in the region are aware of the problems and are starting to take positive steps to correct those problems. Last week I had the honour of representing the Australian government on the Joint Working Group on the Environment in Jakarta, Indonesia, initiated by the Australian Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, and the Indonesian Environment Minister, Mr Sarwono, during the Australia&hyphen;Indonesia Ministerial Council meeting earlier this year. The joint working group was chaired jointly by Ms JoAnne DiSano from Environment Australia and Mr Harry Horsono from the Ministry of Environment, Indonesia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a pleasure for me to attend the opening session and to meet initially with the leader of the Indonesian delegation, Mrs Neike Ismardani Kuryana of the Indonesian House of Representatives, and Mr Sudarsono, the Secretary Minister for the Environment. The working group involved officials from Environment Australia and the Indonesian Environment Ministry, together with business people from both Indonesia and Australia. Twenty&hyphen;nine Australian businesses accepted Senator Hill's invitation to be part of the working group.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9321">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The working group discussed a wide range of matters and ended up with conclusions in six areas. These were: air pollution; waste water treatment and water supply management; marine environment and pollution control; environmental management and auditing; renewable energy; and community education and specialist training. A communique issued following the working group's deliberations highlighted the progress that had been made in both the development and consolidation of a multi&hyphen;stakeholder approach to addressing the six areas of priority. Another initiative was the identification of joint coordinators from Indonesia and Australia to progress activities under the six areas of cooperation. Finally, the importance that was attached to the development of partnerships not only between private sector representatives but also between governments and private sectors of both countries was indeed a really positive result from the working group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Recently, because of haze problems, environmental management and the involvement of key sectors of the community have been more in the minds of both the Indonesian and the Australian people. The Indonesian government has been encouraging the private sector to play more of a role in the environment through various programs such as proper Prokasih, which is the business performance rating, the blue sky program and Adipura. With this private sector focus, the market potential for environmental products and services in the coming years is growing rapidly. Australia is, of course, well positioned in the market to play an active and positive role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While in Jakarta I took the opportunity, in my capacity as parliamentary secretary with responsibility for the Bureau of Meteorology, to visit the Indonesian meteorological and geophysical organisation, Badan Meteorlogi dan Geofisika or, more simply, BMG. The close working relationship between the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and BMG has resulted in many positive activities, not the least of which was the help that the Australian bureau gave to the Indonesian government at the time of the recent bushfire problems. I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> enjoyed and benefited from my meeting with the Director&hyphen;General of BMG, Mr Sri Diharto, and his senior officers. We are hopeful of further collaboration between the weather organisations of our two nations in the time ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also pleased to be able to represent the Australian government at the official opening of the Seventh International Exhibition on Equipment and Systems for Pollution Control and Environmental Improvement and to visit the Australian exhibitors at the exhibition. The conversations I had with Australian exhibitors showed that they were very keen to do business with Indonesia and were looking for a government to government relationship to ensure that the regulations which the Indonesian government had wisely promulgated were enforced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many Australian businesses are doing business in Indonesia in the environmental field, and particularly in planning and managing water and sewerage projects. The city of Jakarta is about to embark on an ambitious program to sewer the whole of the city of Jakarta within the next 10 years and I was able to have discussions with the vice governor on that matter. I was also able to meet with a group of Australian business people who have become associated with this project through the New South Wales government and Jakarta city government sister state relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While problems, particularly in Jakarta, are immense, my discussions with the Minister for the Environment, Mr Sarwono, and his senior officers showed that the Indonesian government has a keen understanding of the problems and a desire to do something about them. Minister Sarwono, in my discussions with him, indicated the steps that the Indonesian government would be taking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in that country. The minister indicated that Indonesia wanted to play its part in achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A city that has expanded as rapidly as Jakarta has is bound to have a lot of social and housing problems. I was pleased and privileged to inspect a new housing township, Lippo Karawaci, on the outskirts of Jakarta in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9322"> an area that is providing its own water and sewerage. Hopefully, this is a demonstration of how clean water and proper disposal of sewage and waste can be achieved in Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The people of northern Australia, where I come from, live closer to the 200 million Indonesians than we do to our fellow Australians in the southern population centres. It is important, therefore, that both Australia and Indonesia work cooperatively together to protect and enhance the regional environment. I am encouraged by my discussions with the minister as to the work which we can do jointly to look after the environment in our part of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On my way to Jakarta I was also pleased to be able to attend the first round table on cleaner production, which was being hosted by Thailand with the support of the United Nations environment program and the World Bank. A round table that was expected to draw about 50 people had an attendance of over 200 people from all over the world who were interested in cleaner production in Asia. The conference and the related exhibition generated considerable discussion on how Asian and Pacific countries can work together to tackle some of the problems of cleaner production. I had the honour of delivering the closing address to the first round table and, in doing so, indicated the desire of the University of Queensland and the Queensland cleaner production task force to host next year's second round table on cleaner production and the associated trade fair in the Queensland capital of Brisbane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My short time in Bangkok allowed me to obtain a first&hyphen;hand understanding of the severe pollution problems that city has. Again, I am encouraged that, whilst there is a long way to go, there is an understanding that clean water, modern sewerage systems, a reduction in energy use and better disposal of waste are all matters which need to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was also encouraged by the good work which the Thai meteorological service does in its weather and climate forecasting in South&hyphen;East Asia. That region suffers from typhoons and floods, as we do in Australia, and there is a lot each country can do to help the other 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with in this area. Interestingly, the King of Thailand takes a very keen interest in meteorological matters and I am told that the palace is actually directly linked to the met services computers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a less positive note, the recent currency crisis in both Thailand and Indonesia has caused real economic and social problems. High&hyphen;rise building work has simply stopped mid&hyphen;floor and I was told that over a million unskilled labourers had recently been made redundant and dismissed. Because of the drought, these unskilled workers, who principally come from the country, are unable to return to their homelands, thus exacerbating the unemployment and difficult social problems in Indonesia. As Australia's eighth largest export market, the health of the Indonesian economy is of vital interest to Australia. It is certainly in Australia's interests as well as the interests of the people of both Indonesia and Thailand for the Australian government to give appropriate financial assistance to overcome the more immediate impacts of the currency crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Governments in both countries are tightening their belts in a way that Australia has done since the advent of the Howard government. The experiences of these two countries at least provide graphic illustrations of what can happen if countries spend beyond their means. I am pleased that Australia is able to help our neighbours in their financial difficulties and also that we are able to join with our neighbours in promoting a better environment in our region.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="9322"><TITLE>Abstudy

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to refer to the Abstudy changes that took place in this year's budget, and also to table a document from an Abstudy summit that took place in my home state of South Australia on 30 July this year which examined some of those proposed changes by the government. I thank all sides for agreement to table that particular document by SAAETAC, the South Australian Aboriginal Education and Training Advisory Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9323">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The cuts to the Abstudy budget of this year total $48 million. They are some of the most savage cuts, I believe, of recent budgets in that they target those in the community who are most marginalised. Also, they are completely at odds with the direction in which we should be heading as a nation&mdash;that is, we should be investing in the talents and the skills of Australians of all ages. But, in particular, we should be seeking to increase rates of participation of those traditionally under&hyphen;represented or unrepresented groups in our education and training systems. Clearly, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians must be encouraged to participate in education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, the government seems to have pursued rather a different direction&mdash;that is, hiking up fees and charges and, of course, introducing up-front and full cost fees. Also, a minimal number of scholarships will be provided over the four years to students, presumably being those from previously under&hyphen;represented socioeconomic and other ethnic groups in our society, in order to encourage them to enter into and participate in higher education specifically, but education and training generally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to some statistics from the groups that I have spoken to, it is my understanding that, out of the 4,000 scholarships based on merit that will be available over the next four years for those particular groups, an Aboriginal and Islander person hoping to attend a university like Sydney will have a one in 4,000 chance. They are their estimated odds, and they are not particularly good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do note, however, that the former Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Amanda Vanstone, had some sense of the dramatic and likely negative impact of these changes on participation rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in higher education specifically. To her credit&mdash;and I will give her credit where credit is due&mdash;she was commencing negotiations, with a number of Aboriginal and islander groups and education sector representatives, designed to ameliorate some of the worst aspects of the proposed changes. So I just put on notice tonight that I would be very curious 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to hear what stage those negotiations are at, if they are still proceeding, and what hope there is for those students who are uncertain about either aspiring to a higher education or continuing in education because they are uncertain that their Abstudy benefits would be available to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The SAAETAC summit on 30 July this year noted their concerns about the possible impact on participation rates. It also noted their considerable concern at the lack of consultation that had taken place with education providers, Aboriginal educational advisory committees and, of course, Aboriginal community organisations. So the government failed to consult widely with these organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These are concerns I have heard echoed not only within the context of the summit but more generally around the country from a range of groups and, specifically, I have to say, the Bachelor College in the Northern Territory. That is a college that provides education for Aboriginal and Islander students, and they are very concerned about the potentially devastating impact on their college.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main criticisms surrounding the government's changes include the introduction in the abatement rate for the Austudy living allowance and dependent spouse allowance. This is without a clearly defined threshold. So, even though these groups welcome the indication of the change with an abatement rate, without any clear ideas as to the threshold level, there are some great concerns as to what impact that might have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The away from base allowance is now being reduced, supposedly, to two trips per year. This is expected to have a severe impact on residential schools or on those courses which are referred to as `block release' courses, particularly in remote communities. There is added concern about changes to compassionate travel. I should note that this is not a particularly compassionate move by the government but it is one that may negatively impact on students who may need to fulfil cultural obligations during their course or a semester.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9324">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conclusions reached as a result of these proposals and the suggested changes or amendments by the summit are most adequately represented in the group's report&mdash;and I strongly commend it to you, Madam President, and the Senate. The authors and the key participants in the process include Mr Frank Lampard, the chair of SAAETAC, Mr Rod Williams, Ms April Blair and Mr Alwin Chong. I commend them for their work in the production of the summit paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would take this opportunity to refer briefly to the tragic death in recent days of Australian singer Michael Hutchence, a performer admired and respected by many Australians, regardless of their age&mdash;but particularly young Australians to whom I have spoken in the last 24 hours and who have expressed their concern. I ask all in this place to remember that, certainly over the last two decades, many young Australians have grown up with the music of Michael Hutchence and his band INXS. I think it is worth remembering at this time his song <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Original Sin</EMPHASIS>, which is a song opposing racism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also wish to express my concern tonight at some of the newspaper and media reports of this tragic event. In particular, allegedly, one prominent Australian performer was informed on camera of this man's death. I would have thought that&mdash;certainly in light of the tragic death of the Princess of Wales and the consequent media and privacy debates and discussions that have taken place&mdash;perhaps people would have been a little more caring in the way they treated this issue. I have also been concerned to see the very detailed reports of the method by which Michael Hutchence died. The incidence of copycat deaths means that the media needs to be more mature about how they choose to report a case such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This death follows not long after that of popular footballer Peter Jackson&mdash;also another young man, well known and liked, with a young family, who appeared to have a lot to live for but who died alone. I wish to refer briefly to the editorial in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS>&mdash;yes, my home&hyphen;town paper&mdash;and to what I think is quite a fitting comment. It states:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the end, however, it is not a superstar who makes that terrible exit but another human being, happy or sad, contented or tormented, achiever and victim and, in the end, alone just like us. His name, his talent, his antics and lifestyle make him front&hyphen;page news around the world. In the end, though, his death is a tragedy not for those reasons but because all young deaths are a tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In remembering these people, we eulogise their lives, not the manner of their deaths. I thank you for allowing me to pay a brief tribute to a wonderful performer who, no doubt, lit up the lives of many Australians and, of course, paved the way for a sort of unique brand of funky 80s and, more recently, 90s music and, of course, broke into the US charts as a top Australian performer&mdash;no mean feat, I might add.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe it is the role of parliament and all honourable members in this place to remember proud and prominent Australians regardless of their age but because of their commitment, their passion and their work. I acknowledge that many young Australians are looking for a way through, not a way out. So I take this opportunity to commend the work of Lifeline services, including their 24-hour counselling service which operates nationally on 131114. It is specifically targeted at young people aged five to 18 years. They also have Kids Helpline. I seek leave to table the Abstudy summit report from the conference of 30 July 1997.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we stand here tonight, this nation is being held to ransom. It is being held to ransom by a group of activists who have absolutely no interest in honestly discussing issues with the Australian people. Perhaps the worst of that group of activists is Mr Noel Pearson, the head of the Cape York Land Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was disturbed to find Mr Pearson saying on the weekend that the possible compensation bill for the extinguishment of native title as a result of the amendments that the government proposes would be in the vicinity of $2 billion. If you do not live in Far North Queensland and are not familiar with Cape 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9325"> York Peninsula, you might believe some of this nonsense. I want to take this opportunity tonight to outline to the Senate how patently false, dishonest and immoral this particular scare campaign is. Because it is all of those things. In fact, it disgusts many people who are familiar with the facts. The facts have never bothered Mr Pearson, as he has shown again on the weekend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, under the schedule of leases which the government proposes will extinguish native title, hardly any of the leases on Cape York Peninsula will appear because most of them are non-scheduled leases. In other words, it is not possible for those leases to extinguish native title. Let us leave that aside. Let us just talk about the value of the leases that exist in Cape York, because I do not want to transgress on any bills before the chamber. There are 105 pastoral leases of more than 500 hectares on Cape York Peninsula. They amount to some 14 million hectares of land. On an unimproved land value of about $1 a hectare, their total value would be about $14 million&mdash;$1 a hectare for 14 million hectares equates to $14 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If, however, you took a survey of those leases at roughly the market rate, which seems to be about half a million dollars a lease, simple mathematics tells you that 105 leases at half a million dollars a lease works out at roughly $52&half; million. That is the total value of all of the pastoral leases in Cape York put together. I do not know where Mr Pearson did his mathematics, but you do not have to be Albert Einstein to know that, if those leases are worth $52 million in their entirety, you could buy those leases 40 times over with $2 billion. You could buy them 40 times over. Yet he had the audacity to go on national television and scare the voters of this country by saying that the compensation bill for the passage of this legislation would be $2 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There could be nothing more grossly dishonest than that. It is part of the typical scare campaign that we see from the Cape York Land Council. Mr Pearson and the Cape York Land Council have broken just about every promise they have ever made to a government in this country. It is a fact that Mr Pearson 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> promised in November 1993 that they would not make claims against pastoral leases in Queensland. It is also a fact that in March the following year Mr Pearson was a signatory to the Wik claim that made claims to pastoral leases over all of Cape York Peninsula in spite of the undertaking he had given at the National Press Club in November. That is how much Mr Pearson's word is worth. It is not worth the paper it is written on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to ask yourself another question, Madam President. Mr Pearson has constantly told this country that native title is not a land grab by Aborigines; it is about the right to fish, hunt, gather and carry on traditional ceremonies. If it is just about the right to fish, hunt and gather, how could the compensation bill be $2 billion? If it is merely a right to access the land to go fishing or bowl over a few roos or conduct a ceremony here and there, there is no way that the compensation bill could even approach the market value of the leases over that land&mdash;absolutely no way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is Mr Pearson's agenda? Is it outright dishonesty in misleading the Australian people about the potential size of any compensation payment? Or is Mr Pearson's real agenda about something more than a right to hunt, gather and fish? I think Mr Pearson has not only a glaring credibility problem but also a glaring consistency problem. He has been caught out by his own dishonesty. Either this native title right is a fairly minor right, in which case it could hardly give rise to much compensation at all&mdash;as you would know, Madam President, having been a very distinguished lawyer in this territory&mdash;or, on the contrary, he is asking for something much more. But even then it would not come to $2 billion. So you have to ask: what is Mr Pearson going on about?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think he has any credibility left, especially when you consider this one additional factor. The Cape York Land Council, an organisation of which he is a titular head, was involved in something called the Cape York Peninsula land use study, or CYPLUS for short. It is interesting to note that the CYPLUS recommendations which are endorsed by the Cape York Land Council argue that the number of cattle on Cape York 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9326"> Peninsula should be increased from 115,000 to 400,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Pearson is saying, `We, as Aborigines, believe you can increase the size of the cattle industry and you can make it more intensive.' Yet in the Wik claim he is saying, `This is horrible; this is transgressing the rights of Aboriginal people.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) $36.617 million. This amount includes payments to providers and income support paid to participants.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs' computer information system records that as at 31 October 1997 the level of commitment made in 1997&hyphen;98 for TEP was $32.340 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) As at 31 October 1997, the total number of job seekers who have commenced under TEP since that program began on 7 October 1996 was 29,436.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Under TEP the Department can purchase training in two ways&mdash;by contracting a whole course from a training provider (contracted course) or purchasing an individual place on an existing course (established course).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) The Department's computer system records the number of projects run by providers not the number of contracts. The number of projects will be greater than the number of contracts as in some cases providers can run several projects under one contract. In the 1996&hyphen;97 financial year 1208 projects were approved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) In the 1997&hyphen;98 financial year 572 projects had been approved as at 31 October 1997.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) There are various reasons why potential providers are not offered a contract under TEP: for example, the proposal is unacceptable because of local labour market demand or supply, capacity to undertake the required training to local established CES standards, cost considerations or previous unsatisfactory performance, as well as the application of the detail of the guidelines set out in answer 4 above. Detailed records of such reasons are not available for publication because it would be a breach of confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) No. See answer to question 7.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) The CES core guidelines Volume 6, Section 1 state that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Department should not enter into a contract with a LMP provider unless it is satisfied that the provider is able to undertake the services and there is reason to believe that Departmental funding will not be at risk."</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There may be some situations where a need for training has been identified that can only be met by a particular provider.

The provider must state that they have delivered services in accordance with the contract before any further payments are made. This must be certified as correct by a DEETYA officer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Volume 6, Section 1 of the CES guidelines states that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Where a provider has failed to meet their contractual obligations, there are a range of measures available to DEETYA under the contract, ie payment may be withheld, recovery action may occur or the contract may be terminated.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legal Group's first priority is to protect the Commonwealth's funds and all necessary actions are taken to this end, as was done, for example, on 12 September 1997 in the Federal Court of Australia in relation to South Pacific Cruise Lines Limited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(10) As advised in answer to question 3 above training purchased under the TEP program can be either a contracted or established course. Under an established course it is normal commercial practice to pay course fees prior to commencement of the course. Places on established courses make up approximately one third of the business written under TEP and this information is recorded on individual files. The Department's computer system records that since the commencement of the program on 7 October 1996 some 336 training providers received advance payments under TEP for various projects under their contracts.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator Hill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) The previous Government supported the Eurogold consortium. During the visit by the then Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Hikmet Cetin, to Australia in 1994 Australian Ministers expressed to him full support for the project. The project was also raised during his visit to Turkey in April 1995, for the third session of the Australia&mdash;Turkey Joint Economic Committee for Trade, Economic and Technical Cooperation, by the then Australian Minister for Trade. The minutes of that meeting referred positively to the venture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The present Australian Government has maintained this positive support against the background that, by March 1996, after some years of detailed analysis and consideration, the Turkish Government had completed the process of granting approvals for the full implementation of the project. While lobbying has continued, there has been no financial, technical or other assistance. Normal EFIC cover was offered for the export of some equipment from Australia to the project, but not taken up by the exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) and (b) The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is unable to identify such a meeting. However, Mr Allan Griffiths, MP, visited Turkey in August 1994. He had discussions with Ministers, members of the Turkish Grand National Assembly and others, in which he supported the Australian involvement. The Australian Ambassador was present at the meetings. Mr Griffiths was, at the time of his visit, a former Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Yes. The Australian Ambassador in Ankara has had discussions with Turkish Ministers concerning the Eurogold project. It is a normal function of Australian diplomatic representatives abroad to interest themselves in significant undertakings entailing Australian commercial involvement in the countries of their accreditation. The French and Canadian Ambassadors have also made representations, given that Eurogold is a consortium of French and Canadian as well as Australian interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) (a) Yes. The Government is aware that the project involves the use of cyanide.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Yes. Australian Governments have supported the project knowing that the process of extraction involves the use of cyanide, as is used widely in gold recovery in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) Although a number of court cases which had been brought against the project and its environmental clearance had been resolved in its favour, the Turkish High Administrative Court, on appeal, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9334"> found some merit in a challenge to the use of cyanide and called on the Izmir Administrative Court to review its earlier decision. Only on 15 October, 1997, did the Izmir Court overturn its earlier ruling and find against the cyanide leaching method.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">6) (a) Yes. The Government is aware of the opposition by sections of the local community to the project. The Government is aware that this opposition has included invasion of the mine site. It has also included damage to equipment at the site in Bergama and the indiscriminate explosion of a bomb at the headquarters of Eurogold, in the city of Izmir.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) A petition against the project by members of the Turkish community in Australia has recently been sent to the Prime Minister. Judged by the number of signatures, opposition to the project in the Turkish community in Australia would appear to be confined to a small minority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite any opposition from sections of the local community, it is appropriate for the Australian authorities to interest themselves in a significant overseas investment by an Australian company. It is for the Turkish authorities to make a final decision as to whether the project should go ahead. The Australian Government expects that any decision by the Turkish authorities will take into account such factors as the environmental impact, the economic benefits and the views of the local community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) (a) The Australian Government has a limited ability to control the overseas activities of Australian companies that may breach Australian environmental standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the proposed overseas activities involved action by an Australian agency covered by the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, then the provisions of that Act would apply. The Australian Government may, if necessary, refuse assistance, including the use of aid funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Otherwise, while under international law Australia has jurisdiction to legislate extraterritorially in a range of circumstances, it does not have the power directly to enforce its laws within the jurisdiction of other states. The usual absence of enforcement power is a fundamental reason why jurisdiction to legislate for Australian companies overseas is not often used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equally important, regulation of the activities of Australian companies overseas is also governed by the notion of "international comity", which is the general mutual respect and good behaviour which friendly states owe to each other. This is a self imposed restraint on states to avoid abuse of their rights and powers. It would be inappropriate for Australia to attempt to impose requirements on Australian companies operating in another country's 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> jurisdiction where those requirements may conflict with the laws of that country. For example, Australian environmental standards may be ill&hyphen;suited to another country's circumstances and could be in conflict with its laws.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) and (c) The question does not arise. The project is not considered to violate Australian environmental standards. The Company has said, and the Turkish Government has accepted and required, that the environmental standards to be applied are among the highest in the world. The process is used in Australia, where, under appropriate strict procedures and construction (of the kind to be applied near Bergama) any environmental risk is controlled. Further, Eurogold is not, in fact, an Australian company. It is an international consortium, with only a minority Australian interest, and a registered Turkish company, which operates under Turkish law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) (a) If the proposed overseas activities involved action by an Australian agency covered by the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, then the provisions of that Act would apply. Otherwise, there are no formal procedures nor hard and fast rules for assessing the environmental acceptability of overseas projects of Australian companies. In general, however, in deciding whether to provide routine support to a project, officials would normally be expected to take into account a wide range of factors, including, as well as any environmental considerations, the law and appropriate procedures in the country concerned, and the economic and commercial benefits to Australia and to the host country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The Australian authorities have not made a formal environmental assessment of the project. However, in providing routine support to it, the Australian authorities have taken into account the fact that it has been subject to environmental assessment by the Turkish authorities: the Turkish Ministry of the Environment granted formal environmental clearance for the project in October 1994; this assessment has been subject to testing through the Turkish legal system. In addition, the Australian Government has taken into account that the cyanide extraction process is used extensively in the gold mining industry internationally, including in Australia, where, with proper safeguards, it is not considered to pose an environmental hazard; and that the company has given assurances that proper safeguards will be implemented at the Bergama mine and has been prepared, after an initial period of operation, to invite international inspection of the mine site to verify its claims that the process does not cause any environmental problem. Australian officials have also taken into account that this is a major investment by an Australian company which will add considerably to the depth of Australian&mdash;Turkish commercial relations; that the investment accords with the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="9335"> objectives of the Turkish Government which attaches a high priority to encouraging foreign investment; that the local community and Turkey as a whole stand to derive significant economic benefits from the project; and that Australia also stands to benefit, both from the commercial success of an Australian company and from the indirect benefits to all Australian companies and economic interests in Turkey in what is expected will be a successful demonstration of Australian commercial enterprise and expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Consultations, principally by the Australian Embassy in Ankara, have included meetings with Turkish Ministers, Turkish officials, mining representatives and with representatives of the local community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(9) The expenditure of resources needed to prepare such a list could not be justified, especially as, while there is material relating to the project in Departmental and Embassy files, there are only incidental references to environmental evaluations, by other authorities, of the project.
