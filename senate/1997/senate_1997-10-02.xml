<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I object strongly to this delay. This matter was referred to the committee in May 1996. The committee concluded evidence gathering in October 1996 and it was due to report by the middle of this year. There has already been one delay. There is now another delay being sought which effectively means that a result will not come out of this committee until at least March next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are hundreds of thousands of Australians who are concerned about that. The committee is dealing with the business of discrimination on the basis of sexuality. This affects a large number of gay men and lesbians, particularly in Western Australia and Tasmania where there is no protection under 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7435"> the law from discrimination on the basis of people's sexuality. It is an extremely important matter. The committee has received a large number of good submissions. They include related stories of lesbians being evicted from public housing, of gay teachers being sacked and of young homosexual people being harassed to the point of suicide.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do you think that that is a fair matter? We are getting the interjection from the government benches that gay people ought not be enabled to follow the teaching profession. That is an example of why this legislation should be dealt with in this parliament. That is why there is this urgency&mdash;because that sort of bigotry and discrimination is occurring in our community. It is time this nation took a stand against it. It is a critical matter. The committee has had a long period since its deliberations. It ought to be bringing a report to this chamber. There is no ostensible reason why it cannot. There are other matters like euthanasia where committee hearings, determinations and reports back to this chamber were done in the express lane. Why not this one? I can only assume that there are political reasons why this report has not come before the Senate, and I oppose that. That is just not good enough. I would like to hear more as to why this chamber is not getting this report and cannot deal with this legislation and, therefore, the concerns that many Australians hold about this particularly insidious form of discrimination.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I draw the Senate's attention to pages 78 and 79 of today's Notice Paper. That, I believe, gives the reasons why we are seeking this delay. On page 78, you can see that the brother&hyphen;sister committee of the references committee has lodged 17 reports to this chamber. On page 79, you will see that six other reports have been lodged by the references committee. The simple reason why we are seeking a delay is the amount of work the committee has before it. I assure the Senate, Senator Brown and all those who made submissions to the committee and who appeared before the committee that there is no 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> deliberate delay. There is no attempt at a deliberate delay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is simply a matter of the workload that is before the committee and the decisions of this Senate which give priority to legislation that comes before the committees. We are given reporting days on those references to legislation committees and we have to give a priority to them. That is a decision of the Senate. Speaking on behalf of all members of the committee, we will certainly be endeavouring to get the report delivered to the chamber by the end of this year. We do not want any undue delays.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like, personally, to get on with the inquiry into the legal aid system in Australia and access to justice, but unfortunately, because of other pressures, we are just not able to do that either.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report I am tabling today is a record of the proceedings of a Seminar conducted by the Defence Sub-Committee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in August this year. This seminar assembled some of the most pre-eminent and authoritative speakers from both Australia and the United States, to share their views on the current status, relevance and future prospects for the Security Treaty between Australia, New Zealand and the United States, otherwise known by its acronym, the ANZUS Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The alliance with the United States continues to be the most important of Australia's Defence agreements. Few would dispute this point. The previous Government's Defence White Paper accepted the value of the US alliance as a key element of our Defence policy, and this Government's recently-released Foreign and Trade Policy White Paper reaffirms the importance of this relationship. I 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expect that the soon-to&hyphen;be-released Strategic Review similarly will reflect that strategic reality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This seminar sought to inform the Parliament, and the wider public through open discussion, of all the provisions and the implications of those provisions of the Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The US Ambassador, in opening the seminar, commented upon both the flexibility and adaptability of the ANZUS Treaty. Its brief and relatively simple wording has allowed it to evolve with changing strategic circumstances. This is the key to the Treaty's continued relevance: that the true value to Australia from the ANZUS alliance arises from the myriad activities, exercises, exchanges and cooperative ventures enabled under its auspices, rather than from what is prescribed by the Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was the main emphasis of the seminar. It was not an occasion to reflect on the military ties between Australia and the United States, strong though they are; from the links forged in the crucible of the wars of this century and annealed in the prolonged and testing uncertainties of the Cold War.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is true that the Alliance was propelled into existence by the common threat of an expansionist Soviet empire, but at heart it was an alliance between nations which was based on shared democratic and cultural ideals and a shared belief in a system of fair and just international relations. Now, over 45 years later, those fundamental considerations are as relevant as ever and remain the strong foundation on which the alliance is based.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The one great internal change in ANZUS has come about because of the adoption by New Zealand of its prohibition of ship visits by nuclear powered vessels. Discussion took place of current New Zealand defence policies, regrettably, without official representation from the New Zealand government. New Zealand's suspension from trilateral activities is an unresolved issue for the Alliance though this is of greater concern to Australia than to the United States or New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee, in reporting its views of the seminar, chose to keep its remarks brief. In so doing, the words of the individual speakers have been allowed to stand by themselves. While individually noteworthy, these presentations collectively provide a comprehensive overview of the alliance, and of the continuing value it provides, not just for Australia, but also for the United States, and for most regional nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a final point, I wish to note that, in the papers presented to the seminar, and in the issues raised by the audience present, there emerged no fundamental questioning of the rationale for Australia's continued membership of ANZUS. Following two days of discussions, the consensus that emerged 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7440"> was that there remains distinct advantages in maintaining the ANZUS relationship, and the Treaty is likely to remain a pillar of Australia's national security policy into the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, I would like to thank the many members of the military, academic, foreign affairs and diplomatic communities, and members of the general public who participated in the seminar, and particularly the score of speakers who generously contributed their time to ensure its success through the quality of their presentations. I believe their efforts have contributed to the creation of a valuable reference source and an important collation of contemporary thought on the ANZUS alliance. I commend these proceedings to you.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB2></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7440"><TITLE>Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</TITLE><DEBATE.SUB2 PAGE="7440"><TITLE>Report</TITLE>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have in addition, of course, been historically prohibited weapons, including sub&hyphen;machine guns, heavy machine guns and other similar weapons in the community.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Past judgments of the courts leave no doubt that the actions that have been specified would, if proved, amount to contempt of court and an attempt to pervert the course of justice if undertaken in respect of witnesses or potential witnesses before courts. Equally, those actions could, if proved, be dealt with by a House as a contempt of Parliament and could be successfully prosecuted as offences under the Parliamentary Privileges Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We are here talking about behaviour which goes very much to the core of the operation of the parliament and its committees. In short, we are talking about the nobbling of witnesses. Section 12 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act relevantly states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person shall not, by . . . intimidation . . . threat . . . or by other improper means . . . influence another person in respect of any evidence given or 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to be given before . . . a committee, or induce another person to refrain from giving such evidence.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is a serious offence that is punishable, in the case of a natural person, by $5,000 or imprisonment for six months. An offence of this nature can be prosecuted in the courts. A breach of parliamentary privilege may also be penalised by the Senate under subsection 7(1) of the Parliamentary Privileges Act by imposing a penalty of imprisonment for a period not exceeding six months. The laws of this country have obviously determined that the offences we are talking about, the activity we are talking about, are serious offences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real issue here essentially is: was pressure put on the Australian Law Reform Commission by the Attorney or someone on his behalf, an agent of his, in respect of that commission giving evidence, or about to give evidence, before a parliamentary committee? The question before the Senate today relates to whether, on or about 25 September 1997, the Attorney-General caused the acting secretary to his department, Mr Reaburn, to influence the Australian Law Reform Commission and its President, Mr Rose, not to make a submission or give evidence in person to the Joint Standing Committee on Native Title.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we talk about that committee let us remember that we are talking about an issue that has a high profile; we are talking about an issue with respect to native title which this parliament will have to confront over the next few months&mdash;in fact, probably over the next few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 17 September 1997, Mr Rose wrote to the joint standing committee confirming that the commission `would be pleased to present oral evidence to the committee'. Mr Rose also enclosed the first page of the draft of the commission's intended submission to the committee. The secretary of the committee, Mr Grundy, responded later that same day seeking confirmation that that commission would present evidence to that committee at 11 a.m. on Friday, 3 October&mdash;this Friday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On 19 September, Mr Rose formally accepted the committee's invitation and indicated that he was intending to provide the commission's written submission `early next 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7443"> week'&mdash;that is, the week commencing 23 September. Then on 24 September, Mr Rose unexpectedly confirmed in writing the commission's intention to withdraw its acceptance to present evidence before the committee and also confirmed that the commission `would not now be making a written submission to the committee in respect to the inquiry'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why the change of heart? Why did the commission withdraw? On Monday this week, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, it was revealed that on 24 September 1997, the Attorney-General, through the acting secretary to his department, Mr Norman Reaburn, told the commission not to give evidence to the joint standing committee. In response to this allegation, Mr Williams's spokesman advised that Mr Williams had had talks with Mr Reaburn `about the committee operating within its references, and the acting secretary passed those discussions on'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One thing that can be said right at the outset is that if you look at all of the responses of the Attorney throughout this particular matter, as with some previous ones, he has a great capacity to lead people off the track, to mislead. When it comes to misleading, this Attorney-General is a recidivist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, that was the response from the spokesman for the Attorney. Mr Rose confirmed that Mr Williams had previously protested to the commission in relation to a submission that the commission provided at the request of Senator Minchin and the Wik task force in relation to the same subject&mdash;the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 . In the words of Mr Rose, Mr Williams protested that `our putting the submission was not within current reference'. Mr Rose indicated that he rejected that view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When asked about this in the House of Representatives on Monday this week, the Attorney confirmed that he had written to Mr Rose on 28 August complaining that, in his view, the commission was acting outside its current terms of reference. Importantly, the Attorney deliberately chose, despite a specific question about the conversation held between Mr Reaburn and Mr Rose asked by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), not to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> advise the House about the content of that conversation. He deliberately created the impression that the only discussions that had taken place were academic discussions about whether the commission was acting inside its terms of reference in wanting to make the submission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Williams later appeared on the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> program. He repeated that version of events. He told the reporter, Mr Ross Solley, that as a result of Mr Reaburn's conversation with Mr Rose, the choice of whether to make the submission or not was left completely in Mr Rose's hands. Mr Williams said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If that is his, Mr Rose's decision, that's it. If he's summonsed by the Committee, then no doubt he will appear before the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">However, that basically misleads the public and it misleads the parliament in terms of his earlier answer. Importantly, Mr Williams made this statement immediately after Mr Rose had preceded him on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> . Despite having heard Mr Rose, I would imagine, he went on to make a statement which was intended to mislead. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>  interview Mr Rose said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last Tuesday I had a conversation with the Acting Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department, Norman Reaburn, in which he conveyed to me the very great dislike which the Attorney had for the proposal that we were proposing to put to the parliamentary committee . . . </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He had great dislike for the proposal that the commission was putting to the parliamentary committee. Mr Rose says there was real concern about the content of the proposal. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that is he was strongly opposed, he, the Attorney was strongly opposed to that draft submission which we'd provided to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Rose goes on to say, quite pointedly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And it was said to me that if we proceeded with that submission we could expect a second letter from the Attorney-General in very, very strong language in effect directing us to conduct no functions that weren't within those provisions of the Act dealing with references.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Solley put this again to Mr Rose. Mr Solley asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can I just clarify, just finally, what impression you were left with after your discussion with Mr Williams' department. Was it your impression that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7444"> the Attorney-General would wind back your powers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, Mr Rose responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, it was put to me very directly that we would get a second letter in very, very strong terms that would be in effect an indication of the Government's determination to do that.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Rose went on to repeat these comments in an article that appeared in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> . This is the reality of the choice that he did have, which was no choice. It was an offer he could not refuse. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was given a choice&mdash;hold back the submission and be able to discuss commission guidelines later, or go ahead with the submission and get a very strong letter from the Attorney-General directing us only to work on formal references from him . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Rose says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So we were really given no choice at all.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Despite this being on the public record and despite the Attorney-General knowing this, the spokesman for Mr Williams stated in response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Reaburn denies requesting the withdrawal of the submission or threatening to narrow the commission's role if it did not do so, and Mr Williams denies asking him to request the submission's withdrawal.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is a direct conflict of evidence here. I know who I believe. Later on, on Tuesday night, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS>  Mr Williams himself admitted that an attempt to improperly influence Mr Rose had been made to limit the powers of the commission. Mr Williams said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we suggested to him&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Rose&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is that he had a choice: either to go the route he wanted to go . . . appeared to want to go, or to not go down that route. If he went that route, he would know that he would be acting contrary to the views that I had expressed, and that's as high as it goes.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Ms Byrne, from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> , then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Rose&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">has already told that it you were very unhappy; you had a very great dislike; and he feared that it could result in limiting his commission's powers. I ask you again, if it's not a threat, what is it?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think Jennifer Byrne got it right. If that was not a threat, what is a threat? Mr Rose was basically told, `You either pull the submission 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or else if you go ahead, we're going to cut back on your powers, your functions and all your activities.' As I say, that was an offer that Mr Rose could not refuse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also have at the end of the day the first admission by the attorney that what Mr Rose has been saying all along was right. The Acting Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department, Mr Reaburn, did leave the commission with no choice: it either pulled its head in and withdrew the submission or it would have had its powers reduced. Then in parliament yesterday the attorney again admitted what I think we had known all along. At first in his normal way of trying to gloss over conversations Mr Williams tried to gloss over the conversation by claiming:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">this is the conversation between Reaburn and Rose&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was left on the basis that it was ultimately the Commission's decision whether or not to comment on the Native Title Bill. But, if they were to do so, they knew that it was my view that they would be doing so without statutory authority.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is despite the fact that during the term of this Attorney-General, the commissioners appeared before parliamentary committees on 21 occasions, giving evidence. During the term of this Attorney-General on 49 occasions in two years they have provided evidence not just to parliamentary committees but to all arms of government, state and federal. In direct contradiction of this innocent, naive interpretation of events given by the attorney, he quoted from a minute which Mr Reaburn made of the conversation. Mr Reaburn said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I told him&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Rose&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the Attorney regarded the justification for making the submission to the Wik Task Force as intellectually untenable. I told him he was "at the cross&hyphen;roads"&mdash;the Commission could go forward with the submission to the PJC and he would receive an `unhappy letter' from the Attorney. Or they could not go forward, and he would not receive any letter&mdash;instead he and I would sit down and try to work out a set of ground rules relating to submissions which would satisfy all the parties.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, Mr Reaburn made it clear that the commission should either behave or it would get a strong direction from the attorney 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7445"> as to what matters it can and cannot carry out and in what manner it can carry out its duties. I think such a statement is clearly an improper statement. It clearly influenced the commission to withdraw its submission to the joint standing committee on 24 September. It also proves two things: it proves the ineptness and incompetence not just of the attorney but of Mr Reaburn. Mr Reaburn is a person who has just assumed the position of acting secretary to the department, and he is trying hard to fill that job, but in this process he does not come out smelling all that well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we also have out of this series of events is an attorney deliberately misleading the House, the media and the Australian public. His comments have not been consistent. No matter how much they have tried to deceive, his comments have not deceived.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The attorney's defence to this is threefold. First, I note that he has deliberately sought to evade discussion of that conversation between Reaburn and Rose that took place on 24 September, preferring instead to refer to his own letter of 28 August 1997. That communique is not in dispute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Second, the attorney seeks to characterise the conversation between Reaburn and Rose as one which merely academically discussed the appropriate powers of the commission. As I have put on the record already, Mr Williams has since admitted that the conversation was more than an academic discussion. Third, he seeks to defend his actions on the basis that, in any event, it was proper for him to tell the commission to act within its powers and pull its head in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this regard, I do not think that whether the commission does have the power is genuinely a matter of dispute. Whilst it is true that the commission has no explicit reference on the Native Title Amendment Bill, the commission does have other references that are relevant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Rose has explained that the commission had a previous reference on Aboriginal customary law. The commission, pursuant to section 24 of the 1996 act, has power to examine matters that unduly trespass on people's personal rights, including property rights such as native title. It has a duty to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> consider whether Australia is acting in compliance with its international obligations, such as the Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination&mdash;a matter which is clearly in contention under the current bill. The commission also has a specific reference before it at the moment in relation to federal civil litigation process. Of course, that includes the operation of the National Native Title Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there is a very powerful case to argue that the commission does have sufficient terms of reference to make the submission. It has always acted on this basis over the last 21 years of its existence. In this regard, it needs to be placed on the record that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Senator Minchin, saw absolutely no problems in getting advice from this commission specifically on the issue of the Native Title Amendment Bill. The attorney is yet to explain why Senator Minchin and the Prime Minister's department thought obtaining evidence from this commission was appropriate while the attorney does not think so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Section 26 of the commission act specifically requires the commission to give evidence to a committee when requested to do so. The power of the attorney to direct the commission in relation to various matters does not extend to the power to prevent it from appearing and making submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last 24 hours, the attorney in his defence has invoked the evidence of Mr Burmester, who at his last outing just a few months ago tried to protect the government in respect of a privileges claim. I must say that Mr Burmester's advice can be seen to be stillborn. He says that, since the commission had no power, under his interpretation, to give evidence, then the attorney is not in breach of privilege.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That advice runs directly contrary to the advice of the Clerk of the Senate. The response of the attorney to this was twofold. First of all, he made a grossly inappropriate and unfair attack on Mr Evans's competence. Second, he hid behind that advice. There is now a direct conflict with the advice of Mr Burmester, a person who also is in a difficult situation, a person who is subservient to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7446"> attorney. Mr Burmester is someone who is under the attorney's direction. He should never have been asked to provide this advice. It is totally inappropriate for someone directly under the Attorney-General's supervision to be asked to give advice as to whether his boss is in the clear or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yesterday we had the advice of Mr Evans and the President's statement to the parliament. On the critical point, the President said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the point has been made in public controversy about this matter that the Attorney-General has a statutory power to direct the Australian Law Reform Commission as to the work it is to undertake. Improper influence with a witness, however, can be constituted by an act which a person is otherwise lawfully entitled to take. This has been made clear by the courts in relation to contempt of court, and also by the Privileges Committee in relation to interference with Senate witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think it is quite important to put on the record that the President also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the point has also been made in public controversy that the Australian Law Reform Commission does not have a statutory function of giving evidence to parliamentary committees. The question of whether a witness has been interfered with, however, does not depend on the nature of any evidence to be given or on the power or ability of a witness to give it. This principle also applies equally to legal proceedings and parliamentary proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So, in respect of the one point that the Attorney-General is trying to hide behind, the one emanating from the Burmester advice&mdash;that is, the commission had no power, therefore the attorney cannot be in breach of privilege for attempting to bring it back to the powers that it does have&mdash;the advice of the Clerk and the statement of the President of the Senate to this place yesterday run directly contradictory to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Once again, Mr Burmester really needs to go back to his law books and reassess the advice that has been given here. I suggest to him that when he does that he should actually have a look at the history and the record on privileges in this place and in the House of Representatives. That might help him.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In essence, what we have here is an attempted cover&hyphen;up of the ALRC's submission to the parliamentary committee. It had critical advice, which I would have thought the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government would welcome. The government is out of its depth in trying to tackle the native title issue and respond to Wik. It should take into account any advice available to it, but in this case it has tried to cover it up. Thereafter, it has tried to cover up the cover&hyphen;up by getting the native title committee to oppose the commission coming before it. Very few matters that come before us are of graver weight than this one. This matter raises critical issues of privilege and needs to be addressed by a full inquiry accordingly. That is why I have moved the motion this morning.</PARA></SPEECH>
<SPEECH PAGE="7446" TIME="10.28 a.m." SPEAKER="Ellison, Sen Chris" NAMEID="9X5" ELECTORATE="WA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Schools, Vocational Education and Training" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia&mdash;</STATE><ROLE>Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs and Minister Assisting the Attorney&hyphen;General)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(10.28 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, we have a weighty matter before us today, as Senator Bolkus has stated. The Senate's power to adjudicate an allegation of a breach of privilege and contempt of parliament involves the exercise of judicial power. This reinforces the great responsibility which we discharge when we consider a privileges issue. We sit here more as judges than as political partisans. So yesterday, when the President ruled that this matter had precedence, the President in no way was making a predetermination of any guilt or of any finding. She was simply saying that this was a very serious allegation and it should have precedence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Accordingly, we now have the task to consider whether the matter at stake constitutes one which involves an improper act tending substantially to obstruct the Senate. That is what we have before us today. The task is akin to a magistrate who determines whether a matter should be committed for trial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the notice of motion that Senator Bolkus relies on, he has drawn the words from the Parliamentary Privileges Act, where he refers to whether the Attorney-General or any other person sought, by force or threat or by other improper means, to influence the Australian Law Reform Commission in the giving of evidence. That basically is the nub of the allegation by Senator Bolkus. As he has outlined today, what we are looking at are the actions of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7447"> and the Acting Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department, Mr Norman Reaburn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to how we approach this matter, the Senate adopted a number of procedures to guide it in its consideration. These criteria are set out in Senate resolution 3 of the resolutions agreed to by the Senate on 25 February 1988. Part (a) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle that the Senate's power to adjudge and deal with contempts should be used only where it is necessary to provide reasonable protection for the Senate and its committees and for Senators against improper acts tending substantially&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and I stress substantially&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to obstruct them in the performance of their functions, and should not be used in respect of matters which appear to be of a trivial nature or unworthy of the attention of the Senate;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Part (b) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existence of any remedy other than that power for any act which may be held to be a contempt;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, is there another remedy available to the Senate? Finally, part (c) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether a person who committed any act which may be held to be a contempt:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) knowingly committed that act, or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) had any reasonable excuse for the commission of that act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those are the three criteria that we are guided by when we look at this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the criteria contained in part (a). The proponents for this motion have to show that the claimed conduct tended to substantially obstruct senators in the performance of their functions or the Senate in its functions. There has been no obstruction whatsoever; no attempt at obstruction, let alone a substantial obstruction. We have to decide whether there has been a substantial obstruction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the facts. The facts are that the Joint  Statutory Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund invited the Law Reform Commission to provide it with a submission in relation to its current reference. The Attorney-General wrote to the President of the ALRC and drew his attention to a very legitimate concern about the desirability of the commission working within its charter 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> which was given to it by this parliament. That is where we have to look at the duty imposed upon the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALRC comes under the direction and control of the Attorney-General. That is provided for by the administrative arrangements order. It is also provided for, by implication, in section 20 of the Australian Law Reform Commission Act 1996, which provides that the Attorney-General refers matters to the Australian Law Reform Commission. The Australian Law Reform Commission must act according to law; it must act within its powers. If it did not, it would bring the Law Reform Commission into disrepute. What the Attorney-General was doing was exercising his duty in pointing out to the Australian Law Reform Commission its powers and its limitations on its powers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the estimates committee, the Australian Law Reform Commission comes before a Senate committee. It is the representative of the Attorney-General who sits before that committee and answers questions on behalf of the Australian Law Reform Commission. That Law Reform Commission is accountable to the people of Australia and to this parliament, and so it should be. It is a creature of parliament and it is accountable. It is governed by an act of parliament, and it comes under the responsibility of the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Senator Bolkus says that a lawful direction can still constitute a contempt, he fails to recognise the relationship between the Attorney-General and the Australian Law Reform Commission. Indeed, I believe this full aspect was not put before the Clerk of the Senate when the supplementary evidence was obtained. The opposition would say that you can sack an employee and that can still constitute a contempt, albeit that it is a lawful act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the opposition fails to realise is that the Attorney-General had a duty to make sure that the Law Reform Commission was acting within its powers. If he did not do that, the opposition would be on him like a shot. It would be raised at the estimates committee. The question would be, `Mr Attorney, why weren't you making sure that the Law Reform Commission was acting within its powers?' 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7448"> Under the Audit Act, the Attorney&hyphen;General has a responsibility to make sure that the Law Reform Commission does not waste people's money. It cannot go engaging in a frolic of its own expending taxpayers' money without proper power or a proper statutory base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the letter that the Attorney-General wrote to the President of the Australian Law Reform Commission on 28 August and which has been tabled in this parliament&mdash;so there is no cover-up about the communication; from day one the Attorney-General tabled this letter&mdash;he simply pointed this out to him. The Attorney&hyphen;General finished by stating:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should therefore be grateful if you would ensure that you undertake consultation with me should such occasions arise again in the future.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There is no threat in this letter. There is not even a scintilla of a threat in this letter. The Attorney-General's actions were more than reasonable. Mr Reaburn, who is a Commonwealth officer and who has to carry out the laws of the Commonwealth, was doing no more, no less than his duty in talking to the President of the Australian Law Reform Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no evidence whatsoever that Mr Reaburn induced, threatened or attempted to do any of those things in relation to the evidence or any submission which was to be given by the Australian Law Reform Commission. In fact, the President of the Australian Law Reform Commission has corroborated the fact that he did not feel threatened by the communications to him, and that was in relation to the communications of either Mr Reaburn or the Attorney-General. So there is not a scintilla of evidence in relation to any threat whatsoever. The Attorney-General was acting lawfully.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question of what are improper means to influence a witness is an issue which has been considered by the courts on a number of occasions. I bring to the attention of the Senate the case of Meissner v. the Queen 1995, 130 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Law Reports</EMPHASIS>, page 547, where it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Argument or advice that merely seeks to persuade the accused to plead guilty is not improper conduct for this purpose, no matter how strongly the argument or advice is put. Reasoned argument or 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> advice does not involve the use of improper means and does not have the tendency to prevent the accused from making a free and voluntary choice concerning his or her plea to the charge. As long as the argument or advice does not constitute harassment or other improper pressure and leaves the accused free to make the choice, no interference with the administration of justice occurs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What we have here was the Attorney-General and Mr Reaburn advising the President of the Australian Law Reform Commission of his duty, of his powers, of what the law was&mdash;nothing more, nothing less.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn now to the other criterion that the Senate must consider when it considers whether to refer this to the Privileges Committee, and that is whether any other remedy exists in relation to the act which is alleged to be contemptuous. The native title bill has been referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. That is a Senate committee with much power and it will have the chance to go over all the legal questions in relation to that bill. It will have the opportunity and power to go into the very aspect that was asked of the Australian Law Reform Commission. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This chamber is another remedy. For the last two days this matter has been ventilated thoroughly before the people of Australia. So we have two alternative remedies where this matter has been canvassed and ventilated. It does not need further ventilation before the Privileges Committee. That would be a waste of the time of a Senate committee. We have here a political exercise which is trying to disguise itself as something which is judicious.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next criterion we have to look at is whether a person who committed the act did so knowingly or whether they had any reasonable excuse for the act, so that the person who is alleged to have committed this act did so with some sort of intent. The Committee of Privileges has said the following on a number of occasions&mdash;I quote from the 42nd report, May 1993:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only in the most exceptional circumstances should it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">contemplate make being a finding of contempt in the absence of any intention on the part of a person or persons to commit any act which may be held 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7449"> to be in contempt. As a general principle, the committee accepts that the damage to the Senate and its committees resulting from such acts would need to be of the most serious kind in order for the committee to find that a contempt had been committed in the absence of intent.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">For a start, the opposition just does not get off the ground in relation to intent or knowingly committing any act which could be held to be in contempt. There is absolutely no evidence, and none made out by the opposition, that there was any intent of any sort. There is no guilty mind whatsoever&mdash;in fact, quite the opposite. You have two people exercising their duty under the law of this Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for any excuse, if you do not have any intent and you do not get past that first arm of this criterion or charge, then you do not even have to get to any reasonable excuse. In any event, the Attorney-general and Mr Reaburn were just doing their duty. That produces the simple finding of no case to answer. When we look at this matter, the Senate has to confine itself to that criterion. As I have indicated, there is absolutely no evidence of any transgression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what happens if the Senate comes to the conclusion that there is no case to answer&mdash;not a shred of evidence that would support any of these aspects that we have to look at? The Senate then is duty bound not to refer this matter to the Committee of Privileges because the Committee of Privileges is doing work on behalf of the Senate. It is not there to consider matters which do not constitute a prima facie case, which are impossible ever to be found to have constituted some sort of substantial obstruction to the Senate. It is not there for frivolous or vexatious references.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would be an abuse of the system, and the Senate committee system in particular, if this were referred, because there is no case made out. It would be taking up unnecessarily that Senate committee's time. It would be turning something which is heavy and weighty and of great importance into a simple political stunt. If the opposition is serious about all this, if it is serious about the Committee of Privileges, if it is serious about the Senate committee system, it will not burden that system with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> something which is simply not worthy of reference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been a very tawdry attempt by the opposition to try to besmirch the Attorney-General, who was simply carrying out his duty. If he had not carried out his duty, the opposition would be the first to jump up and down at the Senate estimates committee. The subject matter of the submission will be dealt with by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. The questions of constitutionality will receive full consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill, the native title bill, is already before a joint committee. There is no question of this bill not receiving adequate scrutiny. In fact, I doubt whether any other bill will receive the scrutiny that this amendment bill will receive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have is no interference with any due consideration of any piece of legislation. What we have is an exercise of duty on the part of the Attorney-General in pointing out to the Australian Law Reform Commission its powers. What we have is the Attorney-General carrying out his responsibility under the administrative orders of this country. What we have is the Attorney-General ensuring that, under the Audit Act, unnecessary expenditure of taxpayers' money is not engaged in. Further, what we have here is the situation where an officer from the Attorney-General's Department was doing all those things as well as the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no cover-up, no cover&hyphen;up at all. The Attorney-General has tabled his letter of communication. He has answered in full the questions that have been put to him. In fact, Mr Reaburn has made full disclosure. Their version of events has been corroborated by the President of the Australian Law Reform Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have before us is uncontested evidence; and, on that uncontested evidence, there simply is not a case to be made out. There has been no substantial obstruction. There has not even been a scintilla of obstruction; in fact, the reverse. We have had people carrying out their duty. At one end of the scale, you have criticism of an Attorney-General who is trying to do his job; at the other end of the scale, you have due process 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7450"> in relation to the native title bill which is it is being scrutinised by no less than two committees and will have full attention given to it in relation to questions of law and constitutionality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Law Reform Commission is governed by its act, no more, no less. It has to deal with references given to it by the Attorney-General, and it should act within that, no more, no less. That is what the people of this country expect of that Law Reform Commission&mdash;not to go on frolics of its own.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might point out that there was another aspect which the Attorney&hyphen;General raised with the Law Reform Commission, and that was in relation to copyright. It was not just the native title bill; it was in relation to copyright as well. He believed there that the Law Reform Commission again had exceeded the terms of sections 20 and 21 of its act. He was not just confining it to the native title bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no attempt to single out the Australian Law Reform Commission because of some submission that the Attorney-General did not like. In fact, it was asked to make a submission to the Wik task force. Its views were asked for by the Commonwealth government in relation to the drafting of that bill. It has been employed by the government, properly so, and that is how it should be employed. But it should not be improperly employed, and that is where it embarks on aspects which are beyond its powers under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On all points, the people of Australia will be well served. They will not be well served or better served by this reference going to the Privileges Committee. In fact, they will be badly served, because this will be an unworthy reference to a very good committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ellison made reference to `trivial issues unworthy of the Senate'. If the Senate chooses to refer this matter to the Privileges Committee, it is so that that committee can determine whether there are recommendations to be made. The fact that the reference has been made, the fact that it is being debated here, indicates that a number of people do not believe that these matters are 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> trivial; they believe they ought to be considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have to look at this issue in context. We have had a number of debates in relation to the Attorney-General, as to whether or not, as the chief law officer of the land, he should be seen to be above politics, in politics, out of politics or totally separate from politics&mdash;and, quite clearly, it is not the case. We know that in the case of the Environmental Defender's Office there were very distinct messages going to their offices, saying that the government was unhappy, the minister was unhappy&mdash;and, of course, in reality, the cabinet were unhappy&mdash;with decisions to take cases against the government, or to try to defend the environment. The reality is that most of the cases which ended up having to be defended were, in the end, cases about whether or not the government played the role that they were meant to play under their own legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at that case. What happened? The Environmental Defender's offices, which had not long been established in some states&mdash;longer in New South Wales&mdash;did not choose to pull their heads in because of those notes. What happened? They got their funding cut. As to the funding, basically it was said, `If you take any cases at all, any litigation'&mdash;because it would have been too obvious to say `any litigation against the Commonwealth or the states'&mdash;`then you will get your funding cut.' We have the Environmental Defender's Office unable to take litigation at all. We have a group of lawyers who are hobbled because they were doing their job, because they were trying to defend the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we did not have that and other examples before us, we probably would be less likely to be in this position of being deeply concerned about whether a commission, which is meant to have some level of independence, was being told what it could or could not say, both to the community and to the parliamentary process. Is the commission required to ask permission of the minister for every statement they put out? Is the commission required to ask permission? Is it written in their orders that they have to ask permission 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7451"> and get everything okayed by the minister? I do not believe that is the case.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Within a relatively short time, this government has become contemptuous of the need to have independent commissions, of the need to separate executive power from the parliament and its bodies. That is a very, very important issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have also had the debate about the ongoing influence on parliamentary committees. We need to have further debate about placing departmental officers on parliamentary committees. And that, in my opinion, will mean that the executive, once again, has more and more undue influence on the outcome of parliamentary committees. We have a very dodgy line here in relation to the separation of powers, and it is getting worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think this is a trivial issue. If there needs to be clarification, this can be sought during the Privileges Committee inquiry and I am sure there will be a number of legal opinions given in relation to the limitations or otherwise of the powers of the Australian Law Reform Commission. That will probably be a useful thing and I am sure there will be differences of opinion. I am sure the government may roll out its own appropriate or convenient opinion or its own legal assistance in that sense, but it is important to have that brought out in the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If clarification needs to be sought, this is the appropriate way to do that. I do think it is wrong to call these issues trivial or unworthy of the Senate. It should not be the case that we can have a situation where committees of parliament are hindered from taking action. In fact, this committee ended up being hindered because of course the government used its votes in the committee to refuse to require the attendance of the Legal Aid Commission. We had two sides to it. We had the minister acting in the way he did and also the government using its numbers on the committee to vote against requiring the Legal Aid Commission to attend and provide evidence. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I personally would like to avoid the kind of situation which I experienced during the hearing on legal aid in Western Australia. The Western Australian minister attended the hearing and, because he was tired, answered a direct question from me as to why the Western Australian Legal Aid Commission was not able to attend the meeting. He clearly said that it was because he told them that they were not allowed to. The embarrassment and the outrage within the media and the community was such that within a very short time the Legal Aid Commission was permitted to come and give evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to see that happening in the federal parliament. I do not want to see that kind of influence or bullying by ministers. If there is any indication that there is a concern that this might be happening, or anything like that might be happening, then we must deal with it. We must be clear about what we are dealing with and we must be clear about where the rights of the parliament exist and where the line might be between executive influence and the democratic process.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand the situation, in the last 12 or 18 months the ALRC has made around 20 submissions to parliamentary committees. It does appear to me from a political standpoint that it is rather odd that the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) should have taken this step when he did. He had not objected to any of other submissions going before the committee, but on this one and the copyright one he apparently did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ALRC reports or submissions are not holy writ and in fact some of them have sunk without trace. It seems to me that this would be just another submission which might have been useful to look at, and obviously it will be useful to have a look at it on a matter of some significance. The ALRC is a creature of statute. I am not in a position to decide whether, under the interpretation of those functions, this would have been justified. I am not in a position the make that judgment at this point of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the meeting the other night of the parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7452"> Fund I was given copies of the ALRC's letters to the secretariat. It did appear on the face of it from those documents&mdash;and Senator Ellison may be able to correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that the committee must have asked the ALRC whether they would be interested in providing a submission. That is what it seems to me from the correspondence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have listened to what honourable senators have said and the minister, Senator Ellison, has done a very valiant job. He did refer to the resolution of the Senate of 25 February 1988. Part 3 of that resolution says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate declares that it will take into account the following criteria when determining whether matters possibly involving contempt should be referred to the Committee of Privileges and whether a contempt has been committed, and requires the Committee of Privileges to take these criteria into account when inquiring into any matter referred to it:. . . </PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly, we have an obligation here to give consideration to (a), (b) and (c), as has been expressed by Senator Ellison. But the statement by the President indicates that it was not her role at the stage that she made the statement to make any judgment as to the facts of the matter. She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since these provisions were adopted, Presidents have followed the principle that a matter should be given precedence if it is capable of being held by the Senate to satisfy criterion (a) and if there is no other readily available remedy.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have gone over criterion (a) and it does seem to me that, on the face of it, this matter is capable of being held by the Senate to satisfy criterion (a).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A number of matters have been raised in the debate today about whether or not the ALRC has exceeded its powers. If it were the case that the ALRC has acted improperly, in a narrow sense of that term, then the question arises whether an improper act&mdash;again, I use the word very narrowly&mdash;and the prevention of an improper act can be regarded as contempt. I suppose that is a matter that will have to be thoroughly considered by the Privileges Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to canvass all of the other matters that have been raised during this debate&mdash;such as whether the person who committed an act which may be held to be in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> contempt knowingly committed that act or had any reasonable excuse for commission of that act. These are matters which, it seems to me, are more appropriately dealt with by the Privileges Committee. I am quite convinced that this is a matter that is proper to go before the Privileges Committee because it does go to the protection of the processes of this parliament, which are essential for us to carry out our responsibilities on behalf of the electors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make absolutely no judgment as to the propriety or otherwise of the Attorney-General. I would only say, as the President has done, that if this is a matter that is capable of being held by the Senate to satisfy criterion (a), then it should be given precedence&mdash;as it has been given precedence. In my view, the matters deserve to be considered by the Privileges Committee, and that is how I will vote.</PARA>

The House of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7454"> Representatives does not accept the amendment for two reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it is the proper role of the elected Executive to bear responsibility for preventing damage to the public interest&mdash;and it is the Executive which will be held accountable by the Parliament and, ultimately, the electorate for its performance in that regard. Secondly, the framework of clause 37, as amended by the Senate, would provide scope for the Auditor&hyphen;General to be drawn in as an unwitting party to the, often, political issues that Members and Senators may wish to pursue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 37 replicates a framework that has been in operation in the Audit Act 1901 for almost 20 years. The scope for intervention by the Attorney&hyphen;General to prevent disclosure of particular kinds of information on public interest grounds is not extensive. The reasons listed in Clause 37(2) for the Attorney&hyphen;General to issue a certificate relate only to matters of genuine importance and significance. If one were to imagine a worst case scenario that could occur under the Senate amendment, it is possible to see how damage could be caused to Australia's national or international security and how the integrity of the Commonwealth's position could be undermined in ways that caused genuine damage to Australia. Accordingly, the House of Representatives believes that it in not worth the risk to accept the Senate amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives believes that the framework in Clause 37, unamended, has been proven to operate in a realistic and sensible way, having been used only once, for reasons of national security. Moreover, Clause 37, as drafted, provides an added measure of accountability on the Executive in that it compels the Auditor&hyphen;General to report any intervention by the Executive and the reasons for it. The House of Representatives believes that the framework provided for in clause 37 is sound and therefore disagrees with the Senate amendment.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Telecommunications Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 applies new arrangements to procedures 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7455"> for establishing an interception capability for telecommunications services in Australia, and the funding of this interception capability. The bill also deals with minor technical amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1997, including aspects of industry development plans, labelling of equipment and ACA industry reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will deal firstly with the interception aspects of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under Part 15 of the Telecommunications Act 1997, which largely carries forward the arrangements under the Telecommunications Act 1991, telecommunications carriers and nominated carriage service providers must ensure they can execute an interception warrant. The only exception to this is when the Minister for Communications and the Arts grants an authorisation. Carriers have also been required to consult with agencies on new technologies before introducing a telecommunications service. Agencies have borne all the costs associated with developing those interception capabilities required to be able to execute an interception warrant, and the costs of executing individual warrants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the existing arrangements for interception capabilities are no longer suitable. The introduction of some new telecommunications services have been significantly delayed with obvious adverse consequences for business and consumers. On occasion services have also been introduced without an adequate interception capability, impacting adversely upon the operations of law enforcement and national security agencies. The funding of all interception requirements by the agencies, with no industry assistance on the establishment and maintenance of this essential service, has been a large and continuing drain upon the agencies' resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These problems will not go away under the current framework. One of the effects of the opening of the telecommunications market to full competition will be to increase the difficulties, and expense, faced by the agencies in attempting to negotiate interception capability arrangements with each and every new entrant. Add to this the escalating speed of technological change in telecommunications and the obvious outcome is increasing delays to the entrance of new market participants, and to new services, with implications for the growth and development of the Australian telecommunications market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The best long term hope for retaining a cost effective interception capability into the longer run is through international co&hyphen;operation directed at getting telecommunications equipment vendors (especially manufacturers of switches) to include common interception capabilities into their equipment. This will ensure that capabilities are maintained, while keeping costs down by sharing them 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> among all user countries and achieving economies of scale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill therefore provides for a new level of interception capability based upon the relevant international standard or guideline. The Attorney&hyphen;General will be given the power to determine, via one or more disallowable instruments, the specifics of the new capability. The Attorney&hyphen;General will base this new capability requirement on the International User Requirement (IUR) developed by most OECD law enforcement and national security agencies (including Australia) under the auspices of the International Law Enforcement Telecommunications Seminar (ILETS). I have tabled a copy of the IUR with the bill, for Senators information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, to ensure there is no lapse in the requirement for an interception capability, carriers and carriage service providers will be required to be in a position to execute an interception warrant issued under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 until the Attorney&hyphen;General has made his determination, that is the `fallback' position will be a continuation of the current capability obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Law enforcement and national security agencies will be able to authorise the operation of a service with a lower (or no) level of interception capability. This is reasonable given that these agencies are the users of the capability, and are in the best position to determine when it is no longer required. The Minister will continue to have a reserve power, exercisable with the agreement of the Attorney&hyphen;General, to also grant authorisations. The Australian Communications Authority (ACA) is to be being given a limited power to provide exemptions for trial services after appropriate consultations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill continues the current requirement for carriers and nominated carriage service providers to notify the ACA of relevant changes to technology, with the ACA ensuring relevant agencies are consulted. In order to make sure that the introduction of new telecommunications services is not unduly delayed, the ACA is now required to specify reasonable timeframes with which agencies can consider new technologies for each new technology notification. If agencies do not comment within this reasonable period they lose their ability to specify particular delivery requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also introduces new funding arrangements for interception. Agencies will continue to be liable for the costs of executing individual interception warrants, as well as most other matters of `help' that are in addition to the basic listening and recording of a communication. They will also be liable for the costs of establishing capabilities they have specifically requested. The ACA has been given new audit powers to ensure that the most cost effective solutions are adopted. However carriers will now be required to pay for the costs of providing the interception capability determined by the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7456"> Attorney&hyphen;General, or the costs of the `fallback' capability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to allocating the transmission costs of an intercepted communication, a new concept of the `delivery point' has been introduced in Part 14. Individual carriers and carriage service providers, and the agencies, will be required to agree to the location of the `delivery point', with the carrier or carriage service provider paying for the costs of transmitting the intercepted information to the delivery point, and the agencies paying for the transmission costs from the delivery point to the final destination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another new concept, the interception capability plan, is also introduced with this bill. These plans are intended to provide a strategic communications and planning tool for the industry and agencies. Carriers and carriage service providers nominated by the Attorney&hyphen;General will be required to submit these plans on an annual basis, and their content will include the policies of the carrier or provider in relation to interception generally; of their strategies for compliance with their interception obligations; a statement of any relevant business developments; and a description of strategies for minimising long run costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill therefore introduces a new framework for the accomplishment of a cost effective and relevant interception capability within Australia. However, we recognise that technologies, the communications market, and the needs of agencies are continuing to evolve rapidly. While telecommunications interception remains for the present a cost effective tool for agencies, it is important that we keep our approach to this issue under review. The bill therefore requires the Minister, in consultation with the Attorney&hyphen;General, to cause a review to be conducted before 1 July 1999 into the longer&hyphen;term cost effectiveness of the arrangements provided for in Parts 14 and 15 of the act that relate to the funding of telecommunications interception. A copy of the report from this review is to be laid before each House of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are also several other matters in the bill which I will now discuss.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for the labelling requirements for customer equipment and customer cabling under Division 7 of Part 21 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 to apply not only to manufacturers or importers of this equipment or cabling but also to authorised agents acting in Australia on behalf of such manufacturers or importers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will allow overseas manufacturers and importers to revert back to established agency arrangements whereby their Australian agents take responsibility for ensuring that the requirements for labelling telecommunications customer equipment and customer cabling are met. This will ensure the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> supply of equipment and cabling to Australia and facilitate the introduction and growth of competition in the supply of goods and services in the Australian telecommunications market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the ACA is currently required to monitor and report each financial year to the Minister on all significant matters relating to the performance of carriers and carriage service providers. The bill builds in additional flexibility by giving the Minister the power to direct the ACA in relation to the preparation of periodic reports as well as special reports on particular matters that may arise during the year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Technical amendments are also proposed to Clause 27 of Schedule 3 to the act dealing with the carriers' powers and immunities. This clause sets out the matters that the ACA must be satisfied about before it may issue a facility installation permit. It also sets out the things that the ACA must take into account in deciding whether the grounds for a permit have been made out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 27, as currently drafted, requires that before a facility installation permit can be issued for telecommunications installations other than designated overhead lines, the ACA must be satisfied that both the landowner and the relevant local authority have not consented to the installation. This has the peculiar and unintended consequence that a consent by either a landowner or relevant authority will prevent the ACA from issuing a facility installation permit. The bill amends clause 27 to address this anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The re&hyphen;draft makes it clear that the ACA can issue a facility installation permit for non&hyphen;designated overhead lines infrastructure where either the landowner or the relevant authority refuse or withhold consent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains minor amendments to Part 2 of Schedule 1 which covers industry development plan arrangements. The amendments correct shortcomings in the legislation relating to when industry development plans are required and when the approval of the Industry Minister is necessary, as well as clarifying the notification of Government policies which carriers must have regard to in preparing their industry development plans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first amendment will require all carriers to have a current industry development plan at all times, rather than only when applying for a carrier licence, as currently provided in the act. The second amendment will see amended industry development plans requiring approval of the Industry Minister, treating them in a similar manner to original plans. The third amendment will require the Industry Minister to notify carriers and applicants for carrier licences of government policies he wishes them to take into account in preparing their plans.  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7457">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes a number of other minor and technical amendments to the Telecommunications Act 1997, the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1997 and the Trade Practices Act 1974.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook, I ask you to reconsider the remarks you made yesterday, because I think you may have made them with insufficient information. The actual effect of my amendments is to add to the framework for the development of government fiscal policy and to add to the issues which the Treasurer (Mr Costello) must assess in the development of long&hyphen;term sustainable fiscal strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments have nothing to do with the short&hyphen;term costing of election commitments and the restrictive time requirements under that part.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was advised that I am carrying it today, and just a few seconds ago I got the documents in front of me, so I am not in the fully prepared briefed&hyphen;up state on this matter that I normally would be. However, going from my recollection of the debate when we closed it down yesterday, my concerns at that point were that, firstly, if this amendment were carried, the Department of the Treasury would be required to provide costings of the social impact of economic policies and provide costings or comments on the ecological sustainability of measures put down by the major parties in an election context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My concerns were, firstly, that those issues are complex and detailed and in many respects call up subjective judgments. Secondly, does Treasury have the equipment and firepower to handle it? I think not. Thirdly, there is contention about the subjective nature of some of these issues. Do we start from a clear definitional base so that we all agree what it is we are looking at? It is essential that we agree on what the implications might be in order to cost them and, if we are working from different premises, it complicates debate; it does not enlighten it. As much as I have reservations about this bill, its purpose is to try and enlighten debate and make it easier for electors to assess the policies of major parties at election time.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7458">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fourth concern I had yesterday, as I recall, was that, given the subjective nature of some of these matters, if in an election campaign a major party&mdash;and it would most likely be mine&mdash;disagreed with what the federal bureaucracy thought were the implications of some of its policies, then in an election context you have got a political party arguing with the bureaucracy over a question of credibility. That exposes us to issues of whom you believe: do you believe the bureaucrats or the politicians? That is a terrible bind. I think most people will believe us, because we are entirely credible, but I would not want to be in a position where they have to make the choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were the concerns that I had about this amendment. What I apprehend you have just put to me is that this is not to be seen as in an election context; this is to be seen as a longer term thing. I would like to hear the government's view on this amendment. That will enable me to look at Senator Murray's most recent remarks and come to a conclusion about those.

Basically, it was a pretty good speech, Senator. I thought you summed up the position particularly well. If we had had three more minutes, I think the vote would have been taken.

I do not say that the other issues which have been brought into this matter are unimportant, but they are not matters which deal directly with the issue which is before the chamber, which is trying to establish sound principles of fiscal management. The other matters which have been raised are important, and clearly they will be matters of concern to people, but they are not matters which I believe should be considered in the context of this particular bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook did make some useful points in relation to the role of the Treasury in

I was going to speak on this matter yesterday, if there had been time, and was not going to say all that much because I thought that Senator Cook had expressed the position pretty well. I am surprised that he could not remember what he said yesterday because it was still ringing in my ears. When this came back on for debate, I asked my advisers to pass me the speech that Senator Cook made yesterday because I thought it was a pretty good summing up of the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just to encapsulate it, the issues which have been raised, the social effects and the ecological sustainability issues, are very important; no&hyphen;one doubts that. They are issues which will always be taken into account in public debate as we look towards the long term. But this is a document produced by the Treasury which deals with the issues of fiscal sustainability. That is the focus of the bill and that is what we are trying to achieve. I think that to widen it in this way, as Senator Cook said so well and so eloquently, is suggesting that Treasury will be bringing in particular skills and issues which are far wider than is appropriate for such a document. So we will not be supporting this measure. The issue of whether or not it is in the election context is another issue, but the fact of the matter is that the general principles that Senator Cook laid out yesterday were sensible. We will not be supporting this measure.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already made a contribution to the debate on this amendment,  but I am concerned about some elements that are emerging. I think that they are coming from both Labor and the government,  so I would like to emphasise that what they are saying, in my opinion, is that budgets are considered to be the realm of economics. You will find around this chamber people who think this is a strange statement, but budgets are, in my belief, about politics and public policy. They 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7460"> are about how you direct your decisions and so economics is a part of the tool that you should be using but budgets should not be simply the realm of economics. All the decisions on revenue, tax and spending are about policy and politics. They are not about decisions about economics; they are about decisions about politics and how you make and direct your choices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Only in relatively recent times have we actually tried to separate economics from politics. I am reminded of a story of about three years ago when I had a parliamentary intern who interviewed a staffer of a Liberal politician on an issue. He was a bit perplexed when he saw that she had done political economy as one of the courses in her law degree. He said, `What has politics got to do with economics?' She was perplexed, as I was, and quite amused, because originally economics was called political economy. Adam Smith called it political economy in recognition of the fact that it is about the choices you make as to how you make a living and how you provide the goods and services and physical needs&mdash;and sometimes other needs&mdash;of people in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The politics and the policy have been artificially separated to the bizarre extent where we find that we are in fact being dictated by speculative markets way out of our purview telling us what we should be doing and how we should be doing it, and being punished by what is happening to our dollar. That is bizarre. I think the most concerning thing is when statements are made that budgets should not be considered to be just the realm of economics. The person who popularised the idea of fiscal policy, which was John Maynard Keynes, would have been the last person to suggest that budgets are not a policy and political decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Somehow we have managed to shut out all of the background and history that has gone into political and social decision making up to now and we have got to a very scary position where we are saying that it is about economics and that economics rules us, rather than our using economics as a tool to achieve public policy and political choices.

What we are seeking in these amendments is to insert into the bill a requirement that some important additional information be provided in the reports. Specifically, the opposition considers that the government must provide national savings forecasts and an estimate of the net effect on savings of the budget as part of the group of obligations created by clause  12 of schedule 1 of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major topic of economic policy debate which has dominated this parliament since the election of the Howard government is that of national savings and the priority the government should be placing on national savings. These amendments seek to ensure that the appropriate emphasis is placed on national savings and its impact by stipulating in this bill that the government must provide separate estimates of the net effect of future budgets on the national savings&mdash;both public and private savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems somewhat odd that this government, which has embarked upon a slash and burn approach to public expenditure in the name of improving public sector savings, has actually excluded this very important item from its reporting requirements. The Treasurer (Mr Costello) has put the issue of improved national savings at the forefront of public debate since March 1996. However, his practice is not to tell the public what his budgets will actually do for national savings. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7461"> We suspect that the reason for this is that he knows he is following the wrong policy mix and that the government will be embarrassed by the poor national savings outcome that this policy mix will create.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We in the opposition have maintained for a long time that an appropriate budget strategy would be one that placed more emphasis on growth and employment with resultant benefits flowing through to national savings by having more people working, saving and paying tax. The government has chosen a different path and in the process flattened the economy, including both consumer and business confidence, which has a resultant negative impact on national savings.</PARA>

Talk to any business person in the Australian community and they will tell you that aggregate demand is down, consumer confidence is down, people feel insecure about their futures and the level of bankruptcies in small business is very high.

It is within this context that we move these two amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government wants to embark upon a chosen economic path and flatten the economy in the process, then in the name of budget honesty this impact should be duly reported in the context of the effect such a policy has on national savings.

The reality is that, Senator Cook, your continued efforts to talk down the economy are not working. We saw another example of Labor ignoring all the good news coming out of the economy and attempting to talk it down. We know that the Labor Party hates good news on the economy. I could list for you the data that has come out in the last three or four weeks, which is overwhelmingly good news. You know the facts of that case, and I will not delay the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook was right to talk about the importance of international savings. I am very glad to hear that admission from the Labor Party. When it was in office, the Labor Party totally ignored the issue of national savings through its massive deficit spending&mdash;from memory, running up $70 million of debt in some five years. Massive overspending meant that public sector saving was a major drain on the economy. It is not surprising that national savings sunk to a very low level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cook is right to highlight the importance of national savings. He is right to highlight the importance that this government gives to national savings and it is right for me to remind him what a low priority his government gave to national savings. The reality is that forecasts of national savings at this stage of our understanding of how we can put all these figures together are still highly subjective and subject to fairly constant revisions of data, which Senator Cook would be aware of. I think that the requirement to publish data, which can be subject to quite substantial revision, is a problem. It could be argued that this would not add hugely to the sum of human knowledge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not dispute the importance of national savings. As I said, Senator Cook was basically right in highlighting the emphasis 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7462"> that the government gives to that. If we could improve the data, we could be more confident of this. Nothing in this bill would prevent governments from printing that. I think it is a matter of judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a very proud record of trying to build national savings and to build the savings culture in this country. The preliminary figures and indications that you get relate not only to what we have done in terms of the Commonwealth's position&mdash;there has been a very dramatic turnaround&mdash;but to forecasts over the three years that we have been in government and the fiscal position that we were left by the Labor Party. The private savings, if one can go on superannuation, look extremely good. As I said, it has been a super year for super. It has been a great year for superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite efforts to talk superannuation down by Senator Sherry and efforts to knock the industry, efforts to argue that confidence in superannuation is being destroyed have been blown utterly sky high. In fact, when you look at the superannuation industry, even taking out the very substantial growth in assets in the superannuation industry, the contributions are flowing in. I can assure the committee that we have nothing to hide in our efforts to promote national savings, both publicly and privately. Publicly, we have not received any help at all from the Labor Party. They have opposed most of our budget measures. We have received no help at all from the Labor Party in relation to public savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to private savings, in the last year the Labor Party has attempted to justify a crazy decision to oppose the superannuation surcharge on high income earners by suggesting that it would wreck confidence in superannuation. The latest figures blew that utterly sky high. The Labor Party is left without a wing to fly on on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not in any way wish to detract from the huge importance of national savings. What we are saying is that there is nothing in this document which would prevent governments publishing forecasts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;ALP amendments 2 and 3 brought me back to what happened in the previous term of government when there was debate on national savings. The response from the then government was to introduce a form of compulsory superannuation, which became the beginning of the end for pensions as a right in Australia. I believe that the national savings debate has been a very limited debate in Australia. It should be, in my opinion, a debate about the ability of people to make choices in their lives; to be able to choose to save or otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Going back to basic principles, the debate should look at the consumption functions of average Australians to find out what kind of income they have left, if any, to make those choices or what percentage of people are in debt and are never likely to get out of it, or not for a long time. Unfortunately, in recent times the debate generally has been about how many and what tax incentives we should give to rich people to alter the direction of their discretionary income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we have talked about national savings without the qualifiers to consider social and environmental implications and national and private savings, it has led to fairly atrocious outcomes. The Commission of Audit, which recommended the slash and burn of the Public Service that Senator Cook has men 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7463"> tioned, gets positive ticks from Treasury analysts because it reduces public expenditure, which therefore presumably reduces national debt and increases national savings. But it does not necessarily work out that way. Any proposed expenditure on education, health or industry promotion would probably get a big negative in respect of national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would argue that the purpose of money is not only to invest it. Expenditure especially on social wellbeing and quality of life is a valid social goal, hence a valid goal of politics. It should not be compromised by creating a report card that will give it a fail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know what the voting position of my colleague from the Australian Greens in this case will be. On the balance, I do not know that what is being put forward as the national savings agenda&mdash;to me it is a cover for a whole lot of other agendas&mdash;is necessarily going to go in the direction of giving people a fair go by considering whether or not their discretionary income allows them to be consumers of goods and services that are produced by local industry and allows them to make choices about whether they save and how much they save from their income, if they have any savings left.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think the debate is about choices in things like housing, affordable transport and reasonable wages and conditions. We should be getting down to choices like people choosing to save some of their work time or choosing leisure rather than work. There are fewer and fewer choices in that regard at the moment. This amendment is a somewhat reductionist approach. I know that mine is seen to be an odd approach, judging from the response around the chamber. I have difficulty with the ALP's amendments 2 and 3 and do not feel I can support them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the particular case of figures on national savings, we are not talking of any great mystery. I remind the government that its budget parameters, the parameters in which it frames its own budget, are subjected to substantial revision. It produces its half-yearly report based on how the budget parameters 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7464"> have been performed against, and it makes revisions at that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue is not of the statistical base upon which some of these things can be founded. Both parties will have their policies costed against the same statistical base. Whether those figures are to a decimal point right or to a decimal point wrong will not make a hell of a lot of difference, I submit, to the final outcome in terms of the implications of a particular policy approach as compared to another policy approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, as to your first point about revision&mdash;substantial, minor or otherwise&mdash;that is a constant theme when we deal with statistics. Statistics are never that accurate to the last decimal point that with subsequent and better knowledge you cannot improve them, and of course the bureau does improve them. The practice followed by Treasury, the government and all governments is to review their budget estimates at the half-yearly interval. Minister, we both know that. I think it is a red herring in this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The real question, the question that I think might mollify the concerns expressed by the Western Australian Greens, is about having national savings at all. The big problem for a country like Australia is that we are a net borrower from the world. We borrow money to finance development in Australia because we do not generate sufficient levels of national savings to fund the development of our own country by Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We borrow money because we are a huge country with a small population and we have major infrastructure requirements on road, rail, transport, ports&mdash;a whole range of things. We are a net borrower from the world. The more we lift the level of national savings and the more we can borrow from ourselves, the less dependent we are on foreign capital. I think there is a common view that we should do constructive and intelligent things to lift the level of national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The debate about the last two budgets from the Commonwealth is whether the right way to lift national savings, from a public sector point of view, is to cut budget outlays and to make the battlers of Australia bear the burden, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> or whether it is to grow the economy and generate funds from the income side by putting people into employment, giving them jobs so that they pay taxes and do not draw unemployment benefits. It is a difference of philosophical approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue for this debate is that there is a commonality of view that lifting national savings is a good thing; there is a difference about how to go about it. With this bill the question is whether the electors of Australia at election time should know the implications of what both the major parties propose, and the implications include the effect on national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the things that the Western Australian Greens have raised&mdash;the concerns about the lack of choice for people who are locked into poverty traps, the lack of choice for people who are unemployed, the obligations in regard to other impacts on national savings&mdash;are reasonable questions for anyone to ask. This amendment is about providing an assessment of the implications of the Liberal Party's proposals about those things or the implications of the Labor Party's proposals about those things in a simplified way so that people can make a decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The theme of choice that was resplendent in the WA Greens submission a moment ago is aided by the fact that the policy implications to national savings and the implications of how much foreign borrowings will take in in order to finance our growth, et cetera can be compared&mdash;the government versus us&mdash;and people can then make a choice about which policy mix suits them.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a very important amendment. One can hope that this would have the unanimous support of members of the Senate. The integrity of the tax base is fundamental to the delivery of adequate public services. Taxes are necessary to finance public services, and these are most fairly raised when everyone so able contributes to them. Ensuring the integrity of the tax base is, therefore, crucial to ensuring that all taxpayers are paying their fair share of taxation. Amendment No. 4 proposes to require the Commissioner of Taxation and the Secretary to the Treasury to provide a report on any material threats to the integrity of the tax system, including the fiscal impact of any of these threats as a permanent and integral part of fiscal reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very important proposal because it will allow the government, and especially the Treasurer, to be held accountable for the conduct of tax policy. The opposition believes that there can be few duties of higher importance to the Treasurer than to maintain a fair tax system in Australia. Critical to that is that the current tax base be maintained. We are concerned to ensure that the revenue authorities' concerns are made public to enable scrutiny of the Treasurer's performance in his duty to protect the public revenue. The tax commissioner can advise the Treasurer on matters that should be undertaken to maintain the tax base but he has no power to force the Treasurer to act in the national interest. The discretion is all with the Treasurer to either accept or reject the advice of the tax office and the Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This amendment does not seek to alter the Treasurer's right to make tax policy on behalf of the government, but we do seek to ensure that the material threats to the taxation system are codified on a systematic public basis as to enable the performance of the Treasurer in dealing with these revenue threats to be openly evaluated. Future Treasurers will still be able to refuse to act on the advice of the revenue authorities, but they will not be able to hide their actions or lack of action from the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Clause 12 of schedule 1 as currently worded only includes some references to the sorts 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7466"> of risks that may have a material effect on the fiscal outlook, but there is no explicit reference to particular threats proposed to fiscal outcomes due to the integrity of the tax system coming under substantial attack. What we do know, though, is that the tax system and the threat to its integrity is under constant and sustained attack. In some instances this is as a direct result of government legislation opening up loopholes. In other cases it arises through a lack of action on tax avoidance through allowing such things as salary repackaging by its senior public servants. As we believe that risks to the integrity of the tax system will always exist, the opposition is convinced that one way of ensuring that these risks are brought to the attention of the public is by ensuring that the government itself makes its own estimate, which is to be published accompanied by a statement as to where it perceives these threats are coming from.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As we know, there are many areas of avoidance activity that are currently going on, the biggest areas seemingly being the alienation of personal services income and complex trust arrangements by high wealth individuals which this government plans to do nothing about. The opposition believes that these threats to the tax system are so great in themselves and quite readily distinguishable from other kinds of risks such as contingent liabilities that they ought to be the subject of a specific obligation. This amendment establishes that obligation. The opposition seeks the support of the Senate to insert this very important requirement into the bill. A vote against this amendment is a vote against ordinary taxpayers.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If ever I have heard a lot of nonsense, that was certainly it. If it is all so hugely important, Senator Cook, you had 13 years to do something about it. You didn't do it in 13 years. This is the big program for the 14th year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact of the matter is that the charter already requires that the material threats to the fiscal outlook be outlined in the statement of risks. The reality is that what Senator Cook has proposed may produce very perverse 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> results. I would ask non-government members, those outside of the Labor Party, just to reflect on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More detailed reporting of threats to the tax base by the tax commissioner, I believe, would draw the attention of tax planners to weaknesses and anomalies in tax legislation before the government, or a future government, has had time to rectify the situation. Frankly, it would be telling burglars that the house currently is unlocked, which doors are unlocked, which windows are unlocked and where they could hope to enter. We believe that such a report may very well produce very perverse results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Cook knows, the tax system is incredibly complex. Governments spend a great deal of the time moving to close off loopholes and protect revenue. Every budget contains a whole host of measures which are designed to protect the revenue. For Senator Cook to lecture this government, frankly, is just absurd.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After 13 years of Labor, Mr Keating, just three weeks before being cast out of office, discovered that there were some problems with high wealth individuals. After 13 years of managing the system, he discovered, with 21 days to go, `Hey, there's a problem here'&mdash;just a total and absolute joke. We have noted how keen those of the Labor Party were to collect money from those with higher incomes by their response to the surcharge: when they had a chance to do something material, they failed to do it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would put to the Greens and to the Democrats that this measure could easily produce perverse results. I would put that to everyone, with the exception of the Labor Party, because their record of failure to act on tax avoidance is clear and on the table.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Normally the Manager of Government Business would be very happy with a chairman who sped things along, but I think it is very important in this matter for the government to put its reasons before the chamber. I deeply appreciate Senator Murray's indication that the debate has been had; he has very eloquently put his views in relation to clause 37 only a matter of a couple of days ago. But I think it is important for the record for the government to say why we insist on the bill in its current form without the amendment moved recently by Senator Murray.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government in the debate in the Senate put the position that the Attorney-General should be able to issue a certificate in relation to information that is in the public interest. We believe that the amendment which relates to not being able to issue a certificate in relation to matters requested by a committee or a house of parliament does contravene the intent of this clause.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The clause gives the Attorney-General the power to act on behalf of the government in the public interest. These are not unique powers. I know that Senator Murray has said 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7468"> to me privately&mdash;and it is a view I expected  to hear&mdash;that just because this power exists in a number of other acts of the Commonwealth it does not necessarily mean that it is right now. Senator Murray will go down in history as a great reformer and he has to keep amending things as they go. He would say that he will start with this Auditor-General's package and try to change this power of the Attorney-General in relation these matters. He will then move on to these following acts as they come before the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Similar provisions which give the Attorney-General power to issue certificates are available in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act section 36, the Privacy Act section 70, the Freedom of Information Act part 4, the Ombudsman Act section 9 and the ADJR Act section 14. In none of those acts is that power reduced or constrained in the manner that this amendment seeks to do. Senator Margetts, you have advised the chamber that you might seek a further amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will not be supporting this amendment. At the outset I thank Senator Murray for not dividing on the previous motion. It does help the way in which the Senate chamber can deal with legislation if, where clearly the numbers are against, the provision to record the vote is used. It has the same effect as having a division basically, except it is seven or eight minutes shorter. But I do thank Senator Murray and the other senators who did not insist on having a division there. It is very helpful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We see the same potential jeopardy in this amendment as in the one that the House of Representatives chose to reject. The fact that the House of Representatives chose to reject that amendment and we moved that the Senate not insist on that amendment shows that we believe that there is an inherent obligation on the executive of whatever political colour to prevent damage to the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7469"> public interest from inappropriate public disclosure of specified categories of matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that in this the government is responsible to the parliament and to the people, and that, if there was an improper public disclosure, then it would be the government&mdash;to put it colloquially&mdash;who would wear it. It would not do and it would not help for the Attorney-General or the government to point their fingers at a committee or a parliament and say it was their fault. From the accountability point of view, clearly the government needs to be responsible for these matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We think the amendment moved by Senator Margetts will, to all intents and purposes, have the same detrimental effect&mdash;cutting in between that accountability&mdash;as the amendment that the House of Representatives has rejected and this Senate has now agreed not to insist upon. I apologise for reading this advice, but I think it is important for it be read into the record. The advice puts the government's view on the legalities and constitutionality of this issue as well as the policy matters:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment would be inserted as subclause (2A) and seeks to prohibit the Attorney-General from issuing a certificate that would prevent inappropriate public disclosure of the kinds of information specified in subclause (1), in circumstances where that information was requested of the Auditor-General by a House of the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not certain that the amendment would constrain a House from requesting information from the Auditor-General through a Committee of that House, with the same prohibitions then still applying to the Attorney-General's powers to prevent inappropriate public disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is noted that section 49 of the Constitution provides for the powers, privileges and immunities of the Parliament to be such as are declared by the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the amendment would appear to leave it open to the Parliament, at some point, to declare that a request for information from the Auditor-General need not depend on a resolution of that House, but could be made by a Committee of that House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government should oppose this amendment as it appears to have the potential to prevent the Executive from carrying out its responsibility to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> intervene where damage to the public interest is at risk by the inappropriate disclosure of information that the section seeks to protect.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I conclude by saying that, ultimately, the Attorney-General is responsible to the parliament for that. I think it is fair to say that the events of the last couple of days&mdash;even though not directly related to these sorts of provisions&mdash;show that, within this great democracy we call Australia, the actions of a minister and particularly the Attorney-General in this case are ultimately accountable. If this power is abused, then the Attorney&hyphen;General and the government will be accountable. If this power is not used properly, in the event that it is required to be used, again we are held accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, if there is an inappropriate public disclosure of information that would put the public interest at risk, it will be the government who wears the responsibility. We are saying that we will accept that responsibility. Future governments will accept that responsibility, just as previous governments have accepted that responsibility both under this package and also under the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act, the Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Act, the Ombudsman Act and the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief because, clearly, the amendment will go down the drain. I commend Senator Margetts for preparing it. It is obvious from what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Ian Campbell) has said in response that the government could see a potential problem if the requests for information came from a committee of the parliament, having regard to the provision in the constitution that the powers and immuni 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ties of the parliament are those that will be decided by the parliament and, until such time, the powers and immunities that are applicable to the British Houses of Parliament will be applicable here&mdash;but that has long since gone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here you have an opportunity to vote for an amendment which does restrict it to a house of parliament. If the matter that was raised by the minister was valid, then all you need to do is put the words `but not by a committee of the parliament' at the end of the amendment moved by Senator Margetts. That is all you need to do to make it perfectly clear that we are not talking about committees of the parliament. I can understand that a situation could arise late at night when only a few members of the committee, not the full committee, were present and you had a request for information carried.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts was trying to get a balance. I think that she has got the right balance. I would have thought that perhaps even the government would have accepted that. They certainly would have accepted, I expect, an amendment which read: `The Attorney&hyphen;General must not issue a certificate in respect of information requested of the Attorney&hyphen;General by a resolution of both houses of parliament.' If they were not going to accept this, I would have thought that that they would have gone for that.

All of the amendments are uncontroversial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Briefly they are: firstly, an amendment to the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963 to allow for simultaneous entry into force of a treaty establishing an international organisation and the regulations relating to that organisation; secondly, an amendment to the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994 to provide diplomatic privileges and immunities to inspectors from the organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and foreign country inspectors carrying out challenge inspections for such weapons in Australia, which would be an extremely unlikely event; thirdly, an amendment to the Nuclear Non&hyphen;Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 to give effect to Australia's obligations under the Nuclear Non&hyphen;Proliferation Treaty (NPT), those under our Safeguards Agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other bilateral arrangements and agreements with various countries; and, fourthly, an amendment to the Passports Act 1938 to add the concept of `recklessness' as a mental element in the offence of making a false statement in a passport application or in support of an application. As an aside, I do not want to trot out examples of recklessness, but I am sure that there are some very lurid and colourful such examples.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have said, the opposition does not wish to debate the majority of the instruments covered by these amendments. However, it would be neglectful of me not to pass some comment on some issues raised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7472"> his second reading speech introducing the bill on 25 June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In that speech, the foreign minister made much of his government's avowed commitment to the international campaign to ban landmines. We are all aware of the total  abhorrence felt by the Australian public in response to the horrific toll that landmines inflict on innocent civilians&mdash;men, women and children&mdash;all over the world. Landmines, originally designed for use against enemy troops, are increasingly being used&mdash;intentionally or otherwise&mdash;against civilian populations. Their use for random and large&hyphen;scale mining of agricultural land has also produced terrible results. The vast majority of landmines laid throughout the world have no use&hyphen;by&hyphen;date and will remain for years, until either they are painstakingly cleared or, as is more often the case, they are accidentally detonated. Each year, these awful weapons kill or maim over 30,000 people, the overwhelming majority of whom are civilian casualties, many of them children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor recognised the imperative of ridding the world of these weapons. We did so in government and we do so now. As former foreign minister Gareth Evans said in February last year:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under Labor, Australia is committed to, and will work towards, a total ban on the manufacture, stockpiling, use and transfer of antipersonnel landmines</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Our support for such a ban was clearly expressed internationally at the Inhumane Weapons Convention Review Conference in Vienna in September 1995. Furthermore, we agreed in the interim&mdash;pending the achievement of total prohibition&mdash;to not produce antipersonnel landmines nor transfer landmines to any other country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an issue to be treated with the utmost seriousness. It is not the place for opportunistic, empty pronouncements. On 15 April last year, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Defence (Mr McLachlan) reaffirmed, on behalf of the present government, Australia's commitment to work for the objective of a global ban. Australia's commitment to this objective was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made absolutely clear by the former government. There is nothing novel in the ministers' reaffirmation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The funding for mine clearance activities announced in recent months by the Minister for Foreign Affairs is to be welcomed as a contribution to that goal, but the other elements of the government's strategy have been&mdash;at best&mdash;a public relations exercise. They do not advance honest dealing with a problem of massive and tragic proportions. Indeed, they are more likely to trivialise it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also on 15 April 1996, the government introduced what was described as a unilateral suspension on the operational use of antipersonnel landmines by the Australian Defence Force. This was announced as a departure from the policy of the former government. This is patently untrue, because the announcement carried a crucial qualification&mdash;the suspension would be reviewed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of substantial deterioration in our strategic circumstances in which Australia's security was under threat and the denial of an APL capability to the ADF would result in additional Australian casualties and damage to vital infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, the government's ban on the operational use of landmines will continue only until such time as their use becomes operationally necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will continue to argue that this offensive charade must be dropped in favour of a genuine demonstration of resolve. While other countries continue to use landmines, the Australian Defence Force continues to train with them. The retention of the existing stockpile against the contingency of future operational use is another matter. Public demolition of the current stockpile, with the exception of the minimal stocks required for ADF training, could be carried out in the presence of the international media and would be a tremendous boost to Australia's campaign for a global ban&mdash;a campaign which has gathered and continues to gather international support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge at this point the contribution to that international campaign made by Princess Diana in campaigning around the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7473"> world for the discontinuance of the use of landmines as international weapons in war and for their removal. That contribution is readily recognised in all the recognition given to her up to and after her most tragic death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The public demolition of our current stockpile before the media would be an international act by Australia which would show our support and which would, I think, attract further international support for this cause. It would be an advance on the position taken by Labor when we were in power. That is only appropriate, given the way the international debate on landmines has moved on from where it was last year. Far from taking this step, the Australian government was one of only five countries&mdash;the others being Ecuador, Japan, Poland and Spain&mdash;to support US efforts to undermine the recent signing of the Oslo treaty.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1997 also fills the category of the previous legislation passed in this place. It is minor, it is technical, but it does have important implications. As indicated by the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) in his second reading speech, this bill allows the Commonwealth to pay money to the states and territories for compensation paid by each of those jurisdictions for historically prohibited weapons, including weapons such as submachine guns, heavy machine&hyphen;guns and other similar weapons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As has been noted, the payment of compo for these weapons was within the original intent of the Australian firearms buyback, and as a result the bill authorises the Attorney to pay moneys to states and territories for purposes consistent with the spirit of the resolutions of the Australian Police Ministers Council. We support the resolutions made by the council and we consequently support the enactment of this bill. Consequent with our support, we have agreed to speedy passage of this bill through the parliament.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7474">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are just two issues I want to raise with the Minister Assisting the Attorney&hyphen;General (Senator Ellison). I put them to him both as minister representing the Attorney and in the knowledge that there is a fair chance that when we come back here later on he may in fact be the Attorney. At the time of the Firearms Appropriation Act 1996, the commitment was made by the government that, if money was left over from the buyback, that money would be paid back to taxpayers through a reduction in the Medicare levy. Though I appreciate that the amount of compensation is yet to be finally determined, I seek a restatement from the government of a commitment to repay any such surplus via the mechanism that was previously announced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second inquiry I have is with respect to a report prepared either by the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department alone or in conjunction with the Australian Council of Police Ministers. Apparently that document was prepared in May of this year. It was advice to the Attorney&hyphen;General as to the degree of compliance of each state and territory within the resolutions agreed to by the Australian Council of Police Ministers. I seek the tabling of a copy of that report; either that report that was prepared in May or an up&hyphen;to&hyphen;date version thereof. I do not know whether you are in a position to do that today. If not, I would like an indication of a commitment to table that report or a commitment to ensure that the matter is addressed by the Attorney.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats have supported the Australian firearms buyback, which ended this week, and we support the National Firearms Program Implementation Bill 1997, which will allow compensation to be paid for firearms which were surrendered under the scheme but which were not expressly banned by the nationwide agreement on firearms regulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are two issues, Minister, which I would be grateful if you could deal with in your response. The first is that I raised a question without notice with you on 4 September in the Senate and I followed up with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a letter on 30 September. You responded fully on 2 October. I think your answer is very helpful. I would appreciate it, though, if you could perhaps deal with those issues and outline the government's intentions as you have outlined to me in your letter, which I am sure you would be content to do. Those issues, for the benefit of the Senate, concern our concern with the possibility of how any funds left over from the scheme will be used. Plainly, if there has been a levy on Medicare and there is an amount of money which is not expended on government buyback, there must be concern as to whether that money will be used for a good purpose. Accordingly, I would appreciate the minister's response on that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second one might be very difficult for you to answer. There seem to be somewhat extravagant claims being made in the media&mdash;I do not know the source of them&mdash;that anything up to a million illegal guns might still be out there in Australia. I do not know how anyone arrives at such a figure, nor do I know how they could imagine there would be such a figure, but I think it would be helpful to the Senate, Minister, if you would indicate whether the government has any feeling or any knowledge as to how many illegal weapons are in Australia outside of the approved and registered scheme. If you wish to take that on notice, I would be happy to have your response at some other time. We would certainly like an indication as to whether there is a major law and order issue brewing in that regard.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, in relation to the questions posed by Senator Bolkus and Senator Murray, I can answer them both with the reply that the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) stands that any surplus funds from the guns buy&hyphen;back scheme will be returned to taxpayers through the Medicare levy system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is possible that, if the amount of money that remains is relatively small, the community might have an expectation that it would be devoted to an appropriate measure rather than 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7475"> subsumed in administration on the return of a modest amount. The government will consider the options in relation to any money left over from the scheme once it becomes clear that most dealers' claims have been finalised. This will, of course, follow a thorough audit of the scheme. I think that answers the questions put by both senators.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the question put by Senator Bolkus about the report he mentioned, it will take some weeks to compile that report. I can give an undertaking that it will be tabled  when it is to hand, but it will take some weeks to get that information together. With respect to the question from Senator Murray as to the number of guns that are still illegally in the community, I will take that on notice in order to do the question justice. We will have that information to you, Senator Murray, as best we can. There was a Newspoll that was conducted recently, but perhaps that is not the only authority as to how many guns there are in the community. It is a matter of vital interest to the government. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This piece of legislation is technical in nature. It is providing for some anomalies that arise in these sorts of schemes. It always happens that there is something which was not accounted for. For instance, there have been cannons, sub&hyphen;machine guns and all sorts of weapons that have been returned, which I do not think were originally envisaged. This bill has to be passed in order to effect compensation for that. I thank the opposition and the Democrats for their support on this bill.</PARA>

Can you confirm that you allowed your department to extend the South Pacific Cruise Lines contract on 20 August despite the fact that you had said, on the previous day in Senate estimates, that you had serious concerns about the contract? In fact, can you confirm you hopelessly dithered for a period of almost three months after initial concerns were raised in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier&hyphen;Mail</EMPHASIS>  of 11 June about the nearly $3 million payment to South Pacific Cruise Lines? Given that it took you 76 days to get your department to ask SPCL to open its books, why shouldn't the Australian public view your inaction as a gross dereliction of duty?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="7475" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Minister for Justice" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Faulkner for a God&hyphen;given question. I just cannot believe that Senator Faulkner is so stupid as to open himself up for yet another knock on the glass jaw.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question is: did I ignore some advice about William Angliss? The answer to that is no. Some advice on William Angliss was in some material provided to my office but not in connection with the contract being made with SPCL. Yesterday's hearing absolutely confirmed this just in the initial stages&mdash;we did not need to waste 10&half; hours of taxpayers' time and money&mdash;with the initial statement outlined by the secretary to the department indicating that the delegations to make the contract were exercised by them&mdash;that is, officers in the department&mdash;without recourse to the minister or her office. We took 10&half; hours trawling over every little bit of paper we could, looking for the name William Angliss, saying that that must mean that I knew something about SPCL and, in the end, getting nowhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Did I agree that the department could extend the contract with SPCL? Senator Faulkner asked this question last night and clearly he was not happy with the answer, so I should take the opportunity to explain for senators who were not there last night the proposition that Senator Faulkner was actually putting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The proposition he was actually putting was this: once the money had been paid over and the contract had not been satisfactorily com 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7476"> pleted, the question, from the department's point of view, is, will we allow them more time to complete, even though we are not paying any more money? Senator Faulkner seems to think that what the department should have said is, `No, don't let them complete. We are not paying any more money anyway, but don't let them complete.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a bit like the analogy I used last night at the estimates committee. If you have a contract for an extension to your house and the builder does not complete it on time, but you have paid all the money, are you serious ly going to say to the builder if he offers to complete without requiring any more money, `No, I don't want you to complete. Even though I am not giving you any more money, I still don't want you to complete'?  What a ludicrous proposition that you put forward, Senator Faulkner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You were an embarrassment to the Senate last night and your question now is an embarrassment to the people behind you; no more `Ho, ho's' today from those behind you. You got that clear as a bell last night&mdash;everyone understands about having a contract completed without paying more money&mdash;but you are such a sucker that you have to come in here and ask the question again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Faulkner went on to purport that somehow&mdash;and this is what he is desperate to show&mdash;my office or myself in some way inadequately managed this issue once we found out about it. If you were at the estimates committee last night, Madam President, what you would have found is that both I and my office first became aware of a contract between the department and SPCL, South Pacific Cruise Lines, after the contract had been made and after the money had been paid over; and that within days&mdash;and I am not using days to cover weeks and months&mdash;my office had requested a brief on that matter, had got some information from the Brisbane area office, had been assured that financial checks had been made and that no irregularities had occurred, and had asked for a subsequent and further brief from the national office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So I do not know whether Senator Faulkner is in dreamland, incompetent, unable to

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. I understand that tenders have now closed for the employment services market. Will the minister indicate the breadth of interest in our reforms from the range of potential providers for this exciting new market? How does the government's competitive tendering process for the delivery of employment services compare with the processes under the former government under the so-called Working Nation program?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="7477" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Minister for Justice" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Tierney for his question and for his patience last night in putting up with 10&half; hours of badgering from the union bullyboys coming along trying to get the story they wanted when it was not there. Yes, the tenders have closed. We have received just over 1,000 packages containing about 5,000 tenders, which cover the 29 employment regions throughout Australia. That means there is no region with fewer than 20 tenders. When you consider that the requirement I am looking for is a minimum of five suppliers in each region and that there is no region with fewer than 20 tenders, we can say that this is a very positive vote of confidence in the government's new employment services market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This employment services market, which I referred to in the earlier question, shifts away from Working Nation to tendering for contracts, to competition, to transparency and to financial checks and conformance&mdash;almost none of which happened regularly under Working Nation contracts. So there was a very big vote of confidence in our new system, which will be operating fully in May next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been moving towards that system since the budget of 1996 when we announced our changes. We are still in a transition zone. We still have some remnants of the old style Working Nation contracts&mdash;less than there were but still a few. That was a system in contrast, a system which allowed the marginal Labor seats of Page and Richmond&mdash;remember the members, Harry Woods and Neville Newell&mdash;to have $24 million tipped into 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> them; $3 million of that for an advertising campaign. They did not want to call it the `Let's save Harry Woods and Neville Newell campaign' so they called it the Northern Rivers new work opportunity project. But, nonetheless, $24 million of hard earned taxpayers' money was poured down the drain because that contract was an absolute failure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was another one called the `Let's save Bob Horne campaign' which went under the guise of the jobs north new work opportunity&mdash;in code for people who do not know what to look for. That had $14 million tipped into it. That is what you got under the old system when you did not have to go to tendering, when you did not have to have financial checks, when you looked after your mates, as those opposite did so well&mdash;$14 million tipped into the `Save Bob Horne campaign' in Paterson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you are not only worried about looking after your members, you can pop over to the Australian Education Union and see if you can tip $17 million into it&mdash;but with no outcome requirement, no real check on outcomes, just tip the money in. I must remind myself to take a quick look after question time to see if there are any political donations from that union.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The SPCL contract was the subject of scrutiny at Senate estimates yesterday. It is one of the last Working Nation style contracts. Labor certainly did not want to compare the performance of the SPCL contract against Working Nation contracts. I have the opportunity to tell you what happened yesterday when we tried to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know already that the SPCL contract, as dissatisfied as I am with it, already has a higher outcome achievement than most of the Working Nation contracts. We have outcomes in jobs, and it has only been a couple of weeks since the program finished. Working Nation projects were given 13 weeks. We are not up to 13 weeks and we will have much better outcomes by the time we get to that point.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Last week the Ombudsman's annual report came out, and it blamed the 43 per cent increase in complaints about Austudy on the decision by the government to cut operational funding for DEETYA as well as the complexity of the Austudy actual means test. Does the minister agree with the Ombudsman's report that the AMT is too complicated, or does the minister believe that students should continue to answer between 280 and 320 questions about personal income and expenditure in order to comply? Does the minister accept the Ombudsman's claims that the funding cuts to DEETYA and the complexity of the AMT are responsible for the problems and the failings of Austudy this year?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Stott Despoja for her question. Senator, I do not think it is possible to say, `I agree completely with everything in the report' or `I disagree completely with everything in the report' because there might be some things that I agree with and some things that I do not agree with. It is important to understand this: the report is a snapshot of history that no longer reflects the current situation with respect to Austudy. The Austudy actual means test is designed to prevent individuals with very complex arrangements who minimise their tax liabilities from claiming benefits. Any measure designed to catch people who, through the use of well paid accountants and lawyers operating through trusts, partnerships 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7483"> and companies, seek to minimise their taxable income and assets will necessarily be at a level of complexity. It is not possible to produce a yes-no completely simple form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator, as you know, when it became clear in February this year that there were problems with the administration of the AMT, we announced a streamlining of administration to fix the problem. Within a week or so, students at that point who had lost benefits began to receive payments. It is a pity&mdash;and I do not want to put it any higher than that&mdash;that the Ombudsman's report does not adequately acknowledge three key initiatives that we have taken to address the problems that it draws attention to. I do not dispute that there were problems there and that it is appropriate for the Ombudsman to report them, but it might be equally handy if some of the things that the government was doing to address problems had been referred to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There was an announcement of a review of the AMT on 24 June this year to identify  anomalies in the test and make improvements. I announced this morning, Senator, as you may well be aware, the result of that inquiry, which will be very positive for AMT applicants and significantly streamlined from last year. It might equally be helpful if the Ombudsman had bothered to mention to people who have an interest in these matters the government's key initiative to combine Austudy and other benefits, to streamline them into a youth allowance. That streamlining in itself will be of some benefit, with about 70,000 students living away from home then being eligible to receive rent assistance under the youth allowance. It would also be helpful to mention that Centrelink&mdash;the combining of the shop&hyphen;front services of the Commonwealth Employment Service and Department of Social Security&mdash;would provide an improved and streamlined service delivery to students.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It mighty equally be fair to point out that the Ombudsman's report is largely based on a proportion of complaints. It is necessary that people understand that. It is not a general survey across the board of Austudy applicants but is a comment, as I understand it, on responses that were complaints. It is like 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> taking one portion of the Austudy population that complained and putting a spotlight on it. So necessarily the report gives a much darker picture than what the reality is.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone), to a question without notice asked by Senator Faulkner today, relating to a contract betwen the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and South Pacific Cruise Lines Limited.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The `ship of fools' issue is the most recent in a very long line of ministerial foul-ups from Senator Vanstone. It has been a sorry saga of ministerial incompetence from Senator Vanstone from day one. Yesterday, we had the absurd spectacle of government senators trying to protect Senator Vanstone. It was a desperate attempt to cover up the South  Pacific Cruise Lines issue by derailing a Senate estimates committee hearing. They did this by bringing in extraneous issues, irrelevant issues, and by trying to waste the time of that committee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, eventually, the truth had to come out. The truth is this: Senator Vanstone has fouled up again in the administration of her portfolio. That is the story. That is the reason that I predict Senator Vanstone will be losing her job tomorrow. We have seen the last in the Australian Senate of Senator Vanstone as Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone said she was aware of the South Pacific Cruise Lines fiasco on 11 and 12 June. But many other issues relating to this particular matter came across Senator Vanstone's desk. On 30 April, she got a drop copy of a brief that went to Dr Kemp on the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> William Angliss 2000 project. Now, of course, that was not signed off by Senator Vanstone&mdash;she does not do that; that was signed off by a departmental liaison officer in her office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone received several letters from Liberal members of parliament: from her colleague Mr Jull on 7 May and from her colleague Mr Slipper on 22 May. She did nothing about those letters. She got a ministerial brief on the issues that Mr Jull raised on 16 May. That was not signed. In fact, Senator Vanstone has said it was not even seen by her&mdash;a ministerial brief to her. She did nothing about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After the matter became public on 11 June&mdash;when she claims she was made aware of media reports&mdash;she got two briefs from the DEETYA Queensland central area office. She did nothing about them. There were consistent media reports and publicity about the South Pacific Cruise Lines issue; she did nothing about them. The matter was debated ad nauseam in the Queensland parliament. Senator Vanstone did nothing about it. She received a number of possible parliamentary questions and question time briefs from her department over those weeks; she did nothing about them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She was asked questions in the Senate estimates committee hearing on 19 August. Many serious issues were raised, particularly by my colleagues Senator Chris Evans and Senator O'Brien. She did nothing about those issues that were raised at the Senate estimates committee hearing. In fact, the next day, as responsible minister, she oversaw her department extending the contract with these same shonky SPCL operators. Questions were also asked by Senator O'Brien in the chamber right here on 27 and 28 August this year. She did nothing about the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So with bad press after bad press and media reports about the shonky operators of this cruise line company and their mafia links, what did Senator Vanstone do when she read these reports? She did nothing. In fact, it was only on 26 August that she first raised the issue with the secretary of her department. It is extraordinary that it took the minister 76 days or 11 weeks, if you like, after she 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7489"> became aware of the matter&mdash;according to her, although we know she was aware of it a lot longer; it took her that long to raise the issue with her departmental secretary. Then she wrote to her departmental secretary, Mr Sedgwick, on 3 September; she had the hide to write to him and complain that nothing was being done by her department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This minister did nothing. Her office did nothing. She did not, of course, exercise her ministerial responsibilities. She claims that she asked the Auditor-General to act, but only on 12 September. It is a pathetic performance from a minister who, for the last time, has presented in this chamber as Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs.

It was actually 13&half; hours of wasted time of the Senate estimates committee and of wasted time of senior public servants. They were given all the information  by the minister.

It was an enormous waste of the Senate's time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Following that, having wasted so much time, what did those opposite want to do? They decided, `We'll send it off to a Senate references committee and we'll go around and collect evidence on this and waste even more 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> time and money.' That was put up this morning. I note that it was deferred, probably because there was no support for such a silly proposition. That was apparent to anyone who sat and listened last night&mdash;if you did not fall asleep watching the TV&mdash;through this enormously boring and wasteful time as we went through this particular matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The procedures that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) has followed on this matter are completely straightforward. She was concerned about the matter and has sent it off to the Auditor&hyphen;General for a full report so that she will have the correct information base on this matter to provide the answers for the Senate. But those opposite could not wait for that; they had to do a bit of grandstanding in the meantime.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that Senator Tierney does not share our concern at the waste of $2.2 million of taxpayers money or how the hopes of 340 long&hyphen;term unemployed people have been cruelly crushed by the government's failure to be able to deliver jobs to them at the end of the training scheme that they undertook. We think it is a serious matter and that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) and those opposite ought to take a bit more interest and show a bit more concern about this issue. It is one of the great financial disasters that this government has presided over. It is a big human disaster too, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in the sense of its impact on those 340 people who worked hard to qualify for what they thought was a job on a cruise liner. The whole thing came to nothing. Despite what the minister asserted today in question time, in fact not one of those people got a job with the cruise line because the cruise line that was supposed to eventuate was operated by a bunch of crooks who never had a ship or any financial understanding of the industry. In fact, they were discharged bankrupts. These are the persons that the department entered into a contract with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a very serious matter. It is a major financial fiasco and the department has to take a lot of the blame. But the process is far from over. At estimates last night we investigated what we could but, because the Auditor&hyphen;General has been required to report on the process, because there are legal proceedings before the courts in terms of suing the people the department entered into contracts with, and because there was a range of questions at estimates taken on notice, this process is far from over. It will continue to hound the minister until she is relieved of her duties. I suspect that that will be a matter of days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are serious issues that the department has to answer. It was the largest ever TEP project undertaken with a single employer and the outcome was clearly a complete disaster. A range of problems that need to be examined inside the department has already been identified. One of those that I would like to get to grips with is this push by the minister and senior officers to get departmental officers to spend project funds by the end of the financial year. It is quite clear from all the documentation that the junior officers were under enormous pressure to spend the project funds by the end of the financial year. The government had no policy on employment; it had no employment program strategy. At the end of the year when it suddenly realised that it had done nothing to help create jobs to solve unemployment the officers were told, `Spend the money, quick.' So they spent almost 10 per cent of their budget for TEP in one effort. They gave it to some shonky employer and said, `Quick, give us 340 jobs&mdash;or at least 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7491"> make it look like we have 340 jobs.' But there was not one job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The real question that hangs over all this is: why didn't the minister do anything? She has become known as the Marie Celeste of the government because this is an utter disaster. She first knew on 11 June. She had seen the press. It was then raised in estimates and she was advised by the department. But, from 11 June, do you know how long it took her to do anything? Not till 3 September did she finally take decisive action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do you know what she did? She wrote to her department's secretary and said, `Don't blame me. I only work here. When this hits the fan, I wasn't there.' That was the action she took. She did not seek legal advice. She did not seek advice about how to get us out of the mess. She did not seek advice about how to protect $2.2 million of the taxpayers' money and she did not seek advice about how to get 340 people jobs. She just made sure that, when it hit the fan, she was not anywhere to be seen. That has been her position ever since.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So she dropped the department in it, saying, `It's nothing to do with me. I'm the captain of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Marie Celeste</EMPHASIS>.' When they found the ship floating, the crew was still on board but there was no captain. The captain had abandoned ship. The minister is not to be found. She just says to her department, `It's not my fault. You're going to have to wear this one.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Had she even spoken to the departmental secretary? It was revealed last night in estimates that she had not even had a conversation with him. That is how concerned she was about these 340 people. That is how concerned she was about $2.2 million being handed over to spivs, with no financial checks at all. She did not bother to ask.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator O'Brien and I raised it with her on 19 August in estimates, after it had been all through the papers in Queensland for weeks. She was not able to help us with any information. She did not take any action then or afterwards. She has done nothing to protect the financial position of the Commonwealth, she has done nothing to protect the interests

She does delegate things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is more, the guidelines under which this scheme operated were tightened guidelines from the Working Nation program which used to be administered by Messrs Beazley and Crean. Under Working Nation&mdash;Senator Tierney has already pointed this out to us&mdash;under your guidelines, the most outrageous things happened. The trade union movement was given literally millions of dollars for these Working Nation schemes and, when accountability came into the question, there was no accountability on those: `We're dealing with trade unions; they are our mates. How dare you think there might be an accountability process when we deliver millions of dollars to our mates in the trade union movement. Of course we would not have accountability processes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is we do have accountability processes now. The error that occurred has been recognised by the department and acknowledged by the department. The department has taken responsibility for it. Unlike the former government, when occasions like this arise,  we say, `This is unacceptable, and we will ensure that it does not happen again.' Because of that sort of financial control&mdash;when mistakes like this occur, we fix them up immediately&mdash;we are going to have a budget surplus at the end of our term, unlike Senator O'Brien's government's record of a $10.3 billion deficit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Howard government has had a shocking first 18 months in office. It has lost five ministers, perhaps several others will not see out the weekend, and the minister who has set the pace on incompetence and arrogance is, of course, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the minister who oversaw the Austudy fiasco that disadvantaged thousands of people; who managed to alienate everyone in the higher education sector; who led the charge in the ERC to slash her own budget at a time of rising unemployment, and then invented the Wright family in an attempt to justify her actions. This minister promoted the concept of job insecurity as a means of fixing unemployment and announced that her new policy of job creation was to look to the heavens. And now we have the South Pacific Cruise Lines fiasco. The Senate should be aware that I have only listed the highlights and in five minutes I cannot possibly do justice to the absolute shambles that this minister's portfolio is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We looked at this issue over about 10&half; hours. About four of those were taken up with inane questions which had no relevance to the terms of reference that the Senate inquiry was given. That time was taken up on behalf of the government to try to obscure the real issue. When we finally got down to finding out what took place and going through the myriad of documents&mdash;we had three large three&hyphen;inch thick folders of papers setting out the obscure documentation on this matter&mdash;what did we find? Briefs that went to the minister's office, not signed off. `I've never seen them,' said the minister. The briefs that the minister had. `Oh yes, I've seen those. I think I saw them on the 12th, or maybe it was the 13th. I don't really know.' And then, `What did you do, Minister?' `I think someone asked for a brief.' `Did you follow it up?' `I think it was followed up a lot.'</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7493">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you asked the department, the response was, `Yes. We think we remember that we were asked for a brief.' How lacking in diligence is either the minister or her office if she seriously wanted a brief from her department&mdash;she is telling us she wanted a brief from her department&mdash;and she could not get it for 11 weeks. What did she do? Did she commit one thing to paper? Did she say, `Look, I've got to have a brief. Let's get a memo out. At least get it on paper.' Not a word. What did the minister do? Eleven weeks later, when it became clear to everyone and became clear to the minister&mdash;it was clear to us beforehand&mdash;that this was a project which had `Unacceptable risk' written all over it, the minister wrote the letter to her departmental secretary and said, `Look, this is all your fault. This is not my fault. I don't want to have a part of this.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we go back to the first written advice that the minister owns up to having read, what do we see? This is a minister&mdash;a legally qualified person, a minister of the Crown, a cabinet minister&mdash;who has got a contract which is the subject of press speculation, that has been let to people who have a very poor financial record in terms of their corporate behaviour and their personal behaviour. This is an area where $2.2 million has been given to these people. This is an area where there is a contract, and the minister is told, effectively, `There are provisions in the contract to check where the money is, and perhaps there are provisions in the contract which allow us to monitor performance and terminate the contract.' Does the minister&mdash;this legally qualified minister of the Crown, a cabinet  minister&mdash;seek legal advice? Does the minister say, `Get me an advice. Let me see what our position is.'? No; the minister did nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say that that inaction in itself was a gross dereliction of duty. If the minister cannot see that, what hope have we got for this minister administering a portfolio of billions of dollars? It might only be $2.2 million in her terms, but it is an important example of the incompetence of this minister, a minister lacking diligence. This minister

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Senator Conroy, you might be interested&mdash;because you were not in the Senate at this time and neither was I&mdash;to look back a little bit at Labor's record on employment. Labor destroyed 420,000 full&hyphen;time jobs during the recession we had to have. Full&hyphen;time employment fell from 6.2 million in July 1990 to 5.8 million in November 1992&mdash;313,000 men lost full&hyphen;time work and one can only wonder how many families lost their only breadwinner as a result of Labor's recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the nub: the number of young people with full&hyphen;time jobs was halved during Labor's administration. Full&hyphen;time youth employment fell by approximately 240,000 from 465,000 in June 1989 to 227,000 in March 1994. Long&hyphen;term unemployment trebled during the worst recession this country has had since the 1930s Depression. Long&hyphen;term unemployment increased from 140,000 in November 1989 to 349,000 in July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment averaged 8.7 per cent during Labor's 13 years in government. This government has only had 18 months. It has done a lot, of course, to fix the fundamentals. The effect of interest rate cuts and industrial relations changes can only assist to get the country back to work and to actually improve employment. In addition to fixing the fundamentals, the government has introduced specific employment initiatives so that there are apprenticeships and traineeships, such as in the green corps program and the work for the dole program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work for the dole program is important in stopping the isolation of young people. It will allow them to get some skills and relevant training to get back into the work force.  Under <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS>, which was a Labor initiative, job placement rates were less than 30 per cent. After 18 months in office, this government has actually put in place some policy initiatives and fixed the economic fundamentals so that surely we will soon see some real assistance for jobs.

When Mr Jull deliberately misled the parliament and deliberately covered up the rorting of government ministers while trying to, at the same time, very quickly say that a few members of the Labor Party had to pay back travel allowances that had been legally claimed, was there any move by this mob against him?

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">I assert to the Senate that each one of my Hobart TA claims meets the requirements as specified in the Department of Administrative Services guidelines.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say that the guidelines set rates for capital city claims. What we have just been told by Senator Faulkner is that he now realises that what has been on the public record is totally and utterly misleading. They somehow claim that if you press the wrong button, you do not find out what the DAS guidelines are or whether there are any DAS guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, you have Senator Ray getting up here and saying, `You are absolutely wrong; you don't understand. How could you possibly believe what you are saying when the DAS guidelines say the following? How could Ruddock and Kemp be so ignorant of the fact when quoting the ABS definition?' In other words, all of that is not operative any more because now we are told that, in fact, they got it wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If they got it wrong and Senator Sherry got it wrong because he did not even bother to find out whether there were any DAS guidelines in relation to TA, Senator Sherry's statement of yesterday is manifestly incorrect. Senator Faulkner has just pleaded guilty on his behalf, which immediately raises the question of when Senator Sherry first knew about this and why he did not immediately come into this chamber and explain himself. Once again, he is totally contemptuous of the processes of the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A press release was put out by Mr Ruddock. Your attention has been well and truly drawn to this. Presumably, you are the one who gave the information to Mr Beazley. You are the one who gave the information to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7497"> Senator Ray. You are the one who got it fundamentally wrong. No-one would ever have known that it was wrong until we actually went back to the source and did the very thing Senator Ray said. He said, `Why don't you go back and check the DAS guidelines?' We have and there aren't any. Yet Senator Ray gets up and says that anyone who disagreed with him is completely wrong. You now come in here and admit that there are no such rules that any capital city definition applies to car allowances. Why on earth you would not go back and check defies belief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The much more important and much more serious question is: when did you find out that you were wrong? Why did you not get up and make a statement? You have had all morning. You had an opportunity in taking note of answers to get up and  explain yourself. You simply think, as you tried to do on the Mike Jeffreys show, that you can talk all this away and pretend it is another trivial little political exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is that this is a very serious issue because you had the opportunity to state your position. You put it on the record yesterday and hoped no-one would notice. Well, of course, they have noticed. You have been absolutely exposed. Your explanation is fundamentally wrong and Senator Faulkner has now conceded that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will be very interested to hear Senator Sherry's explanation on this matter. Presumably, he is now going to say that he did not bother to make any inquiries. We have not yet heard whether the so-called confirmation from DAS three and a half years ago resulted in any written documentation&mdash;in other words, whether any staff member or you took a file note, whether there is anything in DAS recording any such matter, whether you have  any letter to that effect or whether you are simply verballing DAS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, you have not given any evidence at all that you made any attempt to find out what the DAS rules are in relation to TA. You simply come in here and blithely assert that there are guidelines that get you off the hook because they give this tortuous 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> definition that includes Opossum Bay  when you and I know full well that Opossum Bay has to be one of the sleepiest hollows in Australia. It has nothing at all to do with a capital city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is the most extraordinary contorted exercise to try to claim that you are entitled to the sort of money you have claimed. You chalk up about $20,000 in Comcar just to get there and back when you could easily have stayed in Hobart. But you were not prepared to pay for that. No, you had to travel all that distance for hours and hours simply to find rent free accommodation. To cover all that up, you blithely get up and assert that there are DAS guidelines when there are not. I want to know what your explanation is because you have not given one as yet. Unless you do, you deserve not only to be censured by this parliament but you ought to do the decent thing and fall on your sword.</PARA></SPEECH>

Instead, we have a motion to dock a senator who has come in with a definition of what a capital city is.

It is a great honour that I rise in this place here today to address all of you; it is a great honour that I represent the state of South Australia; and it is a great honour that I represent the Australian Labor Party in this very important chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just by way of background, some 37 or so years ago, my family came to this country. I want to make that one of the first points here because much has been said in the course of this year about migration to Australia. Much has been made of political points about migration. There are a number of senators in here who I am sure were born overseas like me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My father and mother came here for a better life in 1959, and they paid the statutory fee of 10 quid. They were known&mdash;amongst other things&mdash;as 10&hyphen;quid tourists. Some years ago when I was doorknocking in my former state Labor electorate and somebody offered me the 10 quid to go home when I made that point, I pointed out that, unfortunately for them, they got me for nothing. In fact, my father and mother had to pay the 10 quid. I came absolutely free and I have no intentions of leaving.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My family came to Australia and saw this as their home. They never referred to the old country as home; they never saw it that way. They transported themselves and their lives, and were working members of this community for the whole of their lives. Unfortunately, they are not here with us today. It is a great pity that that is the case. They were literally working-class people, of largely Irish stock, who had a life in England for some years before they came here to Australia. I think it would have been nice if they could have been here today to see that, here in Australia, we have a society where people can get into forums such as this. It is on that point that I want to turn now to the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ALP has been my life for many years. I added it up the other day and I think I have been to about 29 conferences. I cannot remember how many campaigns I have been to and I cannot remember all of the other activities that I have been involved in&mdash;but it is a large part of my life and that of my family. I am grateful in particular to the South Australian Labor Party who gave me preselection for a state seat in South Australia, which I represented for two parliaments and have only recently left, and who then gave me preselection for the Australian Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to single out our national secretary, Gary Gray, who is a long&hyphen;term friend of mine, for all of the support, loyalty and friendship that he has given me over those years. Similarly, I wish to point out that Don Farrell from the SDA in South Australia has, I am pleased to say, been a great friend of mine over many years. Don, I owe you a great deal and I will constantly be in your debt. There are other people I wish to mention here this afternoon. Terry Cameron is the former state secretary and now a member of the Legislative Council of South Australia. Terry and I have had many years together in political life. Indeed, it is rather a shame that we are now separated because we sit in different parliaments but I am sure that over many years we will still be very close friends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Robert Ray is one of those people whom you remember, for all sorts of reasons, and he has been a great friend of mine. I want to thank him for his mateship and his support over many years. Dominic Foreman has, as we have heard today, come back to this chamber. He is only here for a short time. I am glad that he is in the audience now so that I can make some of the comments that I made the other night in the valedictory for Dominic. I owe Dominic a great deal. When he had his farewell down in his electorate office some weeks ago there were a large number of people there who had got their political start with encouragement from Dominic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dominic is an intensely private man. I think everybody in here knows that. The one great thing about Dominic is that he encouraged others&mdash;not one or two, but lots of them. I was particularly pleased to see at his farewell 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7508"> down at the electorate office in Glenelg a large number of young Labor members whom Dominic had supported over many years. Naturally, I hope he and his wife, Shirley, have a long and very happy retirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Dominic stayed on here longer than I think he would have liked to have done. That is largely my fault because once I, as a serving state MP, gained preselection for this particular position, Dominic wanted to ensure that the taxpayers of South Australia did not have to pay the fee for an unnecessary by-election. Where that is concerned I think it is for us to say thank you to him on behalf of those taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the subject of smooth transitions, I also want to thank the South Australian government. Before my colleagues get worried, I will not be doing it again. But at least in this instance they recognised the necessity to ensure that we had a full Senate representation, and they did not make that an issue during the election campaign. The South Australian Attorney&hyphen;General, Trevor Griffin, did his utmost&mdash;and certainly succeeded&mdash;to ensure that the vacancy created here was filled within something like 72 hours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am proud to say that my wife, Davina, and my four children, Alexander, Liam, Daniel and Kristian, have given me full support. We had many discussions about whether it was a wise idea for me as a father of four children, particularly young children, to be coming over here, with all of the necessary travel demands in this job. But they are all very happy for me to come and sit in this place. They understand the honour of it. By the way, that was the gang that was here last week. The baby found it very hard to restrain himself up there in the gallery. It is a standing joke that he always does that, so I apologise to the Senate. I know that next time I bring him he will probably do exactly the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia as a nation has made a number of great strides since World War II. One of those strides is, as we were saying before, migration and the number of migrants who have come to this country and enriched the social fabric. I want to make it absolutely crystal clear here where I stand on this issue. It is essential that we understand that those migrants who have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> come here, all of whom in my view have made an enormous success of their contribution to this country, have brought some parts of their own culture and they have accepted our ways of life here. They have made contemporary Australia what it is today and it is something that we can be proud of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have seen the various waves of migration. Some 37 years ago it was predominantly Anglo&hyphen;Saxon, Italian and Greek. Today we have a large number of Asian migrants who have come to this country. I was recently driving around the suburbs of one of the major cities in this country and it occurred to me how much this country has changed in the last 30 or so years. I think it has changed very much for the better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I represent the state of South Australia, which is a small regional economy. Some points need to be made about that. One of the great things about South Australia is its lifestyle. One of the problems that we have experienced, particularly over the last 20 to 30 years, is that our share of the national cake is declining. We are seeing head offices move to other states. We have seen our share of the population shrink from 10 per cent to a current figure of 8.2 per cent, and there are projections that it will go down possibly as low as six per cent in the not too far distant future. Areas such as South Australia, and Adelaide in particular, where some four&hyphen;fifths of the population live, need special policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a speech of special pleading for my home state, because I do not believe that what South Australia needs is welfare. I do not believe it needs the welfare mentality. What it needs, and what our party is committed to, is a series of policies which will underpin some of the great advantages that this state has. It is one of the cheapest, cost&hyphen;effective states in Australia within which to set up business. It has a great education system. It has a good, cheap, friendly lifestyle that has been commented on by many people around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we need to do for regional economies such as South Australia and the many others around this great nation is to understand that their special needs are something that we have to legislate for in this place and the other 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7509"> place. We need to encourage investment and diversity not only in South Australia but also in other regions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make a couple of other comments about the South Australia that I know. During debate in here the other day one senator&mdash;and now is not the time to go into who it was&mdash;made the comment, when speaking of the submarine project, that it was a good example of the pork barrel. I will not take that debate up here now with the good senator, but I will make a couple of points about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">South Australia has done an excellent job with the submarine project. That project has my full support because I recognise that the Australian Navy will only have a blue water capacity if we have an effective arm in the submarine service. We cannot afford the items of military hardware which other countries can deploy: large aircraft carriers and a number of surface ships which can defend themselves at sea and constitute an effective striking force. For all of my life&mdash;and that, I suspect, of my children&mdash;the submarine force will be the principal striking force for the Royal Australian Navy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the end of the day the submarine project has been done well in South Australia. I am sure that there are many people who will argue that we will need more submarines. That is an argument I am not going to get into here now, but I think South Australia does a great job with all its defence contracts and all its work. It is essential that we&mdash;here and in the other place&mdash;understand that, for defence preparedness in this country, we must identify and develop our defence related industries, because this is a changing world. It has changed dramatically in the last nine years or so, and I think it has become a much less safe world. I will have more to say about that when the appropriate debates come up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it would be inappropriate for me not to mention here that I am a member of a trade union. I have been a member of a trade union for many years and I will continue to be a member of a trade union. My father instilled a number of things in me. One was never to gamble and the other was to become a member of the union. My mother was quite happy for me to be in a union but she had the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> opposite view on gambling&mdash;she used to like putting a few bob on the gee&hyphen;gees. At the end of the day my father won out in both those instances. One of the things he was most proud of was his union ticket, which he had until the day he retired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I make no apology that we on this side of the chamber are supporting the trade unions. We understand that they have played a historic role not only in Australia but in other Western democracies. Indeed, it is interesting to see the role that they are now playing in the emerging economies of the world. They are fighting not only for industrial rights but for political rights as well, as they did&mdash;traditionally and historically&mdash;both here in Australia and in Britain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other issues which, if I had the time, I would discuss. One of those is the very important question&mdash;one of the most significant before us today&mdash;of global warming. When there is such a world of opportunity out there for us to understand that targeted greenhouse reductions are absolutely essential, I cannot understand how the government has got itself into the corner it is in. Indeed, even if we do not go down the targeted greenhouse reduction road, I suspect the rest of the world will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before everybody here accuses me of being a total greenie, I should also make it crystal clear that, although I am one on all these sorts of issues, I believe that nuclear energy also has a place in the reduction of carbon emissions.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">As I am the first person to speak so soon after Senator Quirke's first speech, I would like to congratulate him very much on what I thought was an excellent first speech. I think you can certainly tell that he was an apt and able state politician and parliamentarian. Welcome to the Senate, Senator Quirke, and congratulations on your first speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This general business motion seeks to highlight the parlous situation with regard to unemployment in Australia. It highlights that we still have an unemployment rate of 8.7 per cent. It highlights that in fact the Australian workers' confidence in the labour market, which is evidenced in the participation rate of 62.9 per cent, is the lowest in three years. We reject utterly the comments by Senator Vanstone that Australia needs a freer labour market and lessened job security to reduce unemployment. We also call on the government to reverse what is clearly a low skill, low wage, low job security approach and actually provide some direction that provides security for Australians.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us have a look at what the current situation is with regard to unemployment in this country. As the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, herself put it, it is flat. I think that Senator Vanstone, uncharacteristically, was understating the difficulty when she said it was flat, but it is flat, stagnant and going down at 8.7 per cent. What was unemployment when the Prime Minister, John Howard, first came to office? It was 8.4 per cent. So we have actually had an increase of 0.3 per cent in the term of this government. The participation rate, as I indicated before, is currently at 62.9 per cent, which is the lowest in three years. It is a drop of a full percentage point. So people are dropping out of the labour market. That means that over the last year close to 150,000 people have dropped out of the labour market; they have just given up and dropped out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Long&hyphen;term unemployment has reached a 28&hyphen;month high and is now at 247,700&mdash;the highest since April 1995. Since the first Howard budget in August 1996, we have seen 60,000 full&hyphen;time jobs gone&mdash;lost, disappeared. That is 60,000 full&hyphen;time jobs gone. We have lost 38,200 jobs in one month alone, which was August 1997, this year. Of this figure, 37,500 were full&hyphen;time jobs. And, for the first time ever in Australia's history, in the last month we had negative growth in employment without there being a recession. This is a time when the government says that the economic fundamentals are right. Why is it then that, for the first time in our history outside a recession, in the last month we had negative employment growth? You have got growth above the line and you have got the unemployment rate below the line, negative. That is the situation we are currently faced with. This is appalling. This is a crisis, and this is something that I think Senator Vanstone has failed utterly to address.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn to some of Senator Vanstone's more quotable quotes, including her most recent and, might I suggest, ill&hyphen;fated excursions into industry relations. As people in this chamber would be aware, industry relations is something we know quite a lot about; in fact, members opposite have often pointed this out. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7511"> Industry relations is one of our areas, amongst many others. Unfortunately, it is not one of Senator Vanstone's areas. When she, I thought quite stupidly, commenced her excursion into industry relations the other day in the Senate, she actually talked about the unfair dismissal provisions. I was unable, for various reasons, to respond on that occasion, so I would like now to make the point I would have made then. Senator Vanstone repeatedly in question time yesterday said, `We have to reform your unfair dismissal laws; we have got to get rid of your unfair dismissal laws; we have got to substantially reduce the impact of your unfair dismissal laws.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I say to Senator Vanstone is: get with it. This government actually completely overhauled the industrial relations system recently. That came into effect on 1 January this year. What this government is talking about with regard to unfair dismissal is not our unfair dismissal laws; it is her unfair dismissal laws. That is what she is talking about with regard to amendment. For goodness sake, having commenced an ill&hyphen;fated excursion into industrial relations, can't the employment minister get her facts right? It is not our unfair dismissal laws; it is the government's unfair dismissal laws. Incidentally, at the time the government did not talk about an exemption with regard to small business, the impact of which will be that one&hyphen;third of the Australian work force will have no protection whatsoever. And Senator Vanstone talks about lessened job security. I can tell you that that is precisely what one&hyphen;third of Australian workers are going to get if the government's unfair dismissal laws are amended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at this. The Workplace Relations Act has only been in since 1 January and already the government is saying it is not working with regard to unfair dismissal and it is seeking an exemption for small business. The government is not even prepared to give its own provisions time to work. The government is not even prepared to say to Senator Vanstone, `Hang on there. Before you start making stupid comments on industrial relations, let's give the new act time to work.' 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> No, we have got Senator Vanstone, fresh from a labour ministers conference, coming back full of energy and going into an area that she knows nothing about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us come to her own areas. I do not think Senator Vanstone knows very much about her own areas either. Let us look again at some of her more quotable quotes, and there are many. I have to say I had to go through and pick some personal favourites because there are many. Some of them, incidentally, I will give, to use one of her phrases, a big tick to, because on some of them she actually told the truth. Let us go through them. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> last year she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we can't get unemployment below 8 per cent&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">this is the government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">we don't deserve to get re&hyphen;elected.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Correct. A big tick for telling the truth there. What is unemployment at the moment: 8.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With the effluxion of time, Senator Vanstone obviously realised that perhaps this comment was not in the best interests of her government and all of a sudden we changed to `We will try very hard and we are sure that the electorate, come election time, will give us a big tick for effort'. I doubt whether it will give the government a big tick for effort. Even if it did give the government a big tick, I doubt whether that would be translated into a vote. If the government does not get unemployment below eight per cent, in line with the comments made by Senator Vanstone on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> last year, it will not be re&hyphen;elected. That is the reality.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Thank you, Senator O'Brien. Let me go to some of the most recent quotable quotes. Consider this one:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have to have, it might be described as, lessened job security. It's not a message everyone wants to hear.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is not a message that Senator Vanstone wanted anybody to hear, because she&mdash;out of her own mouth the other day&mdash;said that she and a member of her staff had taped the proceedings of a CEDA dinner. She said to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7512"> me&mdash;somewhat facetiously, I presume&mdash;across the chamber, `Would you like a tape?' I said quite genuinely that I would like a copy of the tape. She said, `You can't have it. Senator, I did say that but you have to understand that it is in relation to the context. I was misquoted. The people were ill&hyphen;informed. Okay, I did say this, but in the broader context. If you were to see it, you would understand that I was misquoted.' Thank you, Senator Vanstone, but given your record I doubt whether we can take your word for it. So the invitation is open from the opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I won't hold my breath, Senator O'Brien, you are right. Senator Vanstone says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I feel like a farmer that's watching the clouds and saying `this drought is going to break'. . . we are confident it will break&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She is talking about unemployment. When is the drought going to break? We have had this government for 18 months and we have actually had an increase in unemployment, and the situation is getting rapidly worse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We move to the next quotable quote from Senator Vanstone. She said that the government's spending cuts were partly to blame for unemployment. Correct&mdash;a big tick for telling the truth. She is absolutely right. The slash and burn mentality of this government has contributed massively to the unemployment rate and, if you ask any economist of standing, they will confirm that. You cannot slash jobs in the way that they have been slashed in the public sector without having a consequential effect on unemployment. So she is correct but, unfortunately for those people opposite, on this occasion she actually told the truth. But what happened the next day? John Howard came out and said that Senator Vanstone did say that but she was wrong&mdash;a big embarrassment for the government, but I concede that she was correct.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In question time the other day, she said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can confirm, as any Australian would be able to confirm for you, that the labour market remains flat.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As I said before, that is probably an understatement in Senator Vanstone's case. But on the very same day at the very same time we had, down in the House of Representatives, Peter Costello commenting. Was he saying that unemployment is flat? No, he was saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employment is now on the up.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You have got Senator Vanstone in the Senate saying it is flat and Mr Costello down in the House of Representatives saying it is on the up. It is just an absolute joke. I present her next quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't enter into the business of setting targets. We've got the Budget forecasts. They're what I keep my eye on.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">She wants to keep a pretty good eye on the budget forecasts because the budget forecast for unemployment for this financial year is 8.25 per cent. We are currently running at 8.7 per cent. Clearly, that forecast is going to have to be revised. So, instead of just keeping an eye on it, I suggest that she starts telling the truth and that she revises that to precisely what this government thinks it can achieve in regard to unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While I am at it, perhaps she would have the intestinal fortitude to start setting a jobs target&mdash;something by which the Australian people can measure her performance and this government's performance when they go into the ballot booth and think, `Will we give this government the big tick or not?' That is what she needs to do but she will not do it because she is not into setting targets&mdash;no wonder, because the only way you can actually have accountability is by setting targets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have Senator Vanstone's brief excursion into macro&hyphen;economic policy. That was pretty interesting as well, and I remind the Senate of John Howard's headland speech in which he said that in order to have any impact on unemployment, you had to have a four per cent growth rate. As everybody in this Senate knows, the growth rate in the last financial year came in at under three per cent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suspect that the government does not. That is the situation with regard to some of Senator Vanstone's more embarrassing comments. Let me amplify her comment that what Australia needed was a freer labour market and lessened job security. I say again to her: do not go on an excursion into industrial relations when you do not even know that the unfair dismissal laws that you are talking about are your own. Forget it&mdash;stick to employment. The senator does not know much about that, but she knows absolutely zero about industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have spoken already about the impact of the changes on unfair dismissals and what they mean to Australians who are concerned 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about their job security. Unemployment figures are intensifying the feeling of unease in the community with regard to that. Slashes to the public service and the revisions that are being proposed by this government to the Australian Public Service Act, whereby the mendicant status will be enshrined in legislation forevermore with regard to public servants and their political bosses, are adding to these feelings of unease.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the reform of employment services. How can the unemployed feel secure that the government's employment service is actually going to provide jobs? I will tell you that, in terms of votes of confidence, you have four key employment agencies that have said that they are not going to bother tendering under Senator Vanstone's new regime because it is not profitable enough; it is not worth it, and it is full of red tape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We then had a somewhat extraordinary statement from the government's own appointed chairperson of the interim public employment placement enterprise who, on 10 September, said that if he were a private provider he would not sign it. What was he talking about? He was talking about the tender document. He would not sign the tender document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to Senator Vanstone's comments on job insecurity&mdash;that is to say, what we need is less job security or increased job insecurity&mdash;not only has she let the cat out of the bag with regard to what this government is up to but on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> this morning Nick Greiner actually said:</PARA>

I spent a month travelling around Australia, with a number of other senators, talking about the new industrial relations bill. Everywhere we went we asked the question: do you believe John Howard's commitment to the Australian people that no worker will be worse off will be met by this legislation? Every single worker organisation, and even a few employer organisations, said no. In fact, I think I recall the MTIA giving us some interesting submissions with regard to that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to congratulate Senator Quirke, although he is not in the chamber, on his first speech that he made this afternoon. I would like to take up a number of the points that Senator Mackay made in addressing her motion today. The government agrees that unemployment has been a longstanding problem in Australia over more than the last decade. But that will not come as a great surprise to those opposite because, after all, they were the people in charge. For example, the unemployment rate averaged more than 7&half; per cent over the second half of the 1980s. From 1990&hyphen;1995, the average rate was worse at 9.4 per cent and peaked at 11.2 per cent in December of 1992. The party that was in government was the Australian Labor Party. It was a period marked by the highest unemployment rate since the Depression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The quick fixes the opposition propose may have a superficial appeal, but only the right policies will actually address the problem on a lasting basis. So let us look a little harder at Labor's record. Let us look a little harder at the record that Senator Mackay chose to ignore. For 32 consecutive months under the Hawke and Keating governments, unemployment was higher than it was under any government since the end of World War II.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To come here today and criticise the government on the grounds that Senator Mackay chooses shows extraordinary gall. Clearly, the policies pursued by the previous government failed to reduce unemployment. But, in contrast, this government is implementing a range of policies that will act to create the right conditions for employment growth. It is about getting the settings right&mdash;working on all fronts together, not one at a time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since coming into office, the government has been fixing the fundamentals and creating an economic environment that is conducive to doing business. Let me enumerate some of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7515"> those reforms. This government has a clear reform agenda. Our commitment is to making Australia one of the world's most internationally competitive nations by 2010 to meet APEC's free trade targets. That means, in the words of the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), that there must be significant reforms over the whole spectrum of government activity. We do not accept some polemical view that total reform must occur today or that you can do it in piecemeal fashion, irrespective of the costs to the community. Our approach is strategic. It is one in which significant reform is ongoing and which avoids unnecessary strains on community cohesion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The government's reform priorities are clear. It is about developing a fairer internationally competitive tax system. The government is moving down that road right now. It is about responding to useful, productive, constructive reports like the Mortimer, Goldsworthy and IPAC reports with a package that encourages business to employ more people, to be internationally competitive. It is about developing world&hyphen;class IT and education systems. It is about improving customs and clearance in the waterfront, something the opposition would know nothing about. It is about continuing competition policy development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last 18 months significant reforms have been put in place but, of course, they are completely unacknowledged by those on the other side. These include the Wallis proposals to strengthen our financial system and the reduction in automotive and TCF tariffs between 1995 and 2005, which will be legislated. Inflation is at a 30&hyphen;year low with official interest rates reduced five times since the government came to office. Major changes have occurred in the industrial relations system. One-third of Telstra is being privatised, with that money going to useful works in Australia. Incentives encouraging private health insurance and reforms have been introduced to support small business, including capital gains tax rollover relief, reducing the provisional tax uplift factor and revising FBT compliance. If you take all of those together, it is quite clear that the govern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ment's comprehensive commitment is to reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The OECD itself recently assessed the government's current reforms against the recommendations outlined in its jobs strategy. Rather than suggesting that we take the easy answer, or the so-called quick fix of Labor, the OECD has given strong support to this government's reforms&mdash;reforms like the charter of budget honesty, fiscal consolidation, the industrial relations reforms, the overhaul of employment assistance arrangements and the changes to the apprenticeship and trainee arrangements. Where did Labor leave apprenticeships and trainees in this country? These are all areas which the previous government did not have the courage or the foresight to address. Over how many years? Thirteen. Over how many reports? Innumerable. How many young lives have been damaged? You cannot count them. The OECD strategies are the right strategies to pursue. The countries that have implemented those policies have experienced the greatest falls in unemployment and have dramatically improved the performance of their labour markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is here for the long haul. We are fixing the fundamentals to ensure that we can provide for all Australians into the 21st century. The opposition would have this Senate believe that this government is responsible for the level of Australian workers' confidence. How long will they keep up that tired joke? Senator Mackay mentioned participation rates in the Australian work force. They have remained steady for the last three years at around 63 per cent, not a participation rate that the government created but one we inherited from the Labor government who, after 13 years, could not provide enough direction or stability for the Australian labour force to allow them to be re-elected to lead this country for another term. Aren't we all grateful for the foresight of the Australian community?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian electorate elected this government on a promise that we would take a responsible approach, that we would provide real solutions and that we would fix the fundamentals. What we will not do is allow 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7516"> the opposition to bully us into building a job strategy on a base of sand that will just crumble like the previous Labor government's did. This government is providing a concrete foundation to ensure that growth is long term and that confidence in the work force and in the business community is strong and unwavering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the issue of job security, it is important to realise that technological innovation, globalisation and other changes are all having a profound effect on modern economies. For those with any degree of foresight or any capacity to think past the end of their nose, this makes you rethink the notion of job security. In fact, holding a single job for life is becoming the exception, not the norm. Rather, workers are moving from job to job, perhaps even making major career changes during their working life. It seems to me that this is particularly relevant to the question of inexorably falling union membership levels. Maybe those opposite need to contemplate why that might be. Perhaps the organisations that they represent and come from are not keeping up with the changes in employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is addressing these changes in a positive way with policies that will provide the employment growth and the labour market flexibility which will enable workers to move between jobs without becoming unemployed. But of course, as the Prime Minister himself has said, the Australian Labor Party is always prepared, when faced with the choice between a  regulated labour market dominated by the trade union movement or a lower level of unemployment, to choose the regulated labour market. It is our reforms to education and training which focus on fundamentals like literacy and numeracy and reforms to employment assistance which will give people the skills they need to capitalise on emerging job opportunities. It is all about getting those fundamentals right for all Australians, something the opposition did not understand in government and certainly does not understand now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Workplace Relations Act is a powerful example of this government's commitment to getting it right. Australia does need a freer industrial relations system in order to move 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ahead. The Workplace Relations Act removes the old restraints which discouraged employers from hiring. The Labor Party's onerous unfair dismissal provisions have been replaced by a system which is fairer for both workers and employers. We now see workers and employers developing cooperative agreements which provide increased flexibility and productivity in the use of labour and which also meet the needs of employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is extraordinary that the opposition moves a motion such as this, having us believe that the government does not have in place a job strategy that does look after the work force. Just think for a moment about where they are coming from. Let us take a look at their record on youth unemployment and the solutions that they came up with. Over 13 years in government they promised increased opportunities for young Australians and then let the number of apprenticeships run down to the lowest level in 30 years. When this government introduced a work for the dole scheme to provide 18&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds with experience and confidence, a scheme aimed at promoting the culture of work and combating the cycle of despondency and the lack of self&hyphen;esteem and despair that often tragically characterise the young unemployed, the Labor Party actually voted against the scheme in the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scheme is about fixing the fundamentals, building the concrete foundations and putting young people back into the loop. It provides additional funding of $21 million for 10,000 places in 70 pilot projects. It focuses on the long-term unemployed, helping them establish networks or employment contacts which are crucial to finding out about jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The irrefutable facts of this government's approach to fixing the fundamentals to ensure a future for the Australian work force and the Australian business community are the following. There have been five interest rate falls since March 1996, and interest rates are at their lowest level in more than two decades. The interest rates charged to small businesses by banks are at their lowest level in 20 years, and underlying inflation is running at two per cent. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7517">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is on course to deliver a structural surplus of $1.6 billion by 1998-99. In 1996 and 1997, business investment grew by 16 per cent. In the first six months of 1997, the economy was growing at an annualised rate of 3.7 per cent, and there have now been 24 consecutive quarters of GDP growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out of the 1997 budget came the $1 billion Federation Fund for projects of national significance that will generate jobs in the construction phase. I have already referred to the work for the dole project. In addition to both of those, the $130 million small business innovation fund and the $45 million community support program, over the next four years, will assist 25,500 job seekers. The Green Corps training project is providing training for young people aged 17 to 20 years, with $41 million of government funding, full-time for six months on community based environmental projects which link training to career prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the opposition are seriously interested in employment strategies, they should also be looking at the OECD jobs strategy. The following points are listed by the OECD as being appropriate for maximising employment opportunities and employment growth: fundamentals like sound macroeconomic policy, which gives sustainable non&hyphen;inflationary growth; the need to enhance the creation and diffusion of technological know&hyphen;how; and the need to increase the flexibility of working time through the voluntary agreement of workers and employers, and the Workplace Relations Act goes directly to that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Also on the list are the need to facilitate the creation and expansion of enterprises; to make wage and labour costs more flexible to reflect local conditions and individual skills; to reform employment security provisions&mdash;again, the Workplace Relations Act addresses precisely that point; and to strengthen active labour market policies and improve their effectiveness&mdash;and, in every way, the government's work in the workplace relations area goes to that point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Lastly, there is the need to raise skill levels by reforming education and training, which were left in a desperate situation after 13 years of ALP government. There is the need 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to reform unemployment and related benefits systems and their interaction with the tax system, to improve work incentives and achieve fundamental equity goals, and to enhance product market competition. All these fundamentals of the OECD jobs strategies need to be addressed together, not separately and not in isolation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Mackay was blissfully misinterpreting the remarks at the CEDA conference of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, yet again, notwithstanding the minister's clarifications. The minister quite clearly pointed Senator Mackay to the OECD job strategies to correct her misapprehensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the question of job security, the minister made it quite clear what will happen when small business believes that it is going to be very expensive to make changes in the employment of a person who is not working out on the job. If they are unable to select another person and there is a high cost to that&mdash;there was a significantly high cost under the Labor Party's laws&mdash;what people do in that situation is employ casuals because they do not take the chance of making a bad choice. The minister made it quite clear that the government's legislation enables employers to make those choices. They are a very important part of giving small business the strength and capacity to operate effectively in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unemployment is a long-term problem. I acknowledged at the beginning of my remarks that the government knows and understands the views of the electorate on that question and also understands that the electorate had put up with the policies of the former government for a period in excess of 13 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a long-term problem, unemployment requires long-term solutions. The coalition government's solutions are a balanced budget, which will take the pressure off interest rates, and I have already referred to reductions in the interest rates; the capacity for low interest rates that encourage business investment and job creation; a low inflation environment to encourage productive investment in wealth creating activities; flexible workplace relations to increase productivity, to increase Australia's international competitiveness and Austra 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7518"> lia's employment; and individually tailored assistance to the unemployed to give unemployed people the skills they need to get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We pay providers for outcomes. We do not simply stick people in programs that shuffle and churn and change the statistics but still result in long queues of long-term unemployed. We reduced red tape for small business, which enables them to get on with the job of wealth and job creation. The package of reforms announced this week will do just that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have reinvigorated the apprenticeships and traineeships programs in Australia to give more training opportunities to the young Australians who were let down so comprehensively by the previous government. Through our education policies, we are creating pathways from schools to employment and encouraging industry links through that process. We focus on literacy and numeracy in our schools to give young Australians the skills they need to avoid unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Addressing Senator Mackay's motion is all about addressing the fundamentals. I have enumerated those for the Senate this afternoon. It is the government's concern with the fundamentals which means that we will provide Australians with the solutions, we will provide Australians with the answers, that they have sought for more than a decade from the previous government and were continually disappointed in not receiving.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Structural unemployment in Australia is rampant. By that I mean the nature of industry, not the voluntary unemployment where people might choose to move from one job to another, or choose to leave one area of the country to travel somewhere else and then look for a job. Structural unemployment is about how industry is operating in Australia and how it is actually creating unemployment by the nature of its operations, the nature of its use of capital and technology rather than its use of people, the downsizing, the requirement that people work longer and longer hours and so on. I will be talking more about that during my presentation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is acting as if it is voluntary. We have heard people talk about deserving poor and undeserving poor. In most instances, there is a feeling that many people&mdash;perhaps most unemployed people&mdash;are the undeserving poor, and that is a very unfortunate trend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Structural unemployment is a major problem in Australia, but Australia is not alone in that. Structural unemployment is common in most developed nations around the world. It is part of the move to internationalisation and it is primarily a result of the deregulation of the economic world which allows corporations to produce where they like, generally where labour costs, tax and regulations for safety and environmental protection are weakest. We have seen the proliferation of enormous environmental disasters within our region. There is an attraction for big industry to go in to rip and tear where they know there will be the least possibility for them to be called to question on environmental issues and social justice issues, and also where the taxes might be lower and the wages and conditions are lower. That is the world we are living in at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The denationalisation of economies has meant that there is less need for an internal mass market. For all that governments talk about what they do and do not do in terms of the economy, I guess in their private, honest moments they would tell you that there is not a lot that they have left themselves to do with the way they operate an economy these days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If large corporations are not necessarily looking for an internal mass market for their goods and services, where are they looking? They are looking for a global market of elite and upper&hyphen;middle classes to substitute for the need for a national mass market to eliminate the Ford or Keynesian rationale for paying workers enough to pay for most products of an industrial economy. Remember, Henry Ford said that he thought the appropriate wage for his workers was enough to be able to purchase the goods that they were producing. That is not an unreasonable thing to say. The size of the United States economy certainly made that a very viable prospect.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7519">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the changes that we have seen in terms of looking for the elite&mdash;the middle class in bigger economies, even if they are developing countries&mdash;have been exacerbated by technological changes that allow production to be more easily transferred&mdash;to be more flexible&mdash;allowing equipment to be used for various purposes. Data processing capacity and near&hyphen;instant communications allow just&hyphen;in&hyphen;time management practices. People do not hold stocks of goods any more if they can help it. You do not produce stocks and have them available; you have people on and bring the work force in just to produce that which has been ordered. That, in some ways, keeps down the cost for the producer, but does not necessarily reduce the cost for the buyer. I have not heard tales that these costs have been decreased, but it does mean that the cost for the producer is kept down because of their limiting their cost of wages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just&hyphen;in&hyphen;time management allows the severe reduction of material stocks and held stocks of products. It also applies to labour, encouraging the casualisation of the work force and the use of short&hyphen;term contracts. So you get a wider and wider group within our community who do not necessarily know from week to week what their pay will be and what their work situation will be. Of course, those people are less willing to spend any discretionary income that they have from the time that they are working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Economic pressures have also led to the increasing reduction of secure full&hyphen;time work. Through various ways, the government has indicated that this might be a goal. It is rarely admitted but the reality is that there is a reduction in secure full&hyphen;time work. The lack of this secure full&hyphen;time work has increased pressure to reduce or eliminate on&hyphen;the&hyphen;job training. Such training makes no sense when there is no necessary continuity in the work force. The result is that the burden of training falls on the public and on workers. A further result is that people who have little access to appropriate training have fewer options for jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I noticed Senator Payne mentioned Green Corps. The reality is that that is a step down in terms of resources and the number of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> people involved from previous programs. It means in fact that we have less likelihood of outcomes, and the people involved in those programs&mdash;the ones that I know about&mdash;have found that they are required to do more with less. That is always a problem. Whether or not people choose to go on those programs will affect the outcomes as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have had much emphasis on international competitiveness. For many people that means a race to the bottom in many ways&mdash;wages and conditions, and environmental standards. We have seen what that race to the bottom in environmental standards means at the moment in terms of the smog and toxic pollution over this region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also noted that Senator Payne mentioned a competition policy, proudly mentioning the push that the current government has taken and, at many levels, state governments as well. In fact, it was introduced by the former Labor government. I would very much like the actual outcomes of competition policy to be reviewed. I would like it to be seen in terms of its employment outcomes and its environment and community outcomes&mdash;its social outcomes. But, in this chamber, we have not seen fit to do that. I think it is crying out to look at what the actual outcomes are. I know for sure that local government believe it is time for it to be reviewed and revisited because they have been given the short end of the stick on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They represent everybody in Australia. So if local government are finding it difficult and many people at the state government levels are finding it difficult, what does it mean for the rest of the people in Australia? Just wait until we have the outcomes of the 2,000 pieces of legislation that currently are being reviewed behind largely closed doors. What will happen when we have to deal with the outcomes of that? It is not a process that has happened; it is happening, and it is getting worse and worse the less we do about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have looked at some figures based on seasonally adjusted data. The number of unemployed has been increasing from about 750,000 people, or 8.3 per cent, in June 1995, and it is now around 800,000, or 8.7 per cent. Long&hyphen;term unemployment has been increasing 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7520"> from 206,000, or 26.2 per cent of total unemployment, in May 1996, and it is now about 248,000, or 31 per cent of total unemployment. Nearly one&hyphen;third of unemployed people are long&hyphen;term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Youth unemployment has been rising from a low of 26.4 per cent of the youth labour force in July 1996 and now stands at 27.3 per cent. The participation rate is down since the high of 64.1 per cent in November 1995, an indicator that the level of hidden unemployment is high and increasing. The participation rate now stands at 62.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under&hyphen;employment, that is the number of people working part time because they cannot find full&hyphen;time work, is a more recent factor. It has become significant enough that the Australian Bureau of Statistics now collects this information as part of labour statistics. The latest information I could get was the September 1996 figures, which said that there were 547,000 unemployed workers at that time. Note that 1996 was a time when unemployment was actually lower than it is now. I do not know what the current figures are, but it is very important that we recognise this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We all know that in countries where there are no unemployment benefits at all the concept of unemployment is in fact a luxury. People have to survive some way. It could be by the casual economy; it could be by stealing, if you have to survive; it could be by grubbing around in rubbish bins and trying to make things from the rubbish to sell. That might, in some people's eyes, be seen as unemployment. In many people's eyes, that is under&hyphen;employment, and some people just see it as the casual work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think we would really like to see the situation in Australia where more people are being kicked off benefits for various reasons, which we have heard from the Minister for Social Security, Senator Newman, and to have a situation where people are having to make do in whatever way they can. In many cases, that is under&hyphen;employment. It can be that the people who have to accept have very little choice but to accept employment at, maybe in Australia, $2 an hour for delivering leaflets. How many people in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australia are being paid very low, unacceptably low, rates of pay?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government are complicit in these changes for structural unemployment. They are not running the agenda necessarily in the economy, but they are complicit in some of these changes, as was the former government. The Thatcherite or Reaganite economic models espoused this to various degrees and were designed to facilitate the changes, which benefited the corporate interests mostly. The corporations and the international money market generally punish employment policies. They tend to give a big tick for lower taxation, for cutting back on the public sector or for downsizing, but they tend to punish countries that have employment policies. It is an irony, isn't it, that we are being dictated to by people whose main motives are greed and self&hyphen;benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issues that need to be addressed in a global economy are not necessarily how to attract corporations who will export. That is a recipe which may be making the profit margin of General Motors the goal of the nation. What we need is to develop a nation which is more self&hyphen;reliant and which is based on an ethic of providing and supporting people in meaningful work which does not violate goals for increasing the quality of life for all Australians. To be clear here, quality of life does not equate with maximum consumption. It implies that everyone can have enough, but that once most basic material and social needs are satisfied the majority of people find less materialistic activities more fulfilling than working themselves to death to increase their bank account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are we going to get in Australia? I saw some statistics the other day that stated that more people are actually dying of stress and overwork than are actually dying in road accidents. I would need to check the figures, but it was a bit of a shock. We have a situation in Australia where there is under&hyphen;employment and overtime&mdash;a lot of the time unpaid. There is stress for the people who are working, I think, and many of the people who are not working are stressed for different reasons. When we get to our retirement&mdash;which we have to pay for, and there is a lot of stress 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7521"> involved with that because it looks as if pensions are no longer going to be a right&mdash;I can see there will be very few people who will actually have the health and ability to enjoy it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are finding that leisure within our system is something that perhaps fewer people have access to. We have a situation where more people are required to work over the weekends anyway, working in 24&hyphen;hour businesses and so on. There is the whole concept of being able to incorporate the values that we enjoy in our lives and of being able to join with other people at weekends. That has almost disappeared altogether in Australia. That is very worrying, I believe. What are we doing in our nation; what are we benefiting from if that is what we are doing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Receipt of money does become a priority for poor people. Necessities must be looked after, but once people move out of that category they can reassess. This is a good process. We need to reassess as a nation, and work towards a world where everyone has enough rather than a world where everyone has an opportunity to exploit each other as much as possible and a handful of people can win big while most other people lose. That is the concept of wealth creation, or the trickle down theory, much of which was discredited back in the 1970s and 1980s in development theory. We are going back to the assumption in Australia that if a few people have the ability to make a lot of money, then somehow or other everybody else benefits. The figures do not work out. Currently, that is a zero sum cake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If what we are saying in our communities is that we can do things differently, perhaps we can turn this thing around. I was interviewed not so long ago by a journalist who wanted to know what I thought about employment and its rate of growth. I have said for a long time that I do not believe there is a magical point in national growth statistics where employment suddenly becomes available&mdash;although I think four per cent is generally thrown around. We have heard that there have been many quarters of growth in Australia, but we have not heard of there having been many benefits in relation to employment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would say that there are very good reasons why we have had long periods of jobless growth. One of them is because of the built&hyphen;in structure of unemployment. That is because we are, in fact, moving to get rid of people from the work force. We know that governments, especially conservative governments, are desperate to get rid of public sector employees. We know that many corporations themselves have decided their main role in life is to get rid of their employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I believe it is not the percentage of growth that is important. I believe it is the type of development and economy that is important. That can be creating diversity. That can be creating some form of greater regional self-sufficiency. It can mean, in many cases&mdash;cases like Maleny in Queensland&mdash;looking at novel ideas about creating regional credit schemes; looking at novel ideas about communities finding some of their solutions; and also looking at ideas such as finding a local currency which is exchangeable for goods and services which will enable small businesses to become creative and use skills that otherwise are not valued within the normal formal economy. Many people who are otherwise conservative are linking into those schemes because they work well. If what we are after is meeting people's needs, those are the kinds of ideas we have to look at.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also think that the current, very narrow concept of `economy' which says that, as long as you have export coal, you have a healthy economy is very narrow minded. I think we should be looking at other ways of producing our energy. It is clear, and the statistics can show you many times over, that energy conservation and efficiency measures can create many, many more jobs than coal fired power stations&mdash;certainly many, many more jobs than those created with the money, the $2.5 billion, we have wasted in Australia on Lucas Heights. How many jobs have been created out of that $2.5 billion of, largely, wasted money?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What could we have been doing creatively in terms of the environment? What could we have been doing creatively in terms of alternative energy which would put Australia at the forefront of what the rest of the world is 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7522"> aiming to do in terms of energy conservation efficiency? We have wasted a lot of our opportunities, but we should not waste any more. I believe that we can have growthless jobs. I believe that we can be doing things differently in rearranging the way we operate our economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said before today that I do not believe the economy should be ruling people; people should be using the economy to achieve their own ends. We should not be dictated to by the international money markets. We should not have our social policies and employment policies dictated by people whose sole purpose in life is to line their own pockets through money market speculation and futures markets. We in this country should be able to decide on what is a reasonable outcome for our economy and our social system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be looking at very creative solutions for achieving a greater level of independence from what is happening in the internationalist environment which is helping to create the situation we are in now. This does not mean `fortress Australia'. This means smarter thinking, and deciding to meet some of those needs at the regional and local levels with the resources that we have here. This means protecting and preserving the future, and not destroying it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion of Senator Mackay which is before the Senate. This is the most fundamental issue we face as a nation: dealing with the question of unemployment. The fact that unemployment is still at 8.7 per cent and, more importantly, that the participation rate has been declining since this government was elected&mdash;it has dropped, in fact, by 1.6 per cent since the March election of 1996&mdash;is a clear indictment of the current government and its lack of any strategy or plan to deal with this question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that this country needs a plan. It needs a long&hyphen;term strategy to deal with the issue of unemployment if we are to achieve the goal of getting it down below five per cent, which was a goal that the Labor Party in government was prepared to set itself as an 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> objective. But this government is not prepared to commit itself to that or any other target in terms of the unemployment figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality also is that the Labor Party did have a plan for dealing with the question of unemployment, and that plan was Working Nation. One of the significant achievements of that plan was what it did in terms of targeting the long&hyphen;term unemployed. When the plan was initiated, long-term unemployment in this country was around about 300,000; it depends what point you take as the kick&hyphen;in point, but it was around that figure. Labor got that figure down, in a very short period of time, to 206,000. Under this government, it has already moved back up to near 250,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A recent report was prepared by Mr P.J. Junankar and Mr Kapuscinski from the Australian National University. They said a couple of significant things which I think are important and should be put on the record. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although Working Nation had a very short life it succeeded in helping the long term unemployed: it was a very useful social experiment which was aborted for political reasons.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition government have apparently lost interest in the long term unemployed: there has been a massive cutback in expenditure on labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Contrast that with what the Labor Party did in government and Working Nation where we promised to create 500,000 jobs over the period of 1993 to 1996 and, in fact, achieved 680,000 jobs over that period; and contrast it also with the achievement of the Labor government from 1983 to 1996 where, in fact, there were an additional two million-plus Australians employed in this country over that period. That was the extent of the growth in the work force over Labor's term in office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to contrast that of course with the position that was left to Labor&mdash;the legacy that Little Johnny Howard left them when he was the Treasurer of this country in 1983&mdash;of double digit inflation and double digit unemployment. </PARA>

That is a record that you cannot run away from. However, it is fair to say that the previous Labor government did have a plan for dealing with the question of unemployment. It did set out to tackle the problem and it did set itself, systematically, targets and goals to achieve it. It set the goal of achieving five per cent or less unemployment by the year 2000&mdash;something that this government is not prepared to acknowledge or prepared to set itself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately there are others in the community who do have plans about how to deal with the issue of unemployment, and a number of those plans have emerged recently. They have emerged out of the Mortimer report, which raises a number of key issues that we need to address as a community if we are to deal with the issue of unemployment, and those are currently before the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have the Goldsworthy report, which deals with the question of information technology. It recognises the importance of information technology in terms of what it can do to drive the productive capacity of the country and of individual companies and how it can lead to the creation of more competitive enterprises with the capacity to employ greater numbers of Australians. We had the minister who is now responsible for information technology in this chamber the other day, unable to tell us what the size of his department was, what funds had been allocated to that ministry or what the strategy was in terms of addressing the issues that are in the Goldsworthy report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The MTIA have a plan. They have submitted a plan in which they have put forward seven key steps, among which are the question of tax reform, an investment agency, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7524"> stronger central coordination of industry policy and engagement with Asia in terms of it being a free trade area. These are among a number of key recommendations from that organisation in terms of how we can address the problem of unemployment in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The common ground between all of those plans is that you will not get job growth without investment in research and development and in infrastructure. This government, in its budgets, has cut the public support for R&amp;D, yet it is acknowledged across the whole of the business community that it is a key issue in terms of our companies being able to compete in the global market. There has recently been a report released by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology called `Made by Hong Kong' in which they reinforce that point. It is innovation that gives companies the edge in the global marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as a nation have to understand and accept that, in the global market in which we are operating, we do not have the luxury of looking any more at Australia being a domestic market and an opportunity to compete in the market elsewhere. We are a small part of a global marketplace and we have to compete both for our share of the domestic market with international competitors and for our share of the international market with those domestic competitors in those sections of the international market. That is a challenge that we have to confront and we are only going to be able to do that if we are able to hit the marketplace with innovative ideas, then commercialise those ideas and turn them into innovative products that give us a leading edge in terms of our capacity to compete in that marketplace. That is the central message that comes out of all those reports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other area of commonality is the question of sectoral industry plans looking at those key industries of growth, like biotechnology and information technology, particularly in the software area. This country can be at the leading edge of software development in information technology. It is an area where there ought to be a lot of concentration, because we have the skills and the capacity to win a significant share of what will be a very substantial growth area in terms of jobs in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> future. An example is what has been occurring in that area in the United States. Forty per cent of the jobs growth and income growth in GDP in the United States over the last 10 years has been caused by computers and computer software. It has been the engine of growth in the American economy. It is an area, as I said, that we have to give much more fundamental support to and support for if we are going to get the benefits that potentially reside in that area for us as a nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the current coalition government have no plan for job creation. It is a government that has an ideological obsession with discredited economic fundamentalist policies that were implemented by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. They have a wish list to get back to the agenda of the early 1980s and a political mentality that is still somewhere in the 1950s. That is the reason why they are not prepared to commit themselves to an unemployment target.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They have no objectives and there is no criteria against which the government can judge what they are doing in terms of unemployment. They have no idea what the outcomes of their policies are going to be in terms of resolving the unemployment problem. They are counting and relying solely on the market to solve the problem. Their strategy for dealing with unemployment is a wing and a prayer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are hoping against hope that something will happen out there that will change the figures before the next election. They are also hoping that it may not be an issue, but it will be an issue. Unemployment will be the central issue upon which the next election is fought. It will be fought on jobs, it will be fought on job security, and it will be fought on the welfare of every Australian.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The results speak for themselves. If you look at the results over the 18 months of this government, you can see that in fact we have had negative employment growth. We have lost 60,000 full-time jobs since the last budget, 38,000 of them in August 1997 alone. Let us look at some of the criticisms that have been made after the last budget. From the Executive Director of the Victorian Council of Social Services:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7525">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Jobs is the critical issue and they have not tackled it. I don't know how they will bring unemployment down to 8 percent. There is no central industry reform or employment initiative.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">A spokesperson for the Salvation Army said that the work for the dole scheme for 10,000 young people was `totally inadequate for the other 800,000 unemployed Australians'. All this government can do is to blame the unemployed for their situation and fiddle with the figures. The only way the Prime Minister, John Howard, and the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, can see to improve unemployment figures is to make sure unemployed Australians are too discouraged to seek jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work force participation rate is at its lowest for three years. People are just giving up in the search for employment. Look at some of the remedies that the minister offered in this chamber yesterday in question time, when she was questioned substantially upon her address to the CEDA dinner. It is interesting that she keeps saying that she is being quoted out of context but she has consistently refused to provide a copy of her speech. It would be interesting to see what else is in the speech that she may feel would be an embarrassment to her and, probably more importantly, an embarrassment to her government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She kept saying there were two issues that were important for job creation opportunities to deal with unemployment in this country: one was a freer industrial relations market and the other was the question of unfair dismissals. Despite the fact that your industrial relations legislation dealing with unfair dismissals has been in operation for some considerable time, you are still raising the question of unfair dismissals as a furphy. Those are the two issues the minister keeps saying are central to this government's strategy for dealing with the question of unemployment. They want to blame everybody around them, except themselves, for the lack of result in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But what are people in the real world saying are the barriers to employment creation opportunities? Let us look at the survey that was conducted by the Economic Intelligence Unit for the MTIA report and which I think 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> was reproduced in Tuesday's edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. They said that the barriers to investment, in order of importance, were: the small size of our market, high local taxes, little incentive from the government&mdash;I repeat, little incentive&mdash;uncertain outlook for industry policy&mdash;in other words, the fact that there is not any industry policy against which they can judge their investment decisions&mdash;and the physical distance from markets. The last two issues that were identified as a barrier to employment in this country were high port and shipping costs and industrial relations problems. The last on the list was the industrial relations problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have a government that continually talks about micro-economic reform and wants to attack the maritime workers and blame them for a lot of the problems that we confront; yet high port and shipping costs was identified way down the line as being a barrier to investment in this country. We all know that the attack on the waterside workers is not about trying to remove impediments to employment growth; it is ideological in the sense of this government's committed position of trying to destroy the collective organisation of workers in this country, as it is expressed through trade unions and the trade union movement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> The reality is, as I said before, that this government does not have a plan to deal with unemployment, nor does it have a plan about how to grow this economy. It does not have a strategy to put in place that will create the job opportunities that are necessary to reduce unemployment substantially.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another plan which has been developed and just released recently. This was a plan produced by my own union, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rebuilding Australia: industry development for more jobs</EMPHASIS>. I would take this opportunity to acknowledge the work that was done on that report by our national research officer, Nixon Apple. It sets out a strategy for dealing with the question of unemployment.

You have never done anything to promote the development of manufacturing and service industries in this country. The only concern you had about trade unionists was taking their money to buy your pub in Melbourne. You were happy then to engage with trade unionists. But we do have a plan. We have a five-point plan for dealing with the question of unemployment. A key element of that plan is innovation&mdash;a strategy which says that we should adopt an approach to R&amp;D assistance in this country which encourages companies to expend more of their own dollars as well as the dollars provided out of the public purse; a strategy which, if implemented, would in our view considerably increase the expenditure on R&amp;D that we are seeing in this country in the current environment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the things about a whip is that he does not get a chance to talk very often. All he has is the opportunity to table reports and whatever. Senator Mackay has raised a very important subject today. There is no doubt about that. All of us on this side of the chamber certainly share Senator Mackay's concerns about the issues of unemployment, job security and policy direction. There is no doubt about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All we have heard from the other side is a lot of quotes, and, just recently, Senator Campbell talking about a number of plans that have all of sudden appeared out of nowhere. I wonder where all those plans were when the Labor Party was in power and we had unemployment at 11 per cent or so. This government has not once tried to hide the unemployment situation in any shape or form. Instead, in the short time we have been in government, we have sought to get out into the open the fact that unemployment has been a longstanding problem for the last 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem that I have with Senator Mackay's motion is that it is not concerned with the plight of the unemployed. It is a motion that has been put forward to deliberately mislead the Senate and the people of Australia. This motion is misleading because it is based upon three fallacies. Fallacy No. 1 is that this government is responsible for creating an unemployment level of 8.7 per cent. Fallacy No. 2 is that this government is responsible for increasing job insecurity. Fallacy No. 3 is that this government does not possess a coherent job creation policy direction. They are the three fallacies that this motion is based on. In the short time I have, I would like to address those fallacies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addressing the first fallacy, if you were to accept the thrust of Senator Mackay's motion, you could be mistaken for believing that the unemployment levels that we in this nation are facing were the creation of this government. Nothing could be further from the truth. A paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Divided nation: employment and unemployment in Australia</EMPHASIS>, published in September last year by two independent commentators, Graeme Dorrance and Helen Hughes, reflected on the Hawke&hyphen; 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7527">Keating legacy. The paper documented that in 1993 long&hyphen;term unemployment had grown to 37 per cent. Likewise, in 1993, youth unemployment represented 40 per cent of total unemployment. Of most concern, however, is the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The re-emergence of high unemployment in Australia has been accompanied by widening income distribution and worsening poverty. Australia is now a divided nation: whereas 85 per cent of the workforce are employed and living well as `insiders', 15 per cent are unemployed, underemployed, disguised unemployed and poor `outsiders' concentrated in low socioeconomic status neighbourhoods marked by low labour force participation, high unemployment, poor educational achievement and poor health. An underclass is growing as unemployment levels rise with each cyclical downturn</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So let us get it clear&mdash;for 32 consecutive months under Hawke and Keating, unemployment was at its highest since World War II. That was our inheritance 18 months ago.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The release this week of the kit <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Giving Small Business a Fair Go</EMPHASIS> certainly seeks to implement the measures that small businesses have been crying out for. If you want to talk about quotes, have a look at some of the quotes from small business people&mdash;the people that you ignored when you were in government. What did you do about small business? Not one thing. Most of the small businesses around today were big businesses but they became small businesses when you were in government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we do not make any excuses. We side with small businesses, because we know they are the only ones that can create real jobs for this country&mdash;not those Mickey Mouse jobs you quoted in Working Nation where people went in one door, were in training for about 12 months and then went out the backdoor. They are not real jobs. Small business can not only give job security, it can also provide real jobs. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7528">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we are committed&mdash;and how else can you explain our commitment? In my own state of Tasmania we are committed to the regional forest agreement. What is going to happen? After two decades of the competing and divisive demands of conservation and industry in our state, this government is going to deliver job security, certainty and investment&mdash;something you never delivered. Only today, in one of the related moves to this program, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) announced the government's 20&hyphen;20 plantation vision, which is a boost for jobs, economic growth and rural communities.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Mackay, I know you will be delighted to know that the federal, state and territory governments joined with the industry in order to commit themselves to creating up to 40,000 jobs through a trebling of Australia's plantation forest estates by the year 2020. It will be interesting to know what sort of comments we get from Senator Brown about this. I am waiting to hear. I could go on, but it is pretty obvious that this government is certainly committed to delivering job security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us turn to fallacy No. 3&mdash;the claim that this government lacks a job creation policy focus. I refer you back to the quote earlier from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Divided Nation</EMPHASIS>. You should take particular note of this. The authors' following statement was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless fundamental policy changes are made speedily, the insider proportion of Australians could be reduced to 80 per cent, leaving 20 per cent, or one person in five, to be poor outsiders.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Since day one, this government has set out to take on the challenge of reducing unemployment. Fundamental policy changes have to be made, and a lot of them have been made already. If we are going to get this country back and unemployment down, the sorts of things that are going to have to be put in place include balancing the budget, creating an environment of low interest rates, creating an environment of low inflation, introducing flexible workplace relations, tailoring individual assistance to the unemployed, reducing red tape for small business, creating pathways from schools to employment and focusing on literacy and numeracy in our schools.</PARA>

Because they put in place the sorts of things we are trying to do, they reduced unemployment from 20 per cent back to 12 per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would like to speak on document No. 18, the agreement between Australia and Kazakstan on commercial and economic cooperation. Most senators would know that there has been some difficulty with regard to Kazakstan, and the Joint Committee on Treaties has been looking at this particular treaty as to whether or not there should be a recommendation that its ratification proceed. I think honourable senators would also know about press reports on the difficulty that Telstra had in Kazakstan, where an agreement that they had with the Kazakstani government on the supply of telecommunications was terminated for a couple of reasons, one of which, I think, was that they failed to comply with a new law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The treaties committee is somewhat concerned about this matter, as I am, because these agreements are essentially designed and intended for the improvement of trade between countries. I think what has to be kept in mind here, particularly in some of these countries which have emerged as a result of the break&hyphen;up of the Soviet Union, is that some of these East Asian countries are establishing themselves but it is important to Australian businesses that they are made aware of the circumstances that might prevail in some of these countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have found it quite amazing that, in the national interest analysis that was presented to the committee initially, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade did not even inform the committee of the potential pitfalls that could occur within Kazakhstan. Of course, if you were a company interested in investment or cooperative ventures in that country, you would not be aware of them from the agreement or the treaty that is in place. That is somewhat of a reflection on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as it is currently operating. It is clear that Australia, from an international point of view, does not have a department, or indeed a 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister, that are on top of this portfolio. I refer to the responsibility that the minister and his department have to Australian companies for the purposes of them achieving investment overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is clear from a public hearing that we had this week that there are difficulties. Some of those difficulties can be quite significant and could cause some companies to lose significant amounts of money. I am sure&mdash;and we raised questions in the committee about this&mdash;that the development of treaties between countries ought to be the responsibility of the minister. I understand the minister may well be meeting with the Kazakhstani minister this week, but it is important that these matters are resolved well in advance of treaties being signed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even at the signing there should be some clear understanding in regard to the processes and procedures that will be adopted. Telstra, as I understand it from the evidence that it submitted to the committee, entered into an agreement that was for all intents and purposes an indefinite agreement. There may well have been some weakness on the part of Telstra to adequately negotiate some aspects of the agreement that it had but overall there is a responsibility on the government of the country that has entered into a treaty arrangement with another country to offer some protection and some defence of Australia's companies and industries that seek to go overseas and invest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee is going to further consider this particular treaty before making any recommendation that either it should or should not be ratified. It is obviously very important that we do have these treaties&mdash;there is no denying that. By all accounts, from an international point of view the current government is operating very poorly. We have a minister who really is not on top of his portfolio; he is unable to address a lot of these issues and this is reflecting very badly on this country. Any course of action, not only just with this treaty but in a whole range of other areas, will be very important to the successful outcomes or otherwise and to the guarantees, assurances and security provided

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Paper No. 15 concerns the National Health and Medical Research Council. In that context, I want to address the announcement this week by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) that the government was not going to uphold fully the advice given by the NHMRC about the use of the immunisation program for children&mdash;the current use of triple antigen at two, four and six months. Triple antigen is used for diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The whooping cough component of that immunisation can cause some side effects, often a reddening of the injection site and often a mild temperature, which is very disconcerting for the child and the family. It is vitally important that we increase the immunisation levels of whooping cough within our community. This is a disease that can kill very small babies and the health department tells me that an older person's immunity to this disease does tend to wane somewhat. So you need to have a very high level of immunisation, particularly in children, to actually ensure that you do not have a reservoir of the disease in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that there have been six deaths this year in New South Wales alone from whooping cough, mainly of children younger than two months or of very small children&mdash;children who are too young to immunise. The government has undertaken an immunisation campaign and for that I congratulate it. I am very much in favour of immunisation for everything that a child can be immunised against because in my nursing career I have nursed children with diphtheria and I have seen children die of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have nursed people with whooping cough and I have nursed children with tetanus. I have nursed children with polio&mdash;admittedly not in the acute stage but in its post form. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Most people here are old enough to remember in their childhood the worry that our parents had with the 1955&hyphen;56 outbreak of poliomyelitis when, every time the child got a sore throat, our parents probably held their breaths in the hope that the child was not going to contract poliomyelitis. So I have seen those diseases and I have cared for people with them and I strongly support the immunisation of everybody who can be immunised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I have grave concern because of the announcement this week by the minister following his response to the NHMRC's work on the use of a drug for the vaccine for children in that first category. They are not going to use Infanrix, the new drug which is more expensive than the old one. This new drug, which contains part of the whooping cough virus that is sufficient to provide immunity, does not have some of the proteins found in the old drug that cause allergic reactions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, the minister has decided that this new drug&mdash;the dearer one&mdash;can be used for children of 18 months and in the booster for five&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. That is a very good move because until now&mdash;because of the risks of reactions&mdash;children of 18 months and five years were getting the combined diphtheria and tetanus immunisation and not the whooping cough component. It now means that a drug with a whooping cough component can be used to immunise children of 18 months and can also be used in a booster for children of five years. That will reduce the reservoir of the disease in the community and it will also increase the amount of immunity in the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I have concerns that they are going to not allow the use of this vaccine for children in their first three immunisation shots unless they have a strong family history of allergic reactions or unless they have had an allergic reaction to one of their previous vaccinations. This is a very cruel and very callous thing for the government to do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have recently seen further announcements by the government in relation to public sector superannuation which will have the effect of closing off those schemes for new employees, and thereby closing off the level of government contribution which applies in relation to those schemes for new employees. One would not expect there to be great future prospects in the Australian Public Service under this government because of its attitude to selling off, privatising, and contracting out various aspects of government services. Nevertheless, there will be some. I think it is regrettable that these schemes are ultimately being grandfathered, as it were, for the existing employees and that new employees will be denied the opportunity to join even the PSS scheme, which is the later of the two.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a fact that the previous government sought to give a choice for members of the CSS to move from that scheme to the PSS. But that scheme, too, will be grandfathered. We have now come to a situation where the government has announced that it will offer new employees a choice, excluding these two schemes, as I understand it, of five accumulation type superannuation schemes which will be operated by the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are not too many people in the community who have the sort of level of knowledge about superannuation to make informed choices on their superannuation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fund, particularly when they have newly joined the work force. It seems to me to be a policy based on ideology, not the realities of the workplace and the community, which drives this concept that their must be burgeoning choice in the selection of a superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know there are some people who are desperate to make such a choice, but there are a great many other people in the community who are confused by superannuation, who do not understand how the industry works and who do not understand how a choice made early in their working life might affect them in later life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would not pretend to be able to make informed choices for other people&mdash;and I have some knowledge of the superannuation industry&mdash;without doing a lot of research on the matter. Yet we are seeing the possibility&mdash;and I saw an article in the paper recently&mdash;of legal action being available to employees against their employer if, for example, the choice of funds offered to them were not the funds or did not include funds which were in their best interest and they made the wrong choice. I am sure many employers do not want to find themselves in those circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That being the case, I think it is appropriate that the government consider its position in relation to the question of choice in superannuation&mdash;not only for its own funds but also for others. I am not saying that it should not occur. What I am saying is that if it does occur then there has to be a lot more information disseminated to the community, a lot more education of the community and a lot better understanding of superannuation in the community before we thrust this choice on members of the community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly this evening, particularly in relation to a matter that I know you will be interested in, Mr Acting Deputy 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> President. I refer to page 20 of the corporate plan, which sets out the proposal for the rescue and firefighting service charges for the various airports around Australia that have been established by Airservices Australia. In particular, I refer to those charges which have gone from a network price of $1.80 per landed aircraft tonne to various prices depending upon the airport. The airport at Launceston now attracts a charge of $7.68, an increase, as a result of these charges, of $5.88 per landed tonne for aircraft which lands there. Hobart airport attracts a charge of $6.41, an increase of $4.61 as a result of these charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This rescue and firefighting service measure which was implemented by Airservices Australia and has been in place since 1 July will effectively achieve an average reduction in the cost of rescue and firefighting services distributed across the network. It achieves that by imposing much higher burdens on the airports where there is a lower frequency of usage. In fact, the charges for rescue and firefighting services increased for every airport except Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. They just happen to be the airports that are used for international aircraft almost to the exclusion of others. They are airports with a higher frequency of usage. It stands to reason that if you are going to distribute a standard charge for firefighting services in an airport which has a higher level of usage, you are going to get a lower per tonne of usage charge. On the other hand, if you go to remote airports, particularly those in Tasmania that rely on air travel, which have a lesser frequency of usage, you are going to have a higher charge. Those higher charges are going to affect the cost of travel to the more remote airports. It is not just Tasmania; these charges are being imposed all over the country. The effect of that is to reduce the charges for international carriers who fly into Sydney, Brisbane or Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To achieve a reduction of the average network charge we need to distribute higher costs on the remote airports. It seems to me that this is not good policy in terms of the Australian transport industry. It is certainly not good policy for the remote airports, be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7534"> they in the Northern Territory, Queensland, Western Australia or Tasmania. It is not good policy because it must have the effect of increasing the cost of travel to those airports. It is distributing the cost of travel disproportionately because those airports do not have a high frequency of usage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be&mdash;it is not clear from these figures&mdash;that there remains some sort of cost distribution across the network in relation to the new charges. That can only be allocated to the overall cost of administration of Airservices Australia. I have raised this matter with the chief executive of Airservices. I am not satisfied that the matter has been considered properly. I will be seeking to pursue this matter further because, ultimately, the small airports around the more remote parts of Australia&mdash;the parts of Australia that perhaps rely most upon air travel, particularly in my state&mdash;are being penalised by this measure. I think that something has to be done. It has to be done soon. When you consider other things that are occurring in the air travel industry, this is just another unfortunate imposition on regional and remote Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee on the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease settlement offer was handed down yesterday in this Senate. There were four speakers&mdash;Senator Bishop, the chairman of the committee, Senator Knowles, Senator Lees and Senator Harradine. Each of them spoke eloquently about the report. Tonight I wish to add a few further remarks as a member of the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the cut and thrust of politics, the heat of debate in this chamber and in the other place, occasionally an issue comes along that affects us all in such a way that we put aside political differences and endeavour to work towards a unanimous position. I am sure we try to do that on many occasions, but sadly it does not always occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the committee looked at the issue of the plight of persons who were recipients of the growth hormone program some years ago, who now live in the fear of contracting CJD, I am sure that all members of the committee&mdash;it is reflected in the report&mdash;recognised that this is an issue which is above politics. It is a situation where people, quite innocently trusting in the health system and trusting in the marvels of medicine and science, sought assistance to deal with the particular problems they had&mdash;whether it be children with a growth deficiency or women who were unable to fall pregnant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this program, young children and women received injections of human pituitary gland hormones, which were intended to assist them to overcome their problems. Sadly, it was discovered some years later that there was a potential for such persons to contract the deadly CJD virus, a virus that can lay dormant for 20 to 30 years. Because that program was conducted under the umbrella of the government&mdash;the hormone treatment was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made available through the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories&mdash;the parliament had to take responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When this issue came to light some five to 10 years ago, a report was commissioned by the previous government, a report written by Professor Allars. I can remember coming into this parliament in May 1994 and being handed bundles and bundles of government reports. Amongst them was a report on the CJD issue. I thought, `What the heck is that?' I did not have a clue about it. Subsequently, revisiting that report through this inquiry, I came to appreciate the courage that people have when faced with the sort of adversity that people who were under this program are now faced with. They live with the fear that they may have contracted this disease and may in years to come suffer quite a horrible death.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee was charged with looking at this issue. It had become a legal issue because of legal action taken by some of the recipients, including people who have since tragically lost their lives because they have contracted CJD. It also includes persons who have suffered psychiatric stress, nervous shock or some similar stress because of this fear of contracting the disease in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unfortunately, time does not permit me to go right through all those issues tonight, but I encourage each and every senator to find some time to read this report. You will find evidence of innocent victims of a government program, which was clearly conducted with the best of intentions, being given treatment that was also made available in overseas countries and with which unfortunately it was discovered, not until years later, that in some cases there was a terrible virus evident in the treatment that had been granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Witnesses who appeared before the committee were clearly distressed and lived with the constant fear of contracting the disease. They were witnesses who felt they could never have children in the future because of the fear of passing on the potential deadly virus. They were witnesses who first found out about the potential for contracting CJD years after they had been on the program&mdash;maybe 10 or 15 years later. They received a phone call from their doctor to say, `By the way, you had 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7536"> better come in and see me.' When they saw their doctor, they were told, `You were on this program 10 or 15 years ago, and there is a chance you will contract this deadly virus.' You can imagine the impact that that had upon those people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The major duty of this committee, in listening to that evidence, was to consider whether or not the position that the government had adopted&mdash;both the previous government and this government&mdash;in providing some settlement, some resolution of the victims' difficulties, was adequate. In a number of cases we found that it was not. Certainly, claimants were denied legal aid, and the committee has recommended that that position be reviewed. They were denied legal aid apparently because they were seeking to pursue a test case that may not quite have fitted into the guidelines at the time, and subsequently there was a change of government which changed the rules again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They were offered a settlement that basically involved an offer of damages in the event that they contracted CJD some time in the future. They were told by their own solicitors, who were passing on the Australian Government Solicitor's offer, that they really should accept that offer. They had, at one stage, only a month or two to accept that offer. If they did not accept that offer in full settlement of their claims, they were told that they were on their own and that they might have to bear the full costs of taking action against the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fortunately, I think this committee's recommendations have put that proposal to bed. The committee has recommended that the government allocate additional funds to give some compensation to these people who, in some cases, have suffered not only psychiatric stress but also a significant disturbance to their lifestyle. There is much more that one could say about this issue and, as I have said, I urge all senators to read the report. It is sobering, and it is a lesson for us all on how sometimes the best programs of governments can go wrong and people are affected. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This week saw the government announce its new initiatives for small business; a new deal and a fair deal. It prompts the question of why the government should support small business. In 1995&hyphen;96, there were 605,000 new reasons why the government should support small business. In fact, small business was the primary generator of new jobs in 1995&hyphen;96, with companies employing fewer than 20 people contributing 57 per cent of new jobs created.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most job growth was created by micro&hyphen;businesses&mdash;that is, firms employing fewer than five workers. The wholesale trade, retail trade, accommodation, cafes and restaurant industries had the highest proportion of businesses which generated new jobs. Data from the Industry Commission's small business employment report released on 28 August this year found that between 1983&hyphen;84 and 1994&hyphen;95, private, non&hyphen;farm sector firms 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> with fewer than 100 employees increased their market share of national employment by five percentage points, to nearly 47 per cent. During the same period, there was little change in the employment share of large firms. Australia now has a higher percentage of workers in small business than have the large industrialised economies such as the United States, United Kingdom, Germany and France.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If big business think that they are getting a raw deal, maybe they should consider the following statistics taken from the ABS business growth and performance survey released on 22 September 1997. It was small business that took the lead on unemployment while big business did nothing during 1995 to 1996. In fact, medium businesses&mdash;defined as those businesses employing between 20 and 200 workers&mdash;contributed 297,000 or 28 per cent to total job generation; big business contributed 14 per cent. This was despite the fact that in 1995&hyphen;96 43.5 per cent of big businesses increased their yearly income compared with micro, small and medium sized business, which recorded lesser fortunes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The business community, of course, is playing an important role in fixing up unemployment. It is not just for government to solve the problem of unemployment. Solving unemployment also requires the business community to take greater responsibility and ownership over this terrible problem. Business is all about managing risk and embracing new and innovative ideas, not only through adapting to new technologies and finding where new jobs are, but also by embracing new employment initiatives, alternative work arrangements and flexibility in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The five lecture series on `The future of work', recently presented by Radio National, dismissed the claim that there are just not enough jobs to go around. Robert Theobald, author of `Reworking success', stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue is not whether work is available&mdash;it is whether jobs provide a context in which 21st century activities can be most successfully accomplished.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Small business has demonstrated a willingness to do its part with available jobs to help fix unemployment, and the government remains 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7538"> committed to this sector and to looking after those businesses which look after Australians who are out of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is the government doing to help small business? Since coming into office, the Howard government has been fixing the fundamentals and creating an economic environment conducive to doing business. In addition to the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), `More time for business', which was delivered in March 1997, the government's fair trading reform package delivers a comprehensive reform agenda to protect small business against unfair conduct by big business. The package of protections includes: protection against unfair conduct; industry codes of conduct; retail tenancies safety net; franchising reform; access to justice and enforcement; access to finance; and education and information packages on fair trading issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response to the government's fair trading reform package announced by the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business (Mr Reith) has been, I think it is fair to say, jubilant. The Service Station Association press release described the new package as `the most comprehensive small business package in history'. The MTAA said `these are the most exciting decisions made on behalf of small business for many decades'. The Australian Small Business Association said in their press release, `The policy passes small business test with flying colours.' The Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association congratulated the government `in producing a well balanced and focused initiative'. Small business is pleased that these initiatives have been implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In tonight's debate I want to touch briefly on one of the key aspects of the government's fair trading reform package relating to unfair conduct and trade practices reform. A dominant theme of the report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Finding a balance: towards fairer trading in Australia</EMPHASIS> was the wide range of business conduct damaging to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A reading of the report leaves one in no doubt as to the veracity of the statement by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the President of the United Retailers Association that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is war out there between the retailers and the owners and managers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report identified five common features of unfair conduct impinging on small business. These include: little or no ability to negotiate terms of the contract; inadequate disclosure of relevant and important commercial information which small business should be aware of before entering into transactions; inadequate and unclear disclosure of important terms of the contract; contract renegotiations which actually favour the dominant party; and an inability or unwillingness to access quick, cheap and market&hyphen;sensitive ways of dealing with disputes for fear of reprisal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The sentiment of small business towards the existing legislative framework that was put in under Labor was summed up appropriately by Mr Allan Asher, Deputy Chairman of the ACCC, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in my view, it is a cruel hoax to give people a legal provision that is not enforceable. By enforceable, I do not just mean that there is a legal right but that there is some real capacity to be able to use it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am happy to say that the government has acted decisively on this issue by introducing a new provision in the Trade Practices Act that will give small business consumers genuine access to protection against unconscionable conduct, and provisions which will allow industry&hyphen;designed codes of practice, in whole or in part, to be legally underpinned and to be made mandatory under the Trade Practices Act and enforced as breaches of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the new section 51AC of the Trade Practices Act diffuses the concerns of small business. The Australian Automobile Dealers Association stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in practice there has been no effective protection for franchisees or other small business operators, through either common law or the current provisions of the Trade Practices Act&mdash;despite the enactment in 1992 of s. 51AA.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The changes will offer legal protection against unconscionable conduct comparable to that afforded to consumers. This is something that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7539"> small business has long been asking government to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The introduction of a further section, section 51AD, ensures that a person bound by the act must not contravene prescribed industry codes. There are, as I said before, two types of codes&mdash;voluntary and mandatory. Mandatory codes will be prescribed only where self&hyphen;regulation has not worked or is not appropriate. It will apply to all participants in the relevant industry. Those breaching the codes will be subject to injunctions, damages or undertakings to the ACCC to disclose information. Additional resources will be given to support small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Big business has really nothing to fear either. No&hyphen;one could seriously suggest that dominant parties should be able to act unconscionably towards smaller firms. This is a government that actually introduces initiatives that reward businesses for good commercial decisions to invest, to innovate and, most importantly, to employ Australians. The introduction of the fair trading reform package is proof that the government has listened, understood and launched into action.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7539"><TITLE>Mr Tom Considine

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last evening I had some brief words to say about what has become a rather controversial visit to Ireland, by the Australia&hyphen;Ireland Parliamentary Friendship Group, between 14 and 18 June 1997. I understand that the airwaves, particularly those of Sydney, today resounded with some counter-accusations about what was achieved on the trip. Like my colleagues who spoke last evening, I will try to contain myself within those time constraints we imposed upon ourselves.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As was indicated by the leader of the delegation, Senator Calvert, last night when he tabled the report, we did prepare a report. That, however, is merely a snapshot of the very intensive week of activities we experienced in Ireland&mdash;a week of activities which, I believe, achieved the objectives that the delegation set for itself before embarking on the trip.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The criticism that has been made of the delegation and its visit, I suggest, is grossly unfounded because those who criticised did not seek to examine what the objectives of that visit were. If they had and if, in doing so, they had talked to members of the delegation who embarked on the visit, they could, in turn, have checked whether or not the objectives had been achieved. To my mind, they certainly have been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In speaking here tonight and putting some matters on the record, I want to confine my remarks simply to the International Fund for Ireland. I think it is particularly important that I do speak about the International Fund for Ireland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said last evening that the Australian government, the Australian taxpayers, are making a real contribution, a very huge contribution, to the peace process that is going on in that divided nation of Ireland. Our visit was only to the Republic of Ireland, and it was at the invitation of the Irish parliament, Dail Eireann. Nonetheless, we did discuss with various individuals, including politicians, the conflict that exists between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The International Fund for Ireland is, as its name states, an international organisation which was established by the British government and the Irish government in 1986. Its objectives are to promote economic and social advance; and to encourage contact, dialogue and reconciliation between nationalist and unionist throughout Ireland. Its founding agreement requires the fund to spend about three-quarters of its resources in Northern Ireland, and about a quarter in the southern border counties. The Australian Ambassador to Ireland, Mr Eddy Stevens, attends board meetings as an Australian observer.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7540">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia in September 1994, under its then Prime Minister, announced that it would make a contribution to the international fund of some $7 million over five years. The first three instalments have been sent over there, and there is a further $3 million outstanding from that commitment. Our one recommendation in the report to the parliament, and from there on to the government, is that that contribution obligation be fulfilled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note in passing that the International Fund for Ireland has been audited. The audit was undertaken in 1995 by a company named KPMG Management Consulting. That company found in its audit that the fund had demonstrated that it had been very successful in its twin areas of operation: economic regeneration and reconciliation. In regard to the former, it found that the fund had assisted in the creation of approximately 24,000 jobs in the period to September 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, the audit concluded that the fund had made a major impact in fostering dialogue and reconciliation between the two traditions. Some 441 organisations which operate on a cross-community or cross-border basis had been assisted by the fund, involving some 5,700 community leaders. An update of the fund in 1995 found similar success in the creation of employment, and suggested it had a positive impact on the process of reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The level of employment created through the fund projects has now risen to 28,000 jobs. That is particularly important when you examine the report and see the area that the delegation went and visited&mdash;in particular, Dundalk, which is a depressed area that in 1991 had an unemployment rate of some 26.4 per cent. That is 56 per cent higher than the national average, which was then at 16.9 per cent. The Australian taxpayer is assisting with the project we went to see and which we examined in detail, and where we met a large number of people, in Dundalk, with the employment partnership program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That partnership program, in itself, is very interesting. It involves a wide range of organisations which include the Department of Social Welfare, County Louth Vocational Education Committee, the North Eastern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Health Board, the County Louth Enterprise Board, the Industrial Development Authority of Ireland, the local urban council and the county council, as well as local banks, business enterprises, trade unions and other enterprises. It was indeed, to our minds, a success story. It was a success story which paid off in the creation of jobs&mdash;jobs which have provided income to people, jobs which have stopped idle hands from getting into mischief. And, of course, with it being a border county, one can understand the type of mischief that people can get into.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our one recommendation is that the obligation that the previous Australian government entered into be fulfilled. This current government has indeed fulfilled the obligation to date. We hope that the remaining $3 million will continue to be given.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was a very warm delegation and a large delegation, with some 11 members participating in it. We all got on well during the period of time we were pressed together. We were on a coach for quite a considerable amount of time in the travels that we undertook, and we did get on well. I do believe that we achieved some things; we certainly achieved the objective of continuing the very warm relationships that exist between two countries. Unfortunately, I have gone a little over my time, and I hope my colleagues will forgive me for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to make very brief mention of a book that is going to be launched in Sydney on Monday next. Unfortunately I will not be able to be in Sydney for the launch, which will be undertaken by Mr David Hill. Among other things, David Hill's claim to fame is that he was brought to Australia as a child migrant of this country. For that reason he is launching this book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Orphans of the empire</EMPHASIS>, which, its cover says, is `The shocking story of child migration to Australia' and which:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . draws back the curtain on a part of Australian and British history that has been crying out for recognition. All Australians should read it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are the words of Sir Ronald Wilson, the former President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, who recently presided over a major inquiry into the stolen children. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7541">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to read one small paragraph from the book, which unfortunately I have not had time to read in the depth that I would like:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the stranger cases of the separation of siblings involves two brothers, Alex McDonald and Bert McGregor, who attended the same Christian Brothers' orphanage, grew to adulthood and lived briefly in neighbouring streets without knowing they were related. Alex joined the Jesuit Order and Bert jointed the Christian Brothers. They discovered their relationship in a roundabout way, when Alex used the services of Margaret Humphreys to find his mother. His mother was meanwhile trying to find her other son (Bert). All three found each other more or less simultaneously.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It then refers to chapter 12. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both men believe the Christian Brothers Order deliberately withheld information from them even as adults. This claim is denied by the Christian Brothers, who blame absence of records and/or human error.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is just one of many shocking stories that is contained in the book. I certainly look forward to reading it but, in glancing through it, it is a book that I would recommend to anybody who has a real feel for Australian history, particularly migration history.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7541"><TITLE>Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak tonight on one of the government's most significant reform packages to date, and that is `Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia'. This $517 million package was recently launched by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and my National Party colleague Mr John Anderson, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. It brings together the inadequate tangle of assistance which had sprung up over the years, especially under the previous government, in a mostly ad hoc fashion. We now have a proper program of support, investment and education for the nation's farming families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">John Anderson deserves congratulations for this package. To call it simply a $517 million package is only to tell half the story. The $517 million includes more than $200 million more than was allocated in the 1996&hyphen;97 budget, and to have brokered this deal through cabinet is an enormous achievement. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> All of us in the coalition, especially those of us who have connections with regional Australia, are pleased to have delivered such a substantial package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The AAA package, as it is called, has been very well received by farming families, rural organisations and rural commentators. Mr Ian Donges, the President of the New South Wales Farmers Federation, called it a well&hyphen;balanced series of measures which will set the framework for self&hyphen;reliance in Australia's rural industries. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> called it a step on the path to making the farm sector more efficient while extending to it the welfare benefits the rest of the community take for granted. Peter Austin, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Land</EMPHASIS>, said it was just what the rural sector needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The scope of the package demonstrates how serious we are about making major changes to benefit those on the land, and all the regional jobs that flow from a buoyant rural economy. The major features of the package are as follows. Firstly, the creation of the tax linked commercialised farm management deposit scheme will provide farmers with the tools they need for greater self&hyphen;reliance, allowing them to invest the considerable sum of $300,000 as a buffer against lean times and drought. Interest will be paid at market rates and deposits will be fully tax deductible in the year that they are made and taxable in the year of withdrawal. Reports about the possible impact of the El Nino make this scheme particularly timely. The capacity of farm families to survive drought and economic downturn was made much more difficult in the Labor years, what with high interest rates, high inflation, the cost&hyphen;price squeeze and the gutting of the original IED scheme, which had provided the capacity for prudent farmers to provide for lean times and also drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, there is a revamped drought relief repayment, called the exceptional circumstances relief payment, which will be available to farmers experiencing other rare and severe events, not only those in droughts. This will provide some welfare assistance to farm families&mdash;assistance that is, of course, available to all other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, there is a $50 million farm business improvement program, which will pro 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="7542"> vide assistance for skills development, farm business planning, farm performance, risk management, marketing and natural resource management, and things like landcare in addition to that. Education is the key to everything, as we know, and that is as true of those involved in primary industry as it is in other sectors of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fourthly, there is the introduction of the farm family restart scheme, which will deliver improved welfare to the farm sector to support them while they assess future opportunities, and to allow them to make up their own minds about their future&mdash;which is very important to people; they do not like to be pushed around on the land&mdash;and make any necessary changes that are suitable for them, including support if families choose to leave the industry and leave the land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Fifthly, there is an improved rural communities program which will provide flexible grants to assist rural communities, offer such essential services as rural counsellors&mdash;who have been an integral part in the restructuring of the bush over the last few years and most of whom have done an absolutely splendid job in the most difficult circumstances&mdash;telecentres and, of course, credit union facilities. Referring to the successful credit care scheme, I know that Senator Payne is here tonight and I would just like to put on record the integral part that she played in that very worthwhile organisation before she came into the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And, lastly, there is the commitment to generational farm transfer. This is one of the most important parts of the package, because it provides the opportunity for farmers to retire and to gift their farms without jeopardising their access to the age pension. At the moment, farmers are ineligible to receive the pension for five years, if they give away assets in excess of $10,000 a year. This has, understandably, discouraged many from transferring ownership to the next generation&mdash;especially as a lot of farmers are very conservative in their estate planning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under this scheme, the government has declared a three&hyphen;year moratorium on these gifting provisions so that this time older farmers who make this assets transfer will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have immediate access to the age pension. The moratorium is limited to net assets of $500,000 per farm, and other conditions apply, including an income test. By acknowledging the difficulties surrounding the gifting and aggregation of farms and proposing changes, the coalition has taken on some of the biggest challenges faced by farming families&mdash;a set of serious problems ignored by the previous government. If you recall, the previous Prime Minister called himself `the farmers' friend'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It is the coalition who has listened to farmers in dire straits, to those who have slipped through the holes marked `farming family' in our welfare safety net. It is this government which has heard the pleas of the men and women who live in regional areas and who really call for government assistance but at this time whose options have run out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor had little understanding of primary industry. They floundered as drought ravished the country and as commodity prices plummeted. You may recall that then Prime Minister Keating lectured those who live in the bush by saying that drought is a natural occurrence and therefore farmers should prepare themselves for it. And so they should, but they would like a little bit of help to make that possible. To encourage them, as this package does, is something that we should all be very pleased with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we came to office last year, we found that our packaging costs were 40 per cent higher than in Europe or in the United States; we found meat processing costs in our best plants were three times higher than those in the United States equivalents and almost twice those in New Zealand; and we found that it cost twice as much to transport grain here than it did over similar distances in the United States and even in the UK. In fact, if it were not for the National&hyphen;Liberal party coalition, then in opposition, proper drought relief payments would never have existed. It is as simple as that. We can take a substantial credit for embarrassing the previous government into taking the very important and difficult decision it was for them and the costly decision it was for them&mdash;but it was in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7543"> the interests of all the Australian community that that was done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, for the cynics and knockers who believe that farmers do not deserve help and that assisting primary production is a waste of time, I say to them, `Well, you're simply wrong.' The editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> of 16 September is a good example of the writers being patronising. It begins: `How do you wean farmers off their welfare mentality?' It goes on to accuse this government of  `slugging non-farmer Australians to pay for special handouts to farmers'. Can I say that the reporting of rural matters by our major dailies is inadequate and it does them a great disservice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I give as an example the fact that, between 1990 and 1997&mdash;a very difficult time for wool producers&mdash;there has never been a credible interpretation and discussion of that issue in any of the major newspapers. I think that is a great mistake. The print media have served Australian farmers particularly badly over recent years. Their reporting is often simply insulting and untrue. As some would say: there is life&mdash;Australia's lifeblood&mdash;outside the boardrooms of Sydney and Melbourne. The Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia package does not come out of a vacuum. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="7543"><TITLE>Agriculture&mdash;Advancing Australia

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> One of the major issues that the parliament will be debating&mdash;an issue it is debating in the other place and will certainly be debating in this chamber in the coming weeks&mdash;is that of native title, and particularly the government's response to the Wik decision. I want to talk about something positive because I believe we are going to hear a lot of ignorant comments in the coming weeks, as we have done, when people attack the justified concerns of our indigenous people. I want to talk about some positive things that are happening in this area of reconciliation between white Australians and our indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I come from the Sutherland Shire and I have spoken about it on many occasions. It claims to be the birthplace of the nation. That is where Captain Cook landed, at Kurnell, in 1770. We do not have an Aboriginal community in the Sutherland Shire, as such, but we have a sister relationship with the Jawoyn people of the Northern Territory. The Sutherland Shire Council had the foresight, a number of years ago, to see that to assist the process of reconciliation we should try to build links between white Australia, particularly white Australians in the cities, and our indigenous people. So they set up a relationship between the Sutherland Shire and the Jawoyn nation in the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June&hyphen;July this year a number of school students from the shire visited the Jawoyn nation in the Northern Territory for two weeks. I would like to put their names into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> because these young students represent the hope, I believe, of bringing about eventual reconciliation. They are: Liz Favaloro, Andrew Strudwick, Amy Trindall, Glen Sullivan, Ian Sullivan, Carolyn Read and Mr Eddie Pender, who is the National Parks and Wildlife Service ranger who organised and accompanied the students on their tour. They spent some 10 days in the territory. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7544"> They visited the major sites such as Kakadu and Katherine Gorge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But they also spent time living with the Jawoyn people at the Werebun community and the Barunga community. They had the opportunity to experience first hand the cultural heritage of the Jawoyn people. They were introduced to traditional Aboriginal lifestyles such as searching for bush tucker, living out in the open, attending ceremonies and listening to the stories.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to read from a report that has been written by one of the students, Liz Favaloro, because it sums up superbly the experience that these young students had. She says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This morning we went to a place named Manyalluluk where we met some of the Jawoyn students. This journey has been so much fun and I have learnt so much already about a different culture and different lifestyles. I can't believe that we have already been here for four days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Exchange students met at Manyalluluk to go on a bush walk where we ate, smelt and observed different roots, leaves, berries and trees. Becoming familiar with them, I have learnt of the roots which dye different materials, leaves which act as an antiseptic, edible fruits, leaves which stun fish, edible honey ants, etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After such an enjoyable walk we were offered a delicious lunch ranging from Kangaroo, Damper and different salads. Absolutely delicious!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All the Jawoyn students and Sydney exchange students exercised after lunch by a very fast game of football. We are beginning to become great friends and liking each others company very much.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are all going to "Birdie Creek" for an overnight stay which was really fantastic. As soon as the sun set the fires began to blaze and all the children ranging from all ages performed a corroboree, it was terrific&mdash;then to top the night off Phyllis (an Aboriginal elder) spoke to all of us around the campfire. She told a story of the white men and how life was when she was younger. Phyllis is a wonderful storyteller, I could have listened to her words of wisdom for hours.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Camping under the stars for the night with the cool breeze, clean air and natural surroundings nothing could have been better.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Obviously, a fascinating and rewarding experience&mdash;an opportunity for students from Sydney to get together with students from the Jawoyn nation and experience what we all hope for in this country&mdash;true reconciliation 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and a recognition of the great culture of our indigenous people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the story does not end there because this week in the Sutherland Shire there is a return trip from students of the Jawoyn nation. I would like to read their names into the record: Houia Haerewa, Antony Groves, David Groves, Scott Lee, Darian Hood, Leah Jumbililie, Larissa Lee, Shaunette Mumbin, Gaston Bowden, Helen Lee and Ruth Kelly. Those students are accompanied by Phyllis Winjarra, the elder of the Jawoyn people who read those stories to the students back in June and July.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a terrific initiative. I had the opportunity to meet those students from the Sutherland Shire at a flag raising ceremony when they returned. I met them with Burnum Burnum, who recently passed away. Burnum Burnum believed that the way to true reconciliation was for our younger people to come to understand the great cultural heritage and tradition of our indigenous people. The students of the Sutherland Shire and the students of the Jawoyn nation and all those

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">With reference to the environmental approval of the Jabiluka mine on the edge of Kakadu National Park:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) Has the Minister received a copy of correspondence between the World Heritage Committee in Paris and a coalition of environment groups, not limited to but including Friends of the Earth International, Northern Territory Environment Centre, Wilderness Society, the South Australian Conservation Councils, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, and the National Union of Students, requesting that Kakadu National Park be placed on the `World Heritage in Danger' 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> list; and (b) what action will the Minister take in response to this correspondence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) Did the 1988 report of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on the Kakadu Region state that:`. . . A policy which permitted mining in Kakadu Stage 1 or 2 would almost certainly be seen as incompatible with this obligation and Australia's reputation as a signatory to the World Heritage Convention would undoubtedly suffer if mining were to take place'; (b) what does the Government perceive as Australia's obligations under the World Heritage Convention and their implications for the management of Kakadu; (c) does the Government believe that either the operations of the expanded Ranger mine or new Jabiluka mine will infringe on any of those obligations; (d) does the Government believe it can meet its World Heritage obligations with the operation of the Jabiluka mine; and (e) what scientific data supports any conclusions that the Jabiluka mine will not affect the World Heritage standing of the region nor Australia's obligations under the treaty of the same name.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) Does the Government argue that, because the operations of Jabiluka and Ranger are technically outside the arbitrary boundaries of the park, mining operations and waste therefore do not have any environmental impact on the park; and (b) given that ecosystems do not function within human-made arbitrary boundaries based on political decisions, how can any such proposition be argued.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) (a) Does the Minister and the Government accept that uranium mining and World Heritage values are incompatible in general; if so, what will the Minister do regarding the World Heritage listing of Kakadu and its obligations under the treaty; if not, why not; and (b) does the Minister and the Government accept that uranium mining at Jabiluka and World Heritage values are incompatible; if so, what will the Minister do regarding the World Heritage listing of Kakadu and its obligations under the treaty; if not, how can the Government ignore the draft Environmental Impact Statement for Jabiluka which said, `. . . the general 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7547"> incompatibility of a mine with World Heritage values has been an issue no matter what level of impact can be expected from Energy Resources of Australia Ltd's development'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) (a) Did the World Conservation Congress of the International Union for Conservation of Nature in October 1996 pass a resolution that included the following: `. . . urges the Government of Australia to prevent the development of Jabiluka and Koongarra uranium mines should it be shown that such mining would threaten the park's World Heritage values; (b) will the Government abide by this request if this link is shown; if not, why not; and (c) if the Government contends that it has not been shown, is the Government prepared to take action to refuse the approval for the mine if baseline data shows that a detrimental environmental impact may be caused by uranium mining at Jabiluka or Ranger.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) (a) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Australia will be reporting to the World Heritage Committee that there is no evidence to support such a request. The Government believes there is no basis for any suggestion that Kakadu National Park should be on the `World Heritage in Danger' list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) (a) Yes, in paragraph 61. I understand however, that this paragraph refers to mining within the boundaries of Kakadu National Park. Paragraph 49 of the same Standing Committee Report outlines that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The Committee does not make any recommendations as to whether permission should be given for the Jabiluka and Koongarra mines to go into production'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The World Heritage Convention obliges a State Party to ensure the identification, protection, conservation, presentation and transmission to future generations of the cultural and natural heritage situated on its territory. For Kakadu National Park, the Government will continue to meet these obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) No.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) The potential impacts of the Jabiluka proposal on the environment can reasonably be extrapolated from the experience of the nearby Ranger uranium mine. The Supervising Scientist has determined that no activity or incidents occurring at the Ranger mine have resulted in a significant environmental 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> impact outside the immediate mine area. Investigations by the Supervising Scientist of the Magela  Creek system since before mining began have detected no significant effects on the environment. Results of these investigations have been documented in annual reports since 1978 and also numerous inquiries into uranium mining or related matters. Similarly, monitoring of water chemistry by ERA and the NT government has shown that water quality in Magela Creek has remained within applicable standards. Results are routinely made available and assessed by the Supervising Scientist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The draft environmental impact statement (EIS), the supplement to the draft EIS and the assessment report produced by Environment Australia of the Jabiluka proposal provide overviews of the available evidence of the likely environmental impacts of the Jabiluka mine. If, as expected, further baseline work confirms previous findings, and assuming the Jabiluka mine proceeds under the recommended conditions, the evidence supports the conclusion that the mine will not affect the natural and cultural attributes that provide the region with its World Heritage standing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) and (b) The Government considers that the operations of the Ranger mine do not have an impact on the World Heritage values of the Park. Regarding the proposed Jabiluka mine I advised the Minister for Resources and Energy, in correspondence of 22 August 1997, that on the evidence available there appears to be no environmental issue which should prevent the proposed Jabiluka mine from proceeding provided the project is subject to stringent conditions relating to the biophysical, cultural and social significance of the environment associated with the mine. In developing my recommendations to the Minister I was particularly mindful of Australia's obligations under the World Heritage Convention and the need to fully protect World Heritage values.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) (a) I, and the Government, consider that with proper management, uranium mining outside the boundaries of Kakadu National Park will not have an adverse impact on the World Heritage values of the Park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) No. As indicated above, if further baseline work confirms previous findings (as expected), and assuming the Jabiluka mine proceeds under the recommended conditions, the proposed Jabiluka mine will not affect the natural and cultural attributes that provide the region with its World Heritage standing. I understand that your quotation from the Draft Environmental Impact Statement may be incorrect. On page 9, the Draft states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`The general compatibility of a mine with World Heritage values has been an issue no matter what 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="7548"> level of impact can be expected from ERA's small scale development proposal.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) (a) I am advised that it did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) and (c) Consistent with the Government's obligations as a State Party to the World Heritage Convention, the Government has ensured and will continue to ensure that effective and active measures are taken for the protection and conservation of World Heritage values. Proposals which are not consistent with our obligations under the Convention will not be permitted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) No. The Supervising Scientist was established by the Commonwealth Government with the express purpose of filling a "watchdog" role in relation to uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers Region. The level of environmental protection that has been achieved at Ranger owes much to the intense level of supervision of Environmental Requirements, development and promotion of rigorous environmental standards, regular environmental performance reviews (EPRs), assessment of technical aspects of operations, and research into key environmental issues at mines, including Ranger water management, rehabilitation and final tailings disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Supervising Scientist will continue to ensure a high level of environmental performance at Ranger through its research, supervision and assessment programs. A five year program has been established which outlines the focus of EPRs to be carried out every six months. These EPRs assess the environmental performance of the mine operations against desired outcomes and the Commonwealth's Environmental Requirements. The process is completely transparent and accountability is achieved by reporting to a community based committee following the conclusion of each EPR.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The same level of commitment will apply to any mine operating in the Alligator Rivers Region. The body of expertise and experience within the Supervising Scientist Group will continue to reassure the community that potential impacts are objectively and independently assessed, reported and managed.</PARA>
