<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Minister, is it true that your department has published a study since the election which concludes that compulsory work for the dole would not work? Did your department brief you prior to this weekend on the benefits of work&hyphen;for&hyphen;the&hyphen;dole schemes? If so, has the department commented on what success rates such schemes would have in finding young people permanent employment?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a misunderstanding on Senator Faulkner's part. May I first, Madam President, just remind you that yet again there is an implication in a question&mdash;that I allege I was consulted. If the senator wants to claim that I have lied, let him do so; otherwise I ask you not to let him gutlessly put an implication that a senator or a minister has lied when they have given an answer to a question&mdash;namely, that I was consulted. Senator Faulkner, I will look up the dates of the relevant committees for you. If it is of any particular interest, I may choose to pass them on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With respect to the matter which you have clearly not understood, the focus of this program is on young Australians&mdash;not exclusively young Australians, but there is a focus on them, particularly about 30,000 of those who have entrenched, long-term unemployment&mdash;and the benefit for those people to have the opportunity to give something back for the unemployment benefit that they receive. You might in principle refuse to accept that, but I tell you what: there are a lot of unemployed people out there who have consistently raised with members that they would like to do something in exchange for getting the unemployment benefit. They would like to do something, and this is a fair response to that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Resources and Energy. The minister has just announced approval for a production licence that will add 20 per cent to Australia's self-sufficiency in oil. Can the minister provide details of this development and in particular what does it signify in terms of investment confidence under the economic policies and management of the Howard government? What contribution can a development of this type make in the fight to wipe out the disgraceful foreign debt Australia was left with after 13 years of Labor?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank Senator Ellison for that question. I would like 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to confirm that I have approved a production licence in the Laminaria&hyphen;Corallina area in the Timor Sea. This production licence has been granted to Woodside at 50 per cent, BHP at 25 per cent and Shell at 25 per cent. It will mean the construction of a floating production storage and off&hyphen;loading facility in Australian waters in the Timor Sea. It represents an investment of $1 billion. There have been reserves proven up of 250 million barrels: 200 million in the Laminaria and 50 million in the Corallina. It will produce in the order of 150,000 barrels of oil a day, which will increase the self&hyphen;sufficiency of Australia by some 20 per cent. It is expected that the oil will come into production in 1999 and that the project will operate for some 14 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the question on balance of payments, and bearing in mind the foreign debt that was left to us by 13 years of Labor, it will contribute in the order of $1.8 billion per annum in export earnings. The speed with which this project has been approved reflects confidence in the Howard government and in the investment environment that we have put down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The question which was asked was: what are the benefits for Australia? Of course, as I have mentioned, the major benefit is $1.8 billion in export income.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KI4">Senator PARER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a dumb question. Senator Cook, it does not matter whether part exported or used domestically; it still has a $1.8 billion positive effect on our balance of payments and hence on our foreign debt. The project will be subject to Commonwealth resource rent tax and is expected to make a significant contribution in RRT. It has been estimated that the total project is valued at about $7 billion and the direct government take will be $2 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian companies have a major opportunity to  supply goods and services to the project, both in the construction phase and in the operational phase. I understand that there has already been, or is going to be, a contract let to a major Perth company. Laminaria will also establish infrastructure&mdash;I think this is very important&mdash;that could support the further 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="341"> development of petroleum projects in the region. For many years, of course, Australia was not looked on as being highly prospective. The fact that this project will go ahead will encourage further exploration and development and, hopefully, more finds of oil which will be of benefit to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also worth mentioning that this floating oil production storage and off&hyphen;loading technology will, in fact, be the largest in the world, so we are starting to lead the world in this sort of technology. There is no doubt that this is but the beginning of the sort of investment that the public has been looking for with the election of the Howard government in March last year.</PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question without notice is to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Do you agree with your colleague, Minister&mdash;that is, Senator McGauran, the Minister for Science&mdash;that there is no doubt that Australia will be the loser if we do not encourage more people into science and engineering? Is increasing the HECS fee for science and engineering courses from $2,500 to $4,700 encouraging more people into science and engineering?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Carr, for that question, because it gives me the opportunity to address some misunderstandings in the community&mdash;presumably not peddled by yourself, although your past record is not that good. The preliminary analysis of applications for science is that there is no systematic impact of the changed HECS arrangements on science and engineering applications.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Madam President. The trend of a decline in the number of science applicants has been apparent for a number of years. This has been going on for two, possibly three, years. This is, therefore, either the third or fourth year when applications across the board may have fallen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The causes for this are complex and long term, but they look very much linked to falling enrolment patterns in schools. For example, the proportion of year 12 students undertaking a physical science course has fallen from about 50 per cent in 1986. In 1986, about 50 per cent of year 12 students did a physical science course. It went down to 44 per cent in 1992. That was when Labor was in government. Just remember this: when you were in government federally, the proportion of year 12 students doing physical science fell from about 50 per cent to 44 per cent and then, in 1995, it fell to a mere 31 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It follows that, with a declining interest in physical science&mdash;the example I have cited in this case&mdash;at year 12 level, how can we possibly expect students to come on from year 12 and suddenly decide, not having done science in year 12, that they will enrol in science at university? This is just another legacy of Labor's bad management.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to highlight that applications for university are not the same as enrolments. Between 1993 and 1996 the number of students commencing science and engineering courses actually increased; that is, applications fell but the places accepted at university actually increased. That was accomplished in part by drops in TER scores and cut&hyphen;offs in many courses. While it is still very early in the academic year, it appears that following the final round offers in New South Wales there are still some vacancies in science and engineering courses, but it is difficult to see 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="342"> a clear pattern in movements between 1996 in 1997 TER cut&hyphen;offs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the concerns is not just that there has been a fall in science applications and a fall in interest in science at year 12&mdash;all generated when the people opposite were in government&mdash;which obviously leads to a fall in applications for science, but there is a greater problem and that is that brighter students are turning away from science. That has nothing to do with the HECS charges. A pattern over years, as I am advised, is that, across the board, brighter students are turning away. The Victorian government to their credit have recognised this and have set up a committee to see what they can do about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Do I agree that we will be a poorer society if we have proportionally fewer people doing science and engineering across the board? I would say yes. Science and engineering are vitally important faculties at universities, Senator Carr. You know that and I know that. But let us not pretend, with increased applications in some of the highest band level courses, that HECS has anything to do with it. Primarily, it is a function of students not taking science in year 12.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. Minister, in the past you have said that the dramatic drop in science enrolments was the fault of individual universities in the `light rush' of your funding cuts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. Labor was in power for 13 years during the time youth unemployment peaked at 34.8 per cent. When Labor lost the election they bequeathed to the incoming government a massive youth unemployment program problem. Yet all Labor could say was: `We were a good government that was misunderstood. The electorate got it wrong.' No remorse, no regrets, no apologies&mdash;just bad communication and relevance deprivation syndrome. What is the Howard government's plan to help young Australians looking for work?  How will the government's work for the dole scheme help young Australians?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="342" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Heffernan, for that question. You are quite right, Senator Heffernan; when Labor left government youth unemployment was creeping towards 30 per cent. That was a lower level, incidentally, than the highest level we have had, which is 34.8 per cent under the previous Labor government. You are quite right, Senator Heffernan, to say that people opposite still do not understand why they were not re-elected. They mistakenly think the electorate got it wrong. They think the electorate is stupid. They have put no faith in the Australian people electing a different government to fix the mess that they in fact created. As Senator Heffernan says, there was no remorse, no regrets, no apologies&mdash;just the relevance deprivation syndrome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Labor was in power for 13 years and it had not managed to get youth unemployment down below 25 per cent for each of its final five years in government. The coalition has an absolute determination to address this problem. I did raise last week the Leader of the Opposition's attitude to young unemployed people. This was the Beazley `at least they are not on the street bothering other people' line.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The line that Mr Beazley&mdash;thank you&mdash;uses: at least they are not on the streets bothering other people. That is typical stereotyping of young unemployed people as muggers and robbers. I understand that Martin Ferguson was on radio this morning in fact continuing the stereotype of young Australians as people who are not keen to work. Do you know what he said? This is really embarrassing. This is one of your spokespeople. He said, `Are you trying to tell me that 1&half; days or two days a week is going to give people the discipline to work?' And then he said&mdash;and here comes his real attitude: `Then they go home and go back to bed or watch TV for the rest of the week.' That is Martin Ferguson's view of the young unemployed&mdash;once they have had the opportunity to make a contribution to a community project they will just go back to bed and watch telly. That is what you think. You have no business asking a question on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Heffernan, the government's approach to young unemployed includes trialling some schemes for work for the dole, giving people the opportunity to make a contribution to their community and to pick up some experience and some confidence&mdash;in a sense, to give something back for the unemployment benefits that they get. What Labor wants to concentrate on today, this nitpicking exercise of opposing everything the government does when they failed so abysmally themselves, is just a part of a much broader package. The package includes higher economic growth, lower interest rates, a balanced budget&mdash;something that with even the best abacus in the world they could never achieve&mdash;encouraging small business and, very importantly, revitalising apprenticeships and traineeships, providing more entry level training places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that work for the dole will assist young people with a work ethic. It will give them an experience of work. It will promote the culture of work and, more importantly, it will do something to attack the cycle of despondency and despair that is in the young unemployed around Australia who are sadly there because of Labor's incompetence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. I refer to the proposed compulsory work for the dole scheme in rural and regional areas that the Prime Minister announced yesterday after claiming that he had examined how such a scheme might work over a few weeks. Minister, what evidence do you have that young people need to be compelled to work, that they do not have a work ethic and that they are somehow refusing job opportunities? Given that this scheme focuses on a relatively small number of rural and regional unemployed young people, what does your government propose for the hundreds and thousands of other unemployed Australians? Is this government planning to work that out over the next few weeks?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Stott Despoja, some of your questions are in fact a delight. I note that some notes from the Democrat party room have been released this morning. I take it as welcome acknowledgment&mdash;albeit, you could not actually bring yourselves to say it&mdash;that you just might support at least this: a voluntary work for the dole scheme. As I read the second paragraph of the notes that you have been so gracious as to release, it says that all Democrat senators confirm their strong opposition to schemes which rely on compulsion. It follows, therefore, that there might be some things we need to talk to you about, but you might have some sympathy with some voluntary aspects to schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the Prime Minister has indicated is that we are interested in piloting about 30 work for the dole schemes around Australia, primarily for young Australians because they are the ones who are getting their first start, if you like, into the work force. There are other unemployed people, obviously&mdash;many, many more&mdash;but the focus is on young ones. It is not only for them but primarily for them because they are at the beginnings of their careers. </PARA>

They think the electorate is full of dumb people who somehow accidentally elected the wrong government. They cannot bring themselves to accept the will of the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Stott Despoja, you would know well the deplorable state of unemployment left in Australia after 13 years of Labor. You asked me: what are the things that this government is going to do for others? I have indicated to you that this is primarily for young Australians but not solely for them. There is a wide range of other things which I canvassed in the previous question. If you were either not here or not  listening, I will run through them for you again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are looking for higher economic growth. We want lower interest rates, and we have had three drops in interest rates since we have been in government. No policy you 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> could drum up would do more to get people employed than that and put more money in people's pockets. We want a balanced budget. We are encouraging small business; revitalising apprenticeships and traineeships; and drastically and creatively revitalising assistance to unemployed Australians, with 90 per cent of the money towards that going to the long-term unemployed left to us by Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So this government clearly recognises the problems of unemployed Australians, especially the long-term unemployed. There is no one simple fix. I think the work for the dole schemes that we will be piloting, along with all the other things that we wish to do to tackle this problem, are a worthwhile exercise.</PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The important thing in addressing the standard telephone service for the first time ever&mdash;and that is what we did when we conducted a high level review&mdash;was to look at the possibilities of raising the standard. You can do that in a variety of ways. You can do it by raising the quality of service people have, particularly in rural and remote areas; you can do it by improving technologies. We take the view that you should not be technology specific. Indeed, Labor, time and again, made mistakes by being technology specific&mdash;whether it was a commitment to phase out analog mobile telephones or whether it was a requirement that satellite pay television had to be transmitted by digital format.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The committee, which reported to me last week, has provided a number of very useful recommendations. All of those will be taken into account by the government in determining its approach on this important issue. There were something like 16 recommendations covering areas such as pay phones, connection times, quality of service, national access to digital data services, community access points, services to Aboriginal communities and services to those with disabilities. Perhaps Senator Schacht has only read the odd press release and has not yet had time to read the 200 pages of the report, but the fact is that there are a lot of very valuable recommendations in there&mdash;a number of which the government will be addressing very seriously.</PARA>

That obviously has cost implications, and quite clearly it would not be responsible of us to simply endorse that without conducting a proper examination of the costs of providing those services.</PARA>

Minister, one of the key election commitments of the Howard-Fischer government, the family tax initiative, was delivered in full on 1 January 1997. Is it a fact that on 2 January this year nearly 900,000 Australian families directly benefited from the family tax payment?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is pretty clear that on this side of the parliament there is real 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> concern for what has happened to Australia's families over the last 13 years. So it is appropriate that, when something good happens to Australia's families, we should make it very clear as to how and why it has happened. That is, at the last election, Madam President, as you would know, we went to the Australian people promising to look after Australian families better. Many thousands of those families went backwards under Labor rule. I point out to you, Madam President, that NATSEM put out a report just last December stating:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Putting together the divergent trends in market income, cash transfers and income taxes, [between 1982 and 1993] the average Australian's household experienced a real decline in disposable income of $38 a week.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is, a decline of $38 a week between 1982 and 1993 happened to Australia's households. So we promised a turnaround partly by introducing the family tax initiative, and we have done a lot of other things as well, Madam President, as you know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From 2 January, as Senator Macdonald has said, we delivered that promise in full. The implementation of the family tax initiative has gone very smoothly. On the first payday, nearly 900,000 low to middle income Australian families with dependent children received a payment under part A. Of these, nearly 400,000 also received the increased benefits under part B. So already, 900,000 battling families have received extra help to recognise the costs involved in raising children. One million more families will be claiming benefits through the tax system over the coming months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not only have Australia's families welcomed the family tax initiative but so have many community organisations. The National Council for the Single Mother and her Child has welcomed FTI, applauding the fact that sole parents are some of the biggest beneficiaries and that FTI minimises poverty traps and takes away some of the ammunition for sole parent bashing. ACOSS have said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While we would still have preferred a payment more closely linked to the social security system, ACOSS regards the family tax initiative as a very positive step for low income families with children and thanks the government for its efforts. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="350">  </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Brotherhood of St Lawrence have said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is no doubting the value of this payment to low income families. It is the largest increase since the late 1980's increases in rent assistance and family payments and will lift some basic incomes by around 5% per cent of the poverty line.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">With the smooth introduction of the family tax initiative, we will not be resting on our laurels. An ongoing campaign is to be conducted to ensure all bodies are aware of the FTI, including accountants, ethnic groups and groups in remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Madam President, with such an overwhelmingly successful introduction, it is unfortunate to have to report just one sour note, and I think we are getting a bit of a taste of it by the interjections from those on the other side. The doom merchants opposite do not like to see something successful happening for Australia's families. I draw your attention to the member for Werriwa, who decided that he would like to get post&hyphen;Christmas publicity, despite the fact that he was getting it at the expense of scaring Australia's families, who were looking forward to the benefits of the FTI in the new year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But his grumblings were simply a one&hyphen;day wonder and battling Australian families are now well aware of the benefit which this has meant to them and their pockets after 13 years of being alternately ignored and put down, forgotten and damaged financially. The inheritance of the Labor years is well known to Australia's families and they voted those opposite out at the last election. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

An ATSIC commissioned report launched last week found that the failure of governments to adequately implement the recommendations of the royal commission into deaths in custody represented a lost opportunity to reduce the unnecessary number of indigenous people in prisons.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Forshaw, you should also listen. The report showed that there has been little to show, with the deaths in custody continuing to rise. The report which I helped launch on Friday states that the level of Aboriginal overrepresentation in prison has not fallen at all over the nine years since the royal commissioner was appointed, nor over the 5&half; years since it presented its recommendations. What an indictment. Levels of Aboriginal overrepresentation in prison have increased over that time and the levels in police custody have remained roughly constant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot ignore the problem. We cannot simply throw more money at it and hope that it will go away. It is time to take some decisive action with clearly defined outcomes in mind. Since we gained government, we embarked on a program to address these high incarceration rates and deaths in custody. One of the first steps was to try to improve the standards of legal representation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and a compliance audit of Aboriginal legal services was conducted. This action was taken in response to allegations that Aboriginal people were often overrepresented in prison due to a lack of adequate legal representation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's recent appointment of police inspector Colin Dillon as an ATSIC commissioner has also put deaths in custody and high incarceration rates at the top of the agenda. Inspector Dillon has had more than 31 years in the police force, most recently in charge of Queensland's cross&hyphen;cultural advisory service. He has had extensive experience on the issues concerning Aboriginal people and the legal system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Over the last three months, a series of meetings has occurred to organise a ministerial summit and an indigenous summit to address deaths in custody.

Commonwealth, state and territory ministers for indigenous affairs, law and justice, policing and corrective services have been invited to attend. The aim of the ministerial summit is to endorse a coordinated strategy which will bring together the Commonwealth, states, territories and indigenous groups in a consolidated effort to reduce high incarceration rates and, consequently, deaths in custody. It is imperative that the summits do not become ineffective talkfests. We must focus on outcomes and we are committed to producing results.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us look at the history of this government, because there is a degree of misinformation, particularly from this minister. Last time John Howard was in government, he left 158,000 young Australians unemployed. That was in March 1983. When he came into government in March 1996, that figure was down to 87,000. In some 10 short months it has gone up from 87,000 to 99,000. He is back to his old habits&mdash;a 14 per cent increase in youth unemployment in less than a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What does he offer the unemployed in return? He offers them sham jobs, meeting and greeting people at airports, without adequate training. He has dismantled the well-thought&hyphen;out programs providing skill training and work opportunities, and he has ripped $1.8 billion out of an important part of government responsibility in this area&mdash;bad on policy; bad on process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He obviously has no confidence in his Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone). He has no confidence in the department's views. He has replaced them with the views of his pollsters. This program is so badly thought out, so badly designed and so badly engi 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> neered that we know that the minister and her department were against it and we know that the minister was not consulted in the end. She is marginalised as a wet in this government, and there is absolutely no way that she would be treated in this disrespectful way if she were a member of the dry faction. My advice to this minister is, if you want to get your voice heard on behalf of unemployed Australians, put yourself on the list of the focus groups that Mr Robb polls every week. At least that way you might get your input to the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Fitzgerald from ACOSS has described this as a scheme that has failed in the past, is costly to administer and is not linked to recognised training. It is insulting to the unemployed that, having cut $1.5 billion from developed training programs, this government has now come up with a third-rate policy. This comes on top of cutbacks to uni fees and cutbacks to government school fees and increases in HECS. You have failed. You have tossed in the towel on unemployment and you have replaced it with a sham little project. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AX5">Senator CHRIS EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that, Senator, but what I want to do is address the failure of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to advance any reasons for the decision announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to introduce the work for the dole scheme. The coalition parties went to the last election assuring people that they were not going to introduce such a scheme. Mr Kemp, the then shadow minister, put out a very indignant press release on 31 August 1995 saying that Labor was lying when it suggested that the coalition might introduce a compulsory work for the dole scheme. I think Mr Crean's claims have been vindicated 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="356"> by the Prime Minister's announcement the other day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is nothing more than a diversion. There was no attempt by the minister today to advance a claim that the work for the dole scheme would create one extra real job. There is no pretence from this minister that there are any real jobs to be created by this scheme. She concentrated only on the argument that it gave the unemployed an opportunity to give something back. That takes us back to Fightback and the blame&hyphen;the&hyphen;victim philosophy of the Liberal Party&mdash;one which they pretended to abandon at the last election because they knew it was unacceptable to the Australian public. Again, this proposal is about blaming the victim; it is not about creating any jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there were any real attempt to create permanent, lasting jobs with this scheme, you would get more support from the Australian community. The minister had two or three opportunities to answer questions about this issue today, and she did not attempt at any stage to justify the work for the dole scheme as being a job creation scheme, because it is not. It is a diversionary tactic. It has taken some of the other issues that are plaguing the government off the front pages. We are going to have the old hoary chestnut debate about the work for the dole scheme&mdash;the one we have every two or three years. No-one pretends it is going to do anything about helping long-term unemployed people get real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What really riles me most is the hypocrisy of the minister on this issue. When we took her through the cuts to Working Nation during the estimates process, she put up a very plausible case that she really was a caring minister and that she was just trying to finetune Working Nation and she was genuinely concerned about the long-term unemployed. She claimed that what they were trying to do was redesign programs to ensure that people got real jobs. That was the philosophy of the government&mdash;not to support schemes that allow people to get training or short-term employment but to support those that directly resulted in long-term jobs. That was the whole philosophy, the whole thrust, of the government's approach.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we had the hypocrisy of the Prime Minister getting up yesterday and saying, `Well, despite all that, what we're really about is introducing a work for the dole scheme.' There was no pretence at all that it had anything to do with real jobs. He spoke of running a few pilot programs and giving a few unemployed people the chance to feel worth while, but there was no pretence, no claim that it had anything to do with job creation. This government has nothing to say about the creation of real jobs, other than driving down wages and conditions. That is what they sought to do with their new Industrial Relations Act. That is their only answer&mdash;and it has always been their only answer&mdash;to dealing with long-term unemployment and rising unemployment in our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is hypocrisy at its worst, because this scheme is directly contrary to everything the employment minister claims she was about when she took over the portfolio, every justification that she used for winding back Working Nation, which was designed to provide training and support for people seeking employment opportunities. When they wound all those programs back, they said, `No, that's got nothing to do with real jobs. The only way of getting real jobs in this society is by encouraging small business and other employers to provide employment.' They went down that path. They said that none of the Working Nation schemes could be supported because they did not do anything about creating real jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have now is the Prime Minister throwing in a furphy, throwing in a diversionary tactic, by saying that this scheme will do something for the long-term unemployed in this country when, of course, it will do nothing of the sort. It does not fit with any of their justifications for their other measures in terms of employment programs. It is directly contrary to everything the minister said, and I think it really reflects the fact that the minister has been shut out of the loop again. She has nothing to say about employment generation; this government has nothing to say about employment generation. The Prime Minister, it seems, went off with this diver

In fact, just before the last election and in elections of previous years, none of them got up and talked about unemployment. They could not because their record on unemployment was disgraceful. As for Senator Evans coming in and saying that voluntary or compulsory work for the dole scheme will not help young people get jobs, their solutions did not get young people jobs. Mr Beazley himself said on radio station 6PR in Perth on 29 January:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is true that a lot of those who did our training programs did not get a job at the end of it. Many did, but many did not get jobs at the end of it. But they were gainfully employed while they were on and they were not around the streets bothering everybody else. They were out there doing a job of work in the community that was important.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He admits that they did not get jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose that people on the other side do not understand this because very few, if any, of them have ever run a small business and employed anybody. They have always been employees. The disincentives, especially to small business, of employing people have included the industrial relations system that we had under Labor. That has been a disincentive, especially that part of the industrial relations legislation which dealt with unfair dismissal, which inhibited people from employing people, and in particular from employing young people. We have seen the need for micro&hyphen;economic reform on the waterfront; we have seen the need for micro&hyphen;economic reform throughout areas that affect small business. Small business is the engine room of our community, of our economy, and small businesses were not employing. They are not going to turn around and employ immediately. It is going to take a while, as Senator Vanstone has said, to actually get down the appalling unemployment rate that Labor left us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we look at their record on unemployment&mdash;and those on the other side forget to talk about this when they get up and bucket 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and bag schemes we are putting forward&mdash;Labor gave Australia the highest unemployment rate since the Depression: 11.2 per cent in December 1992. At no time since the Great Depression did the unemployment rate rise to 11 per cent and above until Labor came to power. It reached that level for nine months in 1992 and 1993. `The recession we had to have,' as Mr Keating called it, destroyed 310,000 jobs from July 1990 to December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we are on about is making good and repairing the disastrous situation that Labor has left the economy in. But they get up and bleat about the fact that we are putting forward plans&mdash;and I have to say, Senator Stott Despoja, that I did find your comments about the sorts of jobs people might be doing, like helping older people, to be disparaging. I would like to take you along to some of the respite carer groups where older people could benefit and young people could be trained in some skills in assisting older people. They could assist in areas like shopping. Where somebody is caring for someone with dementia, it is incredibly valuable to have another pair of hands to take that person to the toilet or to keep a person occupied while their spouse is doing the shopping. There are all sorts of areas where they can assist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Every time I go into nursing homes, I ask if in fact they could use young people, who would be working for the dole, and I have not had one nursing home that has said that they could not actively engage young people in a nursing home or hostel. For example, a lot of older people in hostels who have poor mobility could be assisted in being taken shopping or in their hydrotherapy&mdash;there are all sorts of areas where young people could gain skills and could assist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the project that the coalition is putting up there will be about 30 or so pilot programs in rural and regional areas where is high unemployment. There will be a mixture of voluntary and compulsory schemes, and we will be inviting various community organisations to put forward proposals for approval by the government. Award rates will be payable, and that means that people in most cases have to work only 15 or 20 hours a week.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="358">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A lot of young people have indicated that they would like the opportunity to be able to do something for the dole. To dismiss it out of court is the sort of blinkered approach the Australian public got used to and became accustomed to with Labor in government, and that is why they said in March last year, `Enough is enough.' We want to try to overcome the problems that Labor has given us, and one of the greatest problems Labor has given us have been unemployment. Last week they had every opportunity to discuss the issue but, no, they had to focus on somebody's private life.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak to the motion that the Senate take note of the answers given by Senator Vanstone to my question and that of Senator Faulkner. While senators opposite have been accusing the ALP opposition of not discussing this issue, I want to make it very clear that the Australian Democrats have been discussing for years the issue of the growing modern problem of unemployment in this country. We are the only ones talking about real jobs, meaningful jobs, sustainable jobs, jobs in future industries, not just for young Australians but for all unemployed Australians. That was the purpose of my question to the minister today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must take issue, through you, Mr Deputy President, with the comments by Senator Patterson. My question relating to the pilot schemes that were being mooted was not whether they were valid jobs for young Australians; it was what education and training opportunities would accompany those jobs, what accreditation would be given to those jobs and what were the long&hyphen;term employment prospects for young people in those jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do take issue with one comment by Senator Bolkus&mdash;the claim that this is a poll driven exercise. I hope and I believe that the mums and dads and the daughters and sons of Australia are angry with the Prime Minister's comments on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> because they do not want stopgap short&hyphen;term measures. They are actually saying, `Mr Prime Minister, what long&hyphen;term and sustainable real job creation options are you giving our families, not just 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for the rest of this decade but for years to come?' I am yet to hear anyone in this debate, in the last week or in the last few years, talk about sustainable future environmental industries, high technology fields, value&hyphen;added manufacturing&mdash;all these areas where we could be looking at voluntary schemes; we could be looking at education and training opportunities for young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has this government done? In the last budget&mdash;and probably in the next one&mdash;they cut labour market programs by $1.5 billion, they hiked up HECS fees and they made it more difficult to embark on education training opportunities. They have introduced a token green corps with 240 places in 1996&hyphen;97. Whacko! I am not sure how that is going to solve the incredibly serious and staggeringly high problem of youth unemployment in this country, where 30.4 per cent of 15&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds are looking for full&hyphen;time work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Vanstone said in this chamber today that the ALP should be appalled at the rising level of youth unemployment in their period in office. Let us look at it now, Minister. It is the highest it have been for 2&half; years. This is a crisis point, and it is not simply a crisis point in regional and remote areas; there is an urban crisis for youth unemployment in this country as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The biggest thing about this debate that has made me so angry today is the minister talking about the stereotypic notions of youth in this country that she believes some politicians have. Yet what is the biggest stereotype of young Australians? That they are reluctant to work; that they are stubborn; that they will not fulfil work opportunities that are presented to them; that in fact life is a beach for those young unemployed Australians who are living on whacko huge dole benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The media has perpetuated that image today in a way that is shameful. Nearly every front page of commercial media today has had a picture of young people surfing, or in board shorts or looking like they are just having so much leisure and that they are playing around with these benefits. Ninety-nine thousand nine hundred 15-to-19-year-olds are looking for work, and this is the response that this government has given them.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="359">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats have made clear that we have long supported incentives for volunteer work. In fact we have long acknowledged that young people are actively involved in volunteer work as we speak. Our own youth poll shows that between 80 and 90 per cent of 15-to-25-year-olds have been actively engaged in some form of volunteer work over the last 10 years. But do we reward that in our society? No, we actually penalise that through the social security system we have operating in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why doesn't this government perhaps investigate more opportunities to remove the disincentives of pursuing volunteer work? I reiterate that the pilot schemes certainly Senator Patterson referred to are worth while. Something that is also worth while&mdash;not for the development simply of self-esteem and this so-called work ethic that young people seem to lack in this country, because that is the impression I have been given&mdash;is giving young people hope that in the next century, as the traditional entry level jobs disappear, and they are disappearing, we actually start looking at the technological and structural change that is taking place in our work force and start meeting the demands of a changing workplace. That is one thing this government has failed to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If token solutions such as work-for-the-dole schemes and a green corps that will hardly look after more than 3,500 people over the next three years&mdash;and even then you can get in only on merit&mdash;are the two answers that this government has come forward with, no wonder young Australians are feeling pretty despondent today.</PARA></SPEECH>

Thousands of those young Australians reported at those meetings that they found Working Nation to be a cynical attempt to massage the unemployment statistics, to get them off the long-term unemployment statistics. That was virtually everyone who came to all of those forums. There was only one Young Liberal out of about a thousand of those young Australians. It was Miss Marise Payne, as I recall. They reported Working Nation as a cynical exercise. They really regarded Working Nation as a joke and they came up with a whole range of ways that they thought we should encourage job opportunities for young people. But virtually to a girl, boy, man and woman they said that what we need are real jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government has been trying to get the economy right after inheriting an enormous mess from the previous government&mdash;massive foreign debt; massive deficit on the current account; a massive hole in the budget, something like $10 billion, which we are trying to repair. It is very painful for us as a government. It would have been great to have come into government with a balanced budget and got to making Australia great. But of course we found a $10-billion hole that made our first day at the office harder than expected. So we started doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We inherited an economy that had the second highest prime interest rates in the world. That makes it very hard for small business to employ young people, or any people at all, and to borrow to expand their businesses. We inherited a tax system which inhibited small business. Already we have brought in roll-over relief for small businesses 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="360"> so they can roll over from one business to another without a huge capital gains tax liability. We inherited relatively high inflation. We had about the third highest inflation in the OECD. Already that has been driven down to one of the lowest rates. We have already attacked red tape on small business. We have not gone far enough yet, but under the guidance of the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Prosser, and other ministers we will be seeking to get rid of red tape on small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, these are all measures that make it easier for small businesses to employ young people. After an enormous debate in this chamber, we have changed the workplace relations legislation that governs Australia&mdash;making the unfair dismissal provisions brought in by the previous administration far fairer for both parties. We have already reduced the deficit. We are now beginning to attack the big problems of efficiency in the country&mdash;things such as the railways, the ports, the airports, electricity&mdash;with a whole range of competition measures to make Australia a more efficient place.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there is only one conclusion that can be drawn from the answers to questions by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) today, and that is that this is a policy initiative that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) pushed through, perhaps at a cabinet meeting late last week, because of the Woods affair. `Let's get the Woods affair off the front page, so let's come up with a policy initiative which was not'&mdash;I repeat not&mdash;`part of the government's policy platform coming up to the election last March.' This is a subterfuge. When you look at a proposal which might employ 500 young people out of an unemployed 99,900 for some indeterminate period on some ill&hyphen;defined scheme, one has to wonder just how desperate this government is getting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose one could ask if the Prime Minister forgot to tell Minister Vanstone about this initiative, so unconvincing were her answers today. Perhaps the memory losses that the Prime Minister has been suffering recently have flowed over into this area. It is clear that the minister who has the responsibility for this portfolio had to duck the answer to Senator Faulkner's first question because she did not know the answer or was embarrassed by the true answer to the question. So, in talking about the minister's answers to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="361"> questions today, the first conclusions to be drawn are that this is a subterfuge and that the minister is embarrassed and really does not want to answer a question about a policy that has been pulled out of the back pocket to try to change the headlines in the papers and get the Woods issue off the front pages.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government that went to the people with a policy of creating real jobs. The policy document was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pathways to real jobs</EMPHASIS>. There are 99,900 young people who do not have jobs at all, and there are apparently 500 who will have the opportunity, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to participate in this pilot program. I think the senators on the government side have quite a nerve to now criticise Labor for its initiatives in relation to the Working Nation package. I must say that I have got a lot more direct experience with the application of Working Nation, apparently, than the minister or senators on the other side of the chamber. The reality is that a lot of people participated in those programs, which involved training, preparation and work, and led to employment opportunities and real jobs being created. But let us face the facts. You do not create real jobs with labour market programs, be they Working Nation, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Pathways to real jobs</EMPHASIS> or this off the cuff, `let's change the headline' policy initiative; you create those jobs with the right structure in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A policy such as Working Nation gets people job ready. You get people who are unfamiliar with the process of getting out of bed every morning and dealing with the working community, and you equip them with contacts in the workplace to allow them, after their placement is finished, to go on with the confidence to present themselves for future job opportunities. The reality is that a great many people did get jobs out of Working Nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What are we talking about here with this initiative for young people? Senator Stott Despoja quite rightly drew the attention of the minister to the issue of what pathways these employment initiatives, these work for the dole schemes, would create for young people. Whilst it is true that there is some honour in performing the duties involved, there is no 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> money out there in the community to employ these people on an ongoing basis unless the government is going to provide it. So the reality is that what Senator Stott&hyphen;Despoja said is correct: these schemes are not pathways to real jobs. They are simply headline grabbing initiatives which have got nothing to do with providing the solution to unemployment for young people or, for that matter, anyone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why hasn't the government given more attention to the initiatives of Working Nation and got back on track to the sort of program that Labor had going&mdash;a program which equipped people for work, trained people for jobs and got people into employment and real jobs that are ongoing?

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="362"> Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Petition of the undersigned shows that only one group have been excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) where such group has performed honourable overseas `active service'. That group being members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 which were excluded under `Operational Service' at Section 6. (1)(e)(ii) of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various claims made in Statements to the House and the Senate and the contents of correspondence from various Ministers to maintain the exclusion are answered as follows, the answers are from documents obtained under FIO and from public record:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) `They were never allotted for operational service', (contained in a letter from the Hon. Con Sciacca Minister for Defence Science and Personnel 1995). A letter from the Secretary Department of the Navy to Treasury dated 11 November 1955 stated `the date that the Navy were allotted for operational  service was 1 July 1955'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) `Members of the RAN were only doing the duty for which they had enlisted', (October 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). This applies to all Service personnel everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) `They were in no danger', (November 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). They shared the same danger as all other Australian Service personnel serving in Malaya at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) `They were not on Special Overseas Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop Minister for Defence Industry Science and Personnel to Mrs Williams of Adelaide dated October 1996). Requirement for Special Overseas Service was introduced in 1962 without retrospective conditions, therefore has no relevance to events of 1960.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v) `They were not on Active Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop Minister for Defence Industry Science and Personnel dated October 1996). It is now, as it was then, that Service Personnel had to comply with one of three requirements for Active Service, this group 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="363"> complied with two, or twice as many as is needed. The one that they did not comply with was, `is in military occupation of a foreign country'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request that the Senate should remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act, thereby giving the Australian sailors involved comparative recognition with the Army and RAAF personnel that served at the same time, and all other Australians who have served their Country on active service overseas.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGibbon</NAME><FROM>(from 40 citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill includes a range of measures announced in the budget to amend the provisions of the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901 relating to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The budget announced the government's intention to achieve savings in the scheme by tightening eligibility and containing growth in outlays which have resulted from decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) and the Federal Court which have had the effect of widening eligibility under the scheme beyond its intent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its recent performance audit on the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, the Australian National Audit 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="367"> Office recommended that the purpose and objective of the scheme be clarified and that a range of measures be introduced to improve administration and accountability</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The genesis of this scheme lies in providing relief from excise on diesel fuel used "off road". This link, which hypothecated excise for road funding, was terminated in 1959. The Rebate Scheme introduced in 1982 was more restrictive than the previous exemption scheme. Subsequent amendments mean that it is now highly focused on activities which contribute directly to the competitiveness of the mining and primary production sectors. It is no longer appropriate to consider the scheme in its historic context. Excise and customs duties raised on diesel fuel are general taxation measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme provides rebate of duty on diesel fuel for certain activities, mainly in the mining and agricultural industries. Its primary purpose is to maintain competitiveness in these key export industries, in a manner consistent with the government's broader fiscal objectives. The scheme also has a very limited number of community and social welfare objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal changes to the scheme proposed by the bill involve:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Amendments to address the effects of recent AAT and Federal Court decisions which have had the effect of widening eligibility;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Removal from eligibility of certain activities under the mining operations category;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> An amendment to enable rebate to be refused or recovered where diesel fuel is not used in eligible activities due to loss in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed that the changes ~n items&mdash;1, 2 and 5 take effect from a date to be proclaimed which will be shortly after Royal Assent to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes to items 3 and 4 require publicity, client education and technology changes and will therefore be proclaimed to take effect six months later.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">1. Effects of recent AAT and Federal Court decisions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been several decisions in recent times which have had the effect of expanding eligibility under the scheme beyond what the government believes was intended, with consequent effects on outlays. In some areas, the potential financial impact of decisions is very significant. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The particular amendments will ensure the continuation of rebate for diesel fuel used in carrying out mining activities but will preclude from eligibility certain activities, best described as undertaken for economic/marketing reasons, rather than the physical extraction of minerals, and activities which essentially involve the transport of inputs/materials for mining or beneficiation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's clear intention is that rebate paid under the legislation should be confined to the narrow definition of eligible activities in the legislation (that is the intention is not that the legislation be defined broadly and beneficially).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed in this bill are designed to tighten and narrow eligibility. It is the government's intention to continue to adopt such an approach in the face of any future broadening.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most significant decision which has potential for expansion in eligibility related to an appeal by Dampier Salt (Operations) Pty Ltd against a decision of the AAT in relation to the point at which payment of rebate on the recovery of salt ceases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Full Federal Court's judgement is considered to be the most far reaching ever delivered in relation to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme. It represents a fundamental shift from a scheme based on the concept of an activity (in this case mining) being regarded as a physical act (that is the extraction of a product from the ground) to a concept of the activity being an economic one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Court found that even though Dampier Salt's product could be sold in the condition it was in at the first stockpile, it was uneconomic for the company to do so. It was only economic to sell into the market it actually supplied. The Court determined the second stockpile activities were so closely related to the process of extraction of salt from the brine in which it was embedded, that they fell within the concept of mining operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has never intended to pay rebate to these types of operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the definitions, particularly beneficiation, make it clear that the physical act of mining or beneficiation is eligible for rebate. It ensures that payment of rebate does not extend to activities involved in getting the product to the market place, such as the broad economic factors which were the basis of the full Federal Court judgment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several other recent decisions addressed what might essentially be categorised as transport activities. The only transport activities intended to be covered are the transport of minerals and ores for beneficiation at facilities remote from the place at which mining activity is carried out, and certain activities specifically provided for. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="368">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments were made to the act in 1995 and 1996 to ensure that activities "connected with" mining were no longer eligible for rebate. The interpretation of the so called "sweeper clauses" had been a source of contention over the years and generated most of the litigation under the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These clauses were replaced with an objective list of activities that are eligible for rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the decision of Dyno-Westfarmers the AAT found that driving explosive trucks over an average distance of 150km each way between the explosives depot and the mine sites was either "mining for minerals" or "the preparation of a site to enable mining for minerals to commence", as those long journeys were "an integral part of this activity".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government considers that it is wrong to apply the concept that an activity is eligible for rebate because it is integral to another eligible activity. It is the intent of the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme to pay rebate only on those activities that are explicitly mentioned in the legislation and not to activities that are said to be integral to, associated with or connected with these activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are necessary to put the intent of the scheme beyond doubt. The approach adopted by the AAT in the DYNO&mdash;Westfarmers case would defeat the purpose of the amendments made in 1995 which removed the "connected with" sweeper clauses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly the AAT and Federal Court have considered the question of transport of materials/inputs to mining operations and beneficiation in recent times. Rebate is intended to be paid for beneficiation of minerals and ores, including transport where such beneficiation occurs at a place removed from the actual place of mining operations. Rebate is not intended to be paid for the transport of goods. materials/inputs for mining operations or beneficiation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outcome of consideration of these issues has varied and this creates uncertainty as to the overall intent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Westrail matter. the Federal Court found that transporting coal to a place of beneficiation by rail was part of beneficiation itself, because the transport was "integral" to having the bauxite beneficiated. This logic was comprehensively reviewed and rejected by the AAT in the Queensland Rail matter. The two decisions cannot stand</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">together. This bill therefore amends the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme to ensure that only the transport of the minerals and ores to be actually beneficiated receives rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In another recent decision in th~e matter of Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical Company Pty Ltd, the AAT found that processes resulting in the production of ferromanganese and silicomanganese by 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> smelting operations constituted the beneficiation of a mineral and were therefore eligible for rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the definition of "minerals" will restore the original intent of the scheme that a mining operation must be in relation to a natural mineral. The amendment will also sharpen the focus on the beneficiation activities that are intended to be rebatable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">2. Removal of certain activities from eligibility in the mining category</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government announced in the budget that the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme would be revamped to curb overclaiming and contain growth. To achieve its objectives in containing growth in the mining category, it entered into consultation with representatives of the mining sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mining sector recognising the government's fiscal requirements accepted the need to tighten eligibility by identifying areas to be excluded from eligibility to ensure that the benefits are contained to mining activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes put forward by the mining sector have been accepted by the government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government accepts that these changes contribute to achieving the savings identified at the time of the budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government accepts that growth in rebate payments for eligible activities under the revised arrangements will occur. Once growth levels are established and forward estimates of expenditure are set it may be necessary as part of the budget planning process to put in place measures to ensure the overall budgetary strategy is achieved. Consideration is being given to appropriate means of ensuring that the expenditure levels once set will not be exceeded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government and industry will work together to assess net growth which will be used in setting budget outlays and forward estimates. This will involve annual discussions which will also involve a review of the effectiveness and efficiency of the scheme in meeting its objectives and intent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">3. Measures to improve accountability and administration</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A range of amendments are proposed which will improve accountability requirements, assist in enabling a clamp down on misuse of the scheme and improve its administration. These changes apply to all claimants under the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian National Audit Office performance report highlighted a number of areas where improvements would significantly reduce administrative costs and lead to more effective management of the scheme. These include:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> adopting risk management principles and practices;  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="369">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> adopting best practices observed in other programs; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> making more effective use of information technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statistical analysis and monitoring of overall trends indicate that overpayments (that is payment of rebate to which claimants are not entitled) are made under the scheme. Additionally the analysis shows that there is a significant level of overclaiming (that is claims above the level of entitlement which are made but detected prior to payment and do not result in outlays).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To a significant extent, these arise from the prospective nature of the scheme and a lack of legislative support for the self-assessment nature of the scheme, including ineffective penalty provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Arrangements to modernise the administration of the scheme have been under way for some time. These focus on legislative reform to underpin self-assessment, to place the onus on claimants to make and retain documentation which will substantiate their applications for rebate with effective risk assessment measures in place to assess compliance. This will be backed by effective penalty arrangements which rely on strict liability requirements for claimants to maintain records to substantiate claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure that risk assessment measures are well grounded and effective claimants will be required to provide from time to time information on the nature of their operations relevant to their use of diesel fuel. While the government recognises these requirements impose obligations on claimants to provide more extensive information than that presently required, this is not considered too great a burden for a scheme which outlays around $1.4b of taxpayers' funds. It will serve to ensure that those entitled to rebate receive their full benefits and the scheme is not diluted by misuse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly for a self-assessment scheme will be the ability of claimants to obtain advice from Customs on the eligibility of their activities and insure themselves against being penalised, on the basis that information contained in the request accurately describes the claimant's circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in particular formalise a post transaction audit regime, make provision for voluntary repayment of overclaimed rebate without penalty and for adjustment to be made to claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments do not remove the ability for criminal prosecution where fraud or serious instances of overclaiming, which seek to misuse the benefits of the scheme, are involved. Recent successful prosecutions have resulted in significant custodial sentences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Repeal of notices of intention</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under amendments made in 1993 a provision was inserted to restrict payment of rebate to fuel- 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> purchased within three years before the application was received. To ensure that claimants were not disadvantaged, this provision allowed for claimants to give notice prior to I July 1994 of an intention to make an application in relation to purchases back to 1986. The effect of that notice was to preserve a claimant's entitlement and not have it constrained by the three year-provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In excess of two thousand notices were lodged under this provision and to date the bulk of these have not been translated into claims under the scheme. These notices of intention represent a potentially significant outstanding contingent liability on the commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill therefore proposes to sunset this provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those who lodged notices of intention have had over two years to lodge claims and it is intended by the bill to only allow another six months for this to occur. All those who lodged notices will be contacted, in writing, advised of the impending change and given the opportunity to lodge a claim before the expiration of the provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">5. Refusal or recovery where diesel fuel not used in eligible activities</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is uncertainty as to whether rebate can be refused, or if paid, recovered, where diesel fuel is purchased for an eligible purpose but is lost and consequently not used in eligible activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that rebate is not payable or can be recovered where diesel fuel is lost, whether because of accident, theft or any other reason and is not used in eligible activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SEX DISCRIMINATION AMENDMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to be able to move the introduction of a piece of legislation that will make the law fairer by removing or limiting protection for unjustified discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill if enacted will remove or limit exemptions in subsections 40(2) and 40(3) of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Sex Discrimination Act was enacted, exemptions for specified legislation were included to ensure that a person would not be in breach of the act by complying with the requirements of another law. Over the years, the scope of these exemptions has been reduced and the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1996 takes that process one step further.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill implements the outcomes of the Review required under section 40A of the Sex Discrimination Act. In accordance with that section, on 31 May 1996 the Attorney-General completed a review 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="370"> of the operation of exemptions in subsections 40(2) and 40(3).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the form of the bill does not exactly follow the drafting style proposed in the recommendations of the Review document regarding repeal, the outcomes are the same. These differences have arisen simply as a result of advice from Parliamentary Counsel. I stress that the outcomes are the same.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Review document, which was tabled in both Houses of Parliament on 26 June 1996, contains a useful summary of the history of section 40 exemptions. As indicated in that document, the Review was carried out in consultation with relevant Federal Government departments, Ministers with responsibility for the legislation currently specified in the exemption provisions and with the government of Norfolk Island. The Sex Discrimination Commissioner assisted with that part of the Review dealing with the federal social security legislation and was also consulted in relation to exemptions by reference to taxation legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will return to the social security aspect of the Review later.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, subsection 40(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act currently provides an exemption for anything done by a person in direct compliance with specified legislation in force as at 1 August 1984. These exemptions will be described in the context of the changes to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxation legislation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraphs (a), (c), (d), (f) and (i) of subsection 40(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act provide for exemption by reference to the Gift Duty Assessment Act 1941, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the International Tax Agreements Act 1953, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935 and the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Act 1982 respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exemption currently applies to all grounds of discrimination covered by the Sex Discrimination Act&mdash;that is, sex, marital status, pregnancy and potential pregnancy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After consulting with the Treasurer, it has been agreed that the exemption by reference to the taxation legislation referred to will be amended so that it is limited to an exemption for marital status discrimination only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reasons for retaining an exemption for marital status discrimination are set out in the Review document tabled in June 1996. They include factors such as the unfairness of exposing people to the retrospective operation of legislation and the need to adhere to provisions which give effect to international agreements. In other circumstances, it has been agreed that it would be inappropriate for taxation policy designed to protect the public 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> interest to be overridden by the objectives of the Sex Discrimination Act. Thus, certain anti-avoidance provisions designed to protect the revenue will continue to be protected by the exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subsection 40(3) currently provides an exemption by reference to section 6 of the Sex Discrimination Act (which deals with marital status discrimination) for anything done by a person in direct compliance with any regulations, rules, by-laws, determinations or directions made under the Gift Duty Assessment Act 1941, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 or the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again, after consultation with the Treasurer, it has been agreed that the exemption by reference to the Gift Duty Assessment Act 1941 is no longer required. The reference to that act will therefore be deleted from the subsection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Services Act 1980 of Norfolk Island</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, paragraph (j) of subsection 40(2) of the Sex Discrimination Act currently provides an exemption for the Norfolk Island social security legislation. This exemption covers all grounds of discrimination covered by the Sex Discrimination Act 1984&mdash;sex, marital status, pregnancy and potential pregnancy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After consultations with the Norfolk Island government, it has been agreed that there is no need for such a wide exemption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Norfolk Island legislation discriminates on the ground of sex in that it provides for differential access to age pension for men and women. The Government of Norfolk Island has sought a continuation of an exemption for this discrimination but will give consideration to phasing in a common age for eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, the Norfolk Island Government has sought to narrow the existing exemption so that it covers marital status discrimination only, arising in the context of the rate of benefit payable. The Government of Norfolk Island has identified potential discrimination on this ground in the application of different income thresholds and the fact that a person's marital status will affect the amount of benefit paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Health Act 1953</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph (b) of subsection 40(2) provides an exemption by reference to the operation of the definition of "pensioner" in subsection (4)(1) of the National Health Act and by reference to the operation of the definition of "concessional beneficiary" in subsection 84(1) of that act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definitions affect the administration of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Because they mirror the provisions that apply different pension ages for pension eligibility for women and men 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="371"> under the social security regime, it is ensured that women and men who are eligible for pensions are also eligible to receive pharmaceutical benefits at concessional rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, because differential access to age pension based on sex is being phased out, the bill amends the existing exemption by providing for it to expire concurrently with implementation of the phasing out of differential access to age pension&mdash;that is, the exemption will have no effect on or after 1 January 2014.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Papua New Guinea (Members of the Forces Benefits) Act 1957</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes repeal of the existing exemption by reference to the Papua New Guinea (Members of the Forces Benefits) Act 1957 as the exemption is no longer considered necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, I turn now to consideration of paragraph (h) of subsection 40(2), which provides an exemption by reference to the Social Security Act 1947. As indicated in the Review document, this aspect of the Review raised complex and difficult legal issues concerning the validity or operation of this paragraph. On one view, the paragraph is redundant, because the 1947 Act was repealed and replaced by the Social Security Act 1991 prior to the coming into force of paragraph (h) of subsection 40(2). On this view, repeal of the paragraph would have no substantive effect. However, there is an alternative view, which is that the paragraph operates to provide an exemption, albeit of a limited nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the ambiguity surrounding the operation and effect of paragraph (h) of subsection 40(2), the steering committee established by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner to assist with the social security aspect of the review examined the provision of social security against the benchmark of legislation and practices which may constitute "in principle discrimination".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes no action in relation to paragraph (h). However, as indicated in the Review document, the Attorney-General, in conjunction with the Minister for Social Security, will make recommendations for appropriate action regarding this paragraph when they report back to Parliament in June 1997.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SYDNEY 2000 GAMES (INDICIA AND IMAGES) PROTECTION AMENDMENT BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislative changes made by the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Amendment Bill 1996 will make it easier for the organisers of the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games and licensed users to take action against those persons who are engaged in ambush marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ambush marketing is the unauthorised association of businesses with the marketing of an event such as the Sydney Olympics. Typically, the ambush marketeer seeks to gain some benefit by suggesting an association with an event without paying for the marketing right or licensing fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Olympic and Paralympic Games in the year 2000 are events of great national significance for Australia. These events provide unique opportunities to demonstrate to the world this country's skills, talents, environment and achievements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the critical factors in making the Games an outstanding success is the ability of the organisers, the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, known as SOCOG, and the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee, known as SPOC, to raise the funds necessary to host the Games. It is a massive task. It is also very expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of staging the Games is estimated to be over $2 billion. It will be shared between the organising committees, the Government of New South Wales and, to a minor extent, the Commonwealth Government through its commitment to share half the expected deficit on the Paralympics, up to a maximum of $25 million. The Commonwealth Government's overall budgetary contribution to the staging of the Games will exceed $400 million. It is expected that the revenue raised from official sponsorships and licensing fees would need to be of the order of $700 million to meet the SOCOG and SPOC budget for the Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ability of SOCOG and SPOC to attract sponsors depends to a large extent on the exclusivity of the licensed indicia and images. If adequate steps are not taken against ambush marketing, the official 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="372"> sponsorship revenue could be significantly eroded. Ambush marketing was a problem in Atlanta and we want to avoid the problem here. For example, two major international organisations, which did not have licensing agreements with the Atlanta Olympic organisers, both attracted large numbers of people to their respective sports pavilion and interactive theatre while implying an association with the Atlanta Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the 28 June 1996, this Government brought in legislation, the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 1996, which was designed to protect the Sydney Olympic and Paralympic Games against ambush marketing. Although the Government was aware, at the time, that the legislation could possibly require some amendment, the need to have the legislation in place before the Atlanta Games commenced, made the immediate introduction and passage of the legislation a necessity. Having the legislation in place, enabled SOCOG and SPOC to take advantage of the major marketing opportunity afforded by the Atlanta Games. The Government also believed that amending the legislation at a later date rather than during the passage of the principal bill would also ensure that there was adequate time for consultation with Games organisers and other interest groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act presently provides protection for the Olympic and Paralympic Games against ambush marketing through the regulation of the use for commercial purposes of the indicia and images associated with the Games. However, for trade in domestically produced goods, the act as it stands, only enables action to be taken against the person who applied the indicia and images to the goods or services. This may make it difficult for effective action to be taken against some who may engage in ambush marketing activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in this bill will enable Games organisers and licensed users to take action against retailers, distributors or other parties in the supply chain rather than having to pursue through the supply chain the unauthorised person who applied the indicia or images to the goods or services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, the amendments will enable SOCOG, SPOC and licensed users to take action against those who aid, abet, counsel and procure breaches of the legislation. In other words, it will be possible to take action against persons whose involvement in the contravention of the legislation is in the nature of assisting in the unauthorised application of indicia and images rather than in their direct application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures greatly improve the operation of the legislation and help ensure the preservation of the Games marketing revenues. As well as protecting the revenue of the Games against ambush marketing, they help ensure that the interests of 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legitimate retailers are protected from less scrupulous competition. Retailers, distributors and other parties will need to check to ensure that the person who applied the indicia or images to the goods or services is licensed. To do this, they need to check the register of licensed users located at SOCOG's office in Sydney or the State Offices of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation to ensure that the person is entered on the register.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In preparing the bill, the Government consulted extensively with the Games organisers and other interest groups, in particular, retailers. To make it easier for retailers and others to ensure that the goods they receive have the indicia or images applied to them by a licensed user, SOCOG proposes to provide easy access to the register of licensed users of the indicia and images, to disseminate widely information on the legislation and on who the licensed users are, and to provide a sophisticated identification system for genuine products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the public awareness campaign, SOCOG will be advertising in various media, and licensees will be required to advertise in trade catalogues and similar outlets. Retail and other industry associations have agreed to cooperate with SOCOG in the dissemination of information so that the public is aware and understands the legislation as it relates to the licensing of users of the protected indicia and images.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that, with these amendments, the legislation represents a balanced and workable approach that will protect the Olympic and Paralympic Games against ambush marketing without placing an undue burden on business. In saying this, I am confident that industry, SOCOG and SPOC will work together in a cooperative manner which will add greatly to the effectiveness of the legislation and help ensure a good budget outcome is achieved for the Sydney 2000 Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions, together with those in the principal act, will cease to operate after 31 December 2000, following the completion of the Games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be no additional cost to the Government of administering this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the sponsorship program for the Games has already begun with Telstra and IBM contributing $100 million as part of the corporate sponsorship effort. We must protect the sponsorship revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes the additional protection provided by this bill will enhance and complement the protective measures already in place under the Sydney 2000 Games (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 1996 and the current intellectual property laws and that it will help in making the Sydney 2000 Olympic and Paralympic Games a sound financial success for Australia.</PARA>

<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is part of a package relating to charging for telecommunications numbers. The second part of this package is the Telecommunications Amendment Bill, which I will deal with shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is about the government delivering on its promises to deliver a fair and equitable environment for the telecommunications industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill enables the commonwealth to charge for certain numbers used for the delivery of telecommunications services. These numbers are a limited public resource.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the current arrangements, carriers and service providers do not pay for the numbers allocated to them by AUSTEL. I am informed that the carriers do charge users for some of these numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A price based allocation system for numbers will remove the `windfall gains' which the carriers 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> currently enjoy, and will also encourage an efficient allocation of this limited resource. I expect that charging for number allocations would encourage the carriers to rationalise some of their holdings, including returning numbers held in carrier and service providers "inventories". These numbers would thus be freed for use by new market entrants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's scheme, as reflected in the bill, will provide the following:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">carriers and service providers will be charged for the allocation of blocks of numbers they receive from AUSTEL;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">charges will be levied annually;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTEL is to set the level of fees for different number ranges by determination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AUSTEL determination, which will specify the numbers to attract a charge and the level of the charge, will be a disallowable instrument. The parliament will therefore have the opportunity to examine the administrative details of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I expect the charging scheme to derive in the vicinity of $30 million in Commonwealth revenue. I am advised that, to meet this figure, the charge on some numbers could be as low as $1.00.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Communications and the Arts can issue a Direction to AUSTEL under section 50 of the Telecommunications Act 1991 prohibiting AUSTEL from levying charges on certain numbers. It is important to note that the minister will issue a Direction which will prevent charges from being imposed on telephone numbers which are allocated for the provision of the standard telephone service, that is, "basic" telephone numbers for both residential and business users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is envisaged that the highest charges (maximum limit of $100,000) will be imposed on certain premium numbers, including:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`13' six digit and `13 4' eight digit numbers&hyphen; used for special network services</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`1800' ten digit numbers&hyphen; which are reserved for freephone services</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`190' ten digit numbers&hyphen; for information services, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`005' nine digit numbers, also used for information services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Charges would therefore be applied to a maximum of 6 million numbers in relation to these premium ranges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Charges will not be set on numbers allocated for the standard telephone service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certain blocks could reasonably be considered to hold more intrinsic value than others. The specific charges to be applied to specific blocks of numbers 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="374"> will be considered by AUSTEL in consultation with the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, the Telecommunications (Numbering Fees) Act 1991 does not permit fees being applied to numbers that have already been allocated free of charge. The existing legislation also does not allow annual charges, which are appropriate for a public resource where we do not wish to grant long term ownership rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill I am now presenting to the parliament enables the accomplishment of the proposed charging scheme. It will enable efficient management and allocation of a valuable national resource. It will also provide for charges to be levied on numbers which have already been allocated to carriers, thus ensuring that carriers will not be unfairly advantaged over other market players. Furthermore, the bill will ensure that at least some of the value of this resource is recovered by the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Bill 1996 has been introduced in the House as part of the post 1997 telecommunications regulatory environment, to ensure the number charging scheme continues after the deregulation of the industry on 1 July 1997.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 1 of the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1996 relates to disclosure of information to emergency services. Part 2 relates to charging for telecommunications numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to charging for telecommunications numbers, this bill comprises the second part of a package of legislative amendments. I have provided details of the proposed charging scheme for telecommunications numbers in my second reading speech for the Telecommunications (Numbering Fees) Amendment Bill 1996. This bill adds to the scheme by providing for the collection of numbering charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of Part 1 of the Telecommunications Amendment Bill is to clarify the exemptions from prosecution which are provided for disclosure, by employees of telecommunications carriers or eligible service providers, of customer information to operators of emergency services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under paragraph 88(3)(d) of the Telecommunications Act 1991, information obtained by a carrier or service provider employee about the name, telephone number, address or location of callers to the emergency number 000, or information about the content of such calls, may be disclosed to police, fire or ambulance officers. Information may not be disclosed where calls are to other emergency numbers allocated by AUSTEL, nor disclosed to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> persons performing services on behalf of the emergency services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTEL has specified in the national numbering plan an alternative emergency number 112 for callers using digital mobile services, and there is a proposal for another emergency number to be specified by AUSTEL for access by hearing and speech impaired persons to emergency services using teletypewriter equipment, via the national relay service. The amendments will enable the specified information about callers or calls to emergency services to be disclosed on all emergency numbers identified by AUSTEL in the national numbering plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will allow information to be disclosed to an emergency service contractor rather than to the emergency services directly. It seems that in at least one state there is a proposal for emergency services to outsource call taking and dispatch functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments do not in any way alter the obligation of carriers to provide free access to an emergency number. The Government will ensure that this obligation continues in the post&hyphen;1997 telecommunications environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will facilitate quick responses by emergency services to calls to emergency services, while ensuring that the confidentiality of personal customer information continues to be protected. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner has raised no objection to the amendments, other than to comment that they should be accompanied by an appropriate public education campaign to ensure that callers to the emergency number are aware of the information that may be disclosed and in what circumstances.

The Financial Laws Amendment Bill 1996 also makes a number of technical amendments to insurance and banking legislation, some of which I will outline below.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Enhanced information sharing</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Financial Laws Amendment Bill 1996 will liberalise the information sharing provisions of legislation administered by the Reserve Bank and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The amendments will improve protection of bank depositors and insurance policyholders by enabling the Reserve Bank and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to move quickly to exchange information to prevent and/or manage a crisis situation arising in a financial conglomerate in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will enable more effective supervision of conglomerates whose constituent institutions are supervised by different agencies (eg, bank, life office, public offer superannuation fund operating under a single corporate banner).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, around 70 per cent of financial system assets are controlled by the 25 largest conglomerates.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rapid exchange of information between the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, Reserve Bank of Australia and overseas financial sector supervisory/regulatory authorities is a key prudential tool in an increasingly globalised financial sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed information sharing amendments are consistent with international `best practice' in financial regulation.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Financial Laws Amendment Bill 1996 also makes a number of amendments to insurance and banking legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes amendments to the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Liabilities) Act 1993 to extend by two years the deadline by which foreign bank subsidiaries or money market corporations can apply for, and convert to, branch banking status and qualify for the concessional taxation and other treatment provided for under the act. The amendment is necessary because the Government decided that it is not reasonable to expect foreign banks to make long term strategic decisions about whether to convert to branch status whilst the Wallis Inquiry into the financial system is in progress, and before its outcomes and changes flowing from it are known.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also makes amendments to the Insurance Act 1973 that will improve the supervision of insurance companies through the introduction of a new Part IVA into the act that improves the approval process for related body assets. These amendments, which are strongly supported by the industry, enable the prudential controls of the Insurance Act 1973 to be extended to companies related to an insurer where the related company and the insurer seek the approval of the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner for such an extension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will enable insurers to include a larger range of investments as assets for the purposes of meeting the solvency test under the Insurance Act 1973, without compromising the integrity of the super 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="376"> visory regime. This new approval process will operate prospectively so that existing approvals will be unaffected by the new regime. It is expected that the extension of supervisory controls to related body assets will only be used on a case-by-case basis where necessary, and they do not apply to assets in prudentially supervised institutions such as banks, life offices, building societies and credit unions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the amendments will enhance the security of insurance policy holder interests by removing certain regulatory decisions from review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT). This will prevent insolvent or near-insolvent companies from using the AAT appeal process to defer the application of regulatory directions designed to protect the interests of existing policy holders, such as orders to freeze assets or cease trading.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This exemption from AAT review is consistent with similar exemptions contained in prudential legislation covering the superannuation sector. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission's regulatory powers in this regard will be checked by the need for the Commissioner to obtain Ministerial consent for decisions that are non-reviewable by the AAT. In addition, exemption from AAT review will be subject to a five year sunset clause.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Financial Laws Amendment Bill 1996 also makes minor adjustments to the balance of the respective interests of consumers and insurers under insurance contracts, removes drafting errors and technical difficulties in existing legislation and provides legislative backing to the industry based Code of Practice for the General insurance industry, and an industry based Code of Practice for insurance brokers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also includes a number of technical amendments to existing legislation to make the wording of particular provisions more gender-neutral, updates provisions that create offences in line with the current practice and criminal law policy of the Attorney-General's department, deletes obsolete references to Papua New Guinea, and updates definitions by reference to the Corporations Law.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This advice, with which I have no argument, is the same advice that the Chief General Counsel refers to in the last paragraph of the letter that was given to the Senate committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister is aware that an amendment in exactly the same terms was accepted by the government to the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Newly Arrived Resident's Waiting Periods and Other Measures) Bill 1996.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason I have no argument with the answer given by the Chief General Counsel that, if you put in such a provision explicitly saying that the RDA overrode this legislation or took precedence over it, it could encourage a legal challenge is that the same situation applies to the social security legislation. I do not have the slightest doubt&mdash;in fact, I am prepared to put a small bet on it&mdash;as to the answer you would receive if you wrote to the Chief General Counsel of the Attorney-General's Department and posed precisely this question in respect of the social security legislation. </PARA>

If you put it up in lights and spelt it out, of course it could increase the challenge. I have no doubt that would be his reply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I would like you to answer&mdash;and you have not answered it yet&mdash;is what distinguishes these two situations? Why is it that, in respect of social security legislation, the government is perfectly prepared to run the risk of an increase of such a challenge by explicitly containing a provision that draws everyone's attention to the fact that this is so and that the beneficiaries or target of that legislation can have the reassurance that it will not offend the RDA but Aborigines cannot?

I hope my contribution will assist that along the way. People have been talking about the $4 million. The way the statistics are prepared, that is all an increase in GDP. An interesting thing with these sorts of inquiries is that the money that is spent on them&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It goes down as a plus on our GDP figures. So we are doing pretty well, I would have thought, under those circumstances. I must say that I am sympathetic with the minister to the extent that this sort of situation is not of his making and there has developed a problem which is right on his plate. I take the view that the minister, being a good minister for Aboriginal affairs, is attempting to do something about that on advice. I certainly have seen the way he has handled his portfolio. To my way of thinking, he is handling it extremely well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a problem that we are faced with. It is not of our choosing and it is not of our doing, but the fact is that no matter which way we go, it is not going to be the end of it. There is going to be litigation. Mention has been made here about the royal commission. There is litigation on the royal commission. If, for example, this legislation goes through as is&mdash;it will not, as I understand it, go through as is&mdash;you still have the salient factor of a valid application on foot under the heritage protection legislation. There is a valid application on foot and that application is by the women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In normal circumstances, under the current provisions of the legislation, the minister would appoint a reporter and due process would occur. The problems of course were that you had the Saunders report overturned on a technicality and you had the Mathews report shelved because of the technicality of the question of separation of powers. I do not know why people did not think of that at the time. It seems to have all been done on technicalities. If you adopt this legislation with the RDA amendment proposed by the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="383"> opposition, the minister says that that is not going to stop litigation. I think he is correct there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we come to the position that I tried to advance on the last occasion we dealt with this matter. I put forward a proposal for an amendment to the heritage protection act. I do not want to go through that amendment, which has been circularised. I omitted to say, of course&mdash;but it would have been evident to everybody&mdash;that I intended that amendment to, in effect, replace this bill. I did not intend that amendment to stand together with the provisions of this bill, because they would be contradictory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not confident of moving the amendment that I now have, which would give effect to my intention, the reason being that it may not be lawful. It would be lawful of me to try, but it may not, in the end, be found to be lawful, because it may not fit within the objectives of the legislation that we are dealing with. I have not got the final advice on that, but that would be my gut feeling at the moment. To save a bit of time, I am not going ahead with that. As I understand it, it would not get up anyhow. I understand that Senator Collins's amendment on the RDA itself may not get up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In all of those circumstances, it is my view that the legislation is not necessary, and I will be opposing it. I would hope that the provisions of the heritage protection amendment act are then proceeded with. I cannot see why that needs very substantial expenditure. That is my feeling and I thought I should mention that to the committee.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well it does. It comes out of that. When we said it will not stop litigation, it was in the context that it is open to anybody to approach the courts over anything. Our best advice is&mdash;through the Chief General Counsel in particular&mdash;that the only way to bring this to a finality is to pass this legislation. Senator Harradine, if you want to still go on, to continue on the legal merry-go-round, that is what will occur. We have had four years of due process. We have reached the stage were we say it is time to stop this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Harradine, I thought your amendment was a welcome suggestion, but again, unfortunately, the amendment did not provide the same degree of certainty and finality offered by the bill. It is a valid statement in relation to the heritage protection act. If, for example, it were tacked on to our bill and then that bill were passed, then we would be willing to accommodate it because it is a valid statement. But to reach finality, the bill still needs to be passed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to Senator Harradine's amendment, the Chief General Counsel's advice pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it leaves the Minister to make a decision on a case by case basis. Any such decision would be open to challenge on judicial review grounds, including unreasonableness or denial of natural justice. Such an approach may not secure as much legal certainty as the present Bill. It also invites a challenge to any inquiry in order to enable the Minister to avoid having regard to the outcome of any inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So once again we are on the legal merry-go-round. I respect Senator Harradine's opinion. I think it is unfortunate that this bill will, on the face of it, go down, but there it is. That is democracy, which I accept.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am grateful to Senator Harradine for his advice because it will have the effect of bringing this matter to an end shortly. I join Senator Kernot in making the point that, if you want to blame someone for the four years and the $4 million, blame the previous government. I would defend the actions taken by the government, as you would expect me to. You can blame the government or blame the courts or blame the lawyers or blame anyone you like but, as Senator Kernot said correctly, in terms of all of us who are close to this issue and have followed it over all that time, I think the one group of people you cannot really blame are the Ngarrindjeri women themselves. It is their interests that are being, to that extent, removed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) has gone back to this nonsensical position&mdash;I point this out again: it is not for the Attorney-General but for him to take in this technical point made by the A-G's department, and he has run over it again&mdash;that it is open to any Aboriginal person anywhere in Australia to make an application for protection of heritage, even when it is not their heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other day I used the example of the Tiwi Islanders, because they are the Aboriginal people who are further north of Hindmarsh Island than anyone I can think of. Leaving aside the question of it being a frivolous and vexatious application, which it would be, and leaving aside the real world facts&mdash;the chances of other Aboriginal people actually having an application to protect another Aboriginal person's heritage is a real world piece of nonsense as well&mdash;it does not get around the fact that it is perhaps a technical legal defence of what is being done, but it is not a real world defence and not a de 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> fence that should be advanced by the minister for Aboriginal affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts are that there is no protection order in existence. The facts are&mdash;and the minister has conceded this on the best legal advice from the Attorney-General's department, and there is no argument about this&mdash;that the minister cannot be compelled to issue one. The facts are that the minister has absolute discretion to issue such a protection order even in the face of a report&mdash;as the case of Boobera Lagoon has indicated and, I might add, as previous actions of previous ministers have indicated&mdash;which comes down and says, `Yes, this is a site. Yes, there has been damage&mdash;yes, yes, yes.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Provided the minister properly takes all that into account and provided due process is observed by the minister&mdash;thereby protecting him against any actions courts might take, because they look for faults in due process&mdash;it is open to the minister in the face of all that to still decline to issue such a protection order. That is why I made the point that I did at the beginning of this debate. As well as being an attack on the women&mdash;the ones who do not want the bridge built&mdash;it is an absolute vote of no confidence in the minister. The bill in clause 2 specifically removes the power of the minister to even consider an application in respect of this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister talks about all the people who will be aggrieved if this bill does not pass parliament. The developers do not particularly see the need for it, and Senator Bolkus has demonstrated that only too clearly. The people who want to build this bridge have been saying for some time, with the best legal advice that they can get, that they see no bar to building it&mdash;apart from the fact that the South Australian government, as a political stunt, is saying that without this bill they will not give the necessary South Australian approval for the bridge to go ahead. It is an absolutely circular argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no protection order. There is no way the minister can be forced to issue a protection order. The minister has just thrown around the expression `$1 million'. I cannot for the life of me understand the analysis on which that figure is based. In order to comply 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="386"> with the act and to comply with process and consideration of the previous inquiries and everything that is already on the public record, I cannot for the life of me imagine why a process would be required that would cost $1 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, the bottom line is that it is the Ngarrindjeri women who are, for whatever reason, having their rights removed to this extent by this piece of legislation. They certainly are not the ones to blame for all of the previous problems and the previous delays and the previous costs. I would have thought they, as well as the budget, would be entitled to some consideration from this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say to the minister that my preferred option would be for this bill to pass the Senate, obviously with the opposition amendment attached to it&mdash;although advice that seems to be generally known indicates that that may not be the result. That is out of our hands to that extent, but that is certainly our preferred option, and I make no bones about it. But, should the bill fail to pass, in legal terms I do not think it is seriously disputed that it is still open to you to undergo that due process; it is absolutely open to you to be as good as your word and, at the end of the day, not issue a protection order so that the bridge can be built.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Continuing from the point I reached when this matter was last debated, I want to move to the legislation arising from the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Bill 1966 and its effect upon some of the smaller bond stores, particularly those which operate in the state of Tasmania. Cities like Sydney and Melbourne have bond stores that have many transactions per day and a huge financial turnover in terms of the charges that they can levy. In relation to the small bond stores which exist in Tasmania, the overwhelming majority would have a very small number of transactions. In fact, some of those bond stores are furniture removalists. At the present time, those bond stores have the capacity to bring a citizen's furniture into the country from overseas and to hold any of that equipment in their bond stores whilst dealing with the customs requirement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is a major saving for inhabitants of an island state such as Tasmania. Without the facility of these sorts of small bond stores being available in the state, it could be that the removalist would have to bring the consignment in from overseas, separate that part which had to be lodged in a bond store when the consignment landed, say, in Melbourne, and either store the rest of the consignment there or bring it to Tasmania whilst awaiting the clearance from the bond store for that part of the transaction. This is the sort of advice that we are receiving from the small businesses within Tasmania currently able to operate small bond stores.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the legislation will cause the smaller bond stores to cease to participate. In other words, it will close the bond store operation because of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cost factor, which is not recoverable given the small number of transactions that is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The legislation proposed for the lower differential charge recommended that a maximum number of transactions of 100 per year be allowed. On the advice that I have, that is not enough to keep the smaller bond stores open and operating. The Labor Party will be pursuing an amendment&mdash;as Senator Cook has advised&mdash;to increase the lower minimum to $500. That is more realistic, given the number of transactions that might occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another consequence for a state like Tasmania. If the effect of the legislation as proposed is the closure of the smaller bond stores, then it is possible that a state such as Tasmania would end up with no bond stores because no&hyphen;one was prepared to pay the charges. That would mean that an importer attempting to bring goods in from overseas would have to land them, say, in Melbourne or Sydney, have them cleared there and then have the transportation which had been interrupted for the bond store clearance continued to Tasmania. It is inevitable in those circumstances that there would be additional costs for those bond stores. That is a consequence that a state like Tasmania does not need and a consequence that small businesses in Tasmania do not need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this government is pursuing the interests of small business, then it will agree to the amendment that Labor proposes in this regard, particularly when you consider the piddling amount of income that the proposal as put by the government at this stage will raise in revenue. It could be&mdash;I would be interested to hear what Senator Parer has to say about this matter&mdash;that as little as $75,000 will be raised by this measure. If that is the case, what is the purpose of taking the risks that I have outlined? What is the purpose of imposing what are potentially significantly higher costs on the Tasmanian community and on small businesses in Tasmania for a revenue gain of about $75,000? But perhaps it would be more appropriate to deal with that matter when this legislation is in committee and the amendments are being considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I should say at this stage that it is estimated by some of the bond store operators who have 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="389"> contacted my staff that, if the measure is passed as proposed and it does have the effect of closing down bond stores, that will increase freighting costs, because of transport interruptions, by $10 to $15 per cubic metre. That is a concern which is real for the Tasmanian community because, as I said earlier, the cost impact of a measure such as this will have a significant impact on an economy which is not doing well at the moment, in which small businesses are not doing well at the moment. Tasmania least of all needs an interruption to trading businesses which could cost jobs, have additional costs for the community and raise a pittance in terms of the overall budget for the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QD4">Senator BROWN</NAME><STATE> (Tasmania)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(5.13 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support what has just been said. Senator O'Brien has covered much of the territory I would have covered, and I will leave that on the record. I, too, have been contacted by Mike Watts and Beth Souter, who have the Celtic Southern Cross business importing Celtic music and instruments to Australia. They work out of Liffey, under the Great Western Tiers of Tasmania&mdash;one of the most spectacular and beautiful places in the country. The business address is via the little post office at Bracknell, as Senator O'Brien said. They are speaking up for thousands of other small businesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The import processing charge changes will have an extremely detrimental effect on a small number of marginal importing businesses, including speciality businesses like theirs&mdash;enough to put them out of business in some cases. In fact, by reducing the threshold for the import processing charge for a bundle of goods coming into the country from $1,000 to $250, some 29,000 lots of small bundles of imported goods coming into the country for small business will, in the main, be hit with a fee of $44.55.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is pretty easy to see that if you are working on lots of $250 an almost 20 per cent impost through the import processing charge makes a very big difference to either your profitability or the sales you will have. It is these things that lead to life or death for small businesses. The government really should 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> very seriously consider withdrawing this change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there is a theory behind this that it will force some of the small business operators to use the computer based option&mdash;$22.80 for processing the same goods. But that is not the case. Many of these small businesses have, as part of their operational advantage, time on their hands to process matters like this manually and the ability to go from place to place to ensure that business is carried out. They do not have to do it through computers. If people want to do that, well and good. But the point is that this charge, one way or another, is going to catch these small businesses and leave them with fewer options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For the reasons that have already been put forward by Senator Margetts, Senator O'Brien and others, I will be supporting the amendments to get rid of this increase in the processing charge and the other amendments that the ALP has mentioned, because they will selectively hit small business. They will selectively hit some very enterprising speciality businesses in Tasmania and doubtlessly in even bigger numbers elsewhere in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They are going to bring in a piddling amount of money to the government but they are going to have a torpedo effect on a number of small businesses. That flies in the face of what everybody in this chamber stands for. The government ought to seriously consider dropping the provisions adverted to in this bill. I hope that if it does not the Senate will have the numbers to correct the bill for the government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of customs bills introduces a cost recovery regime for import related services delivered by the Australian Customs Service. While increasing costs are never to be welcomed, the Australian Democrats believe this move is appropriate given the tight budgetary situation which has affected all departments and all sectors of government. Importers also will need to share part of the budgetary burden.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of these bills is to treble revenue collected from $20 million to $66 million. I 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="390"> think it is important to note, however, that the cost recovery regime does not cover activity associated with Customs community protection functions relating to the detection and interception of prohibited imports and drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also pleased that the charges will not apply to the processing of export transactions. This is an appropriate motivational policy. Exempting exporters from the proposed user&hyphen;pays system recognises the importance of export industries in improving our trade balance and generating jobs. I also note it is a welcome change in the way this government has treated some of our exporters to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) has announced that Customs has undertaken detailed costings of its services. This is an important safeguard to ensure that importers will not be excessively charged. We would urge the minister to ensure that regular costings of its services are undertaken in future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats did, however, have a number of concerns with the initial customs reform package, specifically in terms of how those reforms would have impacted on small business. We had these concerns despite only three small business approaches to us&mdash;one of which is the exceptionally active single Tasmanian who has been in contact with us and also, I gather from the remarks, with colleagues on either side.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We raised our concerns with the minister responsible for Customs, the Hon. Geoff Prosser, and his office and we acknowledge his and his department's cooperation in addressing them. We are pleased to see that the minister took our concerns and those of other members of the Senate on board and acted on them in good faith. In view of this, the Democrats will be supporting the bills before us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Firstly, the Democrats are most pleased the government has agreed to delay a reduction of the import entry threshold for commercial importation through the post from $1,000 to $250 for 12 months. The 12&hyphen;month deferral will provide Customs with time to further develop and encourage use of the Internet for processing of imports. The Internet provides 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> a great opportunity for maximising the efficiency of processing imports and we welcome this approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has assured us that within 12 months he envisages an Internet based facility which will be available for the lodgment of Customs entries. This will provide a cost-effective solution for low volume importers, typically very small businesses, which do not need the full capability of the Customs COMPILE computer system. I expect the minister to keep his word.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The low cost and ease of use of the Internet will be a great boon to importers, offering an alternative to the need for lodging paper documents in person at customs houses and international mail centres. Moreover, the cost of electronic processing is around half the cost of manual processing, as set out in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do, however, recognise that a number of small businesses will probably remain on manual systems. Their numbers and needs should be monitored&mdash;and I believe should be advised to the Senate if you have them available to you&mdash;to avoid unfairly burdening them as a result of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In this light, I hope that the government will do what it can to ensure that Internet access remains affordable and equitable. I urge the minister responsible for Customs to pay close attention to this matter which is in the domain of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston). If he does not, I can assure him that persons on the crossbenches will.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Internet access charges may well increase, especially if the option of untimed data calls for small business is removed. The government has foreshadowed this possibility and the Democrats, through my colleague Senator Lyn Allison, have already noted their concerns over this proposal. It is important that Internet access does not become a significant cost element to small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the government has approved an amendment to the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Bill 1996, which introduces a two&hyphen;tier annual licence fee instead of the flat $4,000 annual fee which was initially pro 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="391"> posed. This amendment is of particular value to smaller depots, which are mostly located in smaller states or in regional centres. It means that smaller depots, specifically those which have less than 100 transactions a year, will be subject to a licence fee of only $1,500&mdash;a significant saving when compared to the $4,000 annual fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, I would like to note that the Australian Democrats regret that the desired 1 January 1997 commencement date for charges had to be delayed until 1 April 1997 pending passage of these bills. Unfortunately, due to the amount of legislation before the Senate in the last session of parliament it was not possible to consider the initial package of bills as was hoped. However, the Democrats are pleased to see that the minister did not seek to introduce retrospective legislation but instead altered the commencement date.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to thank all honourable senators for their contributions. I would just like to make a couple of points. Firstly, phasing the introduction of cost recovery over the next four years is a luxury that the budget imperative, as presented to us on taking over government, in our belief cannot allow. The whole thrust of the measures contained in this legislation is to align the cost of processing imports with that sector of the community&mdash;that is, the importers&mdash;which generates customs work rather than spreading the cost across all taxpayers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second point is that the proposed system of two&hyphen;tier rates is supported but with a different definition of what is regarded as a small depot by the Labor opposition. The government proposes a transaction definition of less than 100 transactions in its amendments, but I understand that Senator Cook now proposes that this be raised to `less than 500'. Senator Cook noted that the amendments proposed by the government would result in 15 per cent of all depots&mdash;that is 415 in number&mdash;falling below the 100 transaction volume per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">More significantly, from historical data we see that this percentage is higher in the smaller states and territories. In the Northern 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Territory, 72 per cent of the current operators will incur the lower fee. In Tasmania, 60 per cent of current operators will incur the lower fee. In South Australia, 30 per cent of the current operators will incur the lower fee. In Queensland, 17 per cent of operators will incur the lower fee. The government considers that this amendment addresses regional Australian concerns and that it is not necessary to increase the small depot threshold as Senator Cook has foreshadowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">With regard to the contributions of Senators Margetts and Brown, I would like to make the following points. The move from $100 to $250 at the post relates to commercial importations only, not to personal importations, which will remain at the higher level. The reason for deferral of 12 months, as has been pointed out by Senator Murray, is to coincide with Customs' development of Internet facilities, which will allow small business importers who use international mail facilities to lodge simplified entry information remotely. This will allow them to incur an electronic lodgment fee of only $22.80 instead of $44.55. Of course, facilities will still be available for fax lodgments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will more significantly reduce costs associated with travelling to an international mail exchange, lodging documents, awaiting clearance and collecting goods. When several hours of travelling time is involved, cost to business can be high. The move in the threshold to $250 addresses a longstanding anomaly, which I do not think too many people have picked up&mdash;I think Senator Murray has, probably in the briefings&mdash;between requirements for commercial importations through the post and those via air and sea carriers. The figure of $250 currently already applies. We are talking about only the post.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For importers using air couriers and express couriers, for instance, all commercial importations with a value of $250 or more have required a customs entry. This anomaly provides an unfair advantage for a business using the post as an alternative. In fact, it is an encouragement, as Senator Cook would appreciate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 12 months grace period signals to importers that the inequity is being addressed 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="392"> while at the same time providing importers that use international mail services time to adjust to the new costs and to examine the Internet options that will be available in 1998.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government amendments to two of these bills, the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Bill and the Customs Amendment Bill (No. 2), have been circulated as requests. This further illustrates the confusion concerning the proper application of section 53 of the constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Bill, the amendments seem to have been presented as requests on the basis that it is a bill imposing taxation and is not amendable by the Senate, which is probably correct. The other bill,  however, increases certain charges but is apparently not classified by the government drafters as a bill imposing taxation. The amendments have been presented as requests, however, because they reduce the scope of the charges levied by the bill but leave charges higher than the status quo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I have indicated in my previous statements, this type of amendment has never been regarded by the Senate as requiring a request as it clearly does not increase any proposed charge or burden on the people within the terms of the constitutional provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To use a shorthand expression, the amendment merely partly restores the status quo. Such an amendment will not be a request under the recommendations of either the Senate or House of Representatives committees which have examined this question. A statement made in the House of Representatives on 2 December 1996 indicated that the Senate's interpretation is now accepted in that house. The amendments to the Customs Amendment Bill (No. 2) will therefore be treated as amendments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Margetts in opposing item 12. The Senate has just moved to delay the imposition of the new charge for 12 months, but that is simply giving the small number of small businesses affected 12 months grace. They have lobbied against the proposal for increased fees. They have given a cogent example of how some specialist businesses will be threatened by these fees, which are the equivalent of nearly 20 per cent of the total cost of items they are importing from overseas to put onto the Australian market and speciality items on which their livelihood depends.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I cannot understand the Democrats turning down the submission that has come from those small businesses. Senator Murray has said that he hopes the government will review this further down the line and that it ought to be monitored if the government finds that these businesses are affected. Once you are out of business, it is a bit hard to review it, and monitoring does not bring a business back from bankruptcy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought the other way around would be the way to do it. We ought to be supporting Senator Margetts and looking further down the line to see whether these businesses go across to the Internet or to the computer available option which is said to be so attractive so that effectively they extinguish the old system upon which they currently depend. That would have been the sensible thing to do. But, by tidying up a piece of legislation, we are effectively saying to those businesses, `You are in the way. We are going to give you 12 months. But when 12 months comes, you either submit or go out of business.' It is going to be as tough as that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> for some of them. It will certainly involve a great deal of inconvenience and increased costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Remember that these are marginal businesses. As Senator O'Brien has said, one of the businesses involved is looking at being able to pay for a position. This will make the difference between their being able to employ somebody or not. It may well make the difference between their staying in business or not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as using the post is concerned, I would have thought the government would encourage that and would not see that as an impediment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important to try to indicate the real level of concern here. Firstly, the reduction of the $1,000 threshold to $250, as the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) has outlined, does in fact affect post in terms of equalising with air and sea and, secondly, also equalising it with courier charges, which are $250 already. The 12-month delay was one not to merely provide a delay but to provide the opportunity for new systems to be set up which would make the cost of transferring from manual to electronic processing, which is cheaper and more efficient, possible to bring into action. Of course, my quest for monitoring is to see that that does take place and does not result in those who remain on manual systems being appreciably disadvantaged.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point has been made that this refers to imports by post. The whole point of this amendment is, I think, that we are talking about small business. We are not just talking about the normal run of small business. Much of the information I have received has been information about what you would call micro business. These are one- or two-person operations, maybe a husband and wife operation, that operate in areas that might be, to the normal mind, somewhat arcane. But, nonetheless, they have carved out a niche business, almost a cottage industry, for themselves to support themselves and would obviously resort to the postal service.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My preferred position is that obviously a service like Customs, which is an important service, has to have an element of cost recovery in it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the problems associated with that&mdash;and hence the idea of correcting the anomaly&mdash;is that it is very easy to have a whole series of split consignments coming through by post which come in under the threshold. Anecdotally, I can tell you from the discussions I have had with Customs&mdash;Customs is not my portfolio, but I have been briefed by Customs officers&mdash;that it is not unusual to find the same bundles in post, but just under the threshold level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would guess that, if Senator Margetts's amendment did go through, we would see a considerable growth in the number of these sorts of goods being imported. I think, Senator, that if you were in a little business of importing things you would jump on the bandwagon to make sure you did that. So you would bring it through by post at the higher threshold than already applies to all other forms of transportation of goods into this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, as the amount has not gone down yet, although in real terms it has gone down over time, it is a bit bizarre to suggest that some time after changing a measure you then not only do not increase it with inflation but also bring it down to a level which, in reality, obviously will benefit the slightly bigger players and may well be one of the reasons, as Senator Cook has suggested, why there is not a bigger brouhaha in relation to the organisations. The Small Business Association, for instance, would have members who were bigger&mdash;in fact, most of the members would be bigger&mdash;than the kinds of small businesses we are talking about who have almost nobody to look after their interests.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not have the same odium that the minister has in relation to the post&mdash;why, somehow or other, it is bad that people should use the post. I think it is not such a bad thing. My problem, as I mentioned in the debate on the second reading, is largely to do with the fact that what we are beginning to introduce by way of this proposal is the user pays principle which could be thought of as a regressive charge because the smaller you are, the larger it is in proportion to what you are doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The same argument has been used in banking, and it has been considered to be unfair in banking. I do not think that charging regressive charges is the way we should be going. Perhaps much of its cost is related to the fact that people have to fill in a form stating that that is what they are doing. If it is coming in by post and there is no form to check as none has had to be filled out, as far as I can see there is not much cost to the customs department. Therefore, are we saving that much money when, in fact, there might not be a cost involved if people know that they are under the limit and do not have to fill out a form in the first place?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will respond on two points. First of all, with split lots coming into the country, no matter what the level is set at, that will occur. It is marginal. Anecdotal evidence has been given to me that it is very marginal, and that the bulk of this issue we are looking at is for single lots being brought in by business people who depend upon those single lots of specialty items. That is the first issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue is about post. If you are importing once a month to Bracknell, Dubbo or Tennant Creek a small package, an item upon which your business depends, I can assure you that using the post is much better than using a courier or ship transport. If you are anywhere near small business and have costed the options, you will know that using sea transport or couriers for lots in the order of $250 is prohibitive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On both counts&mdash;on cost and on convenience&mdash;post is the option. It is efficient and it is specially designed to be able to transport, quickly and cheaply, small items; whereas the other forms of transport are especially designed for large items, particularly bulk items. There are exceptions to the rules, but that is the case.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, if I follow your argument, you are saying that, if the importer using the mail is able to bring in a quantity of goods below the threshold, that is legitimate, and if they cannot they pay the penalty. Perhaps the

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am of the same opinion. The business of anomaly is interesting because this government actively supports all sorts of anomalies. Let me give you an example. If a logger sees a beautiful rainforest tree, cuts it down and sends it to the woodchip mill, he pays less in royalties than if he sends it to a sawmill. On the face of it, there are clear incentives to trash it through the woodchip mill rather than to give it higher added value.

<PARA STYLE="Para">What the opposition is trying to achieve here is a phasing in of charges. The charges we seek are phased in over four years in the same percentage increases. The argument why this is the better way of proceeding than trying to jump a tall building in a single bound, as the government has tried to do, is quite clearly that once again, if small businesses are taken unaware by a rapid hike in charges, it can mean that they are driven financially backward, that they do not employ as many people

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is needed by a government in a good management situation, we would submit, is to give long, strong, clear signals about change. This softens the blow up front, but gives the clear, long, strong signal that change will occur in a more ordered manner and meets something of the principle of user-pays while considering the needs of the small business community.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments gradually phase in the cost recovery charges over a period of 4 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Democrats typically prefer new charges to be gradually phased in, in the present case we feel that immediate implementation of the proposed charges is warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are of the view that the Minister responsible for Customs has acted in good faith to respond to legitimate grievances that have been put to him by both ourselves and the ALP. Especially when one takes into account the tight Budgetary constraints they are operating under.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, as you know, instead of introducing a flat $4,000 annual license fee as initially proposed, the Government has agreed to introduce a two&hyphen;tier fee which will make it much cheaper for small depots who will only have to pay $1,500.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the Government has agreed to defer reduction of the import entry threshold for commercial importations through the post from $1000 to $250 for 12 months. This will provide time for an Internet mechanism for processing of imports to be established. This will provide an alternative to the need for lodging paper documents in person and cost about half the price.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most importantly, however, implementing immediate cost recovery as the Government has proposed, will provide funds which can be used as a source of revenue for off&hyphen;setting the costs of establishing Internet&hyphen;based processing over the next 12 months as promised. As noted, the Democrats believe such a system has tremendous potential and encourage the Government to develop it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the long run, Internet based charging is likely to be of benefit to the very importers the ALP is seeking to assist through a phased in approach to cost recovery. For this reason we feel the Govern

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives considers that these amendments&mdash;to not introduce newly arrived resident's waiting periods for carer pension, widow allowance, disability wage supplement, mature age allowance, special benefit, partner allowance, maternity allowance, parenting allowance, mobility allowance, seniors health card, more than the minimum rate of family payment and health care cards&mdash;should not proceed as they would counteract the electoral mandate given to the Government at the 1996 election to introduce its election commitment relating to imposing a two year newly arrived resident's waiting period on most welfare benefits. The House of Representatives notes that access of newly arrived migrants to Australian social security 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="408"> payments compares favourably with other western nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to carer pension, it is noted that the Government had intended moving amendments in the Senate to take account of recommendation 3 of the majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee that special needs relatives be exempt from the carer pension newly arrived resident's waiting period, as well as exempting refugees, former refugees or a family member of the refugee or former refugee from that waiting period. The House of Representatives is of the view that those amendments should have prevailed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment proposed by the Senate in relation to widow allowance (Senate amendment (17)) would result in a disparity in access between widow allowance and newstart allowance despite the eligibility criteria for widow allowance having always essentially been aligned with those applying for newstart allowance. Previously, widow allowance has been subject to a 26 week residence requirement, akin to the 26 week newly arrived resident's waiting period for newstart allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives considers that the introduction of a newly arrived resident's waiting period for disability wage supplement addresses concerns that in deciding to come to Australia, migrants should be aware of the need to provide adequately for themselves after they arrive in Australia so as not to make undue calls on the Australian taxpayer. The House of Representatives notes, however, that there has been a recognition, as reflected in the legislation, that circumstances sometimes change after a person arrives in Australia and that as a result, the newly arrived resident's waiting period will not apply to a person who first suffered a continuing inability to work in Australia because of an impairment or who becomes permanently blind while in Australia. Therefore, the House of Representatives does not consider that the Senate amendment relating to disability wage supplement (Senate amendment (18)) is warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives believes that any failure to introduce a newly arrived resident's waiting period for special benefit will operate to effectively undermine the newly arrived resident's waiting periods that operate for other income support payments, such as newstart allowance. The Senate amendments relating to special benefit would allow many unemployed people to avoid the two year waiting period provisions, and therefore the House of Representatives does not consider that the Senate amendment relating to special benefit is warranted. Although the Government had proposed that a newly arrived resident's waiting period should apply for special benefit, the House of Representatives notes that the Government had and continues to recognise the importance of ensuring 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that there is an adequate safety net to take care of those persons who suffer substantial changes in their circumstances beyond their control.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To that end, the Bill as introduced and passed by the House of Representatives had provided that such persons would be exempt from the operation of a newly arrived resident's waiting period. Further, it is understood that the Government had indicated to the Senate that it proposed moving a number of concessionary amendments to the special benefit provisions to take on board those recommendations made by the majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee that impacted on special benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to partner allowance, the vast majority of those receiving partner allowance are spouses of recipients of newstart allowance. Prior to July 1995 the unemployed person would have received the partnered rate of unemployment payment and been excluded from this combined payment for 26 weeks. The House of Representatives understands that the amendments proposed by the Government in the Bill as introduced with respect to partner allowance are a further step in a process instigated by the former Government of ensuring that persons qualify for social security payments in their own right. The House of Representatives endorses this position and so opposes Senate amendment  (26).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives disagrees with Senate amendment (28) relating to parenting allowance. Parenting allowance is an income support payment and as such, has always been aligned with other income support payments such as newstart allowance. It was introduced in July 1995 by the previous Government to make available a payment to those looking after children, to compensate for the abolition of the partnered rate of social security benefits. It is noted that for that reason, newly arrived resident waiting provisions mirroring those applicable to newstart allowance were inserted into the Social Security Act 1991 when parenting allowance was introduced by the former Government in July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives does not agree that there is a need for Senate amendments (32) or (36) on the basis that the operation of a newly arrived resident's waiting period for the seniors health card or health care cards would cause undue hardship. Persons subject to a newly arrived resident's waiting period would still have immediate access to Medicare. These concession cards provide access to Commonwealth and State/Territory concessions which newly arrived migrants should not expect to receive immediately upon entry to Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives agrees with the position that had previously been adopted by the former Government that people should qualify for

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the House of Representatives does not agree with amendments (20), (23) and (34) that would seek for newstart allowance, sickness allowance and youth training allowance, respectively, to maintain the exemption from the operation of a newly arrived resident's waiting period that currently applies to a person who is a member of a couple immediately before entering Australia and whose partner has been an Australian resident for at least 26 weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any event, the House of Representatives considers that it would be inappropriate, in the light of the newly arrived resident's waiting period being extended to 104 weeks, to continue to require only that a newly arrived migrant's partner who has been an Australian resident for 26 weeks before the newly arrived migrant could claim an exemption from the operation of a newly arrived resident's waiting period.

The 26 week newly arrived resident's waiting period would apply to those persons who had entered Australia and been granted a permanent visa before that day.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The House of Representatives does not agree that the legislation is retrospective.</PARA>

Further, the House of Representatives understands that information foreshadowing the Government's new policy was provided to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs by the Department of Social Security. This was distributed to overseas posts on 19 March 1996 to provide to all visa applicants and to successful visa applicants when

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee did not consider that the legislation was retrospective. The majority report noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Committee notes concerns about the retrospective provisions in the Bill and evidence that these may result in hardship for some newly arrived residents. In the Committee's view these provisions were clearly enunciated during the election campaign and information on proposed changes to the policy have been widely circulated by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The Committee notes that the provisions in the Bill relating to special benefits are prospective. Therefore new residents who arrive after 1 April 1996 and before the Royal Assent of the Bill will be eligible for special benefits under current arrangements. In the Committee's view, these provisions provide an appropriate transition and will allay concerns about this aspect of the Bill.".</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When Senate amendments to a bill first introduced in the House of Representatives are disagreed to by the House, the Senate has to decide whether to insist on its amendments. The standing orders provide for alternative motions to be moved to determine that question, but the substantive result is not affected by the form of the motion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a vote is taken on that question, and the votes are equally divided, the ruling of President Sibraa of 21 October 1993 applies. That ruling was upheld by a majority of the Senate at the time and subsequently by a unanimous report of the Procedure Committee.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="410">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ruling distinguishes between two types of amendments. The first type, which I will call type A, is a Senate request for an amendment or a Senate amendment which consists of an alteration to the text of a bill. Equally divided votes on the question whether the Senate insists on such a request or amendment means that the request or amendment is lost and the bill proceeds without it. The rationale of this is that such a request or amendment requires a majority to be carried in the first instance, and the equally divided vote indicates that the request or amendment no longer has the support of a majority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other type of amendment, which I will call type B, takes the form of striking out a self-contained item in a bill. An equally divided vote on the question whether the Senate insists on such an amendment means that the amendment is insisted on. The rationale of this is that such an amendment can be made by an equally divided vote in the first instance, as every such item in a bill must be carried by a majority, and the subsequent vote would indicate that the item still lacked majority support. Examples relating to this bill may make this clearer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senate amendment No. 21 to the bill left out an item of the bill and inserted a new item. It is therefore a type A amendment. This amendment required a majority to be carried in the first instance. An equally divided vote on the question whether the Senate insists on this amendment would indicate that the amendment now lacks majority support and the Senate would therefore not insist on the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senate amendment No. 16 to the bill strikes out a division of the bill. The question put by the chair was that the division stand as printed. This question was negatived. It could have been negatived by an equally divided vote indicating that the division lacked majority support, and the division would have been left out by such a vote. This is therefore a type B amendment. If the question to determine whether the Senate insists on this amendment is negatived by an equally divided vote, this will indicate that the division still lacks majority support and the Senate insists on leaving out the division.</PARA>

If that situation arises, the Senate may wish to consider its position and, in particular, to consider whether it wishes some amendments to proceed in the absence of others. I suggest that it would be appropriate for progress to be reported at that stage to allow senators time to consider the situation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. Yes, I have. The argument by some parties in the chamber as to whether these payments be included in the definition relates largely to whether the government has an electoral mandate to introduce waiting periods for these payments. I believe that the debate proceeded, if you like, on a misguided basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The statement in our Meeting our Commitments document, which was released by Mr Costello on 15 February last year, which as you will recall was in the middle of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> election campaign, referred to access to welfare benefits. It did not refer to access to social security benefits and therefore can be quite reasonably interpreted as a more wide ranging coverage than had been the case under the arrangements of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was clear that there would be access to these welfare benefits for migrants other than refugee and humanitarian migrants only after two years. That was spelt out very clearly. We also made it very clear that there would be exemptions for all refugee and humanitarian migrants immediately after their arrival in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We gave a commitment that Medicare would be available for all migrants regardless of their time in the country. All migrants would have full access to family allowance, which of course is now known as fit minimum rate family payment. We undertook to provide a safety net for those migrants whose circumstances changed significantly on arrival in Australia for reasons beyond their personal control. We also made it clear it would apply to prospective migrants only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of those commitments have been met in this legislation. Therefore, I think it was eminently reasonable to assert, as the government has, that we have a mandate for the introduction of these waiting periods in the form that we have provided in the legislation. Indeed, in the debate that took place on this bill last year, it seemed to me there was a failure to recognise that the very large savings which were described in the Meeting our Commitments document, which were $616 million over three years, clearly meant that it was not simply related to extending the existing unemployment type payments from six months to two years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been no dishonesty by the government in this. We made it clear in our election commitment what we were planning to do and the order of savings that we expected to come from these measures. We made it clear who would be protected and how. We have gone ahead confident in the belief that we do have an electoral mandate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course the government has also found in the months that we have been in government 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="413"> that many migrants as well as migrant organisations have seen that there is virtue in this measure and have welcomed it. So it is not nearly as clear-cut as it might have appeared from the apparent opposition in the debate last year. The claim that we do not have an electoral mandate, I would suggest to you, is a fanciful one indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, the government does accept the recommendations of the majority report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee that there should be no waiting periods for the child disability allowance and the double orphan pension, and we would move an amendment later in the debate to delete references to those two payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition, we have reconsidered the issue of maternity allowance. We have accepted arguments which would point out that it is a one-off payment for the birth of a child. That is consistent with the approach we have taken in relation to the minimum family payment. It is not an income support payment, as the other payments that have been covered are. We are therefore prepared to include maternity allowance together with child disability allowance and double orphan pension. We would be prepared to delete references to those in another amendment we will be circulating shortly.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think what we are doing now is absolutely absurd. We are dealing with what ought to be consequential amendments, but on your ruling, Mr Chairman, we are now dealing with them before the substantive issues have been determined by the committee. However, that is what the Senate is about often. You break new ground, you establish new precedents and someone else can have the job of explaining this to the historians. I certainly will not be able to, and I will be very interested to hear what your explanation will be on reflection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The point of the matter is that there are two relevant definitions in the Social Security Act: the newly arrived residents waiting period, which currently applies to newstart, sickness, parenting and youth training allowance; and the waiting period. As I tried valiantly to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> explain a little earlier, these amendments&mdash;or the omissions, if you like&mdash;ensure that there are no references in either definition to the newly arrived residents waiting periods for those payments that the two-year waiting period will not apply to, even though we have not made that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These ought to be consequential. Obviously, if the committee decides not to insist on omitting the divisions which apply to the two-year waiting period for carer pension and other payments, then these need not be considered. That seems very clear to me. I am sure it is quite clear to other senators in the chamber. I am very sorry that obviously the minister does not understand it and that you have made what I consider to be an absurd ruling. Frankly, how you expect senators to vote on this, I do not know.</PARA></SPEECH>

As I understand it, amendments 10 onwards&mdash;in particular amendment 10&mdash;relate to whether or not these are included in the definition for partner allowance, maternity allowance, et cetera. It does seem to be quite logical that we would look at the other amendments that deal with which social security benefits do or do not have waiting periods or what length those waiting periods should be before we determine whether or not they are included in the definition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister probably thinks this new legislation and amendments, if they get through, will stop people intending to come to this country who do not have much means from applying in the first place because the consequences of trying have been made that much more difficult for them.

We are not going to be bullied in our position by a so-called insistence from the House of Representatives, which simply means, in effect, an insistence by the government, that the Senate drop the amendments in the name of social justice which it insisted upon last year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government signalled at the election that the two-year waiting period for the special benefit would be implemented. The point I was making to the government was whether there should be a special benefit for those whose circumstances have changed. For example, if a person in a skilled migrant category comes to Australia on the basis that there is a job for them, and then there is a change in circumstance&mdash;the place where they were going to be employed goes out of business&mdash;there is clearly a requirement, in all justice, to have a special benefit for that particular individual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has indicated to me that there will be regulations in place to assist newly arrived migrants in hardship, those whose circumstances have changed significantly, after arrival in Australia, for reasons beyond their control. I think the committee may well have a copy of those regulations. If they have not, I am sure the government will make them available. They appear to at least ameliorate the situation. If that were the case, I would be voting against 25.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of others. For example, I received a very interesting letter from a member of the public who was receiving the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="416"> mature age allowance. That member of the public married a person from overseas. Their spouse came out to Australia and immediately that Australian citizen's mature age allowance was cut in half because he was no longer single. That was an odd situation indeed. I believe that the government&mdash;and it will be for the minister to explain&mdash;has agreed that that is anomalous and that it should be dealt with. That example was in relation to the single rate of payment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of other things that I have considered. It might be desirable for the government to explain its situation at this stage. I will have another look at the provisions overnight to see if I can isolate them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not in favour of the government's approach on maternity allowance, which is 27. I think it is rather strange for the government to suggest that a maternity allowance be paid to persons who may not be Australian citizens but who have been here for a number of years and who have a child born in Australia, who is thereby an Australian citizen, but not to newly arrived migrants whose child is born in Australia. That seems to be discriminatory, and I would not support that. So I would be insisting on 27.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (7.16 p.m.)&mdash;I would also put a view on Senator Faulkner's suggestion. I think that the problems we had in the past are pretty clearly demonstrated by Senator Harradine's difficulty in moving from one to the other and there being such a variety of reasons for why something might be included or excluded. If we do not stick to a clear running order when debating these items, and rather take them as a whole, we are liable to get into quite unhelpful complication.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also take this opportunity while on my feet to say to the committee, as Senator Harradine was not present when I spoke earlier, that the government is prepared to move an amendment which will take into account two of the measures that were recommended by the committee&mdash;namely, the child disability allowance and the double orphan pension. We have also reconsidered our position on the maternity allowance on the basis that it is a one-off payment for the birth of a child, that to exempt it is consistent with the approach we took in relation to the minimum family payment and that it is not an income support payment&mdash;and I recognise that Senator Harradine did not hear me say that earlier. I think that is important to put on the record at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other thing is that, when talking about the special benefit, Senator Harradine was talking about `disallowable instrument'. Senator Harradine, the guidelines for that have not been distributed; they will be distributed on the passing of the legislation because in relation to special benefits they are conditional upon the legislation being passed. So they would be consequent upon the passing of the legislation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clearly, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) is having a few problems. Nothing highlights this better than his recent trade statement. At best, it could be described as administrative in nature. What this means is that, at a stage of the nation's history the likes of which it has not seen before, with immense opportunities for economic integration with our region, Australia is found to be wanting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For most of the life of this nation, Australia has suffered under the tyranny of distance with regard to trade issues. The economic powerhouse of the European continent was not on the doorstep of Australia and, as a result, we often missed out on the best opportunities. With the growth of the tiger economies in South-East Asia, Australia no longer suffers from the tyranny of distance. Indeed, we have a geographic advantage that our European trading partners could only dream about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, rather than seizing this opportunity and exploiting our advantage, investing in Australian industry and encouraging export industries, this government and, indeed, Mr Fischer have taken a rather pedestrian approach to trade policy. This has never been better highlighted than with the release of the government's trade outlook statement last week. What this statement seeks to do is to administer rather than direct; it seeks to follow rather than to lead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Essentially, the government and in particular Mr Fischer fail to understand the No. 1 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> priority in regard to trade issues. That No. 1 priority is of course jobs. Trade policy is not about nice statements with outdated and unrealistic targets, nor is it about satisfying overseas interests at the cost of domestic responsibilities. Rather, trade policy is about growth, and growth is about jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We as a nation must accept that our domestic market is too small to provide a basis for growth on its own. For industry to survive, government must provide programs and incentives for Australian industry to progress overseas which will provide jobs domestically. Unfortunately, the outlook for trade is not good with this new government. Consequently, the outlook for jobs is poor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The 1996 Howard budget forecasts that the net export contribution to national economic growth in 1996-97 will fall to a negative three&hyphen;quarters of one per cent. This is a net loss. By comparison, in 1995-96 the figure was a positive one per cent. In just under a year this government, and in particular Mr Fischer, has orchestrated a dramatic slump in Australia's export growth. Nothing better illustrates the mind-set of this government and its attitude than these figures. That mind-set, of course, is a bean&hyphen;counter mentality to government, rather than one which initiates policy designed to support Australian business and industry and to encourage growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without the commitment to industry support and a proactive approach to economic policy in general, the commitments of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in regards to jobs ring hollow. How, Prime Minister, can jobs be created when industry and investment is being discouraged?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, with this government, the bad figures in relation to export contribution to economic growth do not stop there. In last week's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mid&hyphen;year economic and fiscal outlook 1996&hyphen;97 </EMPHASIS>there was a negative forecast of one-quarter of one per cent for 1996-97. Admittedly, the figure has improved by half a per cent. However, the forecast is still a negative figure and any improvement stems from a drop in imports rather than any successful trade policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's trade statement is notable for the fact that it comes after a terrible year 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="418"> of government trade policy. Rather than make amends for this matter, it does nothing to recognise the problems or solve them. This is particularly strange because the government's attacks on the industry and trade sector over the past 12 months have been notable for their savageness and short&hyphen;sightedness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, who could forget the DIFF program shambles? Here was a highly successful initiative by the former federal government&mdash;an initiative designed to improve Australian industry competitiveness in the export sphere and an initiative designed to assist the nations in our immediate region where we were seeking to engage in bilateral and multilateral trade agreements. It was an initiative that was looked upon favourably and, indeed, relied upon in many circumstances by the respective governments in the region. However, the government chose to cut the program. The cost was a severe embarrassment for Australia and a lack of credibility within the region in which we sought to economically integrate ourselves through our trade and industry policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned earlier, at a time when finally the geographical circumstances were in our favour, the government finds a way to destroy an excellent program which greatly enhances Australia's position within the region. Unfortunately for Australian industry and, ultimately, Australian jobs, the lack of initiative and action with regard to trade policy did not stop there. There was, of course, backsliding and embarrassment in regard to Howe Leather, involvement with the European Union, cuts to Austrade and a wide cross-section of other programs designed and successfully enhancing Australian industry and exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, who could forget the mess over the ships bounty? Here was a government incentive and assistance program not only designed to assist but actually assisting our export orientated industry, which was gaining a reputation for excellence throughout the world. In accordance with the government's bean counter mentality, the assistance was cut to meet the government's budget bottom line objective. What it did was cut a program which contributed towards a high growth, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> export orientated industry which had a growth rate of 200 per cent, exports of 150 per cent and employment growth levels of over 50 per cent per annum. Additionally, the cuts threatened jobs and the competitiveness of an Australian success story. For a $3 million saving, which is a paltry sum in comparison to the total national budget, jobs and exports were going to be destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It may be possible to argue that in the early stages of a government mistakes will be made and novices will have to learn the ropes. Though after 12 months of disastrous trade and industry policy decisions, the government did not use this statement to make policy corrections. It did not seek to rectify problems of the past and change tack to provide a direction from government for Australian export orientated industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Fischer did little with his statement. If nothing else, the statement could have been used to dispel some of the myths abounding about the government at the moment. For example, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, has recently made comments suggesting that Australia should rely on primary product exports rather than developing our processing industries, which would result in value added products being produced by Australia. The argument was that we should not seek to create new value added industries. Rather, we should continue with the old Menzian ideology, which was dig it up, ship it out and buy it back in some other form at a cost to the Australian community. This is exactly the type of attitude which took so long to correct through the 1980s, with policies seeking South-East Asian economic integration, and created many of the problems we still have today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than dispel this silly notion and make some commitment or even comment in regard to the desirability of a value adding sector, Mr Fischer ignored the issue and, consequently, the challenge facing Australia. Even if Mr Fischer had ignored the challenges relating to value added exports, he could have at least drawn attention to the fact that the forecast for commodity prices on which Mr Anderson would have Australia base its future 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="419"> is not particularly good. Indeed, Mr Fischer's statement on page 22 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . relatively modest outlook for commodity prices.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">My own state of Western Australia will, indeed, be affected by this lack of vision by the Deputy Prime Minister, which one assumes is approved of by Mr Howard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Western Australia is a primary resources state. It has vast reserves of minerals and is a world leader in their exportation. The state's chances for growth in the long term, however, depend on its ability to go to the next stage with these resources. Rather than ship them off and buy them back when they have been through the value adding phase at a net cost to the Australian community, the state and, indeed, the nation must learn to create those manufacturing industries in my home state of Western Australia and around the nation. There was, of course, no comment in regard to these issues. Mr Fischer's lack of interest in Western Australia is the best reason yet why the National Party fails to gain any representation from that state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the other important area of research and development, it was only late last year that the Howard government highlighted its view in this area. Once again, the bean  counter mentality dictated to the cabinet that the tax rebate for R&amp;D should be reduced to 125 per cent rather than maintained at 150 per cent. Australia must learn from its surrounding nations. Their success can provide an excellent case study for Australia on how to encourage and support industry and business to better position itself in the new trading world. In these tiger economies, initiatives like research and development tax rebates are an important part of that progress. Rather than learn from these successful nations, the Howard government, which has handed its trade policy to Mr Fischer, has thumbed its nose at these successes and done the opposite. A better illustration of the government's mentality I cannot find.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian industry and business must have serious concerns now about their futures and their successes. As many of them are making the transition into a competitive region and a competitive world, they are looking to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government for support, direction, incentives and leadership. They have received none. This statement was their opportunity to have their interests put back on the agenda as priorities of the government and to assist them in creating jobs for Australians. Instead, they are now left directionless, with little hope of improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australian business and industry should not be the enemy of this government or the community. They should be recognised as integral to our national growth. Their success is our success, their wealth is our wealth and their growth is our jobs. By letting Australian industry down, the government has let down Australians who are currently unemployed and those who are facing structural changes in their respective industries. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="419"><TITLE>Primary Industry</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Thursday, I asked the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Parer, representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Anderson, a question in the chamber. It was a serious question, although with the answer I got I am not sure whether the minister took it seriously at all. His answer said nothing, but the question remains.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a very serious question because the ABARE conference, which was held last week, forecast a very grim future for our primary and rural industry. My question concerned whether or not it was the fault of the government that this was so, because, to date, it has not produced any policies to correct this situation. I even gave the minister an opportunity to make a statement. I suppose in that sense it was a dorothy dixer. I asked the minister, `What are you going to do?' But of course I got a rambling answer about nothing, and certainly no answer to the plight of our farmers in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia's primary producers are facing falling exports, financial losses this financial year, according to the figures released by ABARE, and a very bleak future indeed. For example, I will just read some comments about the conference from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> last week. It says:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="420">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the rural sector, falling world prices could see the net value of farm production slump by a massive 28.5 per cent in 1996-97, despite a 9 per cent increase in the volume of farm production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Farmers could see the value of their production value slashed by around $3 billion, with a further 17 per cent reduction in 1997-98. On average, business losses of $4700 are predicted for this financial year, after a sharp turnaround in 1995-96 following the easing of drought conditions and buoyant world prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Farm exports are also expected to drop by just over 1 per cent to $20.2 billion this financial year, with no export growth likely in 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I would have thought that, since I had drawn those conditions to the attention of the minister, he would have had a briefing paper which would have given some answers to the Senate and certainly to farmers in Australia. Although I asked a question that should have provided him with an opportunity to present those policy options and those answers, I got what the ABARE conference had got from the minister a few days previously, and that is nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate should be appalled by the non-answer given in this place and by Minister Anderson's failure to take action to address the rural crisis. At a media conference after the devastating rural outlook was delivered, he said that there is little his government can do. Mr Anderson told the conference that he was enormously worried&mdash;I am sure he is&mdash;about the outlook for farmers. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reality is that there is little we can do at home until global demand picks up and so there are no magic wands for farmers.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I must tell the Senate that what farmers want is certainly not magic wands. They do not want John Anderson to be Tinkerbell. They want real policy solutions. Let me continue with more of what Mr Anderson said. He said that Australian farmers are `at the mercy of world markets'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After being given the devastating news that almost all rural sectors will suffer more financial losses this year, farmers have been treated to the sight of their National Party minister throwing his hands up in the air and saying, `Sorry, guys, there is nothing I can do about it.' When will the primary industries minister, John Anderson, admit that his 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government has done Australian farmers and his party supporters a grave disservice by failing to address the rural decline and wilfully leaving primary producers to the mercy of an unfair market? </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I even pointed out to the minister in this place, in my question last week, three areas where there has been dumping in Australian markets. Where is the anti&hyphen;dumping legislation we were promised during the election? It is yet to be seen; it is yet to see the light of day. When will this government see the folly of pursuing pure economic theory and thinking that some kind of macho free trade competition with other nations will provide an answer, when week after week, month after month and year after year we see our markets and our industries at the mercy of that same so-called free trade competition, which is certainly not fair trade. Let me point out that those nations with which we compete are certainly not as keen as we are to throw their farmers on the scrap heap.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I want to know is when this government will see the devastating ABARE figures for what they are: a warning call that the Australian farming industry is in grave danger of being irreparably damaged if real corrective action is not taken, and taken soon. Also last week, ABARE released figures showing that the population in rural and regional Australia has decreased by around 40 per cent in the past 20 years. The policies of both Labor and the coalition have not arrested the appalling situation where we continue to suck people out of our rural areas and dump them in our cities and on unemployment benefit to further increase the pressure on our city infrastructures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Farmers need practical help with their problems with finance, with unfair competition and with the loss of rural services. Certainly, this last couple of weeks, as we have been around part of regional Australia looking at the government announcement that it is going to sell the Commonwealth railways, we have heard from rural and regional areas that they cannot cope with the loss of one more service; that, in fact, they have been stripped to the bone and that, if any further services are to be removed, it really means 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="421"> the total collapse of our regional infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These issues are just as responsible for the rural decline as any unfair competition in world markets. I will admit that the rural crisis is partly due to cyclical and international factors, but I say to the Senate that this has been exacerbated by the economic rationalist and free trade policies of this government and of the previous Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government's macho posturing on free trade is having a devastating effect for domestic farmers, who are being exposed to unfair competition at a time when they are most vulnerable. There are obvious benefits from trade liberalisation, but our strategy must factor in the domestic situation or our farmers are not going to survive the free trade push.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I believe we are facing a rural exodus similar to those which occurred in the United States following the severe droughts and downturn in the 1920s which led to massive social upheaval. I do not think it is too much to refer to John Steinbeck's novel about this time in which he speaks of the grapes of wrath situation. That is the kind of situation we are facing if this government does not wake up to what is happening to our rural communities and our Australian farmers.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="421"><TITLE>Work for the Dole Scheme</TITLE>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear from what has happened that the government have lost their way and have lost the plot. What they have done, in effect, is confirmed for the Australian people their inability to create jobs or assist in the creation of jobs. Quite obviously, they have thrown in the towel very early, after having been elected only last March, because this is not the sort of issue that you would think they would grab for after merely nearly 11 months in government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has a moral obligation, believe it or not, to provide real jobs, just as it has the obligation to provide real policy solutions. The fact is that work is diminishing in our society and that the nature of work has changed dramatically. This needs to be addressed. The government needs to address the cause of the problem rather than use a bandaid approach to overcome the difficulties that beset our community. There is no reason why it should use stop-gap measures, such as working for the dole, to overcome the unemployment problem that besets us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only work available would be work that people otherwise would be genuinely employed in and paid for. In other words, under this work for the dole scheme, those people who would genuinely pick up real jobs will be excluded. What we will see in the longer term is a negative impact. If real work is not available, then paying dole recipients to participate in useless tasks seems to me to be a pretty useless sort of exercise in itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are faced with a government which does not know how to deal with the issue. All it can do is look to simplistic solutions to what it sees as the problem. It does not want to look beyond the simplistic solutions because that might involve too much difficulty within its own ranks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are practical problems in the solution that has been put up by the government of getting people to work for the dole. It is not the panacea that it is painted to be. The issue has been already raised of voluntary versus compulsory work for the dole. For whom is it going to be voluntary? For whom is it going to be compulsory? Where will it be voluntary? Where will it be compulsory? Will it be compulsory in the country and the regional centres? If so, why? Why not in the main cities? When will it be compulsory for people? What days of the week? What time of the day? No-one knows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here we have an ill-conceived scheme with the government not really knowing what they are doing, plucking out a bit of an idea at the last moment which they think may well be their saviour. There are further practical problems. Who is going to meet the fares? Who is going to meet the cost of people pre 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="422"> senting for work? Who is going to pay for the clothing these people will need to present for the work they are offered under the work for the dole scheme? Who is going to pay the cost of protective clothing if it is needed? No-one knows and no-one will know the answer to these questions because the government have not thought this through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a cost associated with a person presenting themselves for work. Who is going to pay this cost to people who are already on a meagre income to start with, being on employment benefits? I believe that this just goes to show that the government have not thought the issue through.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another practical problem that the scheme will face is the cost of training if training is needed in the work that is to be provided under the work for the dole scheme. If there is going to be training, then this would imply to me that a real job should be available and that it should not be a work for the dole scheme job; it should be a real job that goes to a genuinely unemployed person for their long-term benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then we must consider what the rates of pay will be. If we are getting people into jobs that are going to involve training, then what realistically would be the rates of pay that these people should receive? In other words, it implies that they should be remunerated for their degree of skill rather than simply palmed off by being paid a substandard wage or a substandard pittance by way of the unemployment benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further problems that need to be faced include the following. Who is going to be responsible for the work contract and with whom will the work contract relationship exist? Who is, in effect, going to be the employer? Who is going to pay the workers compensation? Who is going to meet the cost of superannuation? Who is going to take the responsible for occupational health and safety? These questions are all totally unanswered and, of course, will further complicate this very simplistic idea of work for the dole. Basically the scheme presents itself as a cut&hyphen;price labour scheme, and that is about the best tag that could be attached to it.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government need to address the real issue in this. They need to start addressing the issue of the downsizing that is taking place in an unfettered manner throughout the workplace by employers. That is one of the first things that they need to do. The second thing that they need to do is address what work will be available for people in our community in the future, and I do not think the government have seriously thought of even addressing this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last but not least, the government need to address the real issue that this concept of work for the dole is not used as a means of manipulating the unemployment figures, because unemployment in itself is a major crisis for the person. It is the person who suffers; it is the person whose dignity is lost as a result of unemployment. It would be sad to see this scheme proceed purely as a means by which the government could manipulate the unemployment figures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So what we have with what was announced over the weekend is really Fightback revisited. It shows no vision; it shows no imagination; it shows no hope. It is what one would expect from a government who finds itself in crisis on the unemployment issue after only 11 months in government. It is what one would expect from a government that lacks policies and vision in this area and offers no hope to those people who find themselves continually on the unemployed list. Undoubtedly this issue will come up further in this chamber, but I could not let this opportunity pass without making a few brief comments about the recent government decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government need to get their act together. They need to think about people. They need to think of the dignity of people and the cost of what working for the dole will really mean to people. It will mean a destruction of the individual's personality, their self-regard and their ability to participate in a meaningful way in our society.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="422"><TITLE>Operation Tandem Thrust</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to focus the attention of the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) on his responsibilities in rela 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="423"> tion to the environmental impact of Operation Tandem Thrust. Operation Tandem Thrust is a major defence exercise that will take place off the coast of Queensland. It is specifically in the Shoalwater Bay training area. It will involve 26,000 defence personnel, 20 major warships and 13 minor warships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do have in my possession an executive summary of the environmental issues involved in exercise Tandem Thrust. While I welcome the fact that there is such a document, I only have the executive summary and I have to say this summary raises more questions and more concerns than it answers. I would like to just run through some of these tonight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the opening statement it says that this is not the largest exercise that has been conducted in this area, but I would like to make the point that it is the only exercise that has been carried out in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Other exercises that were carried out were carried out in the 1970s, and we had very different attitudes, standards and practices in relation to what we expected and how we expected activities to take place in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to detail what the naval operations will consist of. The summary states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Naval operations will occur both inside and outside the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park . . . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Carrier Battle Group will enter the park to conduct "choke point transit" operations, and to launch and recover aircraft. The Carrier Battle Group operations will include surface warfare, undersea warfare and air warfare operations. Carrier based aircraft will conduct operations inside SWBTA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the Shoalwater Bay training area&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These operations will include the dropping of live ordnance onto the impact areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surface combatants will enter the GBRMP&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to conduct naval surface fire support missions on the impact area on Townshend Island. It is planned to launch amphibious assaults, live naval gunfire support (NGS), aerial bombing, and electronic warfare operations from within the GBRMP.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">You can see why I am concerned that there has not been full public debate about some of these issues, and there has been limited accountability on the part of the Minister for 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Environment, who does have responsibility for the marine park.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said, I acknowledge the efforts that are being made, but I think we have a long way to go before many of us would be reassured about some of the planning involved. There is to be an environmental monitoring group, and those roles and responsibilities are set out. They include, among other items, to respond to reported environmental incidents and instigate and coordinate subsequent remedial action. Quite clearly, the defence forces are expecting environmental incidents because they are already predicting them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The environmental monitoring group will also:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">undertake active inspections of the exercise area to detect unnoticed or unreported adverse environmental impacts and subsequently instigate appropriate remedial measures to prevent or minimise damage;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly, that is welcome but it might be preferable if the minister would take responsibility and ensure that we have a fully documented statement of how this exercise is going to take place and how the damage to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is going to be minimised&mdash;and I am not very happy about using that term myself. Clearly, we need a great deal more information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, there is some reference to the group's role to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">resolve issues of cost&hyphen;sharing for environmental repairs and mitigation measures identified during pre and post&hyphen;exercise inspections;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Every senator would be aware that a reef tax is being imposed on tourists visiting the Great Barrier Reef. It seems that we are going to have 26,000 military tourists. If they were to pay the full cost of the reef tax, that would recoup the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority in the vicinity of about a million dollars. Is this what is proposed, or is it going to be dependent on how much damage is done?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is just one example of how uncertain the whole planning process seems to have been. I sympathise with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority because, I presume, they have simply been told that they have to along with it because it is a Defence 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="424"> exercise and Defence calls the shots, if you will forgive the pun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On page 8 of this executive summary, under the heading `Protection of Marine Mammals, Endangered/Threatened Species,' it is acknowledged that there are many of these species in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The summary indicates that there is a critically endangered population of 400 dugongs living in the Shoalwater Bay training area. The summary says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a most important population. It is the most important population remaining in the Southern Great Barrier Reef. The feeding areas most often frequented by dugong will generally not be used during the exercise as they occur in shallow waters where shipping would be vulnerable to grounding.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Clearly, the author of this document is more concerned about the grounding of ships than the state of the endangered species. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To further minimise potential impacts, the location and speed of boat operations in these areas will be restricted. There is also a potential risk to these species when underwater demolition charges are detonated . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I should imagine that is the understatement of the year. The summary continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although there has been no record of injury or mortality of these species as a result of underwater demolitions since the range was established in the early 1970's, underwater detonations will be restricted to Triangular Island . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It goes on to talk about endangered turtles. Turtles&mdash;I am sorry but this would be a joke if it were not so serious&mdash;will:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">not be approached, impeded or interfered with in any way.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Frankly, if you consider what the turtles are facing&mdash;26,000 defence personnel, 20 major warships and 30 minor warships&mdash;I am not sure if the turtles will have much say in the matter, but I digress.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What to me seems to be important is that the minister be fully briefed. He was obviously not briefed this afternoon when my colleague Senator Meg Lees raised an issue related to a ship that is being refuelled within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and about live ammunition being taken off by helicopter in the vicinity of residential areas of Townsville, although I am told that has been done 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in a totally responsible way. You wonder whether this was part of the planning. If so, why do members of the Townsville City Council know nothing of these plans?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would be calling for the minister to release for full public scrutiny this document, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Environmental issues: exercise Tandem Thrust 97</EMPHASIS>. I call on him to make a comprehensive statement about how his department will enforce the management plan, pick up on many of the concerns that I do not have the time to detail this evening and announce what financial contribution will be made for overseeing environmental protection and any clean&hyphen;up measures. There is a need for this issue to be fully scrutinised and fully debated. Just because it is a defence exercise does not mean that we should not have the opportunity to ensure that these proposed actions will not damage the reef or endangered species within it.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="7.57 p.m." PAGE="424"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 7.57 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>
