<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) Naval personnel were not, as claimed, bound by the `Special Overseas Service' requirements, introduced in the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962. This Act became law some two years after the war in Malaya ended;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f) as Australian citizens serving with the Royal Australian Navy they complied with three of the four requirements for `active service'. The fourth,  
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="86"> for `military occupation of a foreign country' did not apply to Malaya.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your petitioners therefore request the Senate to remove the discriminatory exclusion in the Act thereby restoring justice and recognition of honourable `active service' with the Royal Australian Navy in direct support of British and Malayan forces during the Malayan Emergency between 1955 and 1960.</PARA><PRESENTER.BLOCK>by <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator Brownhill</NAME><FROM>(from five citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER>, <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="FY5">Senator Denman</NAME><FROM>(from five citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER>,  and <PRESENTER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator Kemp</NAME><FROM>(from five citizens)</FROM></PRESENTER></PRESENTER.BLOCK></PETITION>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Petition of the undersigned shows that only one group have been excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) where such group has performed honourable overseas `active service'. That group being members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 which were excluded under `Operational Service' at Section 6. (1)(e)(ii) of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various claims made in Statements to the House and the Senate and the contents of correspondence from various Ministers to maintain the exclusion are answered as follows, the answers are from documents obtained under FIO and from public record:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) `They were never allotted for operational service', (contained in a letter from the Hon. Con Sciacca Minister for Defence Science and Personnel 1995). A letter from the Secretary Department of the Navy to Treasury dated 11 November 1955 stated `the date that the Navy were allotted for operational  service was 1 July 1955'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii) `Members of the RAN were only doing the duty for which they had enlisted', (October 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). This applies to all Service personnel everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii) `They were in no danger', (November 1956 The Hon. Dr Cameron representing the Minister for Repatriation in the Senate). They shared the same danger as all other Australian Service personnel serving in Malaya at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) `They were not on Special Overseas Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon. Bronwyn Bishop Minister for Defence Industry Science and Personnel to Mrs Williams of Adelaide dated October 1996). Requirement for Special Overseas Service was introduced in 1962 without retrospective conditions, therefore has no relevance to events of 1960.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(v) `They were not on Active Service', (in a letter from the office of The Hon.

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MIGRATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is the principal bill in a package of three bills which implement a number of the government's important policy initiatives within the Immigration and Multicultural Affairs portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures contained within the bill are consistent with the government's commitments to better manage the migration program, to increase cost 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="91"> recovery in this portfolio and to enhance the value of Australian citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill firstly seeks to provide the government with the authority to deliver a planned, orderly and balanced Migration Program. To be able to do so,  the government must have the authority to determine the number of people in each category of the Migration Program. This is not possible, other than through inflexible means, under the current legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is Australia's sovereign right to decide the total level of immigration to Australia. It is also Australia's sovereign right to decide the balance between the various migration categories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will assist the government of the day to determine, if necessary, the numbers of people in every migration category able to enter Australia each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators will recall that, on 7 November last year, a number of amendments to the Migration Regulations were disallowed. These regulations would have had the effect of reducing demand in the Preferential Family category.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since then the government has reaffirmed that the Migration Program for 1996&hyphen;97 will be 74,000. The government has also reaffirmed the desire to restore the balance between the family and skilled streams of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the disallowance, the more flexible capping powers contained in this bill are even more necessary than before in order for the government to deliver its program this year. They also provide essential tools for future management of the Migration Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are crucial to restoring public confidence in immigration which had been greatly eroded under Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators will also recall that in 1995&hyphen;96, Labor had allowed immigration to get seriously out of control and out of balance. The family stream had grown by 27% in 1995&hyphen;96. It had come to represent almost 70% of the Migration Program. The spouse category had grown by 32% and the number of parents had increased by 74% in that year alone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is hopeful that there will be only limited need to use all of the additional powers being sought in these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, even the best planning cannot predict every possible variation in the number of visa applications that will be made for the many different visa classes. It is for this reason that, from time to time, the government will need to fine&hyphen;tune numbers in each category. These amendments will enhance the ability to manage the program by allowing applications to be carried over to the next financial year. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a substantial part of the Migration Program, the only mechanism currently available requires the termination of existing applications. Use of this mechanism would create confusion and inconvenience to applicants and will be at a cost to the Budget. The alternative provisions being sought in this bill would mean that numbers can be managed in a more orderly fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions would have the effect that, in some years, visa issue in some parts of the family stream may be queued into the following year. This is a much more equitable outcome for these parts of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions will also allow the Minister to smooth out peaks and troughs in Migration Program numbers whilst at the same time minimising inconvenience to applicants and their sponsors. It is essential that the government be able to undertake this fine&hyphen;tuning in the most flexible and equitable manner possible. The bill will achieve this objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As recently reiterated by the Prime Minister, the government is absolutely committed to a Migration Program that operates on a non&hyphen;discriminatory basis in terms of race, religion and ethnic or cultural background. The measures in this bill are completely consistent with that principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is understood that the Opposition supports the level of the program the government has announced. The achievement of the program level, and the continued restoration of the balance between the family and skilled categories which is the key to community support for the program, requires all the measures contained in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Opposition is not prepared to support these sensible measures, it will be clear to all that they are not serious about achieving a well managed and well structured Migration Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is also concerned by evidence that too many visas in the past have been granted on the basis of relationships that are not bona fide. Such abuse threatens the integrity of the Migration Program by allowing the entry of people who would not otherwise be eligible for migration. It also operates unfairly by taking up places in the Migration Program which might otherwise have been given to people who satisfy the criteria for other visa classes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition's Immigration Policy Statement clearly signalled our intention to introduce measures to reduce the abuse of migration based on fabricated or non&hyphen;bona fide relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures included extending the current two year probationary period for onshore spouse and interdependency applicants to offshore spouse and 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="92"> interdependency applicants, limiting serial sponsorships, introducing more rigorous assessment procedures, and requiring a period of cohabitation for de facto and interdependency relationships. Each of these measures was integral to the overall success of the package in reducing abuse of Australia's Migration Program.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key feature of migration entitlements based upon relationships must be that those involved have a long&hyphen;term commitment to each other. Short&hyphen;term or transitory relationships should not provide non&hyphen;Australians with the life&hyphen;long right to live in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is therefore a major defect in the existing legislation that it does not enable there to be a period of cohabitation in order for people to qualify for a visa to migrate on the grounds of being the de facto spouse of an Australian citizen or resident sponsor. As a result, visa applications are being made where couples have only been together for short periods, sometimes only a matter of a few weeks. Such relationships can provide very little evidence of the necessary long&hyphen;term commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An evaluation of onshore spouse provisions at the beginning of 1996 provided empirical evidence that this is an area of concern, with de facto relationships being twice as likely as de jure marriages to break down during visa processing alone. The government considers that requiring evidence of a period of cohabitation is necessary to ensure that only couples who have already demonstrated their long&hyphen;term commitment can be granted a visa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions in the bill will enable Regulations to specify the detail of the requirements, including any cohabitation period. The Regulations will also allow for any exceptions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government considers that it is necessary to impose different requirements on de facto couples to married couples because of the different legal consequences of marriage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will mean that the Migration Regulations will be able to specify the nature and incidents of the relationship which are required to establish a "de facto" relationship between two people, notwithstanding the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was outlined in the coalition's election commitment that de facto spouses will be required to meet different requirements from married couples before their relationship can be recognised for the purpose of visa applications. This differential treatment would create a distinction on the grounds of marital status, and this is presently prohibited by the Sex Discrimination Act 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will exempt Migration Regulations dealing with visa applications from the effect of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, insofar as it applies to the status or condition of being the married or de facto spouse of another person. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that, in relation to the grant of visas, interdependency relationships are not covered by the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 or any other equivalent Commonwealth legislation. As a result, no amendments are required to principal legislation to enable regulations to be made requiring a cohabitation period for those relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government believes that the mischief of bogus and short&hyphen;term relationships is sufficiently serious to warrant an exception being made to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 for visa applications based on de facto spouse relationships. We believe that this measure will contribute to the range of initiatives we are taking to renew public confidence in the integrity of this component of the Migration Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I shall now turn to the provisions relating to the proposed visa application charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government considers that the present system of payments for Australian visas is unnecessarily complex. Not only is there a visa application fee, but some applicants are also liable to pay the English Education Charge and the Health Services Charge. These fees and charges are imposed and collected under three separate pieces of legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present system also imposes a burden on Australian taxpayers because the indirect costs to government of handling visa applications and providing post&hyphen;settlement services cannot be recovered on a fee&hyphen;for&hyphen;service basis. This means that a proportion of government services that are provided to visa applicants are currently funded from general taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This situation is not consistent with the government's stated election policy that "the coalition endorses . . . cost recovery of immigration procedures and services . . . to ensure that taxpayers are not called on to subsidise the processing of applications for migration."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government proposes to simplify the processing of payments for visa applications by implementing a single visa application charge that will be payable by applicants for visas. This will be imposed by the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996. The new charge will replace the existing system of visa application fees, the English Education Charge and the Health Services Charge. It will also allow recovery both of direct and indirect costs of processing visa applications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The settings of the new scheme are very closely modelled on the existing charge schemes, which were introduced by the previous government. The details of the visa application charge will be set out in the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broadly speaking, the charge will be payable in two instalments. The first instalment (comparable to the existing system of visa application fees) is all that the majority of visa applicants will be 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="93"> required to pay. This will include all applicants for temporary visas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations will provide that the second instalment will only be paid by people who have satisfied all of the criteria for the grant of a permanent visa to enter and remain in Australia. These are exactly the same people who would pay the existing English Education Charge and Health Services Charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Valid visa applications that are made before the commencement of the visa application charge will continue to be subject to the existing fee and charging arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amount of the charge will be prescribed in the Migration Regulations and will be subject to the ceiling set out in the Migration (Visa Application) Charge Bill 1996. A similar legislative ceiling mechanism is already in use for both of the charges that currently apply to visa applications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations will reflect the fee and charge settings already announced in the budget context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be appropriate flexibility to exempt certain persons from the application charge, or from part of the application charge. In some circumstances, such as refugee and humanitarian applicants, the charge will be nil. The Regulations will also provide for a waiver of the charge and for refunds in appropriate circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also amends the Immigration (Education) Act 1971 to ensure that a person is permitted to have only one entitlement of up to 510 hours of English language tuition under that act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final measures in this bill relate to Australian citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is strongly committed to recognising the national significance of Australian citizenship. It represents our commitment to a common future and formal membership of the Australian community, and brings with it the responsibilities and privileges of that membership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government remains firmly committed to the general principle that a person granted citizenship after making a full and frank disclosure of all relevant factors should be on an equal footing with any other Australian citizen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the government is equally determined that the value of Australian citizenship should not be undermined by allowing the grant of citizenship to stand where it has been granted as the result of fraud or deception.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet the current provisions for deprivation of Australian citizenship in these circumstances are limited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is currently no provision for depriving a person of Australian citizenship if it was obtained 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> by fraud at the time of immigration. For example, a person who migrated to Australia on spouse grounds cannot be deprived of citizenship if it is later proven that there was never any intention of a genuine union.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, a person who committed fraud when applying for citizenship cannot be deprived of that citizenship if prosecution for the fraud is not commenced within ten years of its occurrence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government considers that this is unacceptable. People should not be able to hide behind Australian citizenship which was obtained by deception. To allow them to do so weakens the meaning and value of Australian citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, in accordance with the government's pre&hyphen;election policy commitment, the proposed amendments to the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 and the Migration Act 1958 will allow deprivation, without time limitation, of future grants of Australian citizenship obtained as a result of fraud, whether at the time of immigration or of application for citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Deprivation can only occur after a person has been successfully prosecuted for a relevant offence and where the minister is satisfied that it would be contrary to the public interest for the person to continue to be an Australian citizen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures will further enhance the value and significance of Australian citizenship.</PARA>

People who made valid visa applications before the introduction of the application charge will not be liable to pay the visa application charge but will remain liable to pay the existing English Education Charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The English Education Charge is prescribed by regulations which are subject to a statutory ceiling. The bill will increase this ceiling to $5,500&mdash;a figure which more accurately reflects the true cost of providing English language tuition to migrants who do not have functional English.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The raised ceiling is consistent with the government's election commitment to achieve greater cost recovery for migration&hyphen;related services.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a totally unnecessary piece of legislation and, because it is unnecessary, it is also a particularly obnoxious piece of legislation. The shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, Mr Daryl Melham, said in the House of Representatives quite correctly that the bill is wrongly named. It should not be named the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill at all; it should be named the Ian McLachlan payback bill. This is a piece of hairy&hyphen;chested political nonsense that this parliament should not be proceeding with. The fact is that nothing now will prevent the construction of this bridge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is not only unnecessary and it is not only obnoxious, it is also a massive vote of no confidence in the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on the way through. Clearly, the cabinet, when it determined that this measure was required, did not have enough confidence in the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to properly discharge his duties under process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fact is there is no protection order in existence to prevent the construction of this bridge. There is also no way in which the minister can be legally compelled to issue one. I am testing my memory here. I am going back a lot of years and I have not bothered looking it up. If I am wrong, I am wrong, but I have a clear recollection of what I believe was the first occasion that this legislation was ever used. I stand to be corrected on it. I have not had time to look it up in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="95">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it was in relation to a dam in Western Australia. It was an acting minister for Aboriginal affairs, from memory, who was responsible&mdash;I think it was the then Senator Susan Ryan&mdash;the minister, I think it was Mr Holding then, being absent. The processes were implemented under the heritage protec tion act in relation to claims that the dam had in fact damaged a sacred site in its construction. An inquiry was conducted. The inquiry found that indeed the dam had damaged the site. There was no argument about that but, because the construction of the dam was at that stage significantly advanced and because a significant public purpose was served to the local communities in the water supplies that came from that dam, the acting minister declined to halt the construction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That action, of course, is completely open to the minister under this act. It is not an act that requires the minister to stop everything at the end of the day. That discretion is available. As a result of the Boobera Lagoon case, if it was not clear before, it has been clear since that the minister cannot be compelled to issue a protection order.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This, of course, has all been canvassed in a Senate committee, but I would be delighted to hear the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) make out his case here today. The fact is, as I have stated, there is no protection order stopping the construction of this bridge now that all that has happened in the past has happened. There is no way that the minister can be compelled to issue such an order. So far as the heritage protection act is concerned, there is nothing stopping the construction of the Hindmarsh Island bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are moving an amendment to this legislation to correct the most obnoxious potential effects of it as far as we are concerned. That is, the provisions of this act will override the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. This is a backdoor attempt to do so, and not a particularly edifying one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested to see&mdash;and I know that all honourable senators will be interested to note, and those who were in fact in attendance at the committee will already know&mdash;that alternative proposals to address this issue, should

<PARA STYLE="Para">An amendment in like terms, as senators in here know, was moved in relation to the social security legislation. The parliamentary secretary representing the government here in this chamber stated, as the government has stated in respect of this issue, `This amendment is unnecessary. We don't intend these provisions under the Social Security Act to infringe on the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. We don't think it's necessary to accept this amendment, but because we don't intend to infringe on the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="96"> Racial Discrimination Act anyway, we'll accept it quite happily,' and reference to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  will show that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wonder&mdash;and I look forward to hearing this from the minister this morning&mdash;if it is a matter of no consequence for the government to accept such an amendment in respect of  recipients of certain social security payments in Australia, why should Aborigines be denied precisely the same amendment? That is precisely what the case comes down to here today if the government wants this legislation passed. The situation is this: if this amendment is carried, we will support the amended bill. It will satisfy our concerns that there will be no transgression of the Racial Discrimination Act and that the parliament will have made this intention crystal clear to a court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the amendment is opposed, then we will oppose the bill. But there is a job for the government here in the Senate this morning. I have copies of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> if honourable senators want me to read out what Senator Tambling said. It is here. I know Senator Harradine was here when it was said. I was here, along with Senator Bolkus. He does not need to read it out. Senator Tambling said, and I repeat it, that the government had no difficulty accepting this precise amendment at all&mdash;it was not necessary and the government did not intend to circumvent the RDA by the back door; therefore, they had no problem accepting it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The job for the government here in the Senate during this debate, if it wants this legislation passed, is to explain to the Senate and to Australia why people in receipt of certain social security benefits can have this protection inserted in law but Aborigines cannot. I have to say that I have tried to construct the thinnest of arguments to explain that, and I cannot. So I will be fascinated to hear what the minister says about it. I repeat again for the benefit of the minister: should the amendment that I foreshadowed be carried by the Senate, we will support the amended bill. But, if it fails, then we will oppose this particular piece of legislation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said earlier that proposals were put to the Senate committee that considered this issue of an alternative form of legislation should the government feel it necessary. It was Frank Brennan who put those proposals. I do not agree with everything Frank Brennan says or does, but even his worst enemies would concede that he is acknowledged as being one of the more competent legal specialists in this area of law in Australia today. Even his worst enemies would concede that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was interested in the response of the Attorney-General's Department to those proposals that he put. What A&hyphen;G's said to the committee effectively was&mdash;and I think this is a fair quote&mdash;`Yes, a bill along these lines could indeed be enacted but it is a matter of policy for the government whether such an approach is preferred.' That of course is precisely the position. It is indeed a policy issue for the government as to whether such an approach would be preferred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say, for what it is worth, which is nothing at all, that as a non-lawyer I simply agree with the commonsense position that Frank Brennan put to the committee in respect of whether the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act itself is a special measure or not. For what it is worth, which is nothing, I think the position of the Attorney-General's Department is wrong, particularly in respect of recent judgments. I would be happy to put a substantial wager on the High Court having that view as well, certainly as the High Court is currently constituted. But whether or not you accept that it is a special measure, I certainly agree with Frank Brennan that it is not relevant to this debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Again, as a non-lawyer, and I know this does not always work in law, in terms of simple English, commonsense and a fair outcome, how could you possibly accept this bill as a special measure for the Ngarrindjeri people? Leave aside all other Aborigines in Australia: how could you possibly do that? Have a look in the international treaty at the definition of what a special measure is. The bottom line of that, unsurprisingly, is that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="97"> special measures are for the benefit of minority groups, not to their detriment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A&hyphen;G's has constructed a very creative argument&mdash;almost as creative as the High Court has been in recent times in certain respects&mdash;that, providing an act did not provide for an outcome which was a lesser outcome than all of the people in a community enjoyed, it could be claimed to be a special measure. I think that is a piece of nonsense. It is impossible in my view to seriously argue,  in non-legal terms at least, for a measure which removes rights and opportunities that people have who are characterised as a group, and that is the Ngarrindjeri people. This bill without question discriminates or purports to discriminate against their interests as against the interests of all other Aborigines in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this bill does is say, yes, all other Aboriginal people in Australia can utilise the heritage protection act to protect particular parts of their heritage but the parliament says that the Ngarrindjeri people, the women particularly, in respect of this particular part of their heritage, cannot have the benefit of that act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">How insidious. Forget the law, because the law is often an ass, as we know. In terms of simple justice, how can you seriously, with a straight face, as minister for Aboriginal affairs, argue that the people who are the subject of this act are not adversely discriminated against? Of course they are. The terms of the bill lay that out only too clearly. It is not a special measure for their benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not having a go at lawyers. They are doing their job. The lawyers in Attorney-General's have a brief to put the best possible construction on the policy direction in which the government wants to go; they have done their job, and, in law, they may be right. In terms of the purpose for which special measures are intended by their simple definition&mdash;that is, for the benefit of a group&mdash;how could the minister for Aboriginal affairs, who is not a lawyer but the minister for Aboriginal affairs, argue with a straight face?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He can put a legal argument on behalf of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department. He can 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> repeat those words that were uttered to the Senate committee, but how could he with a straight face as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs say this is a special measure for the benefit of the Ngarrindjeri people, for whom it is intended?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a nonsense. It is a removal of their rights and, therefore, it is an utter travesty of the purpose for which special measures were intended for particular small groups of people. The government has sullied the legislative program of this Senate by bringing this in here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We know that this bill has got nothing to do with the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. We know that it is a political bill. We know and the Senate committee knows that other legislative measures are available to the government should the government think they are necessary&mdash;and we do not think they are&mdash;and in policy terms determine to use them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this is all about hairy&hyphen;chested political tokenism. I have been in the business long enough to recognise it when I see it. This is all about boosting the stocks in South Australia and letting Ian McLachlan feel that he has been vindicated in terms of the embarrassment that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge caused him. That is what this is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not good law. This is bad law and bad policy. It is particularly bad policy for the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs to be bringing into the Senate on behalf of his constituency because this bill, unblushingly, is predicated on removing rights from people, not conferring them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would love to hear an argument&mdash;as well as an argument from the minister&mdash;as to why the government would not accept in favour of Aboriginal people in Australia the amendment which in like terms was happily accepted by the government in respect of social security recipients. I would love to hear that argument. I would also like to hear an argument from the minister as the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, not as a lawyer, as to how he sees this act as a special measure for the benefit of the Ngarrindjeri

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My colleague Senator Bolkus will canvass another major problem that we have got with this legislation. He will canvass arguments as to what power the government believes this bill is based upon. I will be interested to hear the results of that debate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we put aside the political rhetoric for one moment and take a look at the substance of the bill, I think you can make a claim that the Senate is being asked to legislate in favour of racial discrimination.

We have seen a lot of buzz words and tabloidism in previous months associated with this issue, but I think we need to examine the government's justification for this bill by going into the chronology of events which surround it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The chronology begins in February 1995 when a single judge of the Federal Court brought down his decision in Chapman v. Tickner, quashing former Minister Tickner's declaration under section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection

When you look at this chronological account of events, you can see that most of the things that happened were not in any way connected with the actions of the Ngarrindjeri women. This is a court case&mdash;the minister v. Chapman. In June 1995, former Minister Robert Tickner announced that he would appoint Justice Jane Mathews to provide a further report under section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Heritage Protection Act to afford procedural fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Former Minister Tickner said at the time that a further inquiry would not commence until his appeal against the Federal Court&mdash;in the previous case&mdash;had been handed down. That decision was handed down in December 1995 and the minister's appeal failed. Again this is happening separate from the Ngarrindjeri women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In June 1995, the South Australian government established a royal commission to inquire into and report on whether any aspect of the women's business was fabricated. In September 1996, the High Court brought down its decision in Wilson v. the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, finding that the appointment of Justice Jane Mathews offended the separation of powers doctrine under the constitution. So we have a hugh concentration of resources on legal challenges and legal procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think you could argue that, if the High Court had not ruled the report invalid because of the constitutional limits on the use of federal judges, the applicant women would have had no further recourse. So all we are seeing is due process of law. We might not like how long it takes. Yes, I think we would say it has been protracted and in some cases convoluted. But it is our legal system. If it is to have any claim to legitimacy, then it has to afford all petitioners avenues for redress and all people a full measure of natural justice.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="99">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the Ngarrindjeri women's fault that these delays have occurred. They were not in here setting up inquiries and all the rest of it. In many respects the delays have been unavoidable. I do not see the government hopping in in other areas, where civil litigation can take up to six years. I do not see them hopping in there, attempting to circumvent the rule of law because of some kind of protracted outcome or delay. I think you can argue that the Ngarrindjeri women are entitled to have their application determined according to Australian law. It is a right of citizenship of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In looking at the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator Campbell), I think we see a repetition of some of the buzz words. Somehow it is sensible to override the Racial Discrimination Act, we are told indirectly. I also think that there is a lack of some factual legal basis in the second reading speech. We see talk of `further impeding the building' of the bridge. We see the parliamentary secretary speaking of removing the hiatus. We see the citation of advice from the Attorney-General's Department that yet another report must be prepared or the current law changed. Even more extraordinary, on the issue of appointing another report the parliamentary secretary said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While this appears to be the process least likely to cause concern, the recent history of the administration of the act . . . reveals that, even if all the "i's" were dotted, and "t's" crossed, there would be no guarantee of a satisfactory outcome . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There was a very valuable Senate committee hearing into this bill, and I would like to contrast the parliamentary secretary's words with the evidence of Father Frank Brennan, quoting from the joint judgments of Justices Dawson, Toohey, McHugh and Gummow of the High Court in the case Wilson v. Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A report is no more than a condition precedent to the exercise of the minister's power to make a declaration.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The reason I am going into all of this is that the minister says there is one thing he has to do or will not do and we are saying, `You don't have to do anything. You can go ahead and build the bridge now.' I want to rely on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> this a little. Father Brennan, in quoting the justices, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reporter is not expressly required to hold a hearing but may nevertheless be required to observe requirements of procedural fairness . . . the act does not require the reporter to disregard ministerial instruction, advice or wish if preparing the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Father Brennan went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What is required under the legislation is 14 days notice; written representations to be received&mdash;given the history of what has gone on with this, where everyone has made their representations in the past&mdash;and seven days allowed for those to come in; another 14 to 21 days allowed for people then to make responses to any other written representations that have been received; and then the writing of a final report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In response to questions from Senator Bolkus to Mr Henry Burmester, Chief General Counsel of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department, about the existence of any legal impediment preventing the construction of the bridge, I believe his evidence was a resounding no. There was no legal impediment. I believe the Attorney-General's Department acknowledged that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge could have in fact been built after 24 July and, also, that there is presently nothing holding up the building of that bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Senator Herron, the minister upon whom ultimately the unfettered discretion lies to make a declaration which would prevent the bridge from being built, when asked if he had any intention of making such a declaration, responded by saying that the question was theoretical because he cannot predetermine the outcome of a report that has not been produced. I think the minister has illustrated that there is another possible and less draconian route here and it is one that the High Court has confirmed. He has absolute discretion as long as the principles of natural justice are adhered to. That is why I am I saying that this bill is unnecessary; that is why I agree with Senator Collins. It is the politics that are motivating this bill, not the legal necessity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The most revealing evidence comes from Mr and Mrs Chapman themselves in response to questions from Senator McKiernan. Senator McKiernan asked:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="100">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Who is stopping the construction of the bridge now? Who is preventing construction starting next Monday, for instance?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Chapman answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing is legally stopping it. There are no legal impediments, and there have not been any legal impediments since July this year . . . The state government have said that they are unwilling to commence construction of the bridge whilst there is a threat that it may be stopped or that this bill may not get through or when another reporting procedure may end up stopping the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The most startling revelations derive from evidence given by the solicitor for the Chapmans, Mr Palyga. When he was asked by Senator Bolkus what the problem was with starting the bridge, he replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem is that the state government have refused point blank. We have written them a letter about once a week for the last nine months saying, `Start the bridge' . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and we cannot get them to change their mind on it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This reminds me a bit of the Queensland Premier's response to the Century Zinc situation which is: when you have a problem, let's just have a special piece of legislation. When it is inconvenient to follow due process, we will just introduce a special bill&mdash;no worries about that. That is what we are doing here, apart from the comments that Senator Collins made about Mr McLachlan's role in this and the comments that Mr Melham, the shadow minister, made in his speech in the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe this bill is necessary. I think the legal advice is that the bridge could have started after 24 July. We have to ask: why are we doing this? I think the politics of it have been adequately referred to by Senator Collins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the matter of the Racial Discrimination Act and special measures, I note that, in the coalition's election policy, the promise to respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act was put to the Australian people; yet we are having this discussion about how much this action constitutes a special measure. Does this make it inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act? I suppose we will debate that at greater length when we debate the ALP's amendment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some witnesses put forward an argument which said that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill is inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act in that it is not a special measure and it does discriminate against the Ngarrindjeri when compared with all other indigenous groups in Australia, because their heritage in the Hindmarsh Island bridge corridor cannot be protected by a valid application for protection considered by the minister whereas the heritage of all other indigenous persons, it is argued, can be so protected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Further on the matter of special measures, I think you can mount the argument that heritage protection for indigenous people is not a special measure. It is not a matter of giving some kind of temporary special assistance to a disadvantaged group but, rather, of according substantive equality by treating unlike cases differently. We had a lot of discussion on this in the committee hearings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you have a political point to make first and you are designing a bill to get around that, it is easy to try to twist your understanding of whether you are bringing people back to some kind of substantive equality and therefore you are not breaching the Racial Discrimination Act. I thought that was a very clever kind of argument but, as a matter of principle, I do not think that is the right way to go. In my view, special measures are designed to ensure such groups of individuals have equal enjoyment in the exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms to everybody else. Designing a bill to take away the rights as applied to them is just like some aspects of the Wik case, and the flow-on from native title and its link-up to the Racial Discrimination Act. I do not think it is the way to go; I do not think it is necessary. The minister has it in his power to make sure that he can achieve the government's stated outcome of the bridge being built.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill is to stop the Hindmarsh bridge from being affected by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984. The land and water surrounding the bridge area from Goolwa to Hindmarsh Island 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="101"> are to be exempt from the act. The other reason is to remove the project from the inquiry process and from any court challenges the project may face in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have heard from the opposition that, in their opinion, the development of the bridge can proceed without this bill. They say the developers are not stopped from going ahead and that it is therefore a stunt for developers to take away Aboriginal people's rights by the way the act demeans the Racial Discrimination Act. Of course, the opposition has an amendment in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) could allow the development to proceed under discretionary powers&mdash;it could be either a section 9 emergency declaration or a section 10 declaration if a report is produced&mdash;in the act. What this bill in effect does is stop the process started by previous Minister Tickner under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, which investigated significant sites for  protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current minister, Senator Herron, could continue with this process and look at whether there are significant sites which warrant protection under section 10; but, instead, he is trying to circumvent this process by overriding the Commonwealth heritage protection act to make way for the development. With all the statements that have been made by this minister, you would think that protecting sites of significance to Aboriginal people is his mandate&mdash;no matter what anybody else says&mdash;and he is to be blamed if this does not happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> It seems that it is debatable whether the bill itself is inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. It is also argued that any future acts or regulation changes could leave it wide open to be changed so that future acts are inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. We have heard that both Frank Brennan and the Social Justice Commissioner, Mick Dodson, believe this bill goes against the Racial Discrimination Act because it goes against fair and equal treatment under the act for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Aboriginal people will have been excluded from having their applications heard in this one project case, and that was very well argued by Senator Bob Collins. It singles out one group of people for discrimination. The government has claimed that this is a `special measure'. Special measures are those allowed under both the heritage act and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination&mdash;or CERD&mdash;which are racially discriminatory because they advance the interests of the racial group or they remedy a present inequality suffered by that group. This so-called `special measure' does not do either of those things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a bill that goes against the principles enshrined in the Racial Discrimination Act, the CERD and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The government has not given any reason why this bill is consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. They only give reasons why they should not put in the amendment that says it should not be inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. With the rest, they are mainly dealing with speculation; they have not given us any clear reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Let us give a potted history of what has gone on here. The early history of the project is that, from the beginning, the project failed to get adequate environmental protection. The real story is that, in the first place, the project should not have been approved on environmental grounds. The decision was wrong, but the government at the time approved the project because of some deal between the state ALP government at the time, the local council and the developers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The story goes like this. The ALP government did a deal with a council to have a bridge. At the time, the developers just wanted a better ferry service over to the island, but the council wanted the bridge in order to facilitate more development and, therefore, sold it to the developers on the basis that they would profit from future development. The bridge did not get a proper environmental impact statement and should not have been approved at the time. The State government rushed it through the environmental impact assessment process in order to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="102"> get it approved quickly. When the State government wanted to back out of the bridge project, it wanted the federal government to overrule and step in so the federal government would have to pay the compensation costs to the developer instead of the State government. Originally the federal Liberals, in opposition, were opposed to the bridge. When the Liberal State government was elected it got trickier because they did not want to pay compensation. Now we have a coalition federal government and everybody wants to avoid paying compensation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It appears that the State ALP Aboriginal affairs minister at the time mentioned that, both on environmental and Aboriginal grounds, the bridge should never have re ceived State approval. This brings together Aboriginal and environmental heritage issues and it shows that both parties here are in it up to their ears. We can hear that the outrage is not particularly strong on behalf of Labor because there is involvement on both sides.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to the Aboriginal history of Hindmarsh, the bridge between Goolwa and Hindmarsh Island was first proposed in the early 80's. The proponents, as we have heard, were the Chapmans. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act protects sacred sites, upon application from Aboriginal people, that should be preserved, with details about the site's significance. The Ngarrindjeri people made an application under section 10, while Tickner was still minister. Senator Herron should follow through the process by providing a report on the sites of significance under section 10.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous minister, Mr Tickner, tried to do this but both the Saunders and Mathews reports were ruled invalid on technicalities. This is due to the deficiencies in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, which would not allow the secret women's business to be protected as evidence. Basically, the act does not allow for secret business because all the proponents under section 10 have to be told of what the Aboriginal objections are and that, of course, in a cultural sense is appalling. The Evatt report of August 1996 was on the deficiencies in the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> act and had good suggestions for improving the act. Once these are done the Ngarrindjeri people can finally have their hearing because, as it stands, with two failed attempts, they have not yet been heard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister Herron needs to appoint someone to prepare a section 10 report. Obviously, he would then be in the position of being able to ignore it. But his obligation under the act is to prepare the section 10 report, which he can then deal with as he sees fit. In fact, in order to proceed with the project, they are intending to break these various provisions and, in the end, not give the Aboriginal people the hearing. It is true that the process has been arduous and heart breaking, but this is not an excuse for taking away Aboriginal peoples' rights to be heard in opposition to a development project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The history of the previous inquiries are: first of all, the Jacobs inquiry, then the Saunders inquiry, the South Australian royal commission, the Mathews inquiry and the Evatt report. In relation to the Jacobs inquiry&mdash;an independent barrister&mdash;a report was never released. In the Saunders inquiry of May 1994, Professor Saunders prepared a section 10 report after a Ngarrindjeri application in 1993. This gave the minister the circumstances to make a declaration, which Minister Tickner did, protecting the area for 25 years. The Federal Court overturned this on appeal because of the lack of technical specification of the area&mdash;that the Minister had not read the secret women's business aspect of the report; he had a female adviser do it out of respect for the women.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No women who supported the women's business gave evidence to the South Australian royal commission into the possible fabrication of women's business. What a surprise! It was only those who said it was a fabrication. These, of course, were the dissident women. So the commission ruled it was a fabrication on the basis of biased evidence. It was later shown that the dissenting women themselves `disclaimed any knowledge of the island as a significant place'. Now that is different from what basically is often claimed.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="103">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Mathews inquiry, in December 1995, the Ngarrindjeri lodged a new application over the area. The section 10 was activated. Minister Tickner appointed Senator Crowley to oversee the inquiry and Justice Jane Matthews to do the section 10 report&mdash;as women&mdash;in order to avoid the same mistake. There was a change of government in the middle of this and Senator Herron has not appointed, or has refused to appoint, a female minister to deal with the claim. If the criticism has been that a minister has never seen this, it should be relatively easy to deal with it by appointing a female minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the same time, the Broome crocodile farm judgment in the Federal Court said that all parties have to be informed of the application. This, of course, has implications for Hindmarsh in that the Chapmans, plus the  State government, would have to know the women's business. The Ngarrindjeri then withdrew evidence and didn't present some. Of course, the Mathews report ruled in support of a section 10 declaration on the basis of insufficient evidence. Despite this, Justice Mathews found that Hindmarsh Island and the Goolwa Area were of great traditional significance to the Ngarrindjeri people. That is on page l23. Nine `dissident' women appealed this report to the High Court, challenging Judge Mathews's executive role instead of judicial role. It was overturned and the report ruled invalid. Now the minister must go again and get another report prepared.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Evatt inquiry, in October 1995, was asked to review the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act after previous difficult cases. It produced a report in August 1996 which put restrictions on information and ensured procedural fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The current situation is that the Senate legal and constitutional committee has said that the current application for a section 10 is `still live' and `there is legal obligation to set in train the process for a s.10 inquiry and report on that application' even if the minister ignores the findings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The conclusion is that we have a situation of development at all costs, abuse of common law processes, abuse of procedural fairness and of human rights, cultural and religious 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> disrespect and racism. The minister, it would seem, is worried about going down the section 10 route, perhaps because another report would also be written off on technicalities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the problem is, as we have seen, that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act needs to be changed in order to allow for proper and fair dealing with such cases&mdash;such as secret women's business or it could be secret men's business&mdash;then we need to talk about that. We need to talk about how we make sure that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act does what it is meant to do, that is, protect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander sites of significance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a number of major environmental issues, as I  indicated. Senator Brown will be seeking the call later in this debate to deal with those issues so I will not go into detail. But this has been a farce. It has been a farce from both sides of politics, and I indicate clearly that the Greens (WA) will not be supporting this bill.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak in this debate and to follow on the comments of my colleague Senator Collins. I think the government is making a big mistake with this legislation. Unfortunately for Minister Herron, he is in many ways the bunny that has been caught in the headlights here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can understand how the government took this decision. I think they decided, on coming to government, that they wanted the bridge built and that they wanted also to extract as much political gain as possible out of this issue. They had seen it as a winner in South Australia and they thought that they could prolong it and raise the temperature on the issue by introducing legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, as is quite clear from the evidence before the committee, was the person who was given the job of pursuing the legislation. But unfortunately for him, he was not fully advised on the options available to him. This is a bad law for a number of reasons. It is a bad law for the reasons mentioned quite comprehensively, I think, in the minority reports of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. Driven 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="104"> by prejudice, the government introduced legislation. They think they need legislation. As I say, they saw it as a winner.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But these things do turn, and, unfortunately for this minister, he has had a couple of issues that have turned on him already in this area. He embarked in a cavalier fashion on forcing an auditor onto ATSIC and just a few weeks later he found that the courts of this country decided that he acted outside the law in the way that he approached that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a government which decided in response to the CRA issue that there was the need for special legislation, only to be left high and dry by the company involved in Queensland&mdash;on the basis that they thought that the legislative route was a provocative one and one that would never end and that negotiation was the best way through it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this bill gets through, I can anticipate some quite fundamental problems with it in the courts. It will be challenged, Minister&mdash;that has been made clear&mdash;and it will be challenged on a number of grounds. If you were to pursue this legislation, if it were to get through, you would probably be following the footsteps of your great heroes in Queensland, Joh and Premier Borbidge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Joh Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen took the decision which led the Aboriginal community in Queensland to taking the Mabo case to the High Court&mdash;and he will be forever thanked by Aboriginal Australia for his provocative actions with respect to the land at that time. If it were not for the provocative action of Premier Borbidge, you probably would not have had the Wik decision of a couple of weeks ago. I think, Minister, that this legislation also has the capacity to lay down some quite fundamental legal principles if it goes through and if it is taken to the High Court, which I am sure it will be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It could very well fail because we are talking here about discriminatory legislation which takes away the rights of a small group of the Aboriginal race. As Senator Cooney spelt out quite eloquently in his minority report, there is something quite fundamental in our system of law, and that is equality before the law.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You should know that, Minister, because in your cabinet submission of April last year on the implications of the Wik case advice was given to government that the High Court could very well strike down any legislation in respect to that on the basis of it being discriminatory and contrary to the concept of equality before the law. That is well and truly squarely in the middle of that cabinet advice&mdash;advice which of course is not a public document but advice which has had some currency in the media in recent days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Equality before the law is fundamental. As Senator Cooney says, in discriminating against a small group of one race&mdash;and let us face it: there is a capacity here to be racially discriminate&mdash;you are breaching the rule of law; you are not providing equality before the law and, as a consequence, there could be some repercussions in terms of the courts striking it down.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another issue which needs to be confronted and one which, I am sure, the government has not confronted: the question of what power you are acting under, under what constitutional power this legislation is being introduced into this parliament. I think that the government has not really considered that. In terms of evidence, there is no indication of that being considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You will come back and say, `Look, it is placitum 51(xxvi) of the constitution that gives us the right to legislate in respect of a race.' I cannot see what other power you will try to invoke. But, if you do that, you are treading on very treacherous ground, very shaky ground, because judge after judge of the High Court of Australia over the last 15 years has spelt out that provision, particularly as it applies to Aborigines in Australia. That power can be used only for the benefit of that group of people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one has argued that this legislation is for the benefit of Aboriginal Australians. It is legislation which takes away a right that they have. I can go through precedents&mdash;and maybe I should for the benefit of government advisers. The concept was one which, like many other concepts, was kicked off by His Honour Mr Justice Murphy in the Koowarta 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="105"> case emanating from Queensland&mdash;Koowarta v. Bjelke&hyphen;Petersen. I can see this case against Minister Herron.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1982, Justice Murphy said in respect of placitum (xxvi) of section 51 of the constitution that `for' means for the benefit of. It does not mean `with respect to' so as to enable laws intended to affect adversely the people of any race. If `with respect to' or a similar expression were intended, it would have been used, as it is in other parts of section 51. See the opening words of 51(xxxi) and 51(xxxvi).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the referendum to give power to the Commonwealth over Aboriginal matters the intention of the Australian people was not to give power to the Commonwealth to discriminate against those people. It was to give them power to discriminate for the benefit of those people, for the protection of those people. That is what Murphy was saying in 1982.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The approval of the proposed law for the amendment of par (xxvi) by deleting the words `other than the aboriginal race' was an affirmation of the will of the Australian people that the odious politics of oppression and neglect of Aboriginal citizens were to be at an end, and that the primary object of the power is beneficial. The passing of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Racial Discrimination Act</EMPHASIS>  manifested the Parliament's intention that the power will hereafter be used only for the purpose of discriminatorily conferring benefits upon the people of a race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The point is one that has continued and one that is a pretty strong one. They are not the only judges. Mr Justice Deane is cited in the Blackshield, Williams and Fitzgerald document as saying:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will get to judicial activism in a second, Senator. But how do they say that over the recent years Justices Murphy, Wilson, Gaudron, Deane and Chief Justice Brennan have all espoused this principle? How do they write that out of the law books? And they cannot talk about judicial activism as if it is something new. The high prince of judicial activism was His Honour Mr Justice Barwick when he rewrote and rewrote again the tax laws of this country. You reckon that was judicial activism. There was no complaint from conservative Australia then about judicial activism.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The High Court of this country, despite Mr Howard, the Prime Minister, trying to limit its powers by definition in press statements a couple of weeks ago, has always had the power and responsibility to define the common law. That sits together with its responsibility and power to define statute law. It is not part of the Australian system alone. It is part of the British system that we have inherited to our benefit. It is a bit on the too smart side for the Prime Minister to say they have only got the responsibility of interpreting the law the parliament passes, when he should know, if he is worth his law degree, that defining the common law is something that has been the historical role of the courts in this system, not just the High Court. Let me go on. Justice Deane in essence says that when you are legislating in respect of Aboriginal Australia it has to be to their benefit. In the Koowarta case, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a law of the character which comes within the primary scope of the grant of legislative power to make laws with respect to the people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is not a special law in the sense that Justice Deane talks about. His assertion is that you need to work to their benefit. He also 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> says that any deprivation of rights of those people has to be on the basis of just terms. I raise that as another issue that has not really be considered in this process. We are here contemplating taking a right away from the people involved&mdash;and that is the right to have a process. It is not stretching the case law of the bank nationalisation case, which is judicial activism in the time of Howard, and the Georgiadis case of recent years, to argue on behalf of the women involved that if you are taking away their rights you have to look at just compensation. So, as I say, we have had a group of judges over the years in the High Court who have asserted that this power can be used only for the benefit of the people. You have a problem there. You are taking away the right to process and you may also have a problem there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not necessary. There is no order in place. There is no intention by the minister to issue an order under the existing act. Let us move away from this sham piece of political prejudice and point scoring. Let us look at the existing law. Senator Collins was quite right. There is a precedent in place under which this minister can allow this bridge to be built immediately. It is not just me saying that; it is the lawyers acting for the Chapmans who say that. It is the lawyers who are acting for the Chapmans who have been writing to the state government of South Australia since July last year saying, `Look, there is no order in place.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know whether I need to go through the evidence of the committee but it was pretty clear, Senator Herron, and it was pretty clear in terms of what you said before the committee: there is no order in place that would stop the construction of the bridge. There is no intention to have an order and there is no chance of an order being forced on you. That is the existing law, clearly understood by all involved&mdash;and there is no chance of an interim order. The court has made that very clear. Not only that, you have stated it to the committee. You made it clear that you understand that that is the legal situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You do not need special legislation to prevent you making a declaration, Senator Herron. That is correct. So why do you need 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="107"> this bill, particularly when on the same land that Mr Tickner issued a declaration order on, because of the lapsing of that declaration, a marina is being built right next to where the Chapmans want to build the bridge&mdash;on the same plot of land, on the subject land? Why is that not being stopped? It is because there is nothing in place that would stop either that or the construction of the bridge other than the fact that you want to play politics with this. It will come back and bite you where it really hurts&mdash;your credibility. There is no need for this. It is clear in the evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Herron, you do not intend to run away from your evidence, do you? You are not going to come in here and say, `Look, I got it wrong when I said there was nothing that could stop the construction of the bridge'? You are not going to say that there is no court that would force an order on you other than to have a report, are you?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you had commissioned a report instead of introducing this bill last year that process  would have been over by now as well, and you would not have to worry about that either. You have made a bungle of this, Senator Herron. You have been given this to run with and you have bungled it because you have decided to introduce legislation&mdash;and your evidence before the committee exposes your position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Chapmans share the view I have just expressed. Once again, I point people to the evidence of the Chapmans. On Friday, 29 November, as can be found on page 122 of the transcript of the legal and constitutional committee, Senator McKiernan stated, `Who is stopping the construction of the bridge now?' Mr Chapman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing is legally stopping it. There are no legal impediments, and there have not been any legal impediments since July this year. It was finally cleared to go ahead in July this year.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator Bolkus said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . but you have already got construction work going on in the area . . . We have already accepted on the record that there is no legal impediment to the bridge being built. We have also accepted on the record that there is no capacity, under the heritage act, for an interim injunction to force cessation of the work. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Palyga said, `That is right.' Senator Bolkus said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, you have got one project going; you have the state government not proceeding with the other project. You have no legal impediment to the bridge being constructed; you have no capacity for an interim conjunction.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Mr Palyga, the lawyer for the Chapmans, said, `Correct.' He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem with that is that the state government have refused point blank. We have written them a letter about once a week for the last nine months saying, `Start the bridge'. They have refused point blank to go ahead with it on the basis that, if they start sinking dollars into it, if there is any risk that it has to come to a stop because of a final section 10 declaration . . . that money is all down the drain . . . we cannot get them to change their mind on it.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So this is shaky law, it is unnecessary law. We think an amendment is necessary to keep you honest to the Racial Discrimination Act. We in this parliament should not be in the business of discriminatory legislation, particularly on matters like this. There are double standards. The amendment we are moving today is an amendment which was accepted when I moved it to the social security legislation not only here but also by Minister Ruddock in the House of Representatives. I cannot see why the government cannot accept that to make the law at least overcome one of the legal problems it might have and that is in respect of the concept of equality before the law. You have failed twice on two outings so far, Senator Herron. This will be another one.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Greens oppose this legislation. We oppose the bridge. We support the Ngarrindjeri people who oppose the development and the onrush of developments which will follow this bridge in this very vital area of Australia. I want to emphasise the environmental part of this equation. This development is set in the Coorong in the region of the mouth of Australia's greatest river, the Murray. It is a region that includes one of the world's most important wetlands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Coorong is listed as a top order internationally recognised wetland under the Ramsar convention in the list of wetlands of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="108"> international importance of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Not least is the fact that that listing gives international status to this area because in summer the area supports almost one quarter of a million birds of 82 species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the listing under the Ramsar convention are these factors. The Coorong regularly supports 122,000 waders as a summer population. It supports at least one per cent in the western range of the total population of Cape Barren geese. Remember that these were facing extinction just two decades ago. It supports at least one per cent of the world population of black swans. It is the largest permanent breeding habitat&mdash;in fact, the only breeding habitat&mdash;in South Australia of the Australian pelican. It is a breeding area for crested and fairy terns and pied oystercatchers. It is a great example of a hypersaline wetland. It includes in the region endemic musk grass, which is incredibly important for the food chain and the bird life that I have just mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Coorong, at least 12 species of international migratory birds use the shoreline and wetlands as they are at present. The Coorong is ranked first in Australia for both the sharp-tailed sandpiper&mdash;there are 55,700 of them; these migrate from Northern Siberia&mdash;and the red-necked stint, 63,800 also coming from Northern Siberia and Alaska to use this region as their summer feeding ground. It has the third biggest population in Australia of the sanderling, 930 of them coming from north and central Siberia each year. Of the curlew sandpiper, 40,000 migrate from the central high arctic of Siberia. These birds do not breed here, but this summer feeding ground of theirs in the Coorong is vital to their numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to add here that I was in Taiwan in the middle of last year. Some of the species I have just mentioned come through that island and the important wetlands on the western part of Taiwan on their way to Australia. What is happening there is the rapid destruction of the wetlands, squeezing these species closer and closer towards extinction. At the moment, of 80,000 hectares on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the western part of Taiwan, 11,000 are targeted for industrial development while 3,000 are already under the way of destruction and loss of habitat for these birds. Here in Australia, we are charged with doing better than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A tremendous diversity of other birds that are not migratory are in the Coorong. For example, it has the second biggest population in Australia of the pied oystercatcher. There are 630 of them. There are 5,700 red&hyphen;capped plovers and 77,000 banded stilts. Many other species breed in the area, such as swans, pelicans, egrets, spoonbills, cormorants, terns and ibis. The Coorong is, as I have said earlier, the only site in South Australia where pelicans breed regularly. If you add all this together, in total abundance, there are approximately 60,000 waders, 40,000 of which are migratory and come each year around the globe from the artic, in particular from Siberia and Alaska. Of the 30 species of waders, 20 species are migratory. On top of those 60,000 waders, there are 110,000 waterfowl of 14 species. There are 70,000 other waterbirds, 38 species of them, giving a total summer population of 240,000 birds of 82 species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You might ask, `Why should we be worried about that?' The problem is that, as elsewhere in the world where development is encroaching on the habitat of these species, the numbers are falling. If you look at the time scale of the evolution of species rather than the day&hyphen;to&hyphen;day, short-term vision which we so often have in developmental terms, you will find that that downward population spiral is rapid and alarming and requires national action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In fact, 27 species of wetland birds have shown a decrease of at least 10 per cent in the frequency with which they are recorded in this area. In many cases, the loss of numbers exceeds 20 per cent. The causes of the decreases are not known. However, the decline in reed bed habitat and the increase in human activity, with the obvious loss of habitat from buildings and the disturbance from motorised boats, are prime causes, if you want to speculate on why these bird numbers are dropping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is required here before the bridge and the attendant developments that are obviously 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="109"> going to be a consequence of that is a proper regional environmental management plan. This was recommended in the Hinsliff report in 1994. This was preceded by the Murray Mouth Working Group report of 1991, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a clear need for a management strategy over the whole area to protect its conservation status. It is clearly evident that a conflict exists between recreation activities and conservation values within the Murray Mouth region and that this situation is deteriorating.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What has very often been left out in this debate is the unassailable fact that the developers who are behind this bridge and the plans for further developments both on the island and the mainland are a direct threat to this magnificent internationally and nationally prized wetland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There will be further erosion of the bird life. There will be a deterioration of the environmental values of this region with this bridge. Earlier, we heard the arguments&mdash;and I am not going to repeat them&mdash;as to why this legislation, of itself, is unnecessary in so far  as the designs of the developments are concerned. On that basis alone, we ought not be supporting it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to say that the opposition's move to ensure that the Racial Discrimination Act is not, in any way, trammelled by this legislation is one I will support, but I do not believe that that should allow the opposition, if it were successful, to then say, `We will support the legislation.' I believe, again, that the opposition needs to think about that because this legislation does not warrant support. If it is not necessary for the developers, why support it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have just outlined why the development that is proposed&mdash;certainly the developers, through the government, see this legislation as paving the way for them&mdash;will impact injuriously on one of the world's great wetlands. We on this side of the house and, I submit, everybody in this place ought to be opposing this legislation, just as we ought to be opposing the Hindmarsh bridge development and the onrush of further developments, when, as yet, there is no regional management plan in place to draw a line as to where the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rapid change in this region, due to our human impact, would impact deleteriously on the enormous range of other species which have lived in this region for time immemorial.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much. I have to say that to put it on the record, Senator Collins.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President, most legislation which comes before us in the Senate deals with the execution of broad policy, with the making of laws which have general application and with the provision of a remedy for a prevalent vice, and parliament is usually concerned with the social framework within which the community may best operate. So we pass tax laws which apply to everybody who has to pay taxes, we deal with social security provisions which affect all people who might be entitled to pensions, we pass laws about health, about education and about issues which have application to everyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Matters which are specific to individuals or to a specific case do not come before us very often. In the general constitutional set&hyphen;up of our community, they are dealt with by the courts. We have people in here debating policy, debating the rights and wrongs of particular programs that might be put forward by the government and which affect the society as a whole, and other issues that are more specific to the individual where evidence must be examined more closely than perhaps we do using our broad positions. From a philosophical or political standpoint, those factors are used in debating matters here, whereas in court very specific matters are dealt with in terms of the law as it stands and in terms of the evidence that is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why it is a matter of considerable worry that we have before us the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill which does not deal with general policy covering everybody in a particular class. This bill deals very specifically with one group and with one incident. The government has been quite definite about that. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="110"> They do not disguise it; indeed, they proclaim it. That appears from the second reading speech by Mr Miles in the other place. When he was introducing this bill, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to prevent the Commonwealth Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 from further impeding the building of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. The bill achieves this by providing that the provisions of the act do not authorise the minister to make a declaration over the area which will be used to build the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What has happened there is that the act has been repealed, in effect, in respect of one incident only. We might understand if they then said, `We think it is a very bad principle to have this Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. We know that the people opposite disagree with us, but this is a matter of policy and our philosophy about things, and so we are going to knock over the act.' The interesting thing is that they are not saying that. The government then goes on to say, `This is a tremendous bill, this is a great bill. We believe in the principles of the bill. We believe in the general thrust of what that bill says.' The next paragraph that Mr Miles give us says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will not affect the operations of the act in regard to any applications for protection made by members of the local indigenous community in respect of sites of significance elsewhere on Hindmarsh Island, or by the indigenous people elsewhere in Australia.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="COLLINS" NAMEID="OF4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Bob Collins said, this is the one we do not like. So the principle that the government goes forward with is that all this legislation&mdash;the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, plus the Racial Discrimination Act and acts like that&mdash;is good because it sets up rights that citizens of this country can enjoy, and the government says, `Look, we are behind all that.' I am sure the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Senator Herron, would be foremost in the proclamation of human rights and what have you.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So if all these principles are so good, and if these principles are maintained and, indeed, enhanced, why in this particular incident do we say that we are going to, in effect, repeal it for this particular group of people? Why do we say, `Everybody else can have it but not you.' The answer given is that this particular incident has got out of control&mdash;that seems to be the general thrust of what has been said&mdash;and that the processes, as Senator Bolkus said, are such that it becomes an embarrassment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It seems to me that the fact that the processes have gone wrong is not the fault of anybody who is going to be affected by this bridge. Mr and Mrs Chapman came before us. They seemed to me, as I was listening to them, to be very decent, honest people who wanted to go about their business and forward their commercial interests. The same with the indigenous people who came forward. They are the people who are locked into the position. Yet we say that the way out of that is not to go through the usual channels, which would be the judicial channels where you have hearings and rights of appeal and where there is a final decision made. We say, `No, that is no good. We as a parliament will intervene in a situation which is very much of a character which the courts ought to deal with.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is no doubt that parliament has legislative power to do all sorts of things. But the fact that we have the power does not mean that we should use it in a way which does not do well by the system. There was a phrase used by a judge in the last century: he talked about the `tyranny of parliament'. In modern days that has become the tyranny of the executive because the executive, in effect, runs the parliament, and that is a fact of life.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The concept of the tyranny of the parliament is the ability of the parliament, because of the stack&hyphen;up in the numbers, to put through legislation that may adversely affect people, in circumstances where you say `This is really unfair that parliament should be intervening in this way and doing these sorts of things.' When you reach a situation like that you can talk about the tyranny of parliament because&mdash;in my view at least&mdash;you have to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="111"> think, as it were, of the rule of law. There is an overarching concept that says that in spite of the power the executive might have, in spite of the power the parliament might have and, indeed, in spite of the power the courts might have at times, nevertheless there is this overall sense of fairness, this sense of a proper process which should not be violated no matter what the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want go through the arguments that have been put by the speakers before me: Senator Bob Collins, Senator Margetts, Senator Brown and Senator Bolkus. They have illustrated quite clearly what I mean. This legislation is not the first time that this sort of thing has happened, where parliament has intervened in a process which should be better left to the courts. Nevertheless, it is another precedent we could well do without.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The phrase `judicial activism' is a phrase that has been used this morning. That has been much in the news recently. This seems to me to be legislative activism, in other words, the legislature coming in where it ought best not come in. It seems to me that what is happening is that parliament is not, at the moment, moving in areas where it should,  and is moving in areas, as in this case, where it should not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it does violence to the whole process. That is a real issue we have to grapple with. Are we going to, as it were, put aside the Commonwealth Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act? If we are going to do that, let us at least not put aside the Racial Discrimination Act. If we do that, it compounds the problem, compounds the precedent and compounds the difficulties we are going to put ourselves in as a community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this legislation goes through unamended it will be yet another example of where the general expectation that people are entitled to have and the general rights that people are entitled to enjoy will be taken away in respect of a specific group and the rest left to enjoy them until another problem arises. Senator Collins has raised this issue. If these sorts of problems arise again do we then come along and say, `We are not going to repeal the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 except in this next instance. We really believe in the principles but it is just that this got into such difficulties that we have to put it aside'? Then a third time it happens, and so on. What we really mean is that we believe in the principles and we are going to have these principles enshrined in legislation but we really do not want them to operate because when they operate we get into all sorts of inconveniences and we have to go through the processes, and what have you.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If we are going to take that approach, we might almost do away with criminal trials or, if a criminal trial gets into a difficulty and there has to be the process of appeal, why not truncate the whole process by bringing in legislation? In my view this is a bit of legislation that does quite a deal of violence to the constitutional balance that we should be operating under.</PARA></SPEECH>

First of all, on a practical matter, I cannot see why this bill is necessary if the bridge construction is to go on. There is nothing. This bill is not necessary. The government says it wants to avoid uncertainty. It says that this bill does not transgress the spirit of the RDA, the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has to make up its mind about whether it is better to have this bill defeated totally, allow the processes to continue and appoint, for example, another reporter and do so in a manner that will expeditiously conclude this matter one way, or whether it is prepared to allow this bill to go through to the committee stages, or whether it would like this bill to go through to the committee stages so the opposition can move the amendment that has now been circulated. That amendment is now before us and indicates it is an amendment to ensure that the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act prevail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I suppose the government may consider that it may be even more uncertain to do that than  to just jettison the bill completely. I am not sure what the opposition wants to do, to be quite frank&mdash;whether it is going to support the bill in the second reading stage so that its amendment in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act can be moved and, hopefully, be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to hear in due course the arguments to and fro, but my inclination is that the bill is not necessary. It is a deliberate interference in process, as has been indicated by Senator Cooney. As such, it may well be that it ought to be defeated at the second reading stage, but I know that there are other views on that particular aspect and it might well be, as has been argued by Senator Collins on behalf of the opposition, that the bill should be supported with that amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition has made it perfectly clear through Senator Collins that the opposition is prepared to support the motion it is moving so that the Racial Discrimination Act is to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> prevail and, if that gets the support of the majority of the Senate, it will vote for the measure. I indicate that I will be supporting that amendment. My inclination at the present moment is to support the amendment that is to be moved by Senator Collins. As I indicated, it may well be for the minister now and the government to consider whether it is worth while proceeding with the legislation or whether they will also agree with the amendment that is being proposed by Senator Collins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Without delaying this debate any further&mdash;all of the matters have been thoroughly canvassed before the Senate committee and pretty well canvassed in this debate thus far&mdash;and as I want to listen to what the minister has to say, I think the best thing for me to do is sit down and listen to what the minister has to say in response.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I should go through the points that struck me seriatim as the speakers brought forward the arguments, and I thank each one of them for their contribution. Senator Bob Collins started with his usual rhetorical flourish, which, Senator Collins, we all expect of you anyway. You used the words `unnecessary', `obnoxious' and `hairy chested'. I enjoy rhetoric just as much as you do, but I will not use it on this occasion. I will stick to the facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Collins said that nothing prevents the construction going ahead. I might say that, if other speakers are going to be critical of me for not including things that they have said, I thought that rather than repeat matters that have been brought forward I should go along the lines that once it is has been mentioned then I would accept that the others have probably mentioned it too. As is inevitable in these debates, there is considerable overlap of argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned, Senator Collins said that nothing prevents the construction going ahead at the moment and that the amendment will override the Racial Discrimination Act, and brought forward the instance where the government accepted a similar amendment in relation to social security.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="113">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot spoke about heritage issues, the prolonged nature of the due process that had occurred and mentioned that it was in the 1980s that the bridge was first proposed. She also mentioned the Racial Discrimination Act. Senator Kernot ended up saying that we really should do nothing and that the bill should be withdrawn. She said that there was no legal impediment to the bridge going ahead and that, in fact, the bridge construction could start.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts spoke also of the Heritage Protection Act at some length. She said that this bill was a special measure, and I thought I might deal with the bill and the amendment as a whole in my speech. She said that the Aboriginal people were being discriminated against. She spoke then about the secret women's business and the factual matters in relation to the way in which that was handled at the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Bolkus brought in what I thought was extraneous material. He spoke about the special auditor process, the Century Zinc matter and the Queensland Premier. He said that the bill was taking away the rights of a small group, that there was doubt about its constitutional validity and that there were legal opinions in relation to rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He then brought in other material about bank nationalisation, the Georgiadis case and compensation, which I do not think were really relevant to the bill. He thought it was a sham piece of political point scoring but introduced a new statement that if the bill were to pass it would then be challenged in the High Court&mdash;a sort of threat that this would not be the end of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Brown spoke about environmental aspects, particularly in relation to migratory birds, and said that there should be a regional environmental plan. He in fact differed from the rest of the speakers in that he was totally against the construction of the bridge in any case. I think Senator Brown has a difficulty now in supporting the opposition, because they are in fact in favour of the bridge going ahead, with that amendment. Senator Brown will have a difficulty, as I think Senator Harradine has too, but at least Senator Harradine has not clarified his position.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cooney gave his usual scholarly dissertation. He said that we agreed to differ, but I thought, Senator Cooney, with respect, that in your argument you argued against yourself. You said that this was not the first time parliament had intervened, and you spoke about legislative action. Then you argued against that, but then said that it had occurred. It reminded me a little of St Paul's injunction about virtue, but not just yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Cooney, you are known for your usual erudition, but I felt on this occasion that you argued against your own argument. Finally, Senator Harradine agreed with the other arguments that there was nothing to stop the bridge going ahead and said that there should be another reporter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to put the government's position now in relation to all those matters. First of all, why is the bill necessary? In summary, we believe it is necessary because we consider that it is time that the Hindmarsh Island bridge affair was brought to an end once and for all. It has been going on for a long time, as we know. The first proposal was in 1980 and here we are in 1997. We believe it has to finish.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular, in the last three years it has cost in excess of $4 million when the costs of the two state and two federal inquiries into the matter and the associated legal action are added up. Just in the last three years, it has cost $4 million. Three of the inquiries found that the bridge should go ahead&mdash;three. The other was effectively overturned on appeal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, without the legislation, yet another report would have to be prepared. It would be like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waiting for Godot</EMPHASIS> if we had another report. Given the history of litigation surrounding the issue, there would be no guarantee that another report would lead to finalisation of the matter&mdash;none whatsoever. We would be back where we were.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous government is guilty of gross mismanagement and incompetence on this matter&mdash;gross mismanagement and incompetence. The previous government has been the laughing stock of the Australian public in relation to the building of the Hindmarsh Island bridge. They have been the laughing stock of the Australian public and they are 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="114"> prolonging the affair. More importantly than that, I believe, the affair has undermined public confidence in the ability of government to deal sensibly with indigenous heritage issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe the time has come to end it once and for all. This is clearly an exceptional case and the use of special legislation is fully justified. The bill is consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. It is not retrospective and there are no substantive grounds on which to challenge its constitutional validity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do I say that the bill is consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act? The government's legal advice is that the bill is consistent with the RDA. The heritage protection act is a special measure for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The bill effectively removes this measure as it applies to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge area; it does not affect any other part of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill does not leave Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with fewer rights than the general community and, consequently, is consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. It does not apply to any particular group. They can still apply for protection after the bill is passed, but the minister is restrained from making a declaration. That is the difference. That does not seem to have been understood by the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The next question is: is the bill retrospective? The government's advice is that the bill is not retrospective. The bill provides that the minister may not grant a protection order over the Hindmarsh Island Bridge area. Clearly, it only affects the future. It does not change the law that applied to events in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's advice is that there are no substantive grounds for challenging the bill's constitutional validity. Consequently, it will be open to a court to strike out any challenge to the bill's validity at an early stage in proceedings. In particular, I refer to Senator Bolkus's comments. He built his entire argument, therefore, on a false premise. It just collapses because there is no foundation for it. I think Senator Margetts said it was a special measure.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Margetts. I am pleased that that is clarified. The government has never suggested that the bill is a special measure. It is an amendment to a special measure, rolling back a special measure but not to a level below that of the general community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be nothing to stop the construction of the bridge, but it is possible, if not likely, that I can be forced to go through this process of yet another section 10 report. That will be the effect of it, Senator Harradine. The cycle continues. There is no finality; it just keeps going. We have then got to thus justify the delays, the costs and the processes&mdash;another report is about another $1 million. But if that is what the Senate wants, so be it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor agrees that the bridge should go ahead. Senator Collins, correct?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="COLLINS" NAMEID="OF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Bob Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But it opposes the bill. It agrees that the affairs should be brought to an end. In other words, it agrees with the end, but not with the means.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor supports the suggestion that a further short sharp report be prepared, thereby allowing the minister to quickly make a decision to allow the bridge to be built. However, it suggests this option only because the proposer said he thinks the bill is inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. He is incorrect on that issue, meaning that the whole basis for his suggested alternative way of resolving the affair, therefore, disappears because he is incorrect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moreover, legal advice indicates that a short sharp report would be subject to a serious risk of challenge, leaving us in a few months time in exactly the same position as we are now in, except that more time and money would have been wasted. Father Brennan when he came before the committee conceded that such a report would be a sham because its result would be predetermined. I certainly do not see any virtue in that.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="115">
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="COLLINS" NAMEID="OF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Bob Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did he say that? I bet he didn't.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suggest you read the report. It is difficult to see why this course of action is more palatable than the passage of legislation to close off the affair. There would then be the prospect that the minister's final decision relating to the grant of a protection order would be challenged. Given that it appears to be universally agreed that the whole process would be a sham, there is a good chance that the minister's decision would also be illegal. Clearly, this option was fraught with legal obstacles and cannot be pursued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Margetts brought up the secret women's business. You will be aware that whether or not the area on which the Hindmarsh Island Bridge will be built is a sacred site depends critically on the existence of the so-called secret women's business. It is now clear that this was a fabrication. Four reports have been prepared into the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair and only one supported the existence of the secret women's business and this report by Professor Cheryl Saunders was quashed by the Federal Court. Moreover, it is clear that her report was flawed. For example, it appears that she never once visited the South Australian museum, which holds considerable anthropological knowledge on these sorts of matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Justice Mathews in the most recent report on the matter found that there was insufficient evidence that the Hindmarsh Island Bridge area was a sacred site. The South Australian royal commission conclusively found that the secret women's business had been fabricated&mdash;a royal commission. The facts bear these findings out. For example, the main proponent of the secret women's business had previously written that she did not know much about the culture, language and customs of the Ngarrindjeri people. She also claimed that the place that constituted the secret women's business was an exact place, yet Professor Saunders found it comprised about 100 square kilometres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also seems convenient that the so-called applicant women are the only people who 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> seem to be in possession of this knowledge. Moreover, the secret women's business had never been raised before by anyone, even indirectly, until this affair began. Not even the anthropologists who had done much study into the Ngarrindjeri had any awareness of its existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the question is then whether there should be a fully-fledged report. Labor simply suggested that the government do nothing, that it should simply allow this affair to roll on just as it has to date and that another fully-fledged report should be prepared after which the minister would make a decision on whether to grant a protection order. It further claims that the South Australian government should simply go ahead and build a bridge because there is no legal obstacle to it doing so. Again, this option is based on the false premise that the bill is inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. The government's advice is that it is consistent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another properly prepared report would be likely to cost, as I mentioned before, in the vicinity of $1 million of taxpayers' money. It is difficult to see how this expenditure is justified given that this would be the fifth report on this issue. Moreover, further legal action is also inevitable&mdash;meaning that there is a significant chance we will be in exactly the same position in about a year's time. Will the opposition say that we should go through all this all over again?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor's claim that the South Australian government should simply go ahead and build the bridge before this report is completed and before the minister makes his decision is highly dubious. Would you go ahead and build a bridge in this situation given the possibility of further legal action, financial constraints and difficulty with funds? The opposition is really suggesting that the South Australian government take all the risks in this case. The law in this area is obviously still in the process of being developed. There is little certainty. It is precisely because of this that we have ended up where we are today. We would not be here today if there was clarity in the law. In those circumstances, it would be a brave person to tell the South Australian government that it should not 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="116"> worry about what a court might find in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In these circumstances, it is perfectly reasonable for the South Australian government to delay commencing construction on the bridge until there is legal certainty. In other words, the only way there will be legal certainty is if this bill is passed. That is the responsible action of a responsible coalition government which will not put taxpayers' money unnecessarily at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our advice is that the bill is consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. As Senator Cooney said, the opposition says that it is not. If the proposed amendment is carried, then in terms of the opposition's view that the bill is discriminatory the bill will be ineffective. That is logical. The opposition would be more honest if it opposed the bill outright rather than moving an amendment which, according to its views, would make the bill ineffective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, this is an argument about means, not ends. It is really an attempt by Labor to govern from opposition. The bill will bring this affair to an end consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act in a non-retrospective manner. The opposition should give the bill its full support, and it should be obvious from my foregoing remarks that the government will be opposing the amendment because we do not believe it will allow legal finality in relation to the ability to construct the bridge.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot believe it either, Senator Collins. It is quite a bizarre turn of events that we have just had put to us. As I said in the second reading debate, there is a body of law, emanating from about 1982, which says that the exercise of that race power, particularly when it affects Aboriginals, has to be in their interest or to their benefit. You are saying that you have not sought advice from the Attorney&hyphen;General's  Department on whether this legislation is valid under that power. Have your officers, in formulating this legislation, considered the judgments of Justices Murphy, Wilson, Gaudron, Deane and Chief Justice Brennan?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is so, minister, but that previous legislation was to recognise and enshrine the heritage rights of Aboriginal Australians. This bill&mdash;which will become an act&mdash;undermines those rights. It acts contrary to the interests of Aboriginal Australians. It will be seen and assessed by any court as a bill which erodes those rights. You are saying that the government's position&mdash;or your

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Senator Bob Collins said just a little while ago, it is a bizarre turn of events that you have not taken advice. And then you come in and say that, because it erodes the benefits Aboriginals have in Australia through its amending a previous bill, that is sufficient. I find that a very tenuous legal argument. Maybe we should defer this legislation so that you can see if there is anything more your officers can add to this. This parliament has been asked to make a decision on this legislation and to pass it on the basis of: `Well we haven't asked for advice on whether it is constitutional; we think it is constitutional, even though it erodes the rights of Aboriginal Australians.' That is not good enough, is it?</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, Senator Bolkus is absolutely right. The reason I rise is that I do not think Senator Bolkus was in the chamber&mdash;he was busy elsewhere&mdash;when the minister, just a few minutes ago, made an absolutely pertinent statement in respect of the explanation he has just been given in regard to this bill. I am frankly astonished at this; it is getting curiouser and curiouser.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister has just said that no legal advice was sought by his officers or by him as to the constitutionality of this bill, because it was simply, to quote him, `an amendment to a previous bill.' The previous bill, of course, is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. I ask officers to carefully consider what I am saying in respect of the minister's response here: the heritage protection act has consistently been held by the government to be a special measure, and I do not think that is argued by anyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second part of this that is important is this: no one is arguing&mdash;not even the government&mdash;that the effect of this amendment removes the right of the Ngarrindjeri women to use the benefits of that act for their heritage. The bill, as Senator Cooney correctly said, specifically and explicitly removes that right. This is one of the things I find most objectionable about it. It was not a rhetorical 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="118"> flourish when I used the word `obnoxious', Minister, I assure you. I use that word advisedly. I do find this an obnoxious piece of legislation, because it is bringing to bear the entire weight, power and might of the federal parliament of Australia to crush the rights of a small group of Aboriginal women in South Australia. Whether you agree or disagree with them, that is what it does.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the minister said in respect of this amendment to the act&mdash;and I do not think Senator Bolkus was here to hear it&mdash;is that the act was a special measure. We agree. Let me quote what the minister said a few minutes ago&mdash;I wrote it down and it will be in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. He said that this bill rolls back the special measure, and it does.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="HERRON" NAMEID="VW4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister, it is no good saying no. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  will clearly indicate that you said those words.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add that the government has said that on previous occasions in other words. For at least the purpose of these Aboriginal people, for this piece of heritage, this bill explicitly removes the operation of the heritage protection act. Senator Bolkus, I think, referred to it earlier as `an effective repeal of the act in so far as this matter is concerned'. And it is. I do not think anyone seriously argues that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am saying with some astonishment that it is a fact that this bill actually negates the application of the act that it amends; it ne gates it in respect of this matter. It is all laid out in the bill. It even gives you a map, which of course has legal force, as to where this bill applies and where the heritage protection act can no longer operate. It says explicitly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Heritage Protection Act does not authorise the Minister to take any action after the commencement of this act in relation to an application&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And so on. This is of course the classic sledgehammer to crack an egg. This parliament is being used to bring down a specific law that crushes the rights of a small group of Aboriginal women in South Australia. For the purposes of the heritage protection act, it 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> negates its application; it is not simply an amendment to the act. Again, my opinions on this in legal terms, I am happy to say, are worth nothing&mdash;and I concede that again. I put to the officers, in terms of why they should have sought legal advice&mdash;and I am astonished that no legal advice was sought&mdash;that this is in fact a major amendment to the act in so far as the Ngarrindjeri women are concerned and that it effectively suspends the operation of the act in respect of this piece of property identified in the act and their aspirations to not have development on it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I dispute the minister's claim&mdash;and this was the most substantive argument he put and it is a nonsense&mdash;that the reason the government is introducing this bill is to `put an end to this for all time,' that `we want to bring this to a conclusion and to end it once and for all'. Minister, with the greatest respect, this bill is going to do nothing of the sort, and you know that. You cannot prevent people going into courts in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am absolutely confident that if this bill is passed unamended, there will be legal action taken against it in that it is without power and it is constitutionally invalid. I will tell you why&mdash;not that I think that I need to tell the officers why; I hope I would not have to. The people of Australia, in supporting that very rare amendment to an Australian constitution, did so unarguably for the benefit of Aborigines. No&hyphen;one with a straight face could seriously argue that that amendment&mdash;a rare event in Australian constitutional history&mdash;was also done for the purpose, if the federal government wanted to, of passing acts of parliament to the detriment of Aborigines. No&hyphen;one would seriously argue that with a straight face.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have no doubt, as a non&hyphen;lawyer, in saying this to you, Minister. If this bill rolls back the special measure, as you have said, if it in fact offends against the RDA, if legal action is taken against it&mdash;and you have just given us this&mdash;and if the constitutional power that the government is relying upon for this negation of the heritage protection act&mdash;not simply amending it; it negates it for the purpose of Hindmarsh Island Bridge and the rights of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="119"> those Aboriginal people&mdash;and if the government argues in court, as you now tell us that it will, that it is relying on the amendment to the constitution empowering the federal parliament to make laws for&mdash;I stress `for'&mdash;the Aboriginal people of Australia, and if it is demonstrated in that court, as it will be&mdash;and I have no doubt about this&mdash;that this bill is unarguably against the interests of these particular Aborigines in South Australia, and if the court then, in interpreting black&hyphen;letter law, as it may, determines that it is indeed lawful to do that, what we are then doing in the Senate&mdash;and it is an appalling prospect&mdash;is passing legislation which may give the court an opportunity to say, `Yes, the federal parliament can in fact lawfully enact laws under that amendment to the constitution that are actually to the detriment of Aboriginal people and not for their interests.' That is the argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If a court should find that&mdash;and in black&hyphen;letter law it may be the case&mdash;then I say this: the law is an ass. It is a fact of course that on many occasions courts have done that&mdash;this is not a criticism of the courts, and I know that no lawyer would accept it as a criticism of the courts&mdash;when, in properly construing black&hyphen;letter law, they have come to decisions like that. That is what has given rise to that famous statement that courts have on many occasions demonstrated that the law is an ass and that is why parliaments have often then reacted and responded by amending the anomalies that courts have found. Judges have often come to those conclusions, as Senator Cooney knows, very unhappily. But this is not a minor issue; this is a major issue. I am absolutely appalled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The responsibility for this failure rests with the minister, not with the department. I say without the slightest equivocation and without any doubt in my mind that as Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs&mdash;for a start, I would not have brought this in here&mdash;had this been proposed, I would not have moved one inch without advice from the Department of the Attorney&hyphen;General as to the constitutional validity of this proposal. It is not simply an amendment to the heritage protection act.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No&hyphen;one here doubts, Minister, that the heritage protection act was for the benefit of Aborigines. Of course there is an unargued power in the Australian constitution to do things for the benefit of Aborigines&mdash;although, being a belt and braces man myself, which is obvious just looking at me, I probably would have sought the advice anyway. But this is unarguably a measure that is to the detriment of those Aboriginal people in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is no good you standing up here and saying, `Oh, it is obvious,' which is what you said. Things are not always obvious to a court. In the same way, Senator Herron, I am astonished at this revelation in here. It is a very serious matter because if you are now saying, as you did, that the bill rolls back this special measure, and if you are saying that no advice at all was sought as to the constitutional validity of this, you would be no doubt aware that it has already been publicly mooted that this is without power. There are already lawyers looking very carefully at the prospects of a legal challenge to this bill, should it pass in this form, on the basis that there is no power for this bill. That is not something that I am talking about in an abstract sense. It is being done now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, if you go to court relying on the Aboriginal power conferred on this federal parliament unarguably in real life terms for the benefit of Aborigines, that amendment was brought about to end an international scandal that existed in respect of Australia at that time. It was brought about to put an end to a situation where Australia's indigenous people&mdash;the original inhabitants of this country&mdash;were not counted in a census, were not obliged to be part of the Australian political system and were not for most of this century even citizens in their own country. It was brought about to put an end to all of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not exactly Methuselah; all that has happened in my lifetime. That is how short is the time that Aborigines have actually enjoyed being citizens in their own country. It is a very short time indeed. If you seriously are telling me that the government is going to go into court&mdash;morally, I might add; forget the law for a minute&mdash;and argue that you 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="120"> could use that power to deprive particular small groups of Aboriginal people of rights that they formerly had and that you are going to rely on that amendment to the Australian constitution to do so, it is a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say, as a non&hyphen;lawyer, I would not mind putting another bet on that proposition. I put one on this morning that I would be happy to collect on. I am prepared to take a punt that, if legal action were taken that there is no power to effectively negate the application of the heritage protection act in respect of the rights of these people, that it is without power and that it is to the detriment of these Aborigines and not to their benefit, I would not be in the least bit surprised if the High Court upheld that appeal.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are hypothecating what will occur in the future. Our advice is that if there is any legal action taken as a result of the passage of the bill then that will be struck out at an early stage. So there is finality, Senator Kernot. The question was raised: does the bill discriminate against the Ngarrindjeri people by denying them rights under the heritage legislation? I think Senator Collins brought that up. The answer is no, it does not. The impact of the bill is to take away anyone's rights to make an application 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="122"> in relation to the Hindmarsh Island bridge area. It does not single out any particular racial group. In a 1985 decision the High Court recognised that the need for and extent of a special measure was a matter for political and not legal judgment. Parliament may therefore conclude whether there is no longer a need for special legislation to apply to a particular community or a particular area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the bill, when enacted, will remove the rights of those Aboriginal people with links to the bridge area to obtain protection&mdash;and this is the important point&mdash;it does not discriminate in favour of other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people whose rights are similarly affected by the provisions of the bill. If you follow that argument then it should be fairly obvious that the differential operation of the bill in this way is not contrary to the Racial Discrimination Act. That is the advice we have received and I follow it. I accept it, Senator Collins. It seems perfectly logical to me and I cannot understand why you do not follow it, because that is a valid statement and there should be no argument about it.

Are you saying that if this were challenged, no court, including the High Court, would look at the facts that surround the act to see whether in fact there was a discrimination or not? If you say that the only thing to look at is not the reality or the facts but just the act, is not clause 4(2) of the bill, in its terms, retrospective? I say that for the following reason.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of issues in relation to the amendment proposed by the ALP. The principle of the Racial Discrimination Act is that rights are not being infringed. But it is quite clear from the debate we have had that rights will be. This amendment does not fix the bill. This amendment in effect continues blaming the Ngarrindjeri people for the problem. Labor, in my opinion, is looking at the wrong issue. The Aboriginal people have still not been heard, and this is not the way to do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Basically, the minister has talked about a problem. What we have not dealt with today in any real sense is why what we are dealing with today is not a fairly straightforward amendment to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, which deals with that problem. Instead of trying to either go around the problem, stomp on the problem or put it to a court challenge some time in the future, which I do not really think will advance anybody's cause&mdash;I do not think it is going to advance the Wik cause or the cause to further the application of the Racial Discrimination Act in Australia&mdash;it is somehow trying to make it okay. I do not think I can support an amendment which somehow pretends that everything is okay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that there is no real belief from the ALP that this amendment will make it okay. It may well mean that it goes to the courts. Basically, the real issue here is why there have been these technical problems and delays in people being able to maintain their rights. If there are cultural reasons for people having to give evidence in a certain way, surely under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act we can, as adults who have responsibility in this parlia 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="124"> ment, work out ways of making sure that that is properly done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Unless and until we do that we will not solve or fix the problem. I have spoken to representatives of the Kumarangk Coalition who say the same thing. I have indicated where the involvement has been with the ALP along the way. The ALP has said that they would support amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. That is the way to go. This, I believe, is a retrograde step. I do not believe it will help in the maintenance of the Racial Discrimination Act. It may well be that by sticking this with cellotape into this appalling bill that all you do is create further arguments in the future for people who say the Racial Discrimination Act is unworkable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not going to be party to that. I am not going to be party to this farce and I will not be supporting this amendment which might also give some people a moral approval to support this appalling bill. That is not the major reason.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will not oppose this amendment. In doing so, however, I want to note very particularly the government does not consider that the amending act was, or is, in conflict with the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In the House of Representatives, Mr Ruddock said exactly the same thing in respect of this amendment. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendment 5 concerns the effect of the Racial Discrimination Act and proposes to insert a clause into the bill to indicate that the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act are to prevail over the amending act. The government does not oppose this amendment.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Somewhat to my bemusement, in real terms, the minister has indicated, in the face of all of this, that the government will not accept exactly the same amendment in respect of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill. In other words, an amendment which the government was happy to see beneficiaries of social security payments get the benefit of is not going to apply to Aborigines. I think that is appalling and I have no hesitation in saying so. I know why they will not do it. I have been party to many of these discussions, with all the experts. The reason they will not do it is that, behind closed doors, people in the government concede that there is an even&hyphen;money chance&mdash;although it might not be as high as that&mdash;that this does offend the Racial Discrimination Act and that, because it is at least respectably arguable, the government has taken the decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why we will not have this amendment accepted in respect of Aborigines&mdash;an amendment that was quite happily accepted in the case of social security benefits. In the event that such an argument could be mounted, they do not want the Racial Discrimination Act to interfere with the application of this act. Because it is a later act, technically in terms of black&hyphen;letter law, that will be the case. I find that offensive and obnoxious and, I think and hope, so does the majority of the Senate.

Every time you have attempted to answer a question you have, in fact, dug the government much more deeply into the hole into which they have put themselves.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator BOB COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Precisely. What they said was, in effect, that technically, under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, Aborigines at large around the whole of Australia can utilise this act to make applications for heritage protection anywhere in Australia. Therefore, this act does not discriminate between those groups because it only says that this little bit of Australia will not be available for an application for a heritage protection act, and that applies to all Aborigines. That, essentially, is the argument. That may be true in terms of black&hyphen;letter law but, in the real world, it is an utter nonsense. If a court ever upheld it, the law would be an ass in that case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My punt is this. The High Court, particularly in respect of recent judgments&mdash;and we  live in enlightened times&mdash;is not an ass in that sense. Despite the fact that they may make judgments which, from time to time, I disagree with, I actually think the collective wisdom of the High Court is a lot smarter than that and a lot smarter than this particular government. I have no difficulty at all in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> constantly distinguishing at a glance&mdash;I do it almost unconsciously&mdash;when I walk around the Northern Territory and see an Aboriginal person, whether that person comes from Groote Eylandt, the Tiwi Islands, Milingimbi, Ramingining or Amoonguna. I can do it at a glance with people I have never seen before in my life. I say, `I know that person comes from Milingimbi,' just by looking at them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know what a Tiwi Islander looks like. It is a nonsense in real world terms to say that the Tiwi Islanders could successfully apply for heritage protection on Hindmarsh Island. It would be a frivolous and vexatious act on their part and it would be kicked out. Although it may be technically correct, it is a real world nonsense. It is also a real world nonsense to say that there is an amorphous black blob of Aborigines in Australia and they are all lumped in together in one group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Ngarrindjeri people are, in real terms, as different from the Tiwi Islanders as Greeks are from the Tiwi Islanders. I think a real world High Court would find that. I think a real world High Court would strike down this carefully constructed&mdash;and they are just doing their job&mdash;legal argument that all Aborigines are prevented from making these applications. I think, as Senator Cooney suggested, the High Court would actually look at the facts of the case. I think the High Court would find that yes, this particular and identifiable group of Aboriginal people have had their rights impugned by this legislation and that it would offend the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public interest which I wish to raise this afternoon is that raised on the front page of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>  dealing with Labor attempts to rig last year's ballot for the Students Association of the Australian National University.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators may recall that I raised this issue late last year. There has been some inquiry into those allegations and the Students 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="126"> Association initiated such an inquiry. At the time I questioned the wisdom and appropriateness of the Students Association investigating the matter inasmuch as the person who was investigating the matter was the incumbent president of the Students Association who had won that position by virtue of being a member of the Labor Students Club. So it was, in effect, a situation of Labor investigating Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just briefly detail what occurred in about September last year. The Students Association president at the time, William Mackerras, who was a member of the Labor Club, was running the show. His treasurer, Daniel Jenkins, who was also a member of the Labor Club, was the presidential candidate for the Labor ticket. Due to the Students Association electoral regulations, it was up to the current executive to appoint the returning officers. Mr Mackerras delegated this job to Daniel, despite the fact that he was the presidential candidate and therefore, one might assume, had some interest in the outcome. Undoubtedly that escaped the attention of the Labor Student Club at the time they made that arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Polling took place and that was relatively uneventful until a political student observed one of the Labor candidates&mdash;a Labor Students Club member&mdash;attempting to stuff a wad of ballot papers into the presidential box. After the election the ballot boxes were opened and discrete wads of ballot papers were found in the ballot box. Surprisingly, they all had Daniel Jenkins, the Labor candidate, as number one preference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So we have a situation where these wads of ballot papers had been introduced into the system to undoubtedly come up with a fraudulent result. Despite the introduction of those 146 extra ballot papers, the Labor Club was unable to win the election. So, at the end of the day, it had no impact on the result. Nevertheless, I think we would all agree that  that sort of behaviour ought to be stamped out. It ought to be dealt with in a way that ensures an appropriate penalty is applied to the perpetrators of this, and also imposes an appropriate penalty to try to encourage others 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> not to engage in the same activity; in other words, a deterrent penalty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Mackerras, who had appointed Daniel Jenkins to appoint the returning officers, was then appointed to have a look at the behaviour of Mr Jenkins and the other Labor people at ANU to ascertain what had occurred. It is quite instructive to look at the report that Mr Mackerras came down with, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on irregularities in the 1996 annual elections of the ANU Students' Association</EMPHASIS>. I give him credit: it was a detailed report and it dealt with matters quite extensively. But, on the face of it, it really is a question of whether you can truly expect a Labor person who was so heavily involved in the partisan politics of his campus, trying to assist his group to win the election, discovering a fraud and then being required to inquire into that fraud, to be able to ascertain who was responsible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He did find one person responsible, and that was Mr Daniel Jenkins. I have to say that no matter how biased you were, given all the evidence I would have thought that conclusion was inescapable. But what concerns me is that other people who it would appear were actively involved in this scam have escaped.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The purpose today is to call on the university administration to take this matter further. There has been correspondence by the registrar of the university with Mr William Mackerras. It concerned me that, in that correspondence of 11 November 1996, the registrar wrote to Mr Mackerras confirming a conversation. The letter reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time, I had a preference for the course of action upon which you and the Deputy Registrar had agreed, that is, that the matter should properly be pursued in terms of the provisions of the Constitution of the Association and the Electoral Regulations made under that Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and further on&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Association wishes to pursue the matter after its due processes have been completed, it is welcome to do so.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">At the end of the day, the university, the registrar and the vice&hyphen;chancellor are responsible for behaviour at the university and the way students conduct themselves. To simply 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="127"> allow students who have engaged in such a fraud to escape by simple monetary penalty under the Students Association constitution without any academic or other penalty being imposed is a matter of concern. I would invite the Australian National University and its administration to investigate this matter&mdash;and investigate it thoroughly&mdash;to determine whether any of the other people who have been named are worthy of a penalty being imposed upon them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Out of the 146 ballots, there were the initials of two returning officers on those ballot papers. Mr Mackerras's report, whilst I commend it for its length, does seem to have dismissed the possibility of further investigation because there were two returning officers, one of whom, I am reliably informed at least, was a member of the Labor club. In his report, Mr Mackerras says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both Mr Ahmad and Mr Harrington have asserted that these signatures must have been forgeries.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These signatures being their initials on the ballot papers. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a plausible explanation, as both signatures are not so distinctive as to avoid replication. It is possible that the polling officer involved deliberately forged the signatures of another two innocent polling officers, in order to avoid detection.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">But the names were actually crossed off the list of ballots as well, undoubtedly from students who had not voted. I would have thought that it would not be beyond the wit of the university to examine those initials and get some handwriting expert to determine whether or not they were in fact forgeries. I would have thought it was quite simple.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you are dealing with the rigging of a ballot for a position that, as I understand it, provides some remuneration to the successful candidate and where there is a degree of power and influence to be exercised by the holding of that office, anybody who is involved in such a scam ought be investigated in some detail. I would invite the university, if those ballot papers are still in existence, and I trust they are, to avail itself of the  opportunity of hearing from a handwriting expert to ascertain whether or not those initials were forged or whether Mr Ahmad 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> and Mr Harrington simply misled Mr Mackerras, who did the report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is very easy for Mr Mackerras to dismiss the allegations against those two returning officers on the basis that he mentions without going into any further investigation, but the average punter on the ANU campus, I would have thought, would be concerned by the fact that Mr Mackerras was a member of the Labor club investigating this scam perpetrated, if not officially by the Labor club, by elements within the Labor club. I would simply invite the university to take some further action in relation to that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One statutory declaration has been provided to me along with another one which had been prepared, but the person concerned was no longer prepared to actually swear it so simply signed it as a statement. The involvement of the people is shown in a statutory declaration dated 1 November 1996 sworn in Canberra by a Mr Mohammad Qasim Syed&hyphen;Zaidi. He deposes as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the afternoon of September 19, 1996 after the SA Election Polling had finished I was helping the Deputy Registrar Mr Graham Hutchens along with another candidate Mr Kelvin Watt&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">who was from the Labor club&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and Mr Fuad Ahmad, a student who was employed to assist in the polling. I overheard a conversation to which I cannot remember the details between Kelvin and Fuad when Mr Hutchens was not there which made me suspicious that there was something that was going on and was not right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Immediately afterwards, I approached Mr Daniel Jenkins asked him.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Daniel, are we rigging the elections?"</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">So Qasim, who deposed this, was a member of the Labor club. He asked Daniel Jenkins:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He was astonished and said "Who told you?"</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the afternoon of Friday 20th September.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Jenkins said to me "Qasim, I need to talk to you."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Outside the Union Building, on the stairs above the bar,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said "Sean&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is, Sean Melbourne, who is the person who was identified as putting some of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="128"> ballot papers at least into the ballot box, something which I hasten to add Mr Melbourne denies&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">wasn't able to put his in. I need you to put some in for me."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was referring to ballot papers that had been rorted. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To which I replied "No way, Daniel. Its bad enough that I'm staying quiet, but not this."</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a later occasion, after the wads had been discovered by the Returning Officer during the count, I spoke to Mr Fuad Ahmad. I said "Fuad, William's going to nail you down. He's working on some theory about the votes."</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He replied "He won't be able to prove it."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Thursday 31st October, I rang Mr Jenkins at home, and said</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Daniel, you know what Heidi did in the Senate".</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He replied "Yes Yes Yes. I need to talk to you about that. Absolutely don't tell anyone about it. I'll ring you back. Are you going to be home?"</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I said "Yes, if not you can ring me on my mobile . . . Yes, but what about William. He doesn't know anything about it."</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to express my concern and that of my Democrat colleagues about the issue of unemployment in this country&mdash;specifically, the fact that this government has not set about addressing the issue of unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. The Bureau of Statistics figures that came out on 16 January this year show that a staggering number of Australians&mdash;794,500, in fact&mdash;are looking for full-time employment. That is an unemployment rate of 8.6 per cent seasonally adjusted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As many of us would be aware, in this group there is a disproportionate representation of young Australians. In fact, 99,900 15&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds in this country are looking for work. Nearly 100,000 young people are looking for full-time work in this nation and cannot find it. That is a 30.4 per cent unemployment rate seasonally adjusted. I believe that is the highest figure for youth unemployment in this country during the last 2&half; years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet with these staggering statistics before them, we have yet to see concrete policies being put forward by this government to address the unemployment level. This is a massive social problem in this country. I am sick and tired of the way that unemployed people are treated as economic blips or statistics on the landscape, without taking into account the massive economic, social, personal and emotional ramifications of unemployment in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a problem that should be the No. 1 priority for the coalition. But, to date, the coalition have declined to give any real assurances to the people of Australia that they are doing anything more than waiting for the grail of low inflation, business confidence and a budget in the black to restore substantial jobs growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This unfortunately is not enough. People in this country want solutions. They want more than a government simply pulling the levers, more than economic rhetoric from the treasurers. They need some assurances now that they are going to have a shot in the future, that there are going to be employment, education and training opportunities for their friends, their families, their peers and their sons and daughters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think there are many people in this place who would like to know exactly what plans the coalition has to address the issue of rising unemployment in this nation. We want to know what they are going to do specifically to successfully address the issue of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The August budget statement announced a number of reforms which were intended to have a direct impact on unemployment in this nation. We were looking forward to faster economic growth, which was going to reduce 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="129"> unemployment levels in Australia. But we now know that the budget forecast of 8.25 per cent unemployment by June this year was way off the mark and the foundations of that government employment strategy have crumbled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note the assessments of a number of private sector forecasters, such as Access Economics, Westpac and Dun and Bradsheet. They have suggested that unemployment could rise to nine per cent by mid&hyphen;year unless something is done quickly to address this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is perhaps ironic that the overshooting of the government's budget forecast of 8.25 per cent unemployment by June is likely to mean another 90,000 people jobless, and an additional $1.5 billion deficit will be created as a consequence of the continued unemployment levels in this country. We could actually start to address the budget deficit by increasing employment in this country. I believe that, even if we increased employment opportunities by one per cent in Australia, we could decrease our budget deficit by around $1.5 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The private sector forecasts that we have had from those organisations I mentioned&mdash;Westpac and Access Economics&mdash;are all based on the existing laws, practices and regulations of this government. What this means is that low inflation, business confidence, a budget in the black and labour market reforms will simply not be sufficient to restore substantial jobs growth. What the Treasury and private sector forecasting shows is that the rate of unemployment in this nation is not going to fall dramatically on the basis of the coalition's current regime of laws and policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the inevitable conclusion from these forecasts is that the coalition needs to do more to actually address this issue of unemployment. What we need to see from this government is a positive plan to increase jobs. We need them to stop relying on pulling levers. By that, I do not mean increasing jobs for young Australians with just a token green corps, although that is a principle that the Australian Democrats support strongly&mdash;that is, young people being given training and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> education opportunities in environmental areas and industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We held great hopes for the green corps. The Democrats were under the impression that at least $68 million would be put towards the green corps over the next three years. We thought at least 3,500 jobs would be created over the next three years. We would prefer 25,000 jobs over three years to replace the environmental action programs such as LEAP and REEP. My understanding, and I look forward to the minister responding to this at some stage, is that only 240, 340 or 440 jobs&mdash;we are still clarifying the figure&mdash;will be created in the first year of this token green corps.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="EVANS" NAMEID="AX5">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not for the unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3I6">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not for the unemployed, and that is a very good point that Senator Evans raises; 17&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds are the only ones eligible to apply for this scheme, unlike the coalition's original promise of 17&hyphen; to 25&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds. Even then, the applicants must show some kind of demonstrable commitment to the environment. So we are not talking about unskilled, low skilled or long-term unemployed people in this country. We are talking about a very select group who are to be targeted on merit. That is only one very token solution that we have seen put forward by this government when it comes to addressing the wider issue of unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The kind of plan we should be looking for, and we should see hopefully as the centrepiece of the next budget brought down by this government, could include the consideration of export assistance programs, small business incentives, regional development initiatives, tax reform to make employing more workers attractive, infrastructure programs, environmental repair programs and increased funding for education and training&mdash;again, another area that we seem to be cutting back dramatically&mdash;so that we have the opportunity for people in this nation, be they unemployed or be they young, to improve their skills and the opportunity to improve the creativity of this work force and to encourage research and development in this nation.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="130">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to think that this coalition government will consider initiating a discussion about what work is, about the nature of work in our society, and look at the structural and technological changes that have been taking place in the labour market. This must include a discussion of job sharing, working hours, the contribution of those who work but who are not presently paid, the value of leisure and a wide range of other issues. Yes, that might even involve the setting of targets, something that I notice the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, was somewhat reluctant to do on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> program on Sunday. Maybe that is something this government should commit itself to&mdash;really addressing the issue of unemployment and setting targets that are achievable and realistic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally I would like to focus on the matter of young Australians, the 30.4 per cent of 15&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who are looking for full&hyphen;time work in this nation but are unable to get it. The social and personal consequences of these figures on the lives of young Australians is unimaginable. This group in particular has been targeted by this coalition government with its economic, rationalist and mean&hyphen;spirited objectives. In any part of the budget I can see where young people have been targeted&mdash;whether it is Triple J cuts, whether it is token green corps, whether it is labour market cuts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Even yesterday there was the announcement of a people's convention with the notion that some young people, some 18&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, will be appointed delegates to the people's convention. Again that is not a proportional representation of young people. Eighteen to 30&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds in this country make up 33 per cent of our population, but we will not see that proportional representation at a people's convention or in any other decision&hyphen;making parliaments for that matter. The dob&hyphen;in&hyphen;a&hyphen;dole&hyphen;bludger scheme, the employer contact unit&mdash;all of these measures have hit hardest at young Australians who are suffering incredibly, especially when it comes to a lack of employment, education and training opportunities in this country.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might add that in my home state of South Australia&mdash;which is also the state the minister represents&mdash;young people's unemployment levels are up to 39.6 per cent. The state will suffer even more if recommendations such as those in regard to tariffs contained in the Productivity Commission's report are implemented. I would like to quote from Senator Vanstone's response to a question without notice on 10 September last year when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As minister for youth affairs, I want to assure the Senate that this government is deeply committed to ensuring that the future for Australians is one where they face a world of optimism and of hope.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should be able to say to young Australians that into their hands we have put a land of opportunity, a land where they can get appropriate training, a land where they can expect to get a job&mdash;not any job, but a good job; a real job&mdash;and a land where they can make a career choice on what they want to be, not simply on the basis of where they think they can get a job.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I ask the minister: what has happened to this optimistic future that she had seen for our young Australians? I ask the minister: what choices and what opportunities, in the time that she and her government have been in office, have they given to young people to gain access to education, to training and to skill development to obtain the job of their choice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is fitting to end with a quote from the Governor&hyphen;General, Sir William Deane, when he spoke at the opening of the Courthouse Project in Geelong on 23 November last year. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is essential that our failure as a nation to provide adequate employment opportunities for our young is not seen as merely an economic problem to be elevated as a factor in some economic hypothesis and addressed only within the limits allowed by preconceptions of business efficiency. Youth unemployment must be addressed as an overwhelming social problem which is already having permanent destructive consequences. Youth unemployment is not a failure on the part of those who are unemployed, but a failure by our society to provide them with the basic entitlement to work.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Crane for his question. It is a very important question. My attention has been drawn to remarks made by Mr Beazley on Howard Sattler's program on 6PR on 29 January. In that interview Mr Beazley said that unemployed were gainfully employed while they were on Working Nation programs and, as Senator Crane rightly said, `they weren't around the streets bothering everybody else'. Let me make something perfectly clear: this government does not regard the unemployed of Australia as a bother to the government in a way that Mr Beazley apparently does.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Beazley's remarks only serve yet again to build on the very unfortunate stereotype of the unemployed as petty thieves and muggers. It was a disgraceful remark for a leader of the opposition to be making in any event. But when you consider that after 13 years of Labor&mdash;the party that created the mess&mdash;the Leader of the Opposition is in that circumstance so keen to stereotype young Australians in that way, it is political opportunism at its worst. You have to seriously question Mr Beazley's attitudes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It should not be forgotten that Labor created the highest level of unemployment since the Great Depression. I noticed in previous questions Senator Crowley smiling away saying, `Tell us about unemployment.' And with a smile on her face she says, `Eight 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> point five and going up.' That is another bit of political opportunism at its best. The facts are that Labor created the highest level of unemployment since the Great Depression. Then they go on to say that the unemployed were on the streets bothering the rest of the community. It was a disgraceful remark.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The facts speak for themselves. Trend unemployment was at or above 10 per cent for 33 consecutive months between September 1991 and May 1994. For 32 consecutive months under Hawke and Keating, when you people were in charge, unemployment was at its highest since World War II. Jobs growth between 1993 and 1996 only just replaced the 420,700 jobs that Labor destroyed during the recession we allegedly had to have. In Labor's last five years, youth unemployment never got below 27 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Beazley's comments crystallise the vast gulf between them and us. This government believes that the hard yards in making inroads into unemployment will be found, firstly, in targeting labour market assistance to those most in need and by tailoring individual assistance to the job seeker rather than trying to put a square job seeker into some triangular program designed in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Secondly, and from the broader perspective, job growth will flow if we get the budget back into the black and create an environment where inflation and interest rates are at levels that will encourage investment and wealth creating activities&mdash;we all know that we have had three interest rate drops since the election of this government. We will also make inroads by delivering efficient and flexible workplace relations, reducing red tape for small business, giving school students the basic skills that employers want and expanding apprenticeship and traineeship opportunities&mdash;that is, entry level training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There should be no doubt about the gravity of this problem. Unemployment has been so high for so long under Labor that it has become pretty well ingrained. It went up and down when Labor was in office, but they never had any real success. A lot of work needs to be done to fix this problem. It will not be solved overnight. We are making the proper moves.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I will not, and it is not for me to do that. The fact is that the Mansfield report has spelt out the implications of maintaining the current service on Radio Australia. Mansfield suggests that the audience has declined by some 80 per cent over the last 15 years, that even Radio Australia itself is not clear about its objectives or effectiveness, that DFAT has significant reservations and that its principal source of transmission is short wave which is very much a declining technology.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some in China. It might be 0.8 million, I think. But, as I recall it, Mr Mansfield told me that nearly all of the submissions he got expressed concerns from places like Europe and that, overwhelmingly, they were from expatriates.

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> last in its `one ABC' policy&mdash;it has to find a balance. What Mansfield said was that Radio Australia currently cost $13.5 million for services and another $7 million for transmission. There has to be at the very least, I think he would say, a very big question mark over whether it ought to be a priority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC board is meeting today and it will consider the implications of the Mansfield report. It is  clearly a matter of concern that we do not unnecessarily dispense with services and that other options are explored. I have no doubt that the ABC will be having a close look at the effectiveness of this particular service but, at the end of the day, the ABC knows that it has to find $55 million. We have made that plain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mansfield is suggesting that this is one of the ways in which the ABC could meet a revised charter which gives it a much clearer focus; in other words, to concentrate on being a domestic broadcaster. If it then has reserves or resources which enable it to maintain some level of international service, it ought to be free do that. He is not saying that Radio Australia ought to be closed down; he is simply saying that one ought to look at the cost implications and the effectiveness of a system which has changed dramatically since 1939.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mansfield also makes the point that the BBC runs a similar service but it is maintained by the foreign office, and if the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in this country took the view that Radio Australia was particularly significant, then that department should consider whether they ought to fund it.</PARA>

I draw the attention of Senator Vanstone to the mounting public criticism and concern over the deemed means test for Austudy&mdash;which is perhaps misleadingly described as the actual means test. I point out to the minister that as far back as 27 September 1995 and 19 October 1995 I pointed out the anomalies and inequities in the deemed means test. I ask the minister directly: how many applicants have been denied Austudy on the basis of the deemed means test who would otherwise have satisfied the income and assets tests? How many rejected applicants have sought review of the adverse decisions under the deemed means test? How many primary producer families qualifying for the business assets discount in the assets test have been excluded under the deemed means test?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Harradine, for that question. Senator Harradine, you rightly refer to significant concern in the community over the refinements made to Labor's actual means test. As you well understand, the actual means test was introduced by Labor in 1996, I believe, to try to ensure that those people who have 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the capacity to rearrange their assets and income so as to bypass an ordinary asset or income test would not be able to nonetheless get Austudy. That was introduced by Labor and supported by us as it was perceived to be an effective means of getting at people who could so rearrange their incomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The stories are legion in universities around Australia of the sons of surgeons, for example, who might have incomes that you and I and others would regard as quite substantial, nonetheless being able to get Austudy. I would not imagine that there was a person in this place who has not heard of one Austudy rort or another. Nonetheless, having agreed, Senator Harradine, that the actual means test was a sensible thing to introduce and having decided to refine it to make it easier for applicants to fill in the form, there are still some difficulties&mdash;I acknowledge that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been significant concern raised on the actual means test hotline and, as a consequence of that concern and the inability of some people to get through on that hotline, some time ago&mdash;I cannot give you the exact date&mdash;I asked for more people to be put on. There were originally 15. A further 14 had to be trained but they started today. I am advised through the process of the day that the hotline people can already say that those extra 14 are making a difference. I was nonetheless not satisfied last week that that would be enough and instructed that a further 10 people should be put on. They are being trained this week. So that should very substantially improve, if not get up to tiptop 100 per cent condition, access to the hotline.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is true that the anti&hyphen;siphoning provisions were put in place by the previous administration after there had already been some controversy surrounding the original provisions. It was thought at the time, despite some concerns that we had expressed, that the previous government had got it right. As it transpires, they had not. Although the rules currently require that a pay television licensee cannot acquire broadcast rights to a licensed event unless broadcast rights have already been acquired by a commercial television broadcaster, the rules do not distinguish between delayed and live rights. As a result, News acquired all the rights. They sold the delayed rights only to Channel 7, the live rights to Foxtel and the one&hyphen;day rights to Fox Sports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been a matter of very significant controversy over the last week or so. During the course of last week there were a number of newspaper headlines that made it clear that the public had very significant concerns about the matter. In fact, you can go back to 16 January when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> had a headline saying, `Television Test Blackout: no free coverage of South African tour.' On 29 January the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> said, `Howzat? Live cricket will be on pay TV only.' The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> said, `S Africa tour only on pay TV,' and on 30 January it said, `Pressure mounts on Seven over cricket.' The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> editorial of 1 December says, `It's not cricket'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a result of all that public outpouring, I made sure that a couple of newspapers, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, reported that the government had serious concerns about the turn of events, that we were taking advice and that, if necessary, we would change the rules. Not only did those reports appear I think on the Friday but I subsequently did radio interviews on 3AW and 2BL, and the 2BL interview was rebroadcast on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Grandstand</EMPHASIS> on the Saturday morning.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Against that background it is absolutely extraordinary&mdash;those people who were watching the coverage of the test on Saturday would have been amazed&mdash;that when Ian Chappell asked Mr Beazley about it saying, `What are you going to do about it?' Mr 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Beazley said, `I know nothing about it.' Personally, I nearly fell off my beach chair because I could not believe that this bloke could be so ignorant. Where was he? Asleep at the wheel. He got a slow ball on the middle stump and he shouldered arms&mdash;the most ignominious political dismissal that anyone could ever imagine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here he was, your leader&mdash;all his own work&mdash;in front of hundreds of thousands of television viewers, the very sort of people that you are relying on to win at the next election, telling Ian Chappell that he had had a great January. He had been lying around on the beach for a month or so and he had been taking it easy. But to effectively tell Ian Chappell that he had not read one newspaper, he had not listened to any radio interviews and he had not received any briefings from his staff is just appalling.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sure he is interested in cricket, but he is really interested only in getting his mug on television, so it seems. If he had any interest in cricket he would have known what was happening in South Africa. He would have known the problem that existed. He probably thought there was no point getting on to Senator Schacht about it&mdash;I can understand that&mdash;but at least you would have thought he would have been up with the game. But, no, there he was with the ball in line with middle stump.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you reckon Shane Warne made Mike Gatting look a mug, I  have to tell you that this was the most appalling performance. If you seriously expect that the Australian public are going to think that you are plugged into their concerns when your leader can go on national television and admit that he had not the faintest idea about a problem that had been raging in the media for days on end and of which he had been given a couple of weeks notice, you have a long way to go&mdash;back to the seconds.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will just make a minor correction to your question. You may not have meant to make this inference. I think you said that that was the percentage of people who could not get a full-time job. You of course meant to say that that was of those looking for full-time work. As you are probably aware, the total unemployment rate for 15- to 19-year&hyphen;olds is much closer to 20 per cent. I am not referring to a different unemployment rate that members of the now opposition used to use frequently, which is the percentage of all 15- to 19-year&hyphen;olds, including those in school. I am simply pointing out to you that, when the figures are released for some considerable time, we have focused on the total unemployment rate for all Australians.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is another mistake you have made. If you want to equate the former government's LEAP program, a most unsuccessful labour market program, with the green corps, you are making a very big mistake. The green corps is not a labour market program. It is a program designed to combine two things: young Australians' natural desire to improve, restore and enhance the environment with an opportunity for accredited training in that area. We all know&mdash;I suspect that you know it as well; the Labor Party did not recognise this&mdash;that the surest way to get someone a job is to get some accredited training.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), to questions without notice asked today relating to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">We have seen an extraordinary performance here today, with this minister trying to explain away his own cabinet submission regarding his plans for the ABC. His defence is that the front page of the cabinet submission was not written by him but somebody else. He said that the front page of the cabinet submission is not contrary to the Liberal Party's policy at the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 24 January, Senator Alston is quoted. I presume that if the quote were not correct, he would have taken legal action or issued a writ. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Alston said he did not write a part of the submission that says: "Options examined in the submission are inconsistent with Government election commitments to maintain ABC funding levels but will assist achievement of the Government's fiscal strategy."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He said, `That was the cover sheet. I don't know who drafts the cover sheet. It's someone's shorthand on what they think the situation is.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister says that he does not know who drafts his cabinet submissions. Even if he claims that it is an options paper, he still does not know who has drafted it. This is typical of this minister. He now has a track record. Whenever he is caught out being deceptive or misleading over his policy towards the ABC, what does he do? He blames somebody else, usually either the staff in his office, by implication, or the department. I want to know, Minister, whether the person who drafted the cover sheet is a senior member of your staff and who it is. Have you attempted to find out? Is it Mr Neville Stevens, the head of the Department of Communications and the Arts? 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Is it Mr Tony Shaw? These are the people you have not named but are blaming for putting in a cabinet submission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been the consistent track record of the minister. I remember in estimates committee last year, when an answer signed by him about numbers of employment in Telstra came forward, he actually said that that was something he had not seen, that it must have come from his office and he would chase it up. This is a minister who put back a formal answer to a question on notice and said he had not seen it. He is now using the same defence for his own cabinet submission. This is really an astonishing performance. It means that this minister is not on top of even the material that goes to cabinet. This is a minister, clearly, who does not draft his cabinet submissions and he does not read them. Then he attempts to blame the people who cannot defend themselves, namely, either his staff or the department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This leads one to the conclusion that, at the next estimates committee, this minister should sit at the table surrounded by his senior staff so that they can answer the questions which he is incapable of answering. This cabinet submission has now been on the Internet. What does it mean when something on the front page of a cabinet submission talking about cutting up to $130 million a year from the ABC is a curb&hyphen;side quote? That is ridiculous, but that is the level to which his credibility has sunk. He has to rely on disparaging his own cabinet submission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Then, as he said in the answers, he started to pick parts of the cabinet submission which he agreed with. He used the phrase, `That's a core part of the submission.' Other parts of it, by implication, are not core. Again it gets back to him blaming somebody else for writing his own submission. I believe we have a minister here who is just incompetent in handling his own submissions to cabinet, handling the material and the promises he made as a shadow minister. This minister's time has run out and, particularly regarding the ABC, he cannot be believed on anything he says because what he may say publicly has subsequently proved to be absolutely wrong by documents which have come to light like 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="146"> this cabinet submission. This minister has been exposed today absolutely.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with great interest to what Senator Schacht said. When he started, he indicated that he was raising matters relating to a number of questions asked of Senator Alston. So he is broadly canvassing recent changes to the ABC, including recommendations from the Mansfield report, which has been mentioned several times this afternoon. The truth of the matter is that, after 13 years of Labor government, the ABC was left in a terrible mess. It did not really understand the directions it was following. It had a top heavy management structure and something very drastic had to be done. Given that the board is full of appointees under the last Labor government, this certainly was not done. The whole show was left to go on without very much direction at all as to the way in which the ABC should operate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this minister did was create the Mansfield inquiry to look into matters relating to the activities of the ABC, the way in which programs are produced and the way in which management practices are carried out in the ABC. The series of submissions that went to the Mansfield inquiry were incredibly comprehensive in the range of matters which they covered. They were considered very carefully by Mr Mansfield. He has come up with a number of very sensible recommendations that actually follow on from what the minister has already done in relation to changes in the last budget. Basically what the Mansfield report is saying is that the minister should continue in those directions and consolidate the focus of the ABC, improve the management structure of the ABC and improve the production process of what is shown on the ABC. These are very sensible changes and are ones that the previous government was not prepared to undertake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that the media, in its response to the Mansfield report, really only locked onto one issue. So they were, broadly, pretty happy with the direction of that report. That is quite a contrast to what happened under the last Labor government. Along with Senator Alston, I was on the committee which 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> looked at the ABC. Senator Schacht was there as well and he heard all of this. He heard about an organisation that had seriously gone off the rails. It had gone into pay TV and into ATV overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">BNA was another failed venture. They got into all sorts of trouble over the `infotainment'  programs. It was an organisation that had lost direction. Quite rightly, through the Mansfield report and the actions of this minister, we are getting it all back on track again. If you look at the effects of the changes and the changes that are coming on the ground at ABC studios&mdash;and I have been to ABC studios&mdash;there are a number of minimal changes that they have had to make to the operations of the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The ABC staff there are reasonably happy with the changes. These are tightening up the procedures, the production process and the management structure, and that is very necessary because what we have in the ABC is a unique institution. I have had a look at the approach to public broadcasting in the United States, and we are absolutely streets ahead. We have a great institution in the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After 13 years of mismanagement by the Labor government it does need some changes in focus, some changes in its procedures and some changes in its management structure. That is what is going to happen under this government. It should have happened under the last government. As you were not prepared to make these changes, the coalition government is, and I think the changes that are coming up under the Mansfield report are most welcome in refocusing what is really a great Australian institution.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make a great prediction here: given the answers given by Senator Alston today, he will come back into this chamber at some stage in the next week and recant some part of his answers. If ever I have seen a minister not willing to own up, it is today. There are about four issues that he should have owned up to. First of all, he was very active on 23 June and 6 July denying that there was any prospect of over $100 million in cuts when his own cabinet submission in 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="147"> one of the options canvassed those particular cuts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason he was put in that position has not been revealed today. Senator Alston was going around the country telling all the ABC people, `I don't favour a cut in the ABC funding.' What that did was send the finance minister and Treasurer spare so they started leaking out stories about how tough they were going to get with the ABC. So if Senator Alston wants to know how the stories about the $100 million cuts got into the paper, his own colleagues put them in the paper, which forced Senator Alston to come out and describe them as ratbag suggestions, utter fabrications&mdash;not that much an utter fabrication that a submission with his name on it had a $125 million cut.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second issue is when he gets caught out after this submission is leaked and there is an admission in this submission that there is a breach of an election promise. What pathetic weasel words do we get out of this minister? `Oh, I didn't write that part of the submission. Some bureaucrat wrote that part and it is their iconoclastic view of the world.' And when he is asked today whether he signed off the submission, note his answer. He said he could not remember. He did not say yes; he did not say no; he said he could not remember. And when put under further pressure all he can do is indicate, `The procedures aren't the same as when you were in government.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have the opportunity now, Senator Alston, to come out and tell us. Did you sign that submission when it went to the cabinet office, or did you not? And if not, who put the submission in? Surely cabinet procedures have not changed to the extent that you do not read every word in every submission you put in, because that is the iron law of being a good minister. Every word that goes in becomes your words and your views, and the only area where you have room to manoeuvre is to say, `I had the choice of one of the two options.' That you did have. But the cover sheet, the content and those paragraphs are your words. That is why the word `I' appears so much through it&mdash;because they are your words. The moment the submission goes into 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> cabinet or ERC, they are the property and the views of the minister and anyone who puts one in when those words are not theirs should not be a minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But of course, we have had the Nuremberg defence: `I am not really guilty; I followed orders. I didn't really want the ABC cut but they ganged up on me, Senate. The finance minister and the Treasury forced me to bring in a submission. They humiliated me into bringing in a submission arguing for a $50 million cut or a $125 million cut. All I was doing was obeying orders from above. I am not guilty.' You cannot work both sides of the street. You cannot go out to the Friends of the ABC and their supporters and say secretly that you oppose cuts when a cabinet submission with your name on it gives you two options for major cuts.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Alston, did you actually sign this document off before the election? Did you read it?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This government has a clear commitment to responsibility in the financing of its public institutions, unlike those opposite. The ABC, as well as all other Australians, are paying the price now for that lack of responsibility by the previous government. Surely it is not unreasonable to examine the funding and direction of this very large public institution&mdash;one of our larger publicly funded institutions. Surely this applies to all publicly funded institutions. I think specifically of one of my former employers, the CSIRO. It is frequently reviewed and Senator Schacht was part of some of those reviews and outcomes that followed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why is it any different for the ABC? The ABC began in 1932. The Dix report was in 1981, and we have now had the Mansfield report&mdash;two reports in 60 years. I do not think that is unreasonable. Of course, the Mansfield report also gave people&mdash;staff of the ABC and listeners of the ABC, thousands of them, 11,500 of them&mdash;the opportunity to express their view on the new direction that the ABC might take to reaffirm its current direction and to look at other options.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I can tell you that many of my friends who work in the ABC welcomed this review. They saw it as a chance to upgrade outdated, broken down technology. How many of us have gone up to do interviews with the ABC only to find D&hyphen;Cart has collapsed, the line's fallen out, the equipment's broken down or the tape recorder did not work. Those staff could not wait for the opportunity for a review of the ABC that might, once and for all, address the need for new technology and a clear direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is something that staff say they want for motivation, for job security and, in the long term, for more security for their ABC funding. That was something picked up by Mansfield&mdash;that is, the need to reaffirm once again triennium funding for the ABC.</PARA>

I was delighted to hear this morning that one of the Radio National broadcasters said with some pleasure in his voice, `And we're safe.' Mansfield reaffirmed the role of Radio National. With the Mansfield inquiry, we have sought to maximise the efficiencies of the ABC while trying to contain costs, something our friends opposite lost sight of.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, my view is that the ABC has been provided with a very valuable opportunity to review and to refocus. For an organisation with very strong foundations which were set in all our communities, and that has been recognised and reaffirmed, there is absolutely no doubt that as a result of the recommendations flowing from the Mansfield inquiry we will have a better quality broadcaster.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Saying that the ABC should be watching its costs is just an extraordinary statement. The ABC has been watching its costs, particularly under the last government. Now under this government, the way its costs have been diminished is just absolutely extraordinary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me go back to Senator Alston's responses to some of those questions. He gave a wonderful rap to Mr Mansfield's report and he gave a wonderful rap to all the recommendations in that report. In particular, the one I took note of was where he belittled Radio Australia and its impact in our region. So who agrees with him? Let us have a look at the list. I cannot find anyone who actually agrees with him, but who disagrees with him?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the papers today the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) is reported to have said that he will argue in cabinet for the retention of Radio Australia. There is one person who does not agree with him. It is certainly not the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="149"> They argued in their submission to the Mansfield inquiry that in Indonesia Radio Australia still has a strong following from a generally well&hyphen;educated audience. It is highly valued. It helps create an image of Australia in the Western countries most interested in and expert about Indonesian affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One submission also claims that Radio Australia's programs are extremely popular in China where he says that they have very little audience, while in the South Pacific it is the only source of news in the region available to Pacific countries. So it is not DFAT. It is not the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jose Ramos Horta, whose name must not be mentioned by members of their government, I understand, who says that Radio Australia is the only source of real news to many in Indonesia, particularly in East Timor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not the listeners who Senator Alston says do not exist, but who have been writing to Radio Australia saying it is their lifeline with the outside world&mdash;and they are the people in southern China, the people in Burma. The people in Burma are not going to tell us. They are not going to write to the Mansfield inquiry. Senator Alston said he did not get any submissions from Burma, did not get any submissions from southern China&mdash;or very many from southern China&mdash;and did not get any from Indonesia. I am not actually surprised. That does not amaze me. It is just extraordinary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They came from Europe. That is where people do these sorts of things. They do not write submissions from Burma. They are too scared for a start. They do not write submissions from East Timor; they are too scared too, but they like to hear what is going on in the outside world and they would like to know what the real news is. Radio Australia is one of the very few sources of that news, and you want to cut it off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It certainly was not the PNG government, who I understand are very upset about the possible closure of Radio Australia. So Senator Alston does not think Radio Australia has many fans. I can assure him Radio Australia does have many fans. They are not just people outside Australia; they are not just people who do not vote. They are people who 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> need the news. They are people inside Australia as well. If it is closed down, he will discover at the next election that they are very powerful.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to deal with a few matters which, presumably, will not involve my going over the same ground on the MPI in a few minutes. Just for Senator Bourne's benefit, I did not say that Mansfield and I had not received any submissions from places like Indonesia and Burma. I said, as I recall it, Mansfield told me&mdash;and I do not think it appears in his report&mdash;that the great bulk of submissions had come from Europe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite rightly, the implication of that is that very few came from the region, but I do not want anyone suggesting that somehow there were no submissions from any country in the region. There may well have been some, but the point was&mdash;and I hope you understand the point I am making&mdash;that the great bulk were not from there. I did not belittle Radio Australia. In fact, if you read pages 41 and 42, I was substantially repeating what Mansfield had to say and Mansfield also reports significant reservations on the part of DFAT. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DFAT clearly shows shortcomings in the current services, stating in its submission, `While it is clear that RA and ATV have a key public affairs dimension in our region, in a changing broadcasting environment neither service is presently meeting its full potential and restructuring is necessary to address these shortcomings.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He was quoting there in part from the DFAT submission. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have some difficulty in identifying the extent to which the ABC plays such a role and, if it does, the extent to which it is effective in doing so.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">These are Mansfield's reservations which I am simply putting before the Senate in saying that these are matters for judgment down the track. The government has not made a decision on Radio Australia and, in many respects, it is not our decision to make. It is a matter for the ABC and I am sure the board will be addressing these matters right now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I think the onus is on those who argue that somehow the status quo ought to prevail 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="150"> to find where the money is coming from&mdash;and I would be very interested to hear Senator Schacht say that the ALP is committed to providing an extra $20 million, that is, their budget commitment, to fund Radio Australia&mdash;or alternatively to spell out how effective it is and whether it is doing the job that it was originally designed to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We would all say, in a perfect world, `Wouldn't it be great to have Australia's voice in the region', but you have to look at whether it can be delivered in various other ways, and that is the critical issue in relation to Radio Australia. I hope that that debate will proceed, but Mansfield is the starting point and I think the onus is on those who want to argue to the contrary to refute the propositions that he puts forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If what you do is pick out a few newspaper articles and say `There you go. There are enough people around saying we ought to hang on to something,' then you would simply be ruled by public opinion on the issue without assuming any additional responsibilities which you have as law&hyphen;makers to look at how the ABC ought to deal with scarce resources and have a view along those lines.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Bert Kelly was born on 22 June 1912 at Riverton, South Australia. He was a farmer in South Australia before entering federal politics. Even then he was making a significant contribution to the state's rural industry. He was a member of the South Australian Soil Conservation Committee from 1940 to 1958 and served on the South Australian Advisory Board of Agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In 1951 Bert was awarded a Nuffield Fellowship to study farming in Britain. This was the first time farming fellowships had been awarded in Australia. He became a member of the House of Representatives in 1958 when he won the South Australian seat of Wakefield for the Liberal Party. Although his interest in primary production and in related issues, such as soil conservation, was to remain with him throughout his parliamentary career, his overwhelming concern and the single issue which he championed fearlessly and tirelessly in his political life was tariff reduction and free trade. At the time when he was given his first ministry in the Holt government he was already characterised by the press as a `crusading dissenter'. Indeed, a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> article reporting on his appointment said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">They may have to put an extra layer of green sound-proofing . . . on the doors of the Federal Cabinet room when South Australian Bert Kelly is called in to give the Government advice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Mr Charles Robert Kelly, Federal Minister for Works, as he will become, is one of the bluntest, straightest talkers ever to sit in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Bert was very good at articulating his strongly held views with wit, courage and gentle self- 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="152">deprecation, which endeared him to many both inside and outside politics, regardless of whether they agreed with him. He was, of course, author of the long running `Modest Member' column and later the `Modest Farmer' column.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) recalls himself being on the receiving end of that sharp wit in 1976 after a New Zealand horse won the Melbourne Cup. Mr Howard was the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs at the time and Bert took the opportunity at question time to ask whether he would consider putting a tariff on New Zealand horses to stop them from running faster than Australian horses. It should come as no surprise that Bert Kelly's speech from the back bench always attracted a good attendance in the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert faithfully represented the rural electorate of Wakefield in South Australia for 19 years. He served as the Minister for Works in the Holt government and as the Minister for the Navy in the Gorton government. Not surprisingly, he served on a number of parliamentary committees, including the House Select Committee on Grievances of Yirrkala Aborigines, Arnhem Land Reserve; the Joint Committee of Public Accounts; the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs; the Joint Committee on the Northern Territory; and the Joint Committee of Public Works, of which he was chairman for some years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His departure from federal politics in 1977 was marked by many tributes. Perhaps it was best summed up by a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> article which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bert Kelly is almost a legend. He is one of those rare politicians who actually manages to see the importance of consistent, long-term policies over immediate party advantage.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I think most people on both sides of the chamber would agree that reductions in protection have contributed to a more competitive domestic industry and international trade reform. Whilst there may be differences over the pace and management of change, the general direction of change is due in part to the likes of Bert Kelly, who consistently and passionately articulated a position which has been adopted not only domestically but now 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> internationally. Bert's remarkable contribution was recognised in 1980 when he was appointed Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George for his parliamentary service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For those of us privileged to know Bert, he will be sadly missed. As a distant relative of mine, I will particularly miss him. He was one of my parliamentary heroes because of his determination to stick by a cause no matter what and the skilful way in which he was able to sell his message with wit and humour. He will be remembered by all with great affection, regard and admiration. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Lorna, and his children&mdash;Tony, Kim and Roger&mdash;and their families, our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was first elected to parliament in 1958 for the South Australian seat of Wakefield. He held the seat for 19 years, during which time he developed a, I think, well-deserved reputation for very effectively representing his constituents.

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="153">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert Kelly was appointed Minister for Works in 1967 in the Holt government and Minister for the Navy in 1968 in the Gorton government. He will be remembered not only for his time as a minister in Liberal governments but also as a member from one of the smaller states with a huge determination and will who was very influential in terms of government policy on tariffs and trade. He was the `Modest Member', as he styled himself in the newspaper columns that he wrote on his retirement from the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert Kelly was a strong voice behind the call for less government regulation and he fought relentlessly against higher levels of tariff protection. The truth of the matter is that he fought with both sides of politics for the causes in which he believed.

It takes real fortitude when you are a member of a major political party and you are willing to stand alone on those sorts of issues.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was a federal parliamentarian for almost 20 years and a man who served with distinction as the Minister for Works under Harold Holt and John McEwen and as Minister for the Navy under John Gorton. Bert Kelly will be remembered for his lifelong campaign to wind back tariffs and promote free trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He was born in 1912 in Riverton, South Australia, to a prominent farming family and was educated at Prince Alfred College. His early years were spent on the family farm and he was on the Advisory Board of Agriculture before being preselected for the rural South 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Australian seat of Wakefield in 1958. His strong views on the economic costs of blanket protectionism were shaped by his father, Stan, who had served for many years as a distinguished member of the Commonwealth Tariff Board.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert Kelly's first speech clearly signposted the direction that he would pursue in the parliament. He spoke of the great need for Australia to improve its terms of trade and he raised the question: If primary industry had to feel the winds of competition why should not secondary industry? History repeats itself when we see the sugar tariffs going and some debate on car tariffs to come before this parliament. Bert Kelly served as Deputy Government Whip from 1964 to 1967 before his elevation to the Ministry for Works in 1967. As Minister for Works he oversaw the completion of Australia's then biggest underwater cable laying operation which stretched across Darwin Harbour to supply power to the Radio Australia station on the Cox Peninsula. As Minister for the Navy from 1968 to 1969, Bert Kelly presided over a service that had to work hard to keep its members from the increasingly attractive salaries and conditions of private enterprise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert Kelly will certainly be known as a person who brought to this parliament an opposition to protectionism and for his complete endorsement of free trade. He did that at a time that would not have been fashionable to do so, and I can understand that he would have been unpopular in some areas for his persistent announcements of the reduction of protectionism. But he did it, and his name lives on. His name will be remembered in parliament as the person who led the charge on the reduction of tariffs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I acknowledge that he was successful in pursuing what was very close to him and what politics in Australia has adopted: more free trade policies. He pushed those well before his time. I extend my sympathy to his family and offer them the condolences of the National Party.</PARA></SPEECH>

One of the great pleasures in moving to South Australia some 12 years ago was that I was able to become a personal friend of Bert and enjoy many moments with him. I am also very proud to be a member of the Society of Modest Members, which was of course named after Bert Kelly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert was 84 when he died, so he had had a very long and successful innings. We should really celebrate his achievements in contrast to the tragic condolence yesterday for John Panizza. Bert was a man of no pretension whatsoever; a man of considerable humility, self&hyphen;deprecation and great wit. He was, as we all know, very dry in his economics but he was also very dry in his humour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When I was elected to the Senate in 1993, I asked Bert to write a column for the first newsletter that I produced. He wrote a column which was published called `Unseating the armchair critics'. There is a passage in that which I think is an example of his approach to life. At that time, of course, the Liberal Party was licking its wounds from one of its most difficult electoral defeats. Bert said in this column:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other day, at bowls, a chap said to me, "Bert, Australia is getting in an awful mess and so is the Liberal Party. You were in Parliament for 19 years, you ought to be able to tell us what we should do to make things better". I thought for a while before I answered because that is a trick I learnt in politics, it makes people think you are wiser than you are. Then I replied, "Yes, you are quite right. And if things get any worse I think you will have to start going to Liberal Party meetings". His startled reply was, "Oh cripes, things surely aren't as bad as that!"</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is probably a sentiment being felt in the Labor Party at the moment. But that was an example of Bert's very funny and humorous approach, and the way he was able to use humour to convey his message so effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert was proof for all of us that you can make your mark in public life without being a powerful orator, without being an aggressive politician, without being machiavellian in any way or obsessed by ambition to climb the political tree. He did reach the dizzy heights of minister, albeit for only a couple of years. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> He did not reach it as a result of ambition but I think as a result of his obvious policy conviction. But without being any of the things one might normally associate with political success, Bert Kelly probably had more of an impact on public policy in this country than most of us have or ever will. His commitment to free trade was remarkably resolute. It was very strong and unwavering in the face of the sort of opposition under which most of us would wilt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess, as the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Faulkner) alluded to, much of the opposition to Bert came from within his own ranks, particularly John McEwen. We are now delighted that the National Party has changed its stripes&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite sure that they are now, as Ron would testify, great supporters of free trade. But there were some very powerful, protected industries and industrialists in this country who fought long and hard against Bert Kelly and his views. His views were most unpopular in certain quarters of his home state of South Australia, as is evident at the moment with the difficult issue of car tariffs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paradoxically, it was a Labor Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, who in public policy terms was the first to take real notice of Bert Kelly's advice. I do not think any of us will forget the day on which we learned about Gough's very dramatic 25 per cent cut in tariffs. I certainly will not forget that day because it was one of the most dramatic actions of a dramatic Prime Minister. I was very impressed with the fact that Gough took the trouble and effort to attend Bert's funeral in Adelaide. I thought that was very significant and I know it was valued deeply by his family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia is immeasurably better off because we are now, in a bipartisan manner, pursuing a policy of reducing and ultimately eliminating all tariffs in this country. Much of the credit for that must go to Bert Kelly. I think Bert, almost single-handedly and in his own inimical fashion, made Australians aware of the massive cost to Australia of protection. He 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="155"> was a very great Liberal, a great South Australian and a great credit to this parliament.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I first got to know Charles Robert Kelly&mdash;better known to all of us as Bert Kelly&mdash;as a secondary school student. His longstanding electorate secretary, Flo Jukes&hyphen;Heley, reminded me after my election as member for Kingston in 1975 that I had occasionally visited his office&mdash;as she described it&mdash;`in my school cap' to discuss politics and economics with him. I had been introduced by my father who was a friend of Bert and, indeed, my father was also a friend of Bert's original mentor, C.A.S. Hawker.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those occasional discussions continued during my years at university in the context of my seeking advice and information on economic issues, especially trade and tariff issues which, as a then Young Liberal, I wanted to raise from time to time in Young Liberal policy discussions. I especially remember him giving me the voluminous Vernon report to digest on one occasion. Of course, `Dave's Diary', his column in the South Australian <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stock Journal</EMPHASIS> which ceased when he entered the ministry, become required reading. Quite simply, despite his not being a particularly eloquent speaker in terms of fluency, Bert's speeches, laced with logic and wit, together with written articles, were an inspiration to a young person interested in economics and politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most important of all, however, was his unswerving courage in tackling McEwen and others wedded to protectionism&mdash;courage which included eschewing political preferment. Although twice recognised with ministries&mdash;as Minister for Works under Prime Minister Holt in 1967-68 and as Minister for the Navy under Prime Minister Gorton in 1968-69&mdash;as well as serving as Deputy Government Whip, during his 19 years as member for Wakefield, it was  and in his role as backbencher pursuing the tariff issue for which Australians really owe him a great debt of gratitude. He clearly showed that Australia's high tariffs were detrimental to the interests of our wealth creating exporters, especially farmers, and ultimately detrimental to the community at large.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There was strong and powerful opposition to his then unfashionable stand on tariff protection and government regulation&mdash;I have already mentioned John McEwen&mdash;but he withstood criticism from both the opposition and his own government parties with his customary humour and clear argument. Australia was pricing its exporters out of world markets through its tariff protection, and he put that argument very clearly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When he published his biography <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">One More Nail</EMPHASIS> in 1978, Bert stated at the beginning of that work:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is almost as if Australia has a death wish . . . We have built a wall around our Australian home so high that most of our Asian neighbours think we are a world apart. Indeed we are, because that wall&mdash;invisible as it is&mdash;is very real in economic terms as it represents the high tariff barriers we thrust into the faces of those 2,250,000,000 people we supposedly call our friends.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">After being dropped from the ministry at the end of 1969, Bert began in earnest to put pen to paper, writing the `Modest Member' articles for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>  and again for the South Australian <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stock Journal</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As a man whose heart was in the country, Bert's colourful speech was spattered with rural and homespun analogies. He managed with simple words and humour to very ably get his point across. Of governments that mean well but do badly through excessive interference in the economy, on one occasion he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An economy is like a bucket of worms. It is changing and turning all the time, and if it isn't changing it dies, and the smell is awful.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Bert's great grandfather came to South Australia from the Isle of Man in 1838. His grandfather Robert was briefly a member of the South Australian parliament, before being appointed chairman of the Land Board. His father, Stan, was a member of the State Advisory Board on Agriculture, and then the Commonwealth Tariff Board. To say the Kellys get involved is obviously an understatement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert Kelly himself was born in 1912 at Tarlee, about 80 kilometres north of Adelaide and was educated at Prince Alfred College in Adelaide, before returning to his beloved 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="156"> family farm, Merrindie, in 1929. He was appointed to the South Australian Advisory Board on Agriculture and then to the South Australian Soil Conservation Committee, before winning the inaugural Nuffield Farming Scholarship to study farming in the United Kingdom.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On his return, he became a reluctant political starter, but won the seat of Wakefield in 1958, fulfilling the wish of his mentor Charles Hawker, who held Wakefield from 1931 until his untimely death in a plane crash in 1938. Charles Hawker had told Bert that he wanted him to enter the political arena. I would like to quote Bert, as he recalls that demand by his mentor:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But then he gradually became more pressing and one day said, `Look Bert, I want you to prepare yourself to take over from me when I can't go on, when I resign from Wakefield.' By that time,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bert reflected, I was a member of the Advisory Board of Agriculture, I loved my farming, and I had kids at foot, and I said, `Look, I'd rather be dead than in politics.' And then he said, with that understanding look, `I'm not asking you what you want Bert, I'm just telling you where your duty lies.' And that shut me up. Oh it shut me up. And I never went to a political meeting from then on, never. I said, `I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to be tricked into bloody politics.'</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Of course, eventually he was tricked into `bloody politics' and met that demand of Charles Hawker.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Charles Hawker himself had been a persistent critic of tariff protection. In 1961, Bert went to the United Kingdom to speak to the Oxford Farming Conference and returned via Nepal, where he was the Australian government's adviser on a sheep grazing project, under the Colombo Plan. On his return to Australia, the tariff battle began in earnest. Bert described this time as lonely and sometimes bitter, but always interesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert was amongst those who encouraged me to seek election to this parliament. Given my association with him, I was especially pleased after my election in 1975 that the then government whip, John Bouchier, allocated me a seat in the House of Representatives chamber right next to Bert. Whether Bert had a hand in this I never knew, but perhaps he wanted to keep a fatherly eye on 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> his young South Australian colleague. I only know that during the next two years he would regularly occupy his seat whenever I was speaking, often proffering helpful and witty interjections with his typically dry humour. I certainly appreciated his long&hyphen;suffering patience in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Needless to say, I and many of my colleagues&mdash;I am sure that Jim Short, who was then a member of the House of Representatives, would recall this&mdash;were always in the chamber when Bert spoke. Bert was a welcome source of information, advice, opinion and, most importantly, inspiration during those final two years of his meritorious parliamentary service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was during 1977 that Bert suggested to me that if, in his words, `Kingston went bad on me' at the next election&mdash;as might well be expected, given its history as a predominantly Labor seat&mdash;I should consider following him as the member for Wakefield at the following election, as he intended to serve only one more term. I was honoured by this encouragement but, in the event, held Kingston at the following election, and also the one after that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sadly, it was Bert who was denied the opportunity to complete his parliamentary service as he would have wished. The 1977 redistribution reduced South Australia's representation, with the seats of Wakefield and Angas being amalgamated. Bert lost the ensuing preselection for the new Wakefield to Geoff Giles, the member for Angas. Despite my friendship with and fondness for the late Geoff Giles&mdash;and my respect for his own contribution to this parliament&mdash;I would not be alone in concluding that his contribution to Australia's welfare did not match that of Bert. But such are the peculiarities of preselection: it was Bert's voice which was lost in this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, his voice was not silenced, as his `Modest Member' column became the `Modest Farmer' column in, successively, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. He continued to be much in demand as a speaker right across Australia, travelling, inevitably, with his small weathered case, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="157"> which bore the initials C.R.K in roughly handpainted white paint. Bert also remained prominent as the patron of the Society of Modest Members, of which Senator Short and I were foundation members when in 1981 it was established among members of parliament to foster discussion of the benefits of a freer economic system. Bert kept a fatherly eye on the economic rectitude of a number of us remaining in the parliament, right through until his unfortunate stroke last year. It was a harrowing experience for me, when visiting him after that, to see him struggle to converse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Politics and economics were not Bert's only interests. Sport was an important part of his life. He was a regular on the tennis courts at Old Parliament House, and&mdash;well into his 70s&mdash;on tennis courts in Adelaide on Saturdays with some of his mates. Later on, he was a regular on the bowling green. Football and cricket were also high among his interests, and especially the fortunes of his grandson Craig in his football career with Prince Alfred College, Norwood and, latterly, with Collingwood in the AFL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">His old school, Prince Alfred College, featured high amongst his interests too. He was a foundation member of the school foundation and a regular at its old scholars' dinners and annual old scholars' church services, and, from the late 1980s, the old old scholars' assembly. He often went to watch the current students of that school's senior sporting teams play on Saturday afternoons.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then they went on; and just at the place where Little-faith formerly was robbed, there stood a man with his sword drawn and his face all bloody. Then said Mr Great-heart, Who art thou? The man made answer, saying, I am one whose name is Valiant-for-Truth. I am a pilgrim and am going to the Celestial City. Now, as I was on my way, there were three men did beset me, and propounded unto me these three things:&hyphen;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Or die upon the place.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the first I answered, I had been a true man for a long season, and it could not be expected that I should now cast in my lot with thieves. Then they demanded what I should say to the second. So I told them that the place from whence I came, had I not found incommodity there, I had not forsaken it at all; but finding it unsuitable to me, and very unprofitable for me, I forsook it for this way. Then they asked me what I said to the third? And I told them. My life cost more dear, far, than that I should lightly give it away. Besides, you have nothing to do thus to put things to my choice; wherefore be at your peril if you meddle.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then these three, to wit, Wild-head, Inconsiderate, and Pragmatick, drew upon me, and I also drew upon them.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Friends, we have come to this service to give thanks to God for the life of Bert Kelly, and to share with Lorna, Tony, Kim and Roger and the grandchildren, and with Bill, Winifred and Marion, their loss in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I began these reflections with some lines from Pilgrim's Progress, because I know of no more apt description of Bert's life and work than the description "Valiant-for-Truth". Further, he had some close comrades in his pilgrimage and, in particular, it seems to me to be entirely correct to describe Alf Rattigan as Mr Great-heart. And finally, how appropriate it is to describe the foes which Bert 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="158"> encountered on his epic pilgrimage as Wild&hyphen;head, Inconsiderate and, above all, Pragmatick.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Charles Robert Kelly was born on 22 June 1912. His father was W S Kelly, known as WS or Stan. His mother was Ada May nee Dawson and their infant son was named Charles after her father, and Robert after his father, in that order, because Ada was not going to have any R C Kellys in the family. The Kellys were Methodists from the Isle of Man who arrived in SA in 1838. The Dawsons were Anglicans from Kent, who arrived the same year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bert was the second of four children and they grew up on Merrindie, the family farm. Their lives at Merrindie are delightfully described in the book entitled Merrindie, jointly rewritten by several members of the family and which Bert organised and published in 1988. One vignette, from Bert's pen, must suffice for this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Looking back on my youth at Merrindie, I suppose the aspect that I appreciate most now, with the benefit of hindsight, is the memory of the family sitting around the big table in what we used to call the dining room, with a big kerosene lamp in the table centre. Dad was not always there as he did a lot of reading and writing in his little study, warmed by a smelly kerosene heater in the winter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A vital part of their lives was the Methodist Church at Giles Corner. Methodism was implanted by John Wesley in the Isle of Man in the 1780s, and the Kelly pioneers brought it with them to South Australia. The Methodist Church of Australia is no more, and other surviving churches seem distressed by heresies, but Methodism is important in understanding the life of Bert Kelly. The tag "Methodist zeal" was applied to Bert as recently as 1991 by Sir Paul Hasluck when I was asking the former Governor-General about his close relationship to Sir John McEwen, and his perspective on the battle between the much-feared Country Party Chief and Deputy Prime Minister, and his antagonist, the modest member from Wakefield.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will take a carefully written book to do justice to the closely interconnected fabric of family, farm, church and school which surrounded Bert during his childhood and young manhood. That book, I should add, has been in progress for some time and will I trust, when complete, describe fully in all its richness, this rich culture of early C20 rural Australia which produced so many great men and women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bert attended Prince Alfred College and returned to the farm in December 1929 to serve an apprenticeship under a manager. Three months later he was appointed to teach in the Sunday School. WS had left Merrindie to take up his Tariff Board duties in Melbourne. Lorna Hill came that year to 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Merrindie School to housekeep for her brother Victor, who was taking charge at his first school. Very soon Bert was courting Lorna with the aid of a primitive Fordson tractor, which he used to work over the school corner paddock far more than any economic calculation could possibly justify. In 1935 they married and no politician or public figure could have been more fortunate than Bert, in having Lorna as wife and sheet-anchor. How often has the story been told of Bert droning on to a virtually empty House, late at night, on the implications of the latest Tariff Board report, sustained only by the loyal presence of Lorna in the Visitor's Gallery. But those speeches became part of a public record which kept lobbyists and departmental advisers, at least from some departments, awake at night.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We can summarise Bert Kelly's claim to our admiration, and to his important place in the history of Australia, very simply. He arrived in Parliament, aged 46, in 1959, with no more formal education than he obtained at Prince Alfred College and then, with no parliamentary allies, sustained a long and often bitter campaign, lasting two decades, first against a very powerful Deputy Prime Minister, but always against the deeply held and strongly defended conventional wisdom of the day concerning protectionism. In the thirties, Sir Keith Hancock had written,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Critics of protection, during the second decade of the C20, dwindled into a despised and detested sect suspected of nursing an anti-national heresy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and in the fifties the climate of hostility towards such critics, under McEwen's influence, had become worse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The influence of two men sustained him during this long and lonely battle. The first was his father, WS, whom Bert regarded with "awe and veneration". WS was still very much alive when Bert entered politics, and he maintained pressure on Bert to take up the battle WS was appointed by the Bruce-Page Government to the Tariff Board in 1929, and from that vantage point saw the tragic consequences of the "tariff-on-request" policy of the Scullin Government, a policy espoused by that Government in its woefully misguided response to the massive unemployment caused by the Great Depression.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second man, Charles Hawker, was killed in a plane crash at 2 am on Oct 26, 1938 when his plane, en route from Adelaide, overshot Essendon airport in fog, and crashed into the summit of Mt Dandenong. Charles Hawker was crippled very badly by war wounds but won the seat of Wakefield in the 1931 election. Had he lived he would have most likely succeeded Joe Lyons as Prime Minister. Hawker and WS were close friends and Hawker was a frequent visitor to Merrindie. An important exchange took place during one of these 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="159"> visits, not long before Hawker was killed, and in retrospect Bert recalled it in these words</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But then he gradually became more pressing and one day said, "Look Bert, I want to prepare yourself to take over from me when I can't go on, when I resign from Wakefield". By that time, Bert reflected, I was a member of the Advisory Board of Agriculture, I loved my farming, and I had kids at foot, and I said, "Look I'd rather be dead than in politics" And then he said, with that understanding look, "I'm not asking you what you want Bert, I'm just telling you where your duty lies."  And that shut me up. Oh it shut me up. And I never went to a political meeting from then on, never. I said, "I'm not going to do it! I'm not going to be tricked into bloody politics".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hawker bitterly attacked the endemic corruption which attended the Scullin tariffs, and the settlement which was reached during the thirties on this issue was due to Douglas Copland who argued successfully for "economic and efficient protection". Protection would be accepted as a normal part of economic life, but the Tariff Board would be given the right to exercise proper scrutiny and control over procedures, free from immediate political pressure. WS served on the Tariff Board for many years and all of his work was directed towards implementing this truce. However McEwen, seeking for even greater power to implement his vision for Australia, and desirous of using the tariff and the import quota to achieve his ends, found his ambitions blocked by the Tariff Board. Within this power struggle, then, the ghost of Charles Hawker and the urgent and compelling voice of his father, propelled and sustained Bert in his early years in the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key events in this long battle were the Vernon Report, the resignation of Sir Leslie Melville from the chairmanship of the Tariff Board, and the appointment of Alf Rattigan to succeed him. During this intense power struggle Bert became a master of the parliamentary question which, seemingly quite innocuous, contained within it a potentially lethal trap for the Deputy Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having appointed Bert as Party Whip, Prime Minister Sir Robert Menzies retired in January 1966. Not long after his successor, Harold Holt, drowned in December 1967, having appointed Bert to the most junior ministry of Works. John Gorton then gave him the Navy but later dropped him, and in this way launched Bert on his extraordinary career as the Modest Member. He had, much earlier, developed a unique style and a technique as a columnist with his Dave's Diary, written for rural papers, prior to entering politics. His characters then were Dave, his wife Mary, their politically ambitious neighbours the Clarksons, and Squatter the sheep-dog. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With Dave's Diary Bert had become a very skilled writer, and in the tradition of Steele Rudd and C J Dennis he created, from his experience of farming and political life, a series of characters for his column such as Eccles the ivory tower economist, Fred the farmer next door, and Mavis, the long suffering politician's wife. These characters, and the rural imagery Bert employed, captivated many thousands of readers in all walks of professional and business life. Those Friday columns came to exert great influence throughout Australia, and each successive Friday came to be dreaded by the Canberra lobbyists whose job was defending and expanding the tariffs which their industries enjoyed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was one of the Friday-only readers of the Financial Review of those days, a phenomenon which made Friday's circulation greater than on any other day. And I well recall the sense of anticipation with which I immediately turned to the editorial pages to catch up on the latest adventures of Fred, Mavis Eccles and the modest member. Self-deprecation became, in Bert's hands, an extraordinarily effective weapon. But we should not assume, because it became such, that Bert was not what he claimed to be&mdash;a modest member. Bert believed that modesty was an important quality which, if not innate, should be diligently cultivated, and he did so because it was a part of the fabric of values and strongly held beliefs which became part of him as he grew up at Merrindie, and married, and with Lorna, brought up their family there.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly we should not think that Bert was opposed to protectionism because it was inefficient, or led to distortions in investment and trade&mdash;to use the language of economics. Bert was opposed to Protectionism because it was wrong, and it was wrong because it created a situation in which governments, in the person of ministers or officials, granted arbitrary and capricious favours to some, who were thus greatly enriched, at the expense of others, who were at best impoverished and at worst, ruined. Bert was not really an economic rationalist as that term is now employed. Bert was the great embodiment of Edmund Burke's dictum that "politics is morality writ large." and if the application of the moral principles which had been inculcated into him from childhood led to economically sensible conclusions, that was an additional benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the same reasons Bert never placed the prospect of political preferment above his mission, and he thus became an exemplar to a rising group of politicians who saw in Bert someone who achieved, in reality, extraordinary success but whose political career, in conventional terms, could only have been described as modestly successful. These political heirs of Bert's formed the Society of Modest Members, and have sought in their various ways to emulate him in their conduct and influence. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="160"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bert instinctively understood the truth of Edmund Burke's observation that "all government is based on opinion". Bert set out to change opinion on protectionism, and first of all in the parliament, and then, in his column and in his speaking engagements all around Australia, he played an indispensable role in bringing about the nation-wide change in opinion, to which the Prime Minister referred in his tribute to Bert.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bert was much loved by his companions in these battles. At the various conferences where the issues were debated, Bert's appearance, dressed as he usually was in shorts, open necked shirt, long socks with ruler and pencil tucked inside a sock, together with the battered case with the letters CRK emblazoned in unruly fashion in white paint on one side, was always cause for an immediate uplift of spirits. Bert was always good fun, but we all knew that underneath the wit and the charm there was a well-tempered core of steel; that he would always be true; and if we were to desert the cause, particularly for temporary advantage, his judgment would be stern.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">After this it was noised abroad that Mr Valiant-for-Truth was taken with a summons by the same post as the other, and had this for a token that the summons was true, That his pitcher was broken at the fountain. When he understood it he called his friends, and told them of it. Then said he, I am going to my Father's; and though with great difficulty I am got hither, yet I do not repent me of all the trouble I have been at to arrive where I am. My sword I give to him that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage, and my courage and skill to him that can get it. My marks and scars I carry with me, to be a witness for me that I have fought His battles who now will be my rewarder. When the day that he must go hence was come, many accompanied him to the river side, into which as he went he said, Death where is thy sting? And as he went down deeper, he said, Grave where is the victory? So he passed over, and all the trumpets sounded for him on the other side.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will stand as a monument to Bert that his proteges, to whom he handed the baton of his long, lonely, courageous fight against the folly of protectionism and, subsequently, other economic folly, are regarded as having won the day.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But we should perhaps ask the question: is the fight won? When one considers the

Indeed, one can validly ask whether some of its critics have even read the detail of the report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to say very few words. First of all, to the family of Bert Kelly, I extend my condolences and sympathy on his passing. Of course as a South Australian senator&mdash;and he was a distinguished Liberal Party member from South Australia&mdash;I think it is appropriate that I say a few words. I cannot claim that I was a personal friend. I met Bert Kelly once when I was a staffer in the Whitlam government and occasionally travelled backwards and forwards on the same plane. I remember that, at the time I did meet him and have a conversation, he was in an animated conversation with Richie Gun, the then member for Kingston, over these issues that other senators have mentioned here today: tariff arrangements et cetera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think that Bert Kelly did have some influence on Richie Gun and on other members of the Labor Party about tariffs&mdash;not to the extraordinary degree that we should get rid of all tariffs but he did point out some of the insanity of some of the extraordinarily high levels of tariffs that occurred. I think there was one famous case about plastic buckets when he said that the tariff on imported plastic buckets was so absurd that you would have been better off getting a gold&hyphen;plated bucket made in Australia by comparison. He did point out those absurdities that tariffs had got to in Australia.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="161">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that Bert was obviously one of those few people who had more influence when he was on the backbench than he did when he was a minister. I think that he was a victim of the second <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Melbourne</EMPHASIS> incident when it collided with an American destroyer and sank it at the time when he was Minister for the Navy. At the time, he got some criticism, which I do not think was fairly dealt to him. But when he was dismissed from the ministry&mdash;or sacked, whichever way you wanted to put it in those days&mdash;he took it with considerable forbearance and just saw that as a another part of the passing parade of politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remember that in the middle of 1974 there were major floods in Australia. We had heavy rain and floods in Brisbane and the Murray&hyphen;Darling Basin. There were scenes very similar to what we are seeing at Charleville today where towns were being flooded, towns situated on the low&hyphen;level areas of flood plains. The then Minister for the Environment, Moss Cass, put out a statement pointing out that flood plains are actually for floods, so if you build a house on a flood plain, every so often you have to expect to get flooded; it is all very well for people to say that this is terrible but that is the consequence of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Moss was being criticised by some people for not showing due sympathy for the people affected by the floods, and I remember Bert Kelly writing a letter to Moss. The letter, which I know Moss treasured greatly, said: `Dear Moss, If you continue to tell the truth like this, you are going to put all us politicians out of business. Clearly, it is correct. Flood plains are for floods and we should all recognise that and not get carried away'. Bert wrote that letter in the Modest Member article as well in one of those very self&hyphen;deprecating, humorous columns about Mavis, Eccles and the other characters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to place on record&mdash;I don't think it should be ignored, irrespective of which side of politics or which side you are in the tariff debate&mdash;that his influence as a backbencher was very unusual in that he convinced a lot of people on both sides of politics that unnecessarily high levels of tariff actually retard the economy and do the opposite of creating 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> jobs. Of course, that was against the orthodoxy of both  major parties of the 1950s, the 1960s and into the early 1970s. I notice that Senator Minchin in his remarks complimented Gough Whitlam on the decision, which created mayhem in the Labor Party in 1973, to announce out of the blue a 25 per cent tariff cut.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I always thought it was a bit astonishing that in 1977 he lost preselection for Wakefield to a very distant relative of mine, Geoffrey O'Halloran Giles. And of course when he lost preselection the comments in Modest Member were again written in a self&hyphen;deprecating style along the lines of `Of course, he lost the preselection because he refused to go round to campaign for votes, and his opponent did'. It was all there&mdash;all the things you should not do in politics. And of course there was that great line about Mavis being upset that he might not get a state funeral or whatever&mdash;and all those sorts of things about offending the Prime Minister.

Bert came from a distinguished family in South Australia and was a distinguished member of the South Australian community. Above all else, he made a contribution as a backbencher that in my knowledge of history is not surpassed by any other backbencher in influencing the course of policy which, despite the argy&hyphen;bargy about it, overwhelmingly has probably been for the benefit of most Australians.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to briefly associate myself with this condolence motion for Bert Kelly. I listened carefully to what Senator Schacht had to say and it followed along the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="162"> lines of what many other people have said today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert Kelly was the first federal politician I ever had the opportunity to vote for. I suppose that is probably not quite true. I probably did have the opportunity to vote for a Labor candidate, but in the seat of Wakefield that would not have made a lot of difference. I must also say that it was in those early days when there was not always a Labor candidate. When Senate elections were out of sync, it was quite often the case that Liberal members for Wakefield were returned unopposed. The same thing happened in some state elections in the 1950s when elections were out of sync.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I first had the opportunity at the age of 14 to meet Bert Kelly when in 1957 he came around on his preselection trail to visit my father, who at that stage was one of the approximately 8,000 Liberal Party members in the seat of Wakefield who had duly paid their guinea to belong to the party and were allowed to vote in a voluntary plebiscite&mdash;an issue that is very close to the heart of one of my colleagues. I do clearly remember him being brought around by another member of the Kelly family, a very respected farmer on Yorke Peninsula, who was well known to us and whose family still farms at Urania there, which Senator Schacht well knows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert Kelly impressed everybody that he spoke with even then. I can still remember my father saying to me, `There, boy, goes our next federal member.' I was not that worried at the time because I could do two or three extra rounds on the tractor on my own while Dad talked to Bert about his preselection process. It was the first time I met Bert.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some time after that my father entered state parliament and in the early 1960s when I was going to travel overseas he happened to be talking to Bert Kelly and said, `Well, if your lad is going overseas, Jim, I think there is something he ought to read before he goes.' So he handed my father a copy of his son Tony's diary, which Tony had written while he himself as a young man was overseas for a period&mdash;I think it was a couple of years. I wish I still had a copy of that diary because it was written in the same inimitable style as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Bert had when he was writing his various columns for the paper.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I never had the opportunity to meet Tony until the day of Bert's funeral because he moved to Western Australia and farmed successfully over there. I said to him that, although I had never met him before, I knew of him quite well because of the number of times I read his interesting diary which Bert thought I should read before I travelled overseas for some nine to 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The column `Dave's Diary' must have boosted the sales of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stock Journal</EMPHASIS> immensely because whenever anybody picked up the publication it was the first article that they read. It would not matter what crisis had evolved in the primary industries. It would not matter what the headline of the day was. People used to get the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stock Journal</EMPHASIS> and open it up to `Dave's Diary', such was his ability to enthuse his readers. He was always straight to the point. I had only just left school at the time and gone back on the farm. `Dave's Diary' was well read and well thought of by everybody although many people disagreed with the things that Bert was writing about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not long after Senator Minchin and I had come into this place, three very wise old heads decided that it was time that they taught the young boys a thing or two. I still remember a very pleasant luncheon at the Norwood Hotel with Bert Kelly, John Macleay and Jim Forbes, who over a period of 1&half; or two hours decided that they could impart a lot of knowledge to us on what we ought to know if we were going to serve this parliament well. I only hope that at some stage during our careers we can put some of those things into action that were said to us because certainly they were said with feeling and with much thought. At the end of that luncheon, both Senator Minchin and I were very proudly presented with a signed copy of Bert's book on Merrindie, the family farm, a well&hyphen;written and very readable book about the life of the Kellys in South Australia throughout the hard times and then the good times until the farm was sold.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am also a member of the Society of Modest Members which was formed at that time and am proud to be associated with that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="163"> society because it does remember a lot of the things that Bert stood for and was proud to stand for. It has been said by many people today that Bert was not an eloquent speaker. I would beg to differ with some of those remarks. You might not have called him an orator in the classic style but, whenever Bert Kelly stood up to speak in any forum, whether it was in this parliament or just a gathering of Liberals, people hung on every word that he said. Senator Schacht would probably agree that it did not matter whether it was a Liberal function; whatever function he was at, people hung on every word that Bert said because it was always thoughtful and it was always witty. Whether people agreed with him or not&mdash;as I said, in many cases many of his Liberal colleagues did not agree with what he said&mdash;they all appreciated his earnestness, his style and the manner in which he put forward his case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert Kelly will long be remembered in South Australia for his contribution to the Liberal Party and to politics in South Australia and in the federal parliament.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert entered the federal parliament in 1958 and retired in 1977, as we all know. I was privileged to be a colleague of his, along with Senator Chapman, in the House of Representatives during Bert's last two years there. Very regrettably, as Senator Schacht mentioned, his defeat at a preselection contest in 1977 robbed the parliament of a member who I think had many more potential years of very valuable contribution to make.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert was a unique person in many ways. The Prime Minister, John Howard, in his tribute to Bert on 19 January this year made a couple of points that I think are certainly correct. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bert Kelly was almost certainly the first and definitely the foremost parliamentary advocate in the post World War II period of lower tariffs and freer trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a time when it was unfashionable to do so he, almost single handedly, argued in Parliament for less government regulation and other economic policies now commonly described as economic rationalism.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Prime Minister also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In time he&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Bert&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">was to see the ideas he championed almost alone for so long enjoy much wider political support.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Former long&hyphen;term friend of Bert's and himself a long&hyphen;standing Liberal politician and, indeed, a federal President of the Liberal Party, Dr Jim Forbes, said on Bert's death:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in his time Bert Kelly achieved more as a member of Parliament than any single other member of Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He almost single&hyphen;handedly changed the whole climate in Australia from a high protection climate to one in which free trade prevailed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The excellent obituary in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>  by Ray Evans&mdash;and I am delighted to see that Senator Chapman today has had incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  the eulogy from Bert's funeral&mdash;described Bert as `one of the most influential politicians of his generation'. At Bert's funeral, which many of us attended a couple of weeks ago, former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam said to me&mdash;and I am sure he will not mind my repeating it here; and indeed some of my colleagues may also have heard it&mdash;that during his period as Prime Minister there was no backbench member on either side of the parliament for whom he had more respect. I would certainly fully endorse the words of Jim Forbes and Ray Evans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my view, Bert Kelly was one of the most influential members of parliament, including ministers, of the last 40 years. That was not because of his three&hyphen;year ministerial record as Minister for Works and as Minister for the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="164"> Navy in the period 1966 to 1969; rather it was because throughout his entire period of almost 20 years in the parliament he was a constant, tireless, courageous and extremely forceful advocate for a change in our way of thinking towards international trade and our balance of payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert came into the parliament in 1958, at a time when Australia was heavily protectionist. His maiden speech was devoted entirely to Australia's then&mdash;and I might say still&mdash;balance of payments problem. As he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I make no apology for doing this because the problem is vital to our whole economy and it simply must be faced.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not an academic problem.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless we can correct this balance of trade position, our whole economic health will suffer now and our future advancement as a developing nation will slow down.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Bert did not just leave the problem exposed without proposing any solution. He said, again in his maiden speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is of no use my standing up here and prophesying disaster if I cannot make any suggestion.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">His solution was to increase exports by making exporting easier and the key to that was the reduction in tariffs on imported goods because tariffs impose added burdens on exporters. That was said at a time, I repeat, when the whole mind&hyphen;set of the manufacturing sector was for high tariffs as the only way to enable manufacturing in Australia to survive. Fortunately, that mind&hyphen;set has changed dramatically over the ensuing years, thanks to the courageous persistence of Bert Kelly and some like&hyphen;minded public figures, including in particular former Tariff Board chairman Alf Rattigan in the 1960s and 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many years before I entered parliament I spent a couple of years with the Tariff Board as a project officer&mdash;from 1961 to 1963. Bert Kelly's father, Stan Kelly, had been a very notable board member 30 years earlier. But at the time I was at the board as a project officer&mdash;the early 1960s&mdash;the board reflected the views of the very heavily protectionist manufacturing sector. During my two years 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> there I undertook 13 tariff inquiries. On 12 of them I recommended a reduction in tariffs and on the 13th I recommended no change in the existing level. Of course, the only recommendation I ever got up and had accepted by the board in those years was the one for no change in tariffs. So I got rolled monumentally.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I guess that when I came into the parliament at the 1975 election and took my seat in February 1976 I already had a generally similar attitude towards tariffs to Bert. That may well have been because for many years previously I had been an avid reader of his wonderful Modest Member newspaper articles. Those articles have been referred to here and there is no doubt that they came to exert a great influence throughout Australia during the period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Getting to know Bert as a colleague and, as I would like to believe, a friend during his last two years in parliament certainly focused my mind and attitude much more clearly on the essential correctness of Bert's basic position. Like Senator Minchin, I became in many respects a disciple as well. We were by no means the only ones to be so influenced by Bert. Nor was I by any means the first. Several of my colleagues during the late 1970s and early 1980s came increasingly to speak publicly in support of his approach. I think particularly of John Hyde, Jim Carlton, Ross McLean and Murray Sainsbury. There were others as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">After many years a lone voice in the parliamentary wilderness, Bert was no longer alone. Since then, the debate has been won. Many of the implications of that victory have been implemented. The tariff wall has been reduced considerably. As a result, Australia has become a more vigorous, internationally competitive, lower cost producer of high quality goods and services. Our export effort has been enhanced enormously and our living standards have risen. It is absolutely essential that we maintain the direction and that we continue the revolution or perhaps progressive evolution that Bert Kelly, amongst others, was so courageous and successful in igniting. That is the only epitaph that Bert would regard as fitting. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="165">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A couple of years after Bert's departure from parliament, a group of his parliamentary supporters determined to work towards continuing the course on which Bert had been embarked for so many years. As has been mentioned, we formed the Society of Modest Members, with Bert as our patron. That society has continued and grown over the ensuing 15 years or so. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, it has been an important and influential forum for those advocating free market policies as against extensive government regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Bert Kelly as a man was a wonderful fellow. He was very humble. He was a very kind person. As has been said, he was a self-deprecating person. He was always an extremely courteous person. With all those qualities, he added to them great resolve, courage and determination. He had a great wit, and he used it with style and effect in his speeches and writings. I would like to take the liberty of quoting a couple more instances of that wit to those that have already been mentioned today. Bert, after his departure from parliament, was writing an article about the virtues of a good, well-timed question. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For instance, in September 1964, the Government was contemplating imposing a levy on hens. I asked the Minister for Primary Industry, "Is he aware that most of the eggs produced in SA are produced by flocks containing less than 50 birds? Is the levy to be paid on all flocks containing over 20 birds? Will this mean that each flock will have to be counted by an inspector? Will the Minister tell me how this will be done in my case, as most of my fowls live either in the header or in the trees?"</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That broke the House up. I thought Sir Robert Menzies would fall off his chair. But the difficulty exposed in the question led to the scheme's being rethought in a minor way.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is a good example. Perhaps another more significant one is from April 1975, when he asked the following question of Jim Cairns, who was the then short-lived Treasurer. Bert said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My question is directed to the Treasurer. Last week the Treasurer told us about his policy of using deficit financing to lower the present level of unemployment. How is his solution of burying the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> unemployment problem under a mountain of money actually working out? If printing money is a good solution to the unemployment problem why not print more of the stuff and get rid of the unemployment problem altogether?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Jim Cairns came in, took the bait and said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We might do precisely that.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is generally regarded as the start of Jim Cairns's downfall as Treasurer.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There might have been a few other things. He had a go at both sides. I have mentioned the hen levy. The final example I want to mention was mentioned by Senator Hill briefly in his remarks today. This was Bert's question following the win by Van Der Hum in the 1976 Melbourne Cup. After the race, he asked this question of the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, John Howard:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the consistently strong competition from New Zealand, will the Minister see what can be done to put a tariff on New Zealand horses in order to prevent their running faster than our home produced horses?</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Bert then goes on to say in his article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister floundered so much that the Speaker&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">who was Billy Snedden&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">accused him of weighing in light.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">They are some examples of the wit of Bert Kelly, which very much reflect on him as a man. The funeral for him a couple of weeks ago reflected all of that as well. It could not be said to have been a sad occasion. In many ways, it was a happy occasion. It was a real celebration of the life of a charming man who had contributed a great deal to the wellbeing of our nation. Bert Kelly will be very sorely missed, but his spirit will certainly live on very strongly for many years.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My humble offering today celebrates the life of a quite remarkable man. He was one of South Australia's great characters and was certainly one of the icons of Australian primary industries. It is appropriate that we are speaking about Bert Kelly here today during the week of the Outlook conference. Those of us who have attended many of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="166"> Outlook conferences over the years remember very well Bert Kelly wandering around, chatting with people, making sure that everybody had their line right and imparting his usual sense of wit and fun. As the Prime Minister said yesterday, Bert Kelly was a policy trailblazer, he was a trailblazer for freer trade and he worked tirelessly, often faced with formidable hostility. He was always ready to stand up to the pressure from special interest groups, and we have heard some very amusing examples of that here today. Anybody who opposed his very well&hyphen;articulated views in his sometimes quite simple country style could never fail to get the thrust of his message.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">During the years that I worked at the National Farmers Federation, his newspaper columns `Modest Member' and `Modest Farmer' were compulsory reading. He often weighed into the sometimes warm and robust philosophical debate between the National Farmers Federation and some of its community adversaries. You could never be exactly sure who was going to get the compliment, but the columns were required reading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was his status as the icon of primary industries in Australia that led to him being invited to launch one of the National Farmers Federation's first books that detailed the history and current statistical information of Australian primary industries and, since Australia's farming history dates back to the years of Captain Cook, it was decided that the book would be launched on Sydney harbour in the sailing ship <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Endeavour</EMPHASIS>. It was a dreadful day. Bert turned up on time. The editor of the book, Julian Cribb, had caught the wrong aircraft and gone to Melbourne instead of Sydney. There was a storm raging. We piled into the below decks of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New Endeavour</EMPHASIS> and set sail on a very stormy and rocky Sydney harbour, but Bert was undeterred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">He made a great speech. He managed to link in the history of agriculture with Captain Cook and half a dozen other very amusing anecdotes as we all heave&hyphen;hoed. By the time the book was launched, many of us had faces as green as the cover of the book, but Bert was undeterred. He continued regardless.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Soon after my preselection, he came up to my office with a copy of his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economics Made Easy</EMPHASIS>, published in 1981, and said, `Here, read this. If you like it, you can send me some money; if you don't, you can keep it anyway, but never forget what it says.' Last year at the Samuel Griffiths Society dinner, I was honoured to be sitting beside Bert. While he was clearly failing in health, he was nevertheless a very amusing dinner companion that night. I said to him, `Do you have a message for me, Bert? Do you have something that I should remember?' He said, `I'd like to talk to you about political paranoia. There's a lot of it about in the parliament, but just remember, those people who hear footsteps, they're finished.' It was probably the last thing he said to me that night and it has remained very clearly in my mind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have followed his ill health with the sorrow that others have shared today and I was very sorry that committee business in Darwin prevented me from joining the hundreds of people in Adelaide at his funeral. I would like to say my own special thanks to him. He was a very interesting person to talk to. He often brought his pencil scribble up to me in an office to be typed, wherever I happened to be working at the time, and said, `Here, type this. I want 20 copies and get it in the mail tonight.' Sometimes it was 4 o'clock when he came in. Others have said how he dragged things out of his old briefcase with his initials painted in white&mdash;it was like a box of magic tricks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to say, in conclusion, that his wonderfully supportive wife Lorna was a source of inspiration to him and those of us who had met her, albeit briefly, could understand the great partnership they had. She was as entertaining as he was. They were a great partnership and great characters.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Today, through a series of questions, we had some extraordinary answers from the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston) as he tried to explain away his performance with cabinet submissions for the budget last year and how they clearly broke a whole range of promises that he had made on behalf of the coalition before the last election. He tried to explain away that his cabinet submission really should not be taken as his own document, that part of it was written by somebody else. I think he said it was a footpath quote. He said that part of it was not to be considered as a core part of the submission. These are quite extraordinary comments from the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition believes that this has been a standard practice of this minister now for nearly 12 months. Everything he has said on the record about supporting the ABC now has to be taken with a very large grain of salt. There have been misleading comments; there have been deceptive comments made by the minister.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister likes to keep ducking and weaving that he has not actually broken any promises. My own view is that he might have been a lot better off during much of 1996 and even today to have admitted that, yes, he had actually broken a promise.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This drafting is by osmosis. We cannot find out who wrote it, who drafted it, but it turned up in the cabinet office. It got put in the ERC and, no, we do not know who wrote it. The minister has never even bothered to find out apparently, but there is some vague thing that someone else has to be responsible for it. We just find it astonishing that you would say, `This is written by somebody else. I take no responsibility for it.' As I say, it is not the first time

At one stage you said you fell out of your beach chair when you heard something Mr Beazley said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have to say there is another astonishing answer. This minister says, `When I say on election night after we have won the election, it is not an election promise anymore.' I would have thought that it would be even more important. You actually said, `I didn't break the promise about funding.' When questioned by Jim Middleton on that night, the best answer you came up with, rather than admitting and coming clean saying, `The government changed its policy. We broke our promise,' you said, `The euphoria of the occasion meant that I didn't really know what I was saying&mdash;that is, the implication.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Euphoria! Jim Forbes explained his performance one day in the parliament by saying, `It was a bad back,' and that has become a euphemism for alcoholic content. Now Senator Alston's remark about being euphoric&mdash;a description for having a few drinks to celebrate a great election win for the Liberal Party&mdash;was the only answer he gave. He thinks the best answer to justify on election night breaking every promise of funding for the ABC is: `I was euphoric.' There was the euphoria of the occasion; therefore, it can be discounted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You would have thought, if he had been here in the Senate long enough&mdash;and he has been here now over a decade&mdash;even with a few champagnes in him and even with a bit of euphoria around, that he would have said, `That Middleton's asking me a tricky question. I might just let it pass and say, "Speak to me tomorrow."' But, no, not this minister, not this Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate. `Absolutely,' he said, `absolutely, we will meet that commitment.' This is typical of this minister. He tries to use legal

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> has tried to suggest is that somehow we were saying one thing and doing another in terms of $100 million worth of cuts. The fact is that my words were chosen very carefully: `Any suggestion the ABC will have $100 million cut from its budget is an utter fabrication.' I was not asked `Could they?' In fact, the very thing I did not do, as Senator Ray said today, was deny any prospect of it. There may well have been a prospect. I do not think it was ever a high prospect and, as it turned out, it did not get up at all. At the very most it was a prospect, and that is the very thing I did not say.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Paul Daley in his article started off by saying, `We were considering'. Others may well have been considering but I certainly did not say anything to the contrary.

You have to accept responsibility for the detail of your words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The tragic thing is of course that you did not attempt at any stage to demonstrate that the words were wrong. The words I used were right. It was a fabrication to say that the government `would cut'. The government had not made a decision to cut. With two weeks to go, it considered the matter and rejected it. It had not made a decision. So the words are perfectly accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did maintain current levels of funding. I have said it many times. The fact is that none of this is, in any shape or form, a new contribution to the debate. You are going through the motions because you somehow think that you had better give this a run because there is not much else around. The fact is that at no stage did I say in the submission that I was in favour of a $100 million cut, a $25 million cut, a $55 million cut or a $50 million cut. I was simply asked to bring two options forward.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, paragraph 2 of the submission. You could not get much higher up than that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The critical issue that you seem to be a bit excited about today is what is on the cover sheet? That is what you are excited about. Let us address that. You have not attempted to argue that in fact the cover sheet is right. That is what it is all about. Is the cover sheet right or not? In other words, is option 1 a breach of an election commitment? Well, it is not, so therefore that is wrong. I have said that to you time and again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us worry about whether or not there was a breach of an election commitment. That is what you seem to be keen on establishing&mdash;that we breached our election commitments. I have told you time and again. Option 1 did not constitute a breach of an election commitment and you have not managed to demonstrate that it did. Ipso facto, that statement is wrong. That is all we are concerned about, and the outcome was very much to the benefit of the ABC because they did not suffer an immediate cut of $125 million. What they incurred was a reduction of $55 million in the next financial year&mdash;perfectly consistent with our commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me just say this to you: if you get excited about what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> had to say, at 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="172"> least you should have referred to what the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> said on Friday, 31 January. Mike Richards in his column said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Beyond the report itself, there has been considerable media discussion about the recently leaked Cabinet submission from July last year by the Communications Minister, Senator Richard Alston, in which he canvassed savings options for the ABC. Much of the discussion has focused on Senator Alston's statement on 23 June last year that `any suggestion the ABC will have $100 million cut from its budget is an utter fabrication' and the fact that, less than 10 days later, he took to Cabinet a submission that contemplated a $125.6 million cut.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not see anything particularly sinister about the submission itself, especially in light of the fact that Senator Alston explicitly supported the option involving significantly less savings&mdash;option one ($51.4 million in 1997&hyphen;98) over option two ($125.6 million one year earlier, in 1996&hyphen;97).</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He was proved right&mdash;given that the Cabinet outcome was a $55 million savings target for 1997&hyphen;98.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What should be borne in mind is that Senator Alston succeeded in an environment . . . Treasury also seemed attracted to the idea of advertising and sponsorship on the ABC . . . So, far from being pilloried, with those sharks in the water, Senator Alston ought to be congratulated.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am the last one to want to seek praise from those who offer it, but where it is put there, after calmly reflecting on all the evidence&mdash;in other words, from someone who actually read the submission, weighed it up and understood the implications of it, which were that at all times I argued for a review, I did not argue for costs and I was requested to bring forward two options, which I did&mdash;how can you then turn around and say that somehow I was in favour of big budget cuts? You cannot.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you then address the issue of whether or not we breached election commitments, again it is perfectly clear from option 1 that it is not a breach and it is clear from option 2 that it would be a breach. You are so intellectually lazy that you have not even bothered to analyse it. All you have tried to do is run off the cover sheet. In other words, you are not interested in getting inside the document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The submission itself, couched in the first person, is all in aid of the proposition that 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> option 1 or option 2 are under consideration. Spelling it out, on its face, option 1 is not a breach. Game, set and match! Who is interested? What you are interested in is whether there has been a breach of an election commitment. There has not been and you have not even attempted to make out your case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If someone else has a contrary opinion&mdash;and I suppose you are all entitled to your opinion in a democracy&mdash;then you have got it wrong if you argued that that is a breach, because the facts do not support it. That is the position that we ended up with. That is why people like Mike Richards and everyone else, except those to whom this document was leaked just before Mansfield's report&mdash;in order to sabotage it, no doubt&mdash;understand that there is absolutely nothing in this whole campaign that you are trying to run to disguise the fact that you have not even got a position on the issue.</PARA>

There was a rather good saying that went around the old Parliament House that went: `If you want to know whether it is a conspiracy or a stuff&hyphen;up, then 99 times out of 100 it will be a stuff&hyphen;up.' In general, that is about right, but the government's treatment of the ABC is a really interesting tale so we should have a look at it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mansfield review into the ABC was announced on 16 July last year, immediately prior to the release of the coalition government's first budget&mdash;we all remember that. The budget announcement of massive cutbacks to the ABC came as a shock to the Australian community, including to me. It came as a great shock to me and to most members of the Australian community when the coalition, which said it was not going to reduce funding to the ABC&mdash;in fact, promised it was not going to reduce funding to the ABC&mdash;did in fact make massive cuts to the ABC in the last budget and announced further ones.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The promise was made in the coalition policy statement Better Broadcasting and by Senator Alston himself in the famous interview with Jim Middleton on 2 March that we have heard so much about. In that interview he was asked, `Do you maintain your commitment to the ABC continuing real funding over the life of this parliament?' to which Senator Alston replied, `Absolutely'&mdash;which obviously does not mean absolutely. When Mr Middleton came back with, `What if you find out that the budget is much worse?' Senator Alston replied, `John Howard has made it clear that we are honouring all our commitments'&mdash;which obviously does not mean they would honour all their commitments.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It soon became very obvious that the coalition did not care about keeping its promises, about misleading the Australian people or about maintaining funding to the ABC. But was this merely about the coalition breaking promises or did they actually have a grand plan for the ABC? Those of us who have watched <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> will know what a grand plan is all about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it looks like to us is that the coalition government well and truly had designs on the ABC from a long time ago. Those designs were disguised by the Mansfield review, which was announced, as we said, in July last year. But they had been decided on much earlier. If we look at the cabinet submission tabled before 16 July 1996, when Mr Mansfield was asked to do his review, and if we have a look at the Warwick Smith letters dating back to 1991, we will see exactly what was going on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Mansfield review terms of reference, which guided submissions and provided the framework for Mr Mansfield to carry out his review, did not hide the government's true agenda for the ABC. In fact, they sought a `redefined role for the ABC . . . by narrowing the scope of current ABC services and activities'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review was allowed to take into account technological advancement in the provision of broadcasting services, but it was not allowed to recommend that the ABC be provided with stable funding or with extra funding to enable it to upgrade to digital technology or to provide the types of services which it currently does. The `need for consistency between the cost of future ABC operations and the government's broader fiscal strategy of achieving significant reductions' was ultimately the only consideration for the Mansfield review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why do I say that? It all has to do with a profusely bleeding vein that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> journalist Laura Tingle has so effectively tapped into. On 24 January 1997, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper printed extracts from a cabinet submission which quite clearly outlined the government's agenda for the ABC. That agenda was to decimate the ABC through massive budget cuts. But the cabinet submission contained 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="174"> more. It stated that simply reducing the ABC's budget to $135 million by the year 1999 would create such a public backlash that it could not be the preferred option.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">No. To convince the public that the ABC's roles and functions should be limited would most convincingly come through an independent&mdash;and I use that term cautiously&mdash;review into the ABC undertaken by an eminent person with the full support of the incoming chair of the ABC board. The secretarial support for the review&mdash;not open, not public, not operating in an extremely tight time frame&mdash;would be provided by the Department of Communications and the Arts just to ensure that the flavour and content of the cabinet submission could be translated into the final report&mdash;just in case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does not matter that one year earlier in 1995 the chair of the Senate select committee into ABC management and operations, Senator Alston himself, found the ABC to be a sound organisation, an organisation whose funding should be maintained through triennial arrangements, and an organisation which should remain free from the so-called efficiency dividend. I do not know who invented that name. The ABC is now subject to annual funding. It is not guaranteed and it is not maintained at levels which enable the ABC to plan effectively and to deliver its services efficiently. It is also now subject to the dreaded efficiency dividend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government says that the ABC must incur these costs due to the size of its massive budget. But does it? Let us look. The ABC currently has a budget of about $500 million. Mr Mansfield, without even questioning that figure, suggests it is enough to operate a national broadcaster. But $500 million is about 0.4 per cent of the budget; it is about four-tenths of one per cent of the budget. Why then is the ABC being so concertedly singled out to meet the government's fiscal strategy? And it certainly is.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What it looks very much like is that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Senator Alston), the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and many cabinet ministers actually loathe the ABC. What the government is doing to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ABC has nothing to do with proper, logically constructed or clearly articulated public policy. It has nothing to do with budget deficit reduction. It has to do with the ministers' hatred of the ABC. It has to do with the government having no power, except under funding, to direct the ABC in the way in which it fulfils its functions&mdash;for example, on whether it will show the gay mardi gras&mdash;and the way in which it carries out its daily programming.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The leaked cabinet submission clearly articulated the government's agenda for the ABC. That was to reduce its funding, to disable it from performing the functions and deliver the services required of it under the current charter. It is staggering to watch the arrogance of a government threatening the ABC board with further and larger cuts to its budget if it does not immediately implement the recommendations of the Mansfield review to sell off its real estate, to outsource the majority of its production and to divest Radio Australia and sell off Australia Television. It looks very much like a collective ministerial personal vendetta.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But selling ATV and getting rid of Radio Australia will have disastrous effects on Australia's overseas reputation. Already countries in the Asia&hyphen;Pacific region are lobbying Australia not to rid itself of Radio Australia. In fact, we have just heard that the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Julius Chan, has offered to pay the Australian government one million kina per annum to keep that service operating. That is nearly a million Australian dollars. It is an extraordinary offer from a country that has a budget like Papua New Guinea's.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Evidently, our minister, though, is also strongly supportive of the changes to the ABC charter as proposed by the Mansfield review. I say `proposed' because the report did not actually recommend that the charter be changed. Of course, the ABC charter can only be amended, can only be changed, by this parliament, by a vote of both houses of this parliament. The minister, in his haste to instruct the ABC board, has stated that the proposed charter `should set the course the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="175"> ABC will be required to follow in exchange for ongoing funding'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are we really surprised about this? The proposed charter recommended at attachment B in the leaked cabinet submission is exactly the same as the charter proposed by Mr Mansfield in his review. Is that a coincidence? I will let other senators decide whether they think that is a coincidence. It does not look like one to me, though.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me finish with a warning. Targeting the ABC will prove to be the most politically unwise move that this government has ever made. The Australian community loves the ABC. It is our ABC; it is not the government's ABC. It is all Australians' ABC. Australians want the ABC to grow. The Australian people will vote for that at the next election.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> There is no doubt that the coalition has, both in opposition, and now in government, been embarking on a course to get stuck into the ABC. We all recall the famous Fightback policy that the previous leader John Hewson took to the 1993 election which was going to rip $50 million out of the ABC's budget. Remember that&mdash;$50 million? Of course, after being resoundingly defeated in 1993, the coalition told us that they had thrown out 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Fightback, that it had all been ditched and that they were embarking on new policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Then we came to the Senate select committee in 1994, which reported in March 1995, which was chaired by none other than Senator Alston.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="CONROY" NAMEID="3L6">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3L6">Senator Conroy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who was that?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="656">Senator FORSHAW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston. That committee, which was set up at the instigation of Senator Alston and supported by the Democrats and the Greens, certainly had a purpose as far as the coalition was concerned to once again get stuck into the ABC, to attack the ABC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Senator Alston was unable to come up with the evidence in the committee deliberations to carry out what he really wanted to do, what the coalition really wanted to do&mdash;to strip the ABC of many of its functions, try to politically direct its operations and, of course, reduce its funding. Faced with an inability to get stuck into the ABC in that way because of overwhelming support throughout the community for the ABC&mdash;once again recently witnessed in the Mansfield report&mdash;Senator Alston was forced to grudgingly accept the importance and the great record of the ABC but, more importantly, was forced to recognise that its funding should not be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to remind the Senate of what Senator Alston, who was the then shadow spokesperson on communications policy and the chairman of that committee which presented that report, said about ABC funding. When we recall what was said in that report only a couple of years ago and then look at what has transpired since, we see the real hypocrisy of this government. Firstly, Senator Alston at that time supported triennial funding. The committee report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of triennial funding has been to provide the ABC with stable and predictable funding over the last seven years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All major political parties support the triennial funding initiative.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The committee also went on to talk about the fact that the ABC was exempt from the efficiency dividend that all other departments were required to meet. Obviously, that exemp 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="176"> tion meant that the ABC was able to maintain its real funding by not having to meet that efficiency dividend requirement. I quote again from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continued exemption from the efficiency dividend helps provide greater planning certainty for the ABC's capital works program and is therefore supported by the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I also quote what Senator Alston's report said about new initiatives of the ABC:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee therefore recommends that where the Parliament requires the ABC to undertake new Charter activities or to expand existing Charter activities, it should provide funds sufficient to ensure that existing activities are not adversely affected.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Those comments were made with particular relevance to the operations of ATV and of pay TV initiatives. Senator Alston was calling upon the then government to provide additional funds, if the ABC needed it, so that it would not have to dip into its overall budget expenditure. In its conclusion on funding, the committee&mdash;chaired by Senator Alston&mdash;said this:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABC needs surety of continued funding in order to provide the range of services expected under its statutory obligations. It is therefore incumbent on both the ABC and Government to make very clear their intentions and requirements so as to ensure that all activities are undertaken on the basis of complete transparency and full accountability, without any diversion of funds from the Charter activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee supports the maintenance of ABC funding at least at its current level, the continuation of the triennial funding arrangements and the continued application of the Non-Farm GDP deflator.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That was what was in Senator Alston's own report. Those recommendations were supported by all the parties represented in this Senate&mdash;the Democrats, the Greens and the Labor Party&mdash;even though we put in a dissenting report with respect to other matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I remind the Senate that Senator Alston's words were that `the committee supports the maintenance of ABC funding at least at its current level.' That is not very much different from the statement that Senator Alston made on election night in response to questions from Jim Middleton, when he said very clearly, as has been quoted by other speakers, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that the coalition was going to maintain current funding absolutely; but of course they did not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition came back with a budget which ripped $55 million out of the ABC's funds in its first year of this new triennium; secondly, they removed the exemption from the efficiency dividend which has gone for all time&mdash;at least under this current government, as we understand it&mdash;and, thirdly, they suspended triennial funding pending the review by Mr Mansfield. Yet this minister tries to argue that that was not a breach of an election promise and that somehow the words `current funding' only applied for the period between March and the end of June 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister knows, we know, and every single person in this country knows that that promise related to funding levels for the term of this parliament, not just for the last three or four months of the previous triennium. When a minister stoops to that sort of manipulation of words, that sort of sophistry, then, frankly, he is not entitled to remain a minister. If he is going to try to argue that a promise solemnly made by him and by the Prime Minister, but now broken, is totally consistent with what he had said only a few months before in his own report then, frankly, this minister is a disgrace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The truth is now out. The cabinet did look at a proposal for a reduction in ABC funding of some $135 million. The minister comes back and says, `What a success!' He only had one arm of the ABC chopped off by the cabinet rather than two because they only took $55 million out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The coalition was hoping that the Mansfield report would come in and give them the okay to slash it even further and to do what they wanted to do as defined in those terms of reference. They wanted the ABC to have a redefined role and to have a narrower focus and have it get out of its international activities such as through Radio Australia and ATV. That is what they really wanted but at least in those aspects of the general propositions, although not in respect of Radio Australia, the Mansfield report did not deliver what this government wanted. Unfortunately, it did with respect to Radio Australia because 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="177"> Mr Mansfield had riding instructions, which were, `When you do your inquiry remember that we are already committed to ripping $55 million off ABC funding.

The truth of this matter is very simple: Senator Alston went into cabinet arguing to maintain the funding of the ALP for the current funding triennium and he succeeded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, of course, there you have Senator Schacht thinking he is Michael Jordan. He has all these cartoon characters running around with him&mdash;you are probably Daffy Duck over there, Senator Forshaw. He has all these cartoon characters running around inside his head and what he comes up with is that there is some sort of conspiracy.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is the claim: that there is some sort of conspiracy between Senator Alston arguing to maintain the funding of the ABC for the funding triennium and the creation of the Mansfield report. The Mansfield report, you see, is some sort of secret device to cut the funding of the ABC. This is the argument from the other side. Look, that may well have been how politics was conducted in the cabinets of Mr Hawke and Mr Keating, that may well have been the way in which those opposite were schooled in public administration, but that is not the purpose of the Mansfield inquiry. It has been stated so many times in this chamber that I would have thought even those opposite would understand that the purpose of the Mansfield inquiry is to ensure that the ABC meets the expectations of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Mansfield has made it perfectly clear that he believes that the role of the ABC is to ensure that the public's expectations about the importance of domestic free to air broadcasting are given a high priority. That is what Mr Mansfield has said; that is what the public believes. Mr Mansfield has argued in the public fora that he believes that the role of the ABC, especially in providing news and current affairs, and services to children, youth and regional audiences, is very, very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Yet, in spite of all these things that have been said, those opposite still want to find a conspiracy. The truth is&mdash;and I want those opposite to listen very carefully to this&mdash;that the ABC should not be above review, just like any other government department. It should not be above review, like organisations outside the government. Those of us involved in the private sector know very well that a well run private sector organisation is constantly under review. Yet the ABC and some senators opposite seem to think that it is some sort of terrible slight on the ABC that it should be subject to review. Every government operation should be subject to regular review. The ABC is no different and that is what this is about. More than anything else, it is contrary to the truth.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">It is all very well for the Democrats to claim that the ABC is being reduced by funding. This government has to make tough decisions about priorities right across the board in the running of this country, providing money for many different worthwhile projects. It is no good for the running of this country if, to make oneself feel good, one says that the ABC will get another $100, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation will get another $50 million, et cetera. Once one goes through that list, sane economic management of this country will come to an end. In the end there will be no money for anybody because the economy will be wrecked.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The quote goes on to say that you need `sound economic management so that the ABC can get a reasonable share and so that many other organisations, just as worthy as the ABC, can keep their place in the sun, too'. The person went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">There is a case to be made for governing the country on a balance of priorities.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That happens to have been Senator Schacht speaking on 24 February 1988 saying a very sensible thing: that you need to balance priorities; that if there are to be budget cuts they have to be spread across the board. We have Senator Bourne coming in here braying about some conspiracy theory&mdash;that it is our attempt to undermine the ABC. In fact, when the Labor Party in the same situation had to look at bringing the budget into balance&mdash;and they did not do it very well; in fact, they were appalling at it&mdash;and were trying to face that issue, they too had to address the fact that the cuts had to be taken fairly and squarely across all programs and that one group should not take an unfair and undue share of the burden.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Evans&mdash;or as he was then, Senator Evans&mdash;in the same year, speaking to the ABC Friday Club, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">While there has been some decline in funding for the ABC over the past two Budgets, as compared with the peak year of 1985&hyphen;6 . . . this does not reflect any loss of affection for the ABC or any decision to squeeze it harder than anyone else&mdash;the absence of new policy approvals has been a function of the pressure which has been applied universally to government departments and agencies.  
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">  </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is amazing how the people on the other side had some road to Damascus conversion when they lost the election&mdash;so that suddenly anything we have to do to reduce funding is seen as a conspiracy; that we should not be cutting the budget in any sort of way; that suddenly they have changed their tune. Well, what you say in this place comes home to haunt you. And Senator Schacht has outlined the reasons why they had to cut funding to the ABC and also why they had to do it across the board to a number of programs. I have read from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>  how the government of the day justified that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What staggers me is that in the first question time back after the Christmas break the opposition spent the whole of the time on whether the front page of a cabinet submission agreed with the inside page. I might have understood why they were carrying on if the second option in that cabinet submission had been addressed. But I fail to understand, given that the first option was chosen, why they have gone on, because the first option was in fact in line with our election commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They spent the whole of question time on it and, when they had an opportunity to take note of ministers' answers, they spent the whole of that half&hyphen;hour on this issue. Then, when they had a chance to address an issue of public importance, they spent the whole afternoon debating the issue all over again. So the only thing, other than the condolence motion, that has been dealt with in this chamber today has been Senator Alston's cabinet submission&mdash;the front page versus the other pages. I just find it staggering.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I did not have to be convinced but it confirms the reasons why they are sitting on the other side, why the Australian public decided to put them over there. It was obvious that they got no clue and no idea about&mdash;and no interest in&mdash;the whole of government. They have no interest in the economy; they focus on this little aspect of a government Cabinet submission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> Nothing misleading or deceptive has been done or said. Contrary to what Senator Schacht said or might think, there was nothing misleading or deceptive about the budget 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="180"> cuts to the ABC that the government announced last year. We said that we would maintain the funding for that triennium, and we have done so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Had the people on the other side been more honest about the budgetary situation&mdash;and last week we saw Mr Costello display the sort of honesty that we should have expected from them&mdash;and had they done the same thing and put Australia in the picture, then it would have been clear to Senator Alston and to all of us before the election what some of the things were that had to be done. But we were led along, like the Australian public, to believe that the budget was going to be balanced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So, of course, our policies were designed on that basis. But we found that we had Beazley's black hole. We found that we had $10 billion that was not accounted for. And we did not have that honesty, that decency that the Australian people expect and that we are getting from this government, of an honest approach to the handling of Australia's financial affairs. And this is what has led to this.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">International trade and investment is now much more important to Australia's well&hyphen;being.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1995, our exports of goods and services amounted to 15 per cent of GDP. In 1985 it was only 10 per cent. The government will work to increase net exports with consequent benefits both in terms of jobs and national income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And international trade is not the sole domain of large firms. There are increasing numbers of small and medium&hyphen;sized businesses participating in overseas markets, particularly in the services sector. More than 4,500 small and medium&hyphen;sized Australian enterprises are actively engaged in export markets. They generate about 6.5 billion dollars a year in international turnover. Their pivotal role in job creation makes the further improvement of their international competitiveness imperative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trade is more important, too, for sectors which, in days gone by, were sheltered and could not venture beyond domestic borders. This is shown in our exports of elaborately&hyphen;transformed goods. In fact, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they have been the fastest growing component of our exports, to the extent that they now account for 24 per cent of total merchandise exports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Australia's place in the world economy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">World markets have never been more competitive or more exciting, and our strategy for operating in this environment recognises that Australia has unique interests. We are unique in being a developed country with a strong comparative advantage in the rural and mining industries, but with manufactures and in particular the services sector rapidly becoming more competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our economic integration with Asia is continuing apace. Twelve of our top twenty export markets are in that region. Together, these twelve account for 62 per cent of our merchandise exports. This also sets us apart from other economies. The export growth rates to these markets are pleasing. For example, in 1995&hyphen;96 our merchandise exports to China grew by 28 per cent, those to Korea by 26 per cent and to Indonesia by 32 per cent. The picture for services exports is equally encouraging. In 1994&hyphen;95 they grew by 32 per cent to Indonesia, 31 per cent to Thailand and by 23 per cent to Singapore. Through our more targeted trade policy we will be able to build on these results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of our top export markets also have high economic growth rates. This will in itself lead to further opportunities for Australian firms, but other suppliers are working hard to achieve sales in these markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased that Australian businesses have been particularly active in successfully penetrating the region's highly competitive markets&mdash;markets which collectively are around twice the size of the rest of the world's markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But as I have said previously, while Asia is an important market for Australia, we are a global trader and consequently should not lose sight of market opportunities elsewhere. In 1996 for example South Africa was one of our fastest growing markets, with exports increasing by 37 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have designated 1997 as the Year of South Asia because of the exciting developments now occurring in that market. As elsewhere, continuing deregulation is opening up opportunities for Australian exporters. It is up to Australian traders to grasp these opportunities, but the government will do its share to help them identify and access new markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An example of this is the Australia India&mdash;New Horizons promotion. It has the core objective of building stronger trade and commercial ties with India. We will be examining closely the results of this campaign in terms of increased exports.

Many people have concerns about what happens when you have an increased consumer confidence and how many of the items that you buy even in food, footwear and clothing shops are not made locally.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I was on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade involved with this report on the implications of services exports to Indonesia and Hong Kong. Honourable senators might note that there is a very brief qualifying statement by me at the back which relates to some of my concerns, largely about the information that was available&mdash;some of those issues have been dealt with in the report but I needed to emphasise them&mdash;but also in relation to the political ramifications, which the committee really did not get to hear.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have liked to have had some political analysis of Australia and Australia's involvement with Indonesia and the likelihood of that changing in a post&hyphen;Suharto environment, but it was not considered to be a priority of the committee. I think that is sad considering that there will be many things that we ought to understand about Australia's political and social relationships with countries like Indonesia and, of course, with China. In my opinion, that was a shortfall with this inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would also like to mention some issues that came along the way. There is an assumption that export of service industries like education and health is necessarily a benefit. I would like to give some examples where there may be problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Educational institutions like universities become reliant on the export dollar. We have heard in budget speeches that basically the funding for universities will more and more rely on their ability to attract funding from other sources, including private funding. A lot of that means their ability to export services. So, instead of that being the ability for the universities to provide more services, sometimes there is a great danger that the tail will wag the dog&mdash;that is, the universities have no other source of extra funding. They find funding through export of their services and, when that is achieved, the federal government then uses that as the excuse to pull funding away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the end, those institutions become dependent on finding more and more funding through those sources. It could be private funding, it could be export funding. But then you have the problem of what happens when you are reliant on those export dollars. People have paid a lot of money and they expect to pass. What happens to the standards and the way you design those courses and, indeed, does the tail wag the dog in terms of the educational institutions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another, perhaps even more worrying, concern is in relation to health. You have the same sort of situation; that is, hospitals finding that they need to find sources of income through exporting of their services, attracting people for instance to come to 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="186"> Australia for quite complex operations that they cannot easily obtain in their own country. Once again you end up with a lot of the infrastructure of that hospital being geared towards attracting that export income.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it is a small concern. It is extremely important if we see hospital wards closed for patients who are in need, but we have resources brought into the hospital to try to attract export income from quite wealthy patrons overseas, to bring that trade to Australia. Once again, as soon as that funding seems to be attracted, that is the excuse for this current government to pull government funding out of that resource.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it is a very important issue and we have not yet addressed it. Maybe that is something we are going to have to come back to in the future. It is not just about exports and imports in the internationalisation of trade; it is about the interaction of internationalisation with privatisation policies and competition policy. My feeling is that inevitably we are going to have huge ethical problems and problems within the services of providing the kinds of services we really need and continuing to have a situation where the commercial prerogatives may become more important to an institution than the provision of health services and, in particular, the provision of preventive health services and those things within the community. So we might end up with crisis care or an export sector but a very poor health sector, because of the way the dollar is going. Because preventive health and community health are not necessarily immediately seen to be of benefit they are getting their funding taken away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those are some of my considerable concerns in relation to the inquiry and in relation to the kinds of messages we are getting. I am very sorry that I seem to be one of the few people on the committee who have those concerns but I do hope that those issues are brought up more often in the future and that it will not just be someone from the Greens who is interested in pursuing them. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Senate concerning the Western Australian Commission on Government, together with related documents.</PARA></TALK.START></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thank the Senate. The Commission on Government inquiry into the prevention of corrupt, illegal or improper conduct in the Western Australian public sector and by politicians concluded that major changes were necessary to the structure of government. The Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters showed that the substantial misuse of public funds during the 1980s was not solely the result of improper conduct by elected and appointed officials. It was also the consequence of a governmental system which, to read from the Commission on Government report No. 5:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . had three broad defects: the Parliament and the public were systematically denied detailed information about the conduct of government; procedures for holding governments, ministers and officials accountable for their actions were either non&hyphen;existent or ineffective; and there was no clear and authoritative statement of the functions, duties or responsibilities of the key office holders of executive power in this State.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This also was the opinion of the Western Australian Royal Commission. In part II of its report it set out a series of criticisms of the operation of government and recommended the creation of a commission on government to consider that in detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In its reports, the Commission on Government rejected the Court government's persistent argument that the excesses of the state government in the 1980s were simply the result of bad men and bad women who held office during the period. In its final report the commission argued that the whole point of a well structured system of government is to limit the damage that improper or reckless conduct by politicians and officials can inflict on the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A system of government that is open and accountable to the people requires rules and structures that are designed explicitly to prevent corrupt, illegal and improper conduct. Much of the blame for the extent of the damage to the finances and reputation of government in Western Australia during the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="188"> 1980s must be laid at the feet of a system of government that failed to prevent such events.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commission on Government, in its consideration of the 24 specified matters referred to them by the parliament, restated the findings of the royal commission and found that changes to the operation of the public sector to prevent a recurrence of the abuses of the 1980s were vital to the proper operation of the public sector. Establishing a system of government in a public sector that operates correctly is essential to safeguard the public interest. What is required is a structure of government that is open to scrutiny. Public officials must know that their conduct may be judged by the public. Lines of accountability need to be clearly set out so that every official knows the nature and scope of his or her responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Parliament is the central element in maintaining the accountability of the public sector to the people. The lines of administrative accountability of government departments and agencies is through ministers who are answerable to parliament. In addition, parliament supervises the operation of the public sector through its control over legislation, finance and the monitoring activities of its officers and committees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Many of the recommendations by the Commission on Government were designed to enhance parliamentary scrutiny of the administrative activities of the public sector. This scrutiny has the goal of preventing corrupt, illegal or improper conduct both directly by supervising the activities of government and indirectly by providing the public with information on which political judgments can be made. According to the reports and recommendations of both the royal commission and the Commission on Government, in its failure to implement vital changes which were recommended, the government would continue to put the system and the safeguard of the public interest at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is an unacceptable situation which I, as a representative of the people of Western Australia in the Senate, and the newly elected Australian Democrats in the Legislative Council of Western Australia will be fighting to rectify. Our new MLCs will be introducing 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> legislation in the Legislative Council after 22 May in an attempt to implement the Commission on Government recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Australian Democrats view and take the accountability of government to the people very seriously. It is a fundamental element of our system of government which must be in place for democracy to work. The Court government must stop regarding accountability to the people of Western Australia as an optional extra to which they only arrive when they are forced to. They must begin a legislative program introducing the recommendations of its own Commission on Government. I thank the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;This morning in the debate on the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996, I made the point that this legislation would come back and bite the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) where it hurts him most, which is on his credibility. I think it has done that already. We have seen this afternoon an incident where a minister came into this parliament after months of this bill being on our <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper </EMPHASIS> and having been debated&mdash;this is its second time around&mdash;and said, `On the fundamental point of whether the government had the power to do what we wanted to do with this legislation, we did not seek legal advice. We did not go to the Attorney-General's Department and ask them whether we had the power to act in the way that we have purported to act in this legislation.' Nothing could be more incompetent than a government taking a measure so far down the track without knowing the legal validity of what it was doing; that is, without knowing why and how they were acting and under what power of the constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Consider the fact also that not just this side of parliament has made the point that was 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> made earlier. Some six judges of the High Court of Australia over 13 or 14 years have all made the same point. This point has not come out of the dark. It has been on the public agenda for quite some time. You would have thought that any competent government attempting to legislate in the way that they have would have taken legal advice quite some time ago. That is why I say that this is a great symbol of the incompetence of not just this minister but this administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It confirms our view that the government's advice this morning and for the last few months was inadequate. It confirms our view that the government had taken the wrong approach. It also confirms our fear that this government had embarked upon a political exercise without having done its homework. It was not concerned about rights or legal proprieties or what was constitutionally valid. From day one when it came into power, it was concerned about using the Aboriginal community of Australia as a political football. That was exposed even more by its opposition to accepting the amendment that we moved on this bill. It was an amendment that would make this bill subject to the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act. It is the same amendment which Minister Ruddock accepted for the social security legislation. This government would not give the same protection to Aboriginal Australians that this parliament has given to migrant Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This has been a political exercise. This has been manipulated by all the Prime Minister's men who are hidden in a bunker in the office of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)&mdash;Mr Morris and Mr O'Leary. Poor Senator Herron is the bunny. I am making this point because this government, in particular, has used this issue as a political point and it has been sprung at this last moment. As I say, that is not a novel point, it is not a new one; it has been on the agenda for some time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our view is&mdash;I have put this to Senator Herron both publicly and privately and I will put it to whichever government member wants to discuss it&mdash;that if you want to build the bridge, you do not have to legislate. It is quite apparent from the evidence that Senator Herron gave to the Legal and Constitutional 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="190"> Committee that you do not have to legislate. It is quite apparent from the advice that the Chapmans are getting from their lawyer, Mr Palyga, that you do not have to legislate. So why this legislation? Because you want to string out a sleazy little political game. That is the only purpose of it and you have been trapped. This exposes the incompetence of the minister and of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This decision was taken by cabinet. We know how cabinet processes run&mdash;we know how they should run. When you put up a submission to cabinet, you normally read it, unlike Senator Alston, and there is normally input from other offices, in particular, from the Prime Minister's office. Where was the advice from the Attorney&hyphen;General (Mr Williams) and from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department on this particularly critical matter? This minister, in a sense, has been hung out to dry because the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department did not do their work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where were the comments of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet? What was their advice on this particular issue? Why did they not pick it up? They have an indigenous peoples section in that department. This probably would not have happened under the previous Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet secretaries Codd and Keating, but it has happened under Mr Max Moore&hyphen;Wilton, a person who has been dragged out of the private sector with absolutely no background knowledge in terms of general social policy and machinery of government issues. Let us face it: the person who has got to take the rap for this is the minister himself. It is his responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about legislation which the government was prepared to go to the wire on. It views it as a great political issue. It tried to prop it through the media in South Australia and tried to paint the opposition and other parties in the Senate as being obstructionist to development. Six judges, including Chief Justice Brennan and Justice Stephen, who went on to become Governor&hyphen;General, all raise that particular point. The point is that, under the constitution, particularly when it relates to Aboriginal Australians, you cannot just legislate; you have to `legislate for the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> benefit of'. That is why that referendum was carried in 1967. The people of Australia did not carry that referendum to empower governments to discriminate against Aboriginal Australians; it empowered governments to take special measures and steps to benefit Aboriginal Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it was an easy way out, Senator Herron. You will probably come back with advice from Attorney&hyphen;General's Department saying this, that and the other&mdash;that it is not discrimination, whatever. You will be trying to argue that black is white and white is black. I say to you, when you go to them to ask for advice on that fundamental constitutional point, firstly, you should ask them why you did not get it before and, secondly, you should say to them, `What is wrong with that other avenue that has been suggested by the opposition and by others to the government? Do we need this legislation?' I think, if they were being honest, they would say, `You don't.'</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has just been called, there are three bills here: the Customs Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996, the Import Processing Charges Bill 1996 and the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Bill 1996. All three bills are being debated cognately, that is to say, at the same time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reason for these bills coming forward to this chamber is that in the budget the government announced a cost recovery regime that would apply in the case of customs charges and the bills together implement that cost recovery regime. They involve the imposition of 13 fees and charges for import related services delivered by the Australian Customs Service. Each of those fees and charges, and to what they refer, are outlined in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies these bills. I will not go into that in any detail, but they are there for the record.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The opposition broadly supports the idea of cost recovery, but I say broadly because in the case of these bills, which could be termed cost recovery bills, we will be seeking some amendments because there are important considerations in the application of the principle of cost recovery. We think these bills can be improved by the amendments that we will later move.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our concerns, and the reason we will be putting forward amendments, are on behalf of Australian small business and on behalf of regional Australia&mdash;in particular, regional ports where small customs agents operate who currently enjoy a regime of no charges. They will be faced with quite significant new charges, particularly in small ports like Launceston and Hobart in Tasmania, or Bunbury and Geraldton in my own state of Western Australia. In those sorts of ports, where the traffic of goods necessitating customs charges is quite small, the normal thing is to find that customs depots too are quite small. They are usually diversified businesses and small businesses. The new fee that is being imposed 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> involves for customs depots' licensing charges an increase from zero to $4,000 for these small businesses each year plus, in the initial year, a $1,000 up&hyphen;front charge&mdash;that is to say in the first year $5,000 and in subsequent years $4,000 thereafter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a new entrant were to seek to become a customs depot then the licensing charge upon the passage of this bill would be $3,000 up&hyphen;front and $4,000 each year&mdash;a cost of $7,000.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="PARER" NAMEID="KI4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A big depot?</PARA></TALK.START></INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A big depot? Let me accept that interjection from the minister. Nonetheless, from zero it is a significant hike in charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Our concern here is, as I have said, for the small businesses that operate in this field. There have been a number of them that have written to the minister on this subject. Some of them have favoured us with copies of their correspondence to the minister and indeed we have received some correspondence ourselves as well. One has to remember that this is a government that came to power claiming to have a mandate to represent the interests of small business. The type of correspondence that I see on this subject reflects a concern by small business that the government is not representing their interests, and that it is imposing, with little notice and out of the blue, quite significant&mdash;for them&mdash;charges that they will have to meet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One also has to consider that on Monday of this week it was reported in the media that in the December quarter 1996 Australia suffered a record number of bankruptcies, many of which involved small businesses. It was, I think, reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics last thing on Friday. That record number of bankruptcies reflects the flat economic conditions that are currently applying in Australia, whereas we have seen in the mid&hyphen;term review of the budget released last week that the forecast of economic growth remains unrevised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most private sector economists believe it to be heroic and that the growth in the economy will not be 3.5 per cent over the year but more likely 3 per cent or lower and that 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="193"> unemployment will increase on the budget estimates from last August. Again, according to a survey conducted of consulting economists in the private sector by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper, that figure too is heroic and unemployment is likely to top nine per cent by the middle of the year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, small business is a major employer and growth in small business is immediately translated into jobs. So it is against the background of a very flat economy&mdash;an economy in relation to which, at the time of the budget when the government decided on these charges, the government had stronger views about economic growth than the now revised figures show is likely to occur&mdash;that I think some review of the immediate impact on these charges ought to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is, of course, another concern. That is, if small businesses in regional Australia were to close as a consequence of these sorts of charges, obviously access by regional companies to goods coming through Customs and through the depots would be made more difficult. It would impose further cost constraints on those businesses. It would also be possible to see a scenario in which staff cuts in the Customs Service would occur in regional Australia too.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I obviously recognise that Customs have been assiduous in finding greater and more efficiencies, and they are to be commended for the fine work they have done in achieving that, but it ought not be, and never should be, at the cost of the types of services that aid business development in Australia. In support of the amendments that we are moving here, we believe that a loss of Customs services would detrimentally impact on small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said that we had received a number of items of correspondence from small business people. Let me just refer to one of those. This is from a company called About Time, a company that operates in North Sydney. The author of this letter, Mr Andrew Bliss, in reference to these charges, heads his letter `Government changes take another $2,500 from my pocket annually'. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By way of background, I will say that I import a range of spare parts for clocks from dozens of suppliers in various countries. The size of the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> orders ranges from $100 to $2000 per order, and there would be about 50 orders annually. The goods are despatched by Post.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He is referring to the import entry charges that are to be imposed on postal items. Having said that, he goes on and talks about the status quo, but the real point of his letter is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AFTER JANUARY 1, 1997:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">My agent advises me that the $1000 limit will REDUCE to $250, forcing me in almost EVERY instance to engage an agent to perform the clearance. Further, my agent will be charged $51.40 for the pleasure of paying my duty and sales tax. The ludicrous situation will exist where it will cost me $125 to pay a duty and tax bill of $75&mdash;far more than the sales tax and duty collected (and note, 99% of what I import is duty FREE).</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">He concludes his letter&mdash;and this is a letter to Minister Moore&mdash;by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is so far the only change the Howard government has made which affects my business. Rather than `slashing red tape for small business', you seem to be creating more, and taking money from my pocket.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I look forward to your comments.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The opposition had a number of discussions with the Customs minister over this bill when it was first presented to us. I pay due recognition that the Customs minister, Mr Prosser, has been careful to listen to what we have said and has been prepared, and I commend him for this, to alter his position as a consequence. I acknowledge that. My view is, however, that he has not yet altered it far enough and there needs to be an amendment to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are parts of this bill that I want to refer to in particular. The opposition is seeking a phase&hyphen;in period of four years for all of the fees. That, I believe, would overcome the problem of the standing start where a nil fee applies now, and, upon carriage of this bill, a significant charge would be implemented. If it were phased in, it would cushion that impact. We believe the phase&hyphen;in over four years and the reduction of the threshold of $1,000, at which the import entry fees are imposed for goods entering Australia via the post, should occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said a bit about that, and I do not think I need to labour that point any further, 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="194"> but we did make representations to the minister on this. Since then, and following our representations, he has suggested that it be delayed 12 months to enable Customs to provide an Internet facility for electronic lodgments&mdash;that is, lodgments at a much cheaper rate than the rate I am referring to. I still think this represents a substantial impost as those lodgments are as well currently free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We will proceed with our amendments to phase in the charges over four years. However, the phase&hyphen;in will not begin until 12 months after the commencement date of the bill. We think the government will oppose this, but we hope that they will change their mind and recognise that this is not a case of Senate delay. This is a case of improving the legislation and the impact the legislation has on small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In respect of fee 10, the licensing charge for section 17(b) customs depots, we wanted to see the establishment of a two-tiered fee based on the turnover of the depots to protect low turnover depots. What we have of course in small ports is small depots, and in large ports ones that are much larger and do a roaring business. But, in order to recognise the special needs of the smaller ports and the smaller depots, we believe that there ought to be a two&hyphen;tiered structure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has recognised that point and, to its credit, that is one of the areas in which it has been prepared to be a bit flexible. I do not think it has been flexible enough, however. It is my understanding that the government has proposed an amendment that defines smaller depots as those depots having less than 100 transactions a year and in their case charging them a reduced fee of $1,500 per annum, a saving of $2,500 on the higher fee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have sought information about what number of depots would be affected by the two&hyphen;tiered system operating for 100 transactions a year. I am advised, and I think the source is customs, that around 15 per cent of depots have less than 100 transactions. On a state by state basis, six per cent of those occur in New South Wales and Victoria, but, significantly, 12 per cent occur in Western Australia, 17 per cent in Queensland&mdash;and 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> given the regional ports in Queensland that is obviously an important factor there&mdash;and 30 per cent in South Australia. Tasmania has 60 per cent of those companies and the Northern Territory has 73 per cent. These depots are mostly in regional centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Discussions that have been held, not by my office but by colleagues of mine, suggest that the number of small depots indicates that, if the figure were 500 to 1,000 transactions, we would arrive at a far better cut&hyphen;off point as many of the small depots have up to 1,000 transactions a year. By contrast, just to make the distinction, the large depots in Sydney and Melbourne have up to 50,000 transactions a year.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding is that about 50 per cent of depots have more than 1,000 transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, if the cut&hyphen;in point were at 500 transactions for the two&hyphen;tiered system of charging, then we believe that a more equitable outcome would be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has recently circulated its amendments. One of them extends the settlement date by which the new screening charges must be paid from 21 days to 45 days. I think this appears, if one looks at the original bill, to correct a drafting error that occurred there. But, in any case, on behalf of the opposition, we would support that amendment. It does give more time to small business to meet the repayments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one looks at what current commercial practices are, it seems to me from my recent discussions with small business in the last couple of weeks that that seems to have crept down to a settlement time of 91 days. That is commercial practice. So this change by current commercial standing is less favourable but nonetheless is an improvement and therefore should be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the other changes the government has proposed is to amend the transitional arrangements for the new customs depot charge as a result of not having the anticipated 1 January 1997 starting date. This bill was on the list before we rose for the Christmas recess. Obviously, now that we are considering it at this time, we have passed the operation date. I think it is important that the transitional arrangements ought not anticipate 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="195"> 1 January 1997, so we can support the change the government has made there.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendment as well defines a number of terms, particularly relating to the number of transactions for a customs depot. We have sought clarification from the minister about this&mdash;that he is not reinventing the definition of a transaction. So as no depots fall into the small category, and we have been assured on that point, and on that basis we would support what appear to be straightforward changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I say, in broad principle, the opposition does  support cost recovery for government services. That is not in every single case, because in some cases full cost recovery can damage growth in the economy or, if it is imposed suddenly, can, in an unanticipated way, throw into question the strategic planning of particular companies and push them towards bankruptcy and a flat economy. It is something that the government should move very carefully on and that is the reason for our position. I commend that to the Senate.</PARA></SPEECH>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DX5">Senator MARGETTS</NAME><STATE> (Western Australia)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(6.36 pm.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly in relation to the Customs Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1996. The intent of this bill is to further extend the concept of user pays to certain activities of the Australian Customs Service. The government seems determined to apply this concept to all sectors of the economy, with some notable exceptions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens (WA) have fundamental concerns with applying user pays to government services. It overlooks the fact that many services provided by government have a public interest component that outweighs their financial cost and that many essential government services are provided to sections of the community that are unable to pay the full cost of provisions. Ironically, the government itself has recognised this fact in the bill by exempting exporters from any cost recovery charges. The justification provided is that it is in the national interest not to hinder the economic competitiveness of exporters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The specific section of this bill which we have problems with is item 12 of schedule 1. This section would lower the threshold for goods exempt from import entry from $1,000 to $250. The person lodging the import entry 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> would then be required to pay a processing charge. I guess we will need to find out later what that would actually cost to process, whether you are actually gaining much or whether it is eaten up by the processing charge of having to look at the forms in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The charge is proportionately quite high. The charge for an electronically lodged import entry via post for a good valued at $250 would be $22.80. The cost of a manual or non-electronic import entry via post for a good of the same value is $44.51. For a small importer, this is a significant additional impost. Perhaps we could assume that the people happiest with this might be the larger importers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are also concerned that the charge is a flat rate, which is regressive and takes no account of the importer's ability to pay. Perhaps in trying to a remove tax we are putting flat rates on people which is inequitable. A business importing goods worth $260 would pay the same charge as a business importing goods worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. Clearly, this amendment will hit hardest those who are least able to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Questions also have to be asked about how much will actually be gained by this bill. The ACS estimates that there are approximately 29,000 imports in the range of $250 to $1,000 which would be subject to the import entry processing charge if this bill is passed. The vast majority of these import entries will be lodged electronically, thus attracting a charge of $22.80. The annual revenue gain for the ACS from lowering this threshold will be approximately $660,000. This is a relatively small amount. When compared with the burden it will place on small importers, it is then difficult to justify.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Honourable senators will realise that I have no personal or general problem with import fees or duties, but I have problems with the imposition of fees or duties which are inequitable. Often people will argue in the same way in relation to banking fees&mdash;`This is the cost of servicing.' But it is very inequitable when the people who are being charged such large servicing fees are least able to pay. We 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="196"> have seen people's small accounts being eroded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principle also applies sometimes to small importers. We, therefore, will be moving an amendment in the committee stage to look at or remove item 12 from schedule 1. I will deal with that more at the time and ask questions related to that. That basically is our concern in relation to this bill. I think it is important that we start to clearly put these issues on the table.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is a problem when the government starts talking about the fact that somebody has to pay before the government provides services even if those people pay tax. I think that is not a principle which the Greens (WA) would generally support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a lovely little town in northern Tasmania. This business is operated by Beth Sowter and Mike Watts. Mike corresponded with me in relation to this legislation. I wanted to substantially put on record what he had to say because I think he is much more eloquent about the impact of this legislation on a small business than I ever could be. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Beth Sowter and myself have over the last five years established a small business that caters for folk musicians around Australia. It has been hard work developing our international Supplier contacts and building up our outlets around Australia. We have also developed a good rapport with folk musicians who are beginning to rely on our experience and knowledge. Though we work at the business part time we are hopeful that it will employ one of us full time within two years. Our growth of 30% per year justifies this prediction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">What could be a good business is now in jeopardy due to the changes to Customs procedures, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> moved in Parliament on Wednesday 6th November, 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We import goods from England, Scotland, Ireland and Canada from Suppliers who previously could not make their goods available here due to the distances of the markets. Our import orders are not large because of the market size and the variety of interests of our customers. The value of an average import consignment is between $300 and $400. When goods arrive we do an Informal Customs Clearance which takes no more than five minutes. With this Clearance we inform Customs of the value of the goods, sales tax and duty payable and costs in Australian Dollars. This is then faxed to the Customs in Hobart and the goods are dispatched. All consignments under $1000 are imported by Post.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost recovery amendments moved by the Government have put a stop to Informal Custom Clearance. Their user pays/cost recovery system will now involve a $44.55 charge for manual lodgment (for us we will have to lodge in Launceston in person) or a $29.65 electronic lodgment charge. We have been advised that we would need a Customs Agent to process transactions to qualify for this reduced fee. Agents were charging us $60 per consignment before we started doing the Informal Custom Clearances ourselves. This fee will obviously rise with the more formal clearances and licensing fees. I have been told we could be charged a fee by a Customs Agent of $80 plus the electronic lodgement charge of $29.65.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a consignment of $300 to $400 these charges will make our business unprofitable. These charges may be suitable for large consignments but the very nature of our business prevents us from placing orders larger than we are currently doing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also do not consider that a consignment of 15 song books worth $300 requires a charge of $44.55 to process. The Government should have looked at ways of reducing the book work involved before proceeding with this legislation. During the second reading of the bill it was stated by the Minister that "Customs has undertaken detailed activity based costing of its services to ensure that the costs recovered do not exceed the costs calculated to process import transactions".

<PARA STYLE="Para">That small business will clearly be affected by the charge as those business proprietors interpret its impact upon their business.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="197">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is curious, given the government's position in relation to freeing up a small business from the impost of charges, and it is ironic that the day this bill was being introduced into the House of Representatives on 6 November last year the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) was addressing the opening of the National Small Business Forum in Parliament House. He told it that government had `placed an enormous amount of rhetorical emphasis on small business in the lead-up to the election. We also placed a lot of policy emphasis on it'. Mr Watts and his fellow proprietor are wondering what that emphasis is in the context of their small business and the impact of these charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government and the Prime Minister has said that small business is the great engine room of the future economic recovery, so the question will need to be asked&mdash;and I am sure the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) will be keen to respond on this point: how does this particular measure assist small business to do what the Prime Minister has said, that is, be the `great engine room of future economic recovery'? In this case we have business proprietors who are talking about a business which at the moment is not a great economic generator but which anticipates, with the history of business growth, that in a period of two years they will be able to employ one of them full time, which obviously is how small business works in terms of gradually building up a business over time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In relation to this matter, the impact of these small transactions is prohibitive. If there is an option for small importers to access the lower charge&mdash;which I think is more properly described as the amount of $22.80 rather than the amount Mr Watts suggested it is&mdash;then there will have to be the ability to lodge without going through other agents who will charge fees. That may be the intention of government. I can say that in looking at Mr Watts' letterhead he is already on the Internet so he will be able to lodge himself, provided that is possible. But there is obviously a lot of concern in the community that there may be charges that are going to arise that are not foreseen in this legislation by the need to use 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> specialist customs agents for the processing of these small quantities of product.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Indeed, effectively something between eight and 10 per cent of the value of this business's input will be levied in import charges. I suppose the minister may say that this business should simply pass that cost on, but is that really desirable in these circumstances and is the real cost of processing these electronic fees $22.80? I would be interested to hear what the minister has to say about that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Generally speaking, there is a concern about the Import Processing Charges Bill in relation to the imposition of these charges on the very small transactions. They do impact on small economies such as the Tasmanian economy, where we have businesses which do their own imports on a very small scale at no cost at present. So this is a total increase in the costs imposed by this bill where no costs exist at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> In relation to the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Bill, Senator Cook has substantially placed on record matters that the Labor Party would rely upon. I have been advised, in relation to the Tasmanian situation&mdash;and you would have noted from the statistics that Senator Cook put before the Senate that 60 per cent of the small operation&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate take note of the documents.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I wish to make a few brief remarks about the annual reports of the Australian National Railways Commission and the National Rail Corporation Ltd. I simply wish to make a few comments about the future of rail in this 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="198"> country and the approach that the government has taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be to the ongoing shame of those opposite that they presided over a 13-year period of government in which the railways in this country were basically run into the ground. As a result, we had millions of dollars worth of debt and subsidies being paid out to an extent that clearly was untenable. In fact, the people of Australia were denied the truth about the railway system within this country during the last election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On coming to government, we found out about the mess that our rail system was in and, as a result, the government took it upon itself to commission the Brew report which would consider the future options for rail to ensure both its longevity and its role as a vital part of the transport infrastructure within this nation. I am delighted to say that everyone on the coalition side is absolutely committed to our rail system and to ensuring that it is a viable transport alternative for the businesses that rely upon it around this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, if we had continued down the road of the previous government&mdash;where employment in the past decade went from around 9,200 down to 2,500; or, in my home state of Tasmania, where it went from about 1,200 employees down to less than 200 employees now&mdash;we would have seen that rail was headed for disaster and doom. We wanted to arrest that continuing slide. We have committed ourselves to trying to obtain a private operator to take over our rail system, to ensure that it is properly managed and that appropriate capital investment can be made to continue its ongoing role within Australian transport.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is vital that our Australian rail network continues to exist within this country. The previous government's recipe was sitting back and doing nothing or, indeed, just changing the name&mdash;I think that was one of the most important decisions that was taken&mdash;as was so aptly put to the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, which is inquiring into the Australian rail system, when we were sitting in Launceston just the other day. Might I add that view was put to us by one of the trade unions involved, 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the Public Transport Union, who told us that that is all that had really been done by the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We were not prepared to see the rail industry in this country continue to slide down into oblivion. We have embarked upon a process which we are hopeful will allow for not only job security but also jobs growth, after a decade of jobs being lost in the rail industry under Labor. We want to arrest that slide. We want to see job security and jobs growth in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me commend the workers in our rail industry and those that have been seeking to manage it. I indicate to the people of Australia that, basically, governments like playing trains but it is very expensive and they do not know how to run them. It is my hope that, in the years to come, there will be a very small report from the Australian track authority indicating how well the rail system is being run in this country and that the taxpayers of this country will no longer be burdened by the heavy losses that have been incurred as a result of mismanagement, especially under the previous Labor government.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say a few words on both of those reports&mdash;the annual report of the Australian National Railways Commission and the annual report of National Rail Corporation Ltd&mdash;particularly after listening to Senator Abetz who has stated his government's objective of selling our public rail system and has espoused that this will somehow deliver a panacea to Australians, both from a financial aspect and from a service aspect. In saying that, I would just like to point out to Senator Abetz that some other countries&mdash;such as the UK that has tried this exercise for some 12 years&mdash;are finding that it is not working.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am not quite sure how you say the public will be better off from the point of view of having a private owner of a rail system when, indeed, the public operator is the provider of the service. What it comes down to is that if it is sold to private enterprise&mdash;as has been recommended and which is being pursued by the conservative government of this country&mdash;what you will end up with is an owner who 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="199"> will seek to maximise the revenue generated from that operation rather than the service provision. That is clearly the experience now being felt in the UK not only from their rail transport point of view but also from their bus services which have also been  privatised in that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Abetz, if you took the time to read some of the British newspapers from time to time about this issue, you might find that 1.5 billion pounds worth of investment has floundered because the British rail system, because they have regionalised the sale of it&mdash;and I assume that is exactly what your government is proposing to do&mdash;have not been able to get agreement from the private operators of the rail services. Therefore, the public are suffering as a result. Indeed, you know the very importance of the rail infrastructure in our own state from a transport point of view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would say to the government very seriously that you want to give great consideration to this issue. I will be very interested to hear our state minister, Mr Cleary, when he appears before the Senate committee inquiry on the Brew report tonight as to what he is proposing to do with our rail system, because rail is an important part of our infrastructure. It is critical that we maintain a service and not pass it over to someone who is going to look at it purely from a revenue point of view. That is one of the most important things.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> As some commentators have said in the UK press, the taxpayers&mdash;the consumers of services such as rail and bus services&mdash;are now really feeling the pinch because the services are so bad. You talk about infrastructure being run down, but it is even worse under private ownership that is purely driven by revenue raising measures. I think your government, Senator Abetz, ought to take into consideration exactly what the objective is. You say it is important to provide a service, but I would be very interested to know how, at the end of the day, you intend to do that under private ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there are few services of this nature. I am sure we are all for making them more efficient. That is why, with regard to the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> rail system in this country, we sought change. Unfortunately, conservative state governments would not come to the party to bring the whole thing into being, to make sure that we ended up with a more efficient structure for the rail system per se.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will be a sad day when we see the rail infrastructure of this country handed over to private ownership with no real capacity to obligate the private operators or owners to deliver a service to the public. We are such a large nation in a geographic sense we must have a service provided. If it costs the taxpayer something, then we ought to minimise that cost. But we ought to maintain the service, which is very important to the people and businesses of this country.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note from this second report to which we are speaking&mdash;the annual report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Rail Corporation Ltd&mdash;</EMPHASIS> that there was an after tax  profit of $1.005 million, which was in line with budget. If that is so, it means that there is a basis for great hope that rail transport will take the position it should take in this country. As Senator Murphy has said, it is essential that it do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Abetz pledged that the coalition government is dedicated to rail, although he says it should be in private hands. But there seems to be unanimous agreement that there should be rail transport. In deciding whether it should be privatised or not, what I say is that in the year 1995&hyphen;96 there was an operating profit for the National Rail Corporation Ltd. To make it clear, revenue coming from freight amounted to $475.7 million, which was slightly down on the previous year. Other contributions to the profit outcome were interest earnings of $36.6 million and restructuring payments by shareholders totalling $25.2 million, in line with the 1991 shareholder agreement. The shareholders are the government of Australia and the states of New South Wales and Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Abetz said across the chamber that things would be better if the unions were less hardline. I have talked to the Secretary of the Public Transport Union in Victoria, Mr Peter Bourke, and I can say that he is very much dedicated to the efficient running of the rail 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="200"> system. He is a man who grew up in the rail system. His forebears were in the rail system, and he is a man who has a love for the system. He has not only a love for the system but a deep understanding of it and a deep commitment to it. The only way in which he could be described as being hardline is that he is jealous of his union members' interests. That is his job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is what is needed to make this system work properly. This report makes clear that, unless there is not only agreement between the unions and the corporation but also agreement from the employees that all should work well and everybody should get a reasonable deal, the system is not going to work, and it will not work whether it is in private hands or in public hands. The way the workers are treated decides, to a very large extent, the way a corporation or an enterprise will operate. It is for that reason that I am very pleased to see, in the aims of this corporation that are on the back of the front cover of the report, a determination to increase productivity, to be competitive and to look to the safety of the people who do the work in the system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is quite clear that people like Mr Bourke and Mr Roger Jowett, the National President of the Public Transport Union, are the sort of people who should be consulted more often than they are. If they are consulted more often&mdash;and on a more gracious basis than at present&mdash;this system will grow to be what we all want to achieve: a very viable, very active and very productive rail system throughout Australia.</PARA>

A series of recommendations on pages xxvii, xxviii, xxix, xxx and xxxi of the report deserve study.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For example, recommendations 27 to 35 deal with the native title legislation, and that is a matter we should take very much on board. I notice that recommendation 27 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A lack of clarity about the property rights associated with native title, rather than native title per se, is the major cause of the current increased uncertainty about access to natural resources.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> is a very pertinent comment and a comment we should take on board. That issue of property rights has been clarified in the Wik case and that is in line with the thrust of this report as to what should happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If there is any disappointment to be expressed about this report, it is in terms of the paucity of recommendations about the level of employment in Australia and how that might be affected by Australian firms locating overseas. I notice that recommendation 11 says that `Australian direct investment abroad is likely to increase the demand for skilled relative to unskilled labour' but it does not seem to take the matter any further. In this day and age when unemployment is the scourge that it is in Australia it would have been good if the Industry Commission had made some recommendations about that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In locating offshore, Australian companies cannot simply say, `Well, it is more profitable to do that'. I think Australian companies, indeed any companies that operate in Australia, do have an obligation not simply to the level of profit&mdash;and of course profit is not a dirty word; we need as much profit as can get in Australia. There should be other considerations besides that, and one of the main ones is what we can do about the level of employment in this country. If that could be helped by firms doing onshore what they propose to do offshore, that should be a matter that holds great weight in the decision made by the companies, because an Australian company, like an Australian citizen, has an obligation to the community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak tonight about matters relating to the resignation of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Firstly, let me say that the Labor opposition will not be trawling through matters relating to the police investigation into Senator Woods. At the end of the day, he will either be charged or he will be cleared. That is a matter for the police and, unlike the Liberals, who at times seem to have taken a different view on these matters, we will allow that investigation to take its course. Coalition senators have thought that it is not inappropriate to reflect in the chamber on matters which are subject to a police investigation; we do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, I want to make it absolutely clear that Labor in the Senate will never reflect on personal matters. We have always considered those matters to be off&hyphen;limits. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has already expressed that he was sorry for Senator Woods and that he hoped he gets through any of the problems associated with this. I can only support that sentiment in the Senate today. I hope that all involved get these matters behind them as soon as possible and that they proceed with happier lives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Thirdly, there is another principle that we feel is important, and that is that parliament should not be used as a forum to improperly air personal grievances. We will never condone the sort of abuse of the forum of the parliament that happened recently in Victoria with the Smith&hyphen;Harris affair. It is our strong belief that that issue went well beyond the bounds of political and parliamentary propriety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But there is a lesson that senators on the other side of the chamber can well learn: that is, that sometimes&mdash;in fact, quite often&mdash;crass political opportunism rebounds. I refer to an interview that took place after the former Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating, resigned on 23 April last year. That interview was on SBS TV, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Insight</EMPHASIS> program hosted by Vivian 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Schenker, just two days after Mr Keating resigned. Senator Woods went on that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Insight</EMPHASIS> program and was asked  a couple of questions. The transcript of that program reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Bob Woods let's start with you, you think politicians should be forced to complete their terms, don't you? In most circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bob Woods:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I think being a member of Parliament is not just another job, it's not something you do while waiting for a position in private practice, you know a nice private lucrative job. It's not something you do because you can't think of something else you might do with your career, you make a commitment, and a contract and I believe very strongly you should fulfil that contract for the whole term of whatever that term might be.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Question:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Well, you actually take it a step further than that don't you and say they should actually sign some sort of contract?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Bob Woods:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Well I did that actually, I signed a contract which may not be legally binding, but there certainly is an appropriate contract with the director of the State Liberal party saying if I resigned, I would commit a certain amount of money towards the cost of the by&hyphen;election which I caused. Now that's a bit easier as a Senator because it's a much smaller process, but I believe very firmly you should make a commitment or a contract for the whole term that you're there for.</PARA>
<PARA> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The truth of this matter is this: if Senator Woods was to follow his own dictum, he would stay. In fact, if he was to follow his own dictum, he would pay for the joint sitting of the parliament in New South Wales. If Senator Woods firmly believed in that commitment, which was made publicly with Senator Woods all puffed up with self&hyphen;importance and bombast and pomposity, he would serve a full term. He would serve out his five remaining years in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When it comes to politics, these sorts of cheap gratuitous stunts mean nothing. They mean absolutely nothing at all. They catch up with you in the end. It is not as if this interview on SBS was anything other than a cheap jibe at the former Prime Minister Paul Keating. There are plenty of examples of 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="202"> former leaders of political parties who have been defeated in elections or in leadership ballots and who have resigned from the parliament. They have reached the heights of their careers and it is an accepted thing in Australian politics that those leaders bow out. It has not just been Paul Keating. Malcolm Fraser resigned after he was defeated in 1983; Dr Hewson resigned after he lost the Liberal Party leadership. More recently, Mr Andrew Peacock has resigned. The former Prime Minister Bob Hawke resigned from parliament and caused a by&hyphen;election. This is not unexceptionable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But Senator Woods is the only politician from any side of the parliament who I can recall being critical of a former leader who resigned. This is a very clear lesson to those on the other side of this chamber that hypocrisy never pays. Trying to get a bit of gratuitous political mileage out of the totally unexceptional circumstances of a former political leader resigning after he has lost an election or the leadership is part and parcel of political life in this country. It is not only true, I might say, in the federal parliament. It is also true in state parliaments. If you really try that sort of gratuitous stuff then, of course, it comes back to haunt you later. It has come back to haunt Senator Woods today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me make it clear that I do not begrudge Senator Woods leaving the parliament, and the Labor opposition does not begrudge Senator Woods leaving the parliament. On his departure from this chamber, we will wish him a fulfilling retirement. But let me make it absolutely clear that we will never let hypocrisy of this magnitude go unremarked on in the parliament.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="202"><TITLE>Senator Woods</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In order that my colleagues do not think that, on our side of politics, only our leader John Howard has an enduring interest in cricket, I wish to use this occasion to make a few comments on the state of Australian cricket. Firstly, congratulations to the Australian cricket team on retaining the Sir Frank Worrell trophy. Also, I send congratulations to the ABC broadcast team led by Tasmanian Neville Oliver and thank you, Terry Alderman, for your astute comments in the final interesting session in Perth when Australia was soundly beaten.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The past 12 months have witnessed some mixed fortunes for Australian cricketers. Indeed, the fascination of one&hyphen;day cricket is but a microcosm of the wider appeal&mdash;and frequently the unpredictability&mdash;of cricket results, whether the match is played in the test arena, on a local oval or even in the backyard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Heroes there are aplenty. It is a tragedy when tempers and acid comments sour an otherwise good sportsperson's image. Thankfully, the umpires and the respective captains, Mark Taylor and Courtney Walsh, took the appropriate steps recently so that a great series did not end too much in unnecessary acrimony. While there have been some disappointing performances, the giving away by bowlers of so many no balls is a situation that when I played the game many years ago would not have been tolerated. I believe that certainly some stronger message must be sent to some of the younger players, like fast bowler Andrew Bichel.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="203">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It does appear that the selectors are prepared to tolerate endless failures by some players yet pounce on other young players far too readily. Australians do respond favourably to the aggressive play of the likes of Slater, Mark Waugh and Ponting. There was some chatter in Tasmania when Ricky Ponting was making his name as a brave and dashing young cricketer that two Tasmanians in an Australian team was really too much on an enduring basis for the Australian mainland cricket establishment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While David Boon would publicly deny that his retirement from test cricket partly had this in mind, regrettably Tasmania now does not have a test representative. After a great knock of 88 runs in Brisbane, contributing to a great Australian win, Ricky Ponting, following a failure in a subsequent test, was dropped. This action undoubtedly took toll in relation to his confidence until recent matches. It is also interesting to note that Australia has lost two of the three test matches since Ponting's removal and most of the one day games. There are also other young Tasmanians such as Jamie Cox, Michael DiVenuto and Shaun Young who should be seriously considered for the English tour. I wish the Tasmanians well in their game against Canberra tomorrow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given the extraordinary money now flowing into cricket administration, perhaps our selectors should also be looking at choosing a different mix of one day cricket specialists, while reserving others for test matches. There is so much cricket played today that injury, tension and social pressures are with players as never before.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally, I would like to add my respect for and congratulations to Billy McDermott, who never gave less than his best in an inspiring contribution to the game.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few remarks this evening on the recent report by Mr Mansfield on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> It is an organisation that is now accepted as an important information provider to Australians. No fact more clearly illustrates this than the number of submissions received by the ABC review headed by Mr Mansfield. Mr Mansfield records that 10,616 submissions were received. Clearly the ABC has become part of Australia. Few other issues would inspire over 10,000 individuals and groups to put pen to paper and send it to a review committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The review was an important one and this is true for several reasons. It was established for two reasons: firstly as an attempt to cut expenditure from the public sector; and, secondly, as an attempt to hobble an institution the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and his cabinet believed to be biased against the conservative parties. Both views are wrong and short&hyphen;sighted. The findings and recommendations by Mr Mansfield must have shattered Senator Alston and his Prime Minister. By and large, the report supports the past actions of the ABC, rejects criticism of bias and recommends few significant changes. Many of the changes that are recommended are as a result of the changing communications market and the new expectations the Australian people have. This is very different from the changes due to past incompetence of the ABC and its managers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I do not believe that all the recommendations are necessary or particularly smart. This is especially true with regard to those programs which are broadcast to international consumers. In particular, I speak of Radio Australia. The issue of Radio Australia cuts right to the crux of the current debate in Australia. It is the argument of the bean counters versus the strategic thinkers, the ideologues versus the pragmatists.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government argument, as I understand it, is that Radio Australia should be cut because, first, it provides no real service to domestic Australia and, secondly, it would be a cost cutting exercise to better support the government or the ABC bottom line. These are similar to the arguments run by the government with regard to the highly successful DIFF program run throughout South&hyphen;East Asia by the former Labor government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="204">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Institutions like Radio Australia provide an important link between Australia and our future in the South&hyphen;East Asian region. It is an important and significant way of clearly expressing the view that Australia is a western nation most interested in integration with South&hyphen;East Asia. It highlights that Australia sees its future in the region and wishes to educate the region about Australia and provide it with a source of information about Australia, its policies and its aims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Australia currently needs this kind of strategic view. It requires this thought in all areas of government. This important strategic link cannot be underestimated. This week alone there have been many media reports of South&hyphen;East Asian and other nations criticising the proposal to close down Radio Australia. This is where the real value of concepts like Radio Australia are realised. Their value lies in broadcasting not just to expatriate Australians but to policy makers in business and in government in nations where Australia seeks to further economically integrate itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These countries view the program as an important source of information on Australia and their understanding of our importance to them. This point cannot be more clearly illustrated than by the comments now coming from other nations themselves. Senior figures from China and Hong Kong have all made comment in the past 24 hours about the importance of Radio Australia as an information provider to their respective parts of the world. Essentially, they argue that Radio Australia has played an important role in Australia's economic integration into the region and, likewise, the region's understanding of the priority Australia places on its integration within the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As an educational tool about Australia to the rest of the region, Radio Australia is playing an essential role. It is a view that is also supported by the current Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer). Recent media reports place the Minister for Foreign Affairs at loggerheads with the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Senator Alston. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade realises the importance of programs such as 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> Radio Australia. It understands the value of this type of international broadcasting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Whilst the submission from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade recognises that the current program is not perfect and changes can and should be made, it accepts and supports the notion of international broadcasting in the national interest of Australia. I am told that the submission from this department was personally approved by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, before it was sent off to the ABC review. I am sure that it will make for an interesting discussion within cabinet over the next few weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is true that Mr Mansfield identifies the important role that Radio Australia plays. However, it is his contention that if the role it plays within the region is essential to our diplomatic effort, it should be run in the context of the diplomacy effort by the government and not by the ABC. Mr Mansfield compares this with the system which operates in other nations, such as the United Kingdom. On page 41 of volume 1 of the review, he quotes the relationship that the BBC has with the United Kingdom government. The review states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This is in direct contrast to the situation of the BBC World Service which is required to broadcast:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to such audiences overseas and in such languages as are approved by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, in accordance with the objectives, priorities and targets which may from time to time be agreed with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, or with such Departments of Her Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom as may from time to time be specified in writing by the Secretary of State."</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The problem with this argument is that the national interest is not solely determined by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. If it were, it would be an incredibly narrow approach to the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The national interest includes areas such as shipping, industry policy, information technology, agricultural development, defence, aviation policy and a wide range of other areas. The point is that all of these issues and their relevant debates are occurring in the Australian public, in the Australian parliament and, indeed, in the Australian community. The outcome of these debates and the role they 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="205"> play in our strategic positioning are equally as fundamental to our role in the region and beyond as foreign affairs and trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of these areas need to be known and freely reported by the ABC into the region so as to inform Australians and international policy makers of our strategic direction and plans. A wide&hyphen;ranging strategic perspective opens up many more doors for Australia than does a narrow focus on one or two areas. Essentially, the question that is not being answered by the review is why the national interest with regard to broadcasting services to regional and isolated Australia, such as Triple J and ABC Classic FM, is any different from the national interest overseas. The answer is that there is no real difference. The purpose is information production and its distribution for national purposes. If this, however, is not convincing enough, what is the difference between money spent by a department for information distribution purposes and money spent by the ABC for information distribution purposes? The answer is nothing except the independence and impartiality of the information provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The only other reason provided by the review for the cutting of Radio Australia is the decline in market base stemming from short wave radio. This, too, however, is a weak link in the argument. I have alluded to the reasons earlier. Much of the change facing the ABC stems from technological changes rather than past mistakes. Radio Australia is now involved in satellite broadcasts and digital audio broadcasting. Therefore, the decline in market radio for Radio Australia on short wave radio is not a result of a decline in interest in Radio Australia. It is, rather, a change in technology which has pushed Radio Australia into new areas. As a former chairman of the ABC, Mr Mark Armstrong, stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS>today, the claim about short wave radio is like abolishing the postal service because telegrams are outmoded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are a range of reasons why Radio Australia should be kept. Much of the review into the ABC was positive. It did reject criticisms of bias levelled at it by the conservative government. However, in areas such as international obligations, it perhaps lacks the 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> vision needed for a nation such as Australia seeking to improve its ties with the region within which it resides.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="205"><TITLE>Northern Territory: Growth</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME><STATE> (Northern Territory&mdash;</STATE><ROLE>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP>(7.35 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to comment on the Howard government's commitment to north Australian growth. Earlier today, a number of documents were presented and tabled in the Senate from the sitting of the last Senate. Those documents included the federal government response to the Committee on Darwin report, which was originally dated 29 June 1995. The response was tabled together with a statement by the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp). I welcome both the response and the statement to the very important report of the Committee on Darwin, which was conducted and chaired at that time by Mr Neville Wran.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As Mr John Sharp, the minister, said last week in tabling the document, which he entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A northern focus</EMPHASIS>, the coalition's first formal response to the report was very important. My criticism of the original report is well known because, after much of the hype that surrounded it, the Labor government at that time failed to adequately address strategies for developing Darwin as an important gateway to the east Asian region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We now have a response by the Liberal-National Party government which comprehensively addresses the 77 recommendations of the Wran report and objectively looks beyond the report, very importantly, to outline the federal government's future directions for development in north Australia. In fact, the Wran report of 1995 had some 17 or 18 special consultancy reports attached to it, most of which were not addressed in detail by Mr Wran in the conclusions drawn in the report at the time. That led to a lack of direction and focus by the then Labor government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government, since its election in March last year, has now gone through those documents in detail, conducted extensive internal discussions within the Common 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="206"> wealth bureaucracy and various departments and had very open consultations with the Northern Territory government. The response that we now see highlights the importance of continued Commonwealth assistance in defence, communications, transport and health to advance development in the Northern Territory and, in fact, right across northern Australia. The $850 million expenditure on defence infrastructure over a 10-year period, the investment in the Darwin based QANTM, a special cooperative multimedia centre, and the future private construction of the Alice Springs to Darwin rail link are some examples of exciting areas for future growth in the Northern Territory economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think it will be lost on senators that ministers like the Northern Territory transport minister, Barry Coulter, will be in Canberra taking these initiatives forward in discussions next week, and I am sure the Chief Minister, Shane Stone, and the Premier of South Australia, Mr John Olsen, will be meeting with the Prime Minister later in the month to again advance these important developments and projects. Future strategies will enhance the activities of the Northern Territory government in forging beneficial relationships with many Asian countries which have been described by the federal government in this response and statement as `remarkable activity and leadership.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Commonwealth will, of course, as is outlined in the detailed response to the 77 Wran recommendations, pick up a lot of further support, particularly for initiatives of the Northern Territory government, for example, by appointing honorary consuls for trade promotion purposes; by providing policy advice through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; by hosting a team Australia ministerial meeting to coincide with the Northern Territory's Expo `97 in June of this year and, of course, ongoing ministerial coordination; and by continuing to encourage visits by Asian leaders to Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The response to the Wran report itself is proof of the federal government's commitment to assisting the export potential of northern Australia and facilitating a special trading thrust into Asia. In the future, we will 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> expect to see expanding cooperation between Australia's northern states&mdash;there will be three of them in the not too distant future&mdash;and a special cross&hyphen;border approach to economic development and domestic and overseas market penetration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The federal government's budget strategy, both of 1996 and in the lead&hyphen;up to 1997, is determined to establish a climate of security and stability for investment which will attract new enterprise to north Australia, for example, by reducing the provisional tax uplift factor, by reducing the fringe benefits tax on remote area housing, by retaining the diesel fuel rebate scheme and alleviating the many cost burdens that apply in such remote areas. By improving our image and promoting and marketing northern Australia as part of Australia's regional economy, the area will naturally flourish and I particularly welcome this detailed response and important statement which highlights the issues that will be, and that will continue to be, attracted to northern Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="7.41 p.m." PAGE="206"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 7.41 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator Vanstone</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) The effects of labour market programmes (LMPs) on job seekers are regularly evaluated by the Department. A recent evaluation of Working Nation LMPs demonstrated that some programmes and providers are less effective than others at helping job seekers get jobs. The cut in SkillShare funding and the independent review of SkillShare projects has meant that less effective providers have not been provided with funding and that the Commonwealth should obtain improved results for each dollar of expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) There was no freeze on LMP funding in the lead up to the Budget. When this Government was elected, some 90 per cent of the 1995&hyphen;96 appropriation for LMPs was already committed. Prudent management of LMPs was required because of the very high level of commitment in a cash limited 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="211"> appropriation. This limited the number of new contracts which could be signed but LMP assistance continued to be provided to unemployed people during the pre&hyphen;Budget period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The Government has a clear and comprehensive strategy for reducing long term unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some of the major elements of this strategy are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> elimination of the budget deficit to take the pressure off interest rates and encourage business investment,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> creating a low inflationary environment to encourage productive business investment,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> results focused, targeted labour market assistance for the long term unemployed,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a flexible industrial relations system,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> expanding and introducing greater flexibility into the apprenticeship and traineeship system,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> reducing the burden on small business to encourage employment creation, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a Cabinet Employment Committee to focus on the employment effects of Government policies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implementation of the Government's strategy will act to reduce the number of long term unemployed. The extent to which the implementation of the legislative elements of this program is delayed or frustrated by the Senate will of course impact on the Government's ability to reduce the number of long term unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Under the reforms to labour market assistance, the focus will be on real job outcomes and assistance will be client driven, not programme&hyphen;driven. Job seekers will benefit from higher standards of service and more flexible and customised assistance. Whilst employment service providers will be expected to tailor assistance to individual needs, some client groups and programmes have special requirements which can be met most efficiently by retaining a separate programme identity and funding. Some programmes will be retained to meet these needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) To pursue the best possible delivery of SkillShare services to unemployed people and having regard to the tight budgetary situation, I established an independent body, the SkillShare Services Review Committee to review the national SkillShare network. As a result of the Committee's recommendations and subsequent decisions, capacity to fund around 360 SkillShare projects was available to continue to provide training for job seekers across Australia in 1996&hyphen;97. At the end of the current financial year SkillShare sponsors funded to 30 June 1997 will have their contracts extended until 30 November 1997 subject to budgetary considerations, their performance and ongoing need.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) and (2) HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shoalwater</EMPHASIS>  conducted a Lead&hyphen;through exercise with HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Onslow</EMPHASIS>  on 9 August 1996; the predetermined channel used in this exercise passed between North and South Heads in the approaches to Port Jackson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) The aim of a Lead&hyphen;through is to give navigation support to other vessels, to allow them to pass as close as possible to the centreline of a channel, or ordered track in an area, which as been subjected to Mine Countermeasures (MCM) in response to a mine threat. The objective for the customer vessel is to pass over the same ground as the Lead&hyphen;through Unit and thereby minimise risk of damage from mine detonation. The 9 August exercise objective was to exercise Lead&hyphen;through procedures exclusively, and involved a simulated minefield only.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Since the minefield in this instance was simulated, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shoalwater</EMPHASIS>  was not required to clear the channel prior to the Lead&hyphen;through.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) As is the practice with all Lead&hyphen;through operations, the 9 August exercise was conducted 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> along a predetermined route known to both participating units.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) Lead&hyphen;through operations are routine activities for Minehunters and Minesweepers, with the former required to complete six annually to maintain minimum level of capability. At least 12 Lead&hyphen;through operations are conducted annually in the course of Fleet Concentration Periods, Major Fleet Unit Workup, MCM Exercises, and on an ad&hyphen;hoc basis as requested by other units.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(7) Minehunters are the preferred platform to provide Lead&hyphen;through but Minesweepers are also capable of conducting the operation. The majority of Lead&hyphen;through operations since 1991 involved Minehunter Inshore (MHI) augmented on occasion by Minesweeper Auxiliary (Large) and (Small).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(8) Lead&hyphen;through exercises are routine operations which have been conducted on numerous occasions from Sydney, Newcastle, Jervis Bay, Port Kembla, Townsville, Cairns, Weipa, Darwin, and in the Torres Strait.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">B Gibbs served in HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quickmatch</EMPHASIS>  from 21 February 1956 to 15 September 1957, which was attached to the Far East Strategic Reserve in Malaya from 13 March to 5 April 1956, and again from 28 September 1956 to 25 June 1957. The conditions of service for Service personnel who served in Malaya were considered by the government in 1956. Service by RAN personnel in Navy ships attached to the FESR was specifically excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits, on the basis that the enemy did not have the capability to threaten naval vessels, while it did have an offensive capability against forces ashore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to a question from a Government member as to why this was the case, Dr Donald Cameron, Minister for Health at that time, replying on behalf of the Minister for Repatriation, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"They are not regarded as being subjected to additional operational<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">  risks. They are subjected to the risks of the service for which they<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">  engage,

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of the RAN in any Order of Battle does not necessarily denote active service, despite the fact that the term `Order of Battle' is an historical term used to describe the manner in which the combat components of a fighting force were organised immediately prior to going into battle. As with many such terms, the meaning has changed over the years and its more modern usage is as a descriptive term when listing all the components, including administration, of a military force. As the RAN is the senior service in Australia, its name will be placed first in any such listing of Australian Defence Force services.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="214">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) Yes. The Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel made arrangements for Admiral Peek to make a submission to an Interdepartmental Committee on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) `Returned from Active Service recognition' is not a term which is commonly used by the Australian Defence Force. The term, however, may be equated to three distinctly separate areas applying to service overseas:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Land based members of the Defence Force, regardless of Service, were eligible for repatriation benefits if they were allotted for service within the operational area defined in Schedule 2 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Defence Force personnel, regardless of Service, qualify for the Returned from Active Service Badge if they served on the posted strength of a unit or formation in Singapore between 31 December 1955 and 1 February 1959 or in Malaya between 31 December 1955 and 31 July 1960.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) The term `active service' is used in relation to discipline under `military law' during the Malayan Emergency from 1955&hyphen;1960. Military law does not apply to the Navy who were subject to the Naval Discipline Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) Yes. There were 2 deaths during this period, the cause of death being:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) one accidentally drowned in Singapore Harbour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) one was accidentally killed by friendly fire when struck by a Star Shell casing fired by HMS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cockade</EMPHASIS>  during an exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5) In May 1990, the Federal Court (in the cases of DOESSEL and DAVIS) construed the phrase "allotted for duty" as being equivalent to "posted for duty". On this interpretation, any person who served in an operational area, but was not specifically allotted for operational service for the purpose of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986, would qualify as having had operational service, even though that service was not at a time when it involved increased danger. This was not the intended purpose of the term "allotted for duty".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6) The former Minister for Veterans' Affairs, following the Federal Court decisions on DOESSEL and DAVIS, introduced amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 through the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1990. These amendments were introduced so that there would be no future misunderstanding of the intention of specifically allotting members to operational service in an operational area, rather than merely posting members to a vicinity for less than operational purposes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) No. As with all other AQIS officers undertaking quarantine operations, staff undertaking imported food inspection duties will be appropriately qualified and trained to perform those duties. No mandatory qualifications are currently required and this will not change in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) See (1). No qualification is capable of giving an inspector a capacity to certify that imported foods are free of Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes or E.Coli.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) (a) Yes; (b) Yes; (c) The Imported Food Control Act 1992 is concerned with human health. Newcastle disease or infectious bursal disease which are diseases of birds are controlled through the Quarantine Act 1908.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4) No. (a) The introduction of company based inspection is a small component of a wider strategy to improve food safety and meat hygiene in meat production in Australia. Company&hyphen;based inspection will largely transfer costs from the Commonwealth to meat processors. AQIS will maintain a veterinary presence at plants and meat exports will continue to be certified by AQIS based on rigorous auditing and quality assurance arrangements; and (b) the trial has extensive support.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) The transitional export licence issued to Mr Phillip Griggs for 1997 (MEPWOOD 1468) specifies that the wood chips must be produced from wood harvested in the Tasmania Region and prohibits utilisation of wood harvested in an Interim Forest Area or in an area not available for timber harvesting under a Regional Forest Agreement. However, in his application Mr Griggs advised that the area of intended operation would initially be on private property in the vicinity of `Gallaghers Road' and `Garden Island Creek Road' in the D'Entrecasteaux Channel area of Southern Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Not known.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Refer to copy of MEPWOOD 1468, attached. The varieties of wood permitted to be exported 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> under that licence are consistent with that allowed under the Interim Forest Agreement for Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) These areas are covered by the Tasmanian Interim Forest Agreement, which seeks to protect areas which may be required for a comprehensive, adequate and representative (CAR) reserve system. That Agreement followed scientific assessment of forest conservation values to ensure logging during the period of the Agreement did not foreclose options for a CAR reserve system. Licence conditions referred to in (a) above re&hyphen;inforce that protection. Also, on 28 August 1996, I designated Mr Griggs, along with other applicants for transitional licences, to the Minister for the Environment as a proponent under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. Also on that same day, pursuant to section 30(3) of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, I sought comments from the Australian Heritage Commission on the effects of a decision to grant export licences on places that are listed on the Register of the National Estate or on the Interim List of the Register of the National Estate. Further, Mr Griggs provided, as part of his application, the results of a digitised study of the Lymington forest area which provided a yield forecast and stand density assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(e) and (f) The assessment undertaken prior to the signing of the Tasmania Interim Forest Agreement was undertaken by Commonwealth and Tasmanian Government staff and was published in December 1995 in the report: `INTERIM FOREST AREAS TASMANIA Report of the Interim Forest Assessment Process'. The Minister for the Environment, Senator the Hon Robert Hill, provided his advice on 22 October 1996. The Australian Heritage Commission provided its advice on 16 October 1996. Mr Griggs provided information from the study (undertaken by an unnamed consultant) on 11 October 1996.</PARA>
