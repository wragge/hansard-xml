<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I left off last evening, I was referring to the fact that there are two fronts on which the bounties undoubtedly assist the companies in Queensland that I outlined. Firstly, they provide employment to those companies as small businesses. I think that this is particularly important, because small business is being touted by the government as the generator of employment in our community today. Here we have a government initiative which will undoubtedly impact on the ability of these small businesses to employ.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Secondly, the bounty enables these companies to be competitive in a particularly cutthroat industry. The removal of the bounty
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> will affect the capacity of these companies to operate. It will affect their employment levels and, undoubtedly, in so doing it will have a flow&hyphen;on effect for the community and, in particular, for other industries within the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission report was predicated on the continuation of, firstly, a 150 per cent R&amp;D tax concession; secondly, the EMDG and, thirdly, AusIndustry initiatives. These have all been cut and, when the bounty is cut, we will have the computer industry suffering a double whammy. It seems the shipbuilding industry has been accommodated, but now the computer industry seems to have been singled out. My colleague will be moving a suitable motion on the other sectors affected by the government's decision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The computer bounty has contributed to the growth in this nation's exports. Along with the partnerships for development program, the computer bounty saw information industry exports treble in the last five years. The government should be about supporting small business, not making the success of small business more difficult, if not impossible. I support the amendment which will be moved at a later stage by my colleague.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to speak in this second reading debate on the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill, I particularly want to focus on my own state. Although I probably should have a more global approach, I want to focus on Tasmania because of the very important part of the bill that relates to the ship bounty and, of course, our very famous Tasmanian shipbuilding company, Incat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In doing so, I will address the second reading speech of the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) in the House of Representatives going to the question of what the government did in pursuit of removing particularly the shipbuilding bounty and also the other bounties that it intended to remove. We have had more moves than those on a chessboard on these particular matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, we will hear from the minister's representative in the Senate, Senator Parer, who will tell us, `You people had planned to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4748"> do the same.' But that is not quite true. It has been stated on a number of occasions now that, in every case, we had a program of reductions in the bounties which were in line with movements in those sorts of protections in overseas countries, particularly with regard to the shipbuilding bounty. The second reading speech in the Senate says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The success of the shipbuilding industry was reported on by the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) in its March 1995 report reviewing the Ships Bounty. One of the recommendations of that report was that it was now time to consider the termination of direct bounty assistance to the industry. In the context of competition from subsidised foreign shipbuilders, the government has therefore decided as a interim measure, to extend the operation of the Ships bounty to 31 December 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will review the need for any further extension of the bounty (beyond 31 December 1997) in the second half of 1997&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which we have not got to yet&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The progress towards implementation of the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement (which provides for the cessation of official subsidies by major shipbuilders) is being closely monitored.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The government could not have been monitoring it too closely because it would not have taken the decision that it took to extend the bounty to 31 December 1997. I know that Senator Parer will get up and say that we had a plan that was only going to go to 30 June 1997. Yes; but, as I have said to the minister before, that was on the basis of the OECD agreement proceeding according to its timetable. It was supposed to take effect from January 1996, but clearly it has not. As the minister well knows, and as the department identified in estimates very recently, it is highly unlikely that the OECD agreement will ever be ratified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been a very serious degree of uncertainty in this industry. Not unlike car tariffs, and not unlike the robotics bounty and the computer bounty, the government has had to fall over in light of the pressure&mdash;and I have to say logical and commonsense pressure&mdash;that has been brought to bear by the industries of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will turn to the BIE report on which the minister seemed to hang so much of the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government's decision. In the foreword of the report, in part, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the last 20 years have seen a steady process of declining assistance and international rationalisation of shipyards, recently culminating in the OECD Agreement between the major shipbuilding nations. The Agreement is designed to terminate shipbuilding supports from January 1996&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">which I said earlier&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but with some provisions for phase&hyphen;out. It will inevitably create some uncertainty in the Australian shipbuilding industry, and the industry will take some time to assess its likely impact . . .</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I cannot understand for one minute why the government has not heeded the warnings in this report, let alone why it has tried to use it as justification for taking the steps that it took. Clearly it would not have taken that position had it read this report properly. It simply would not have done it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On page viii of the report, which is one part of the report I found somewhat unusual, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The importance of an economy&hyphen;wide approach</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report makes some important basic points about industry assistance measures, with the following messages for the shipbuilding industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, don't overestimate the value of the bounty to the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not know where that came from because further on in the report they say that the bounty was, in fact, the fundamental reason we got a new shipbuilding industry in this country. Even though it may not have been designed for that, it was one of the fundamental factors that brought about a new shipbuilding industry in this country. The report goes on further to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To a significant extent it simply compensates the industry for assistance that is provided to other Australian industries.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I really cannot understand the relevance of that. We had an ailing steel shipbuilding industry which was going out the back door. Something had to be done about that so a bounty was introduced. They also say further on in this report that it was, in effect, the very reason we got a new industry. It goes on to state:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4749">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, it follows that the loss of all or part of the bounty will not hurt as much if other Australian industries are also losing their protection, as they are.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am at a loss to understand the logic of taking away a bounty that has built an industry and remains in force&mdash;although is being phased out&mdash;to ensure that the level playing field, which we get to ultimately, remains in place, or at least in part remains in place. Section 5 of the report outlines the main recommendations. This is where you get to the point about how the government could decide that 31 December 1997 was the cut&hyphen;off date when they have a good understanding that the OECD agreement, in the first instance, is not likely to be ratified, but, secondly, contained within that was the opportunity for a three&hyphen;year phasing out for other countries that have shipbuilding industries and that we compete with. Our industry and the people involved in it have been out there in front, have been doing the work and, yes, have become competitive. I think the industry was happy to see a phasing out of the bounty, but on the basis that certain things happen.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The BIE report finally recognises that. I will read into the record some of the recommendations at section 5.2 of the report. They state in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How should assistance to bountiable shipbuilders stand relative to the rest of Australian manufacturing after June 1997? The BIE's recommendations are in four parts.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I will go quickly to subsection 2 of section 5.2, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia should seek to join the OECD Agreement unless there are strong reasons to expect that it will be ineffective. In the event that Australia joins the Agreement, the bounty would not be renewed when the current legislation expires in June 1997. There is an outside chance that the bounty will be terminated earlier, that is, if it emerges that there is a strong case for joining the Agreement before June 1997 and continuation of the bounty until June 1997 is not acceptable to existing parties Agreement's phase&hyphen;out arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Subsection 3 states&mdash;and I think this is a very important point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Australia does not join the Agreement, the average ERA to the bountiable shipbuilders in the period from 1997-98 to year 2000&hyphen;1 should be brought into line with the average ERA for manufacturing industry, that is, 5 or 6 per cent.
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is a report, which takes time to get round, which acknowledges that if the OECD agreement is either ineffective or does not come into play then the bounty should continue. This is a March 1995 report. The minister was fully aware of it. Why the government did not understand that particular subsection of the report is beyond me. They are the sorts of things that could have avoided the insecurity that the shipbuilding industry faced as a result of the government's inaction. They are the sorts of things that clearly should have been avoided, but that ultimately led to the backflip on the computer bounty and robotics bounty. The report states further in relation to the BIE's reasons:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly, the BIE's view is that the industry's first priority is to closely examine the opportunity to play on a level field.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Again, there is a very clear indication to the government and the minister in this report that there was a plan, arising out of this report, to phase the bounty out by June 1997. It was always subject to the other conditions coming into effect&mdash;the OECD agreement being a major one. Unlike the current government, we at least acknowledged, and had indicated, that should those things not happen we would continue the bounty. It is clear in this report that you would continue it at five to six per cent. The BIE further states in its reasons:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The OECD Agreement reads as a genuine multi&hyphen;lateral attempt to eliminate government supports for the shipbuilding industry. If that is how it works in practice, the elimination of support to international competitors will force prices up and thereby compensate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">and this is very important&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Australian industry for the loss of its bounty.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is true. I would have thought that would have been fairly easy to understand and yet the government for months maintained a cloud of uncertainty over the shipbuilding industry, I think costing it many opportunities to secure contracts to build further vessels that would have resulted in export earnings for this country and provided more job security, particularly for the Western Australian company and its employees. We finally did do it, but even now we have a half&hyphen;baked approach where we say, `It is going to continue through
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4750"> to 30 June 1999 and there will be a review in 1998.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not know why the government has to take that approach and why the government just cannot say that the bounty will continue in line with this report until such times as the circumstances have changed and the OECD agreement has been ratified and takes effect and then allow for the three&hyphen;year phase out. It is a fairly simple process. I was somewhat bemused by some of the things in the BIE report and the logic they applied, but at least when it came down to it they put some fairly basic steps to follow in there, yet the government cannot follow them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will go to a letter which in part formed a submission to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee which considered this legislation. The letter is from the Tasmanian Liberal Premier. I do not agree with too much of what he says but on this occasion I do sympathise with the views in the letter he forwarded to Senator Ferguson. The letter reads in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quite obviously the first jurisdiction to remove barriers, while their competition continues to have barrier protection, will be at a distinct disadvantage on the world market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Commonwealth's need to explore all measures to improve its budget position is acknowledged, the fact is that Australian companies have relied upon this bounty in negotiating contracts which were agreed prior to the knowledge that the ship building bounty will cease on 30 June 1997. With vessels now under construction, companies now face the unreasonable position of having to absorb the full value of the lost bounty into their costs of production.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Tasmanian Government strongly supports the retention of the bounty at its current rate of 5% until such time as industry assistance in overseas countries, such as the European shipbuilding nations, is removed.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Premier of Tasmania could get it right; he had a reasonable understanding. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian shipbuilding industry operates against heavily subsidised competition, particularly from Europe which receives a subsidy of at least 9%.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">That is right; we know that. If poor old Tony Rundle could get that right, then I would have thought it would have been a fairly simple thing for the government to follow through. But, no, it could not do that. It threw this
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry into a state of confusion, along with the other industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other very significant industry is that to which the book bounty applies. I would have thought the efforts of this government ought to be on import replacement. Why would we want to kill off our own industries? We have a population of a bit over 18 million and we want to lead the world, to lead the charge in removing assistance to some of our industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government can take account of the budget argument, the fiscal problems that we may have. But, at the end of the day, they will be twice as bad if we continue to throw people out of work. In a lot of other areas we have no industry strategy whatsoever coming from the government. It is about time&mdash;particularly from an employment point of view&mdash;that the government gave some serious thought to industry strategy and industry development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have stood in this place on a number of occasions and spoken about the forest industry&mdash;which has a zip strategy. It will not be too long before this industry goes further down the chute, and we will see more and more of the jobs in that industry being shipped off overseas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I call on the government to at least take some steps to provide certainty for industries that have bounty assistance and some real plans for our industries, not the current flip-flop approach we have had with the industries with which we have been dealing&mdash;particularly the car industry most recently. I urge senators to support the amendment moved by Senator Cook, because it will make this legislation much better.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The original decisions made by the government when it decided to abolish the books, machine tools and robotics, shipbuilding and computer bounties were the decisions of a naive and inexperienced government. They were so poorly considered that the government has actually had to reverse its position on a number of them. This very fact sums up what everyone knows and has been saying ever since the government launched an  all&hyphen;out assault on industry assistance mecha
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4751"> nisms, without any concern for the long&hyphen;term implications. This government has had no industry policy. It still does not have an industry policy, but at least it now is aware of this, and has undertaken the Mortimer review in the hope of rectifying this serious deficiency. At least the government is not making errors of judgment on the scale it made in its first year in office and at least it has had the courage to reverse some of its decisions, if not all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should not forget that, when the government made its decision to abolish the bounties, the industry minister and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) defended the position. Maybe the industry minister defended the position because the Treasurer made him&mdash;because since he certainly has shown a different mettle. The government said that the decisions had been well considered&mdash;they were not&mdash;and told us that they would not detrimentally affect employment or manufacturing activity&mdash;and they did. The government has recognised they were not good decisions and, therefore, has reversed some of them, for which we thank it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why has the government decided to extend, rather than cut short, the shipbuilding bounty? Why has it reversed its decision to phase out the machine tools and robotics bounty ahead of schedule? The answer is because the decisions were poor and because they have affected investment, jobs, growth and exports. As we now know, the government's dithering about has cost substantial contracts, particularly to the shipbuilders. But that, I am afraid, has happened, and we have to wear that. The decisions to prematurely remove the computer and books bounties were also poor decisions. Unfortunately, these industries have not benefited from the government's slow awakening.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government had only one objective when it set out on its assault on bounties and other industry and export assistance measures: short&hyphen;term revenue savings. There was no cost benefit analysis, no sensitivity analysis, no medium&hyphen; to long&hyphen;term assessment of the effects on the economy, on jobs and on the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> communities from its assault on these industry assistance measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Focusing only on government expenditure levels in such a short-sighted manner will not safeguard Australia's long&hyphen;term prosperity nor will it generate, let alone retain, jobs. Abolishing these bounties will, in the opinion of the Australian Democrats, abolish jobs. It will, in the opinion of the Australian Democrats, diminish our manufacturing sector. And those are views shared by the manufacturing sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of us in this chamber know that the manufacturing sector is stressed and it needs assistance in the areas of jobs, investment, growth and exports. What occurs when critical support measures are removed, regardless of the broader economic impact and regardless of the specific impacts on the industries in question, are not just the measurable effects but the immeasurable effects of a lack of confidence, of insecurity and of poor planning decisions resulting from those effects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government has argued that these bounties can be abolished because they are only a minor determinant of profitability and competitiveness for these industries, and that manufacturing activity would therefore continue unaffected. But cost benefit analyses of the impacts on jobs, investment, growth and competitiveness of abolishing these bounties were not undertaken. In other words, those were assertions; they were not empirically or objectively based.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By contrast, industry representatives&mdash;even if we accept their clear self&hyphen;interest in so arguing&mdash;have provided and presented evidence showing that bounties have enabled domestic manufacturers to expand market share and, by adding to revenue, have fostered industry investment and development. This has been crucial to supporting employment and improving competitiveness. Moreover, this was confirmed by the Industry Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government thinks otherwise, then it should table a detailed empirical objective analysis showing why. Neither in an estimates process nor in hearings nor in any sector has the government been able to respond on that
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4752"> basis. The government should respond on that basis, because bounties are part of an industry assistance package which affects very considerable industry sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In South Australia, for example, the sectors covered by the four bounties&mdash;the books bounty is important within that&mdash;account for approximately eight per cent of total employment, and more than eight per cent of value added in the manufacturing sector. Moreover, the machine tools and robotics industries, the shipbuilding industry and the computer hardware industry are the types of growth industries that we need to encourage as we move towards the 21st century. They are research and development intensive. Research and development constitutes a significant percentage of turnover compared to manufacturing generally. This means that they employ high skilled, high wage labour, and are heavily export oriented.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not just the impact of the bounty cuts that needs to be considered. The impact of the removal of the bounty needs to be assessed in tandem with the cuts the government has made to research and export assistance programs. The 150 per cent tax concession for R&amp;D was effectively halved by reducing the rate to 125 per cent, and the export market development grants program was severely curtailed, as was the DIFF program. These programs were highly valued by these research and export intensive industries. Coupled with the impact of the abolition of bounty assistance, the end result will be to weaken our manufacturing base and to destroy jobs, not create jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But this did not figure in the government's and, particularly, in the Treasurer's consideration. He just has a one-eyed kind of accountant's view of balancing the books. That is very important, but it is not the only responsibility of this government. Nor did it occur to the government to consult fully at the time with the industries concerned. In fact, the decisions affecting the book and machine tools and robotics manufacturers were taken prior to the completion of Productivity Commission inquiries into each of these industries. The government's decisions actually go further in winding back assistance than rec
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ommended by the Industry Commission in draft reports, which were publicly released at that time. The draft reports for both of those industries, not surprisingly, recommended that these bounties be phased out on their scheduled termination date. I say `not surprisingly' because the Industry Commission has a reputation for ideology.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Industry Commission did not, however, recommend that they be abolished beforehand, as the government attempted. That is the second major problem. Not only did they not do the analysis and assess the impact on the economy but they were going to break our contractual committed word. Breach of contract, as we found in the DIFF situation and our foreign affairs bungling, is a very bad thing for government to have laid on it. The fact is that there is a strong case to be made that bounties with a known and accepted expiry date represent contractual obligations between government and the industries concerned. These contracts should not be broken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting to note that, during the recent debates over the assistance for the car industry, the government said it would not make a decision until the final Productivity Commission report had been completed and that they would not release the final report until they had made a decision on future assistance for the car industry. The Treasurer insisted this was conventional procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If this is conventional procedure, then why did the government treat the machine tools and robotics manufacturers and the book industry with such contempt? Why did they bother to put them through the efforts of making submissions and supplementary submissions and appearing before public hearings if the whole exercise was to have no bearing on the government's decision, which was based on other considerations? Why have the government still not released the final reports? The final draft of the book industry report was apparently completed in October last year. The machine tools and robotics bounties final report was completed in August last year&mdash;nearly a year ago.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The answer is obvious to us. These industries do not carry as much weight as car manufacturers in this government's view. You
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4753"> are perfectly at liberty to prioritise industries and manufacturers as you see fit, but ignoring these people because they do not carry as much electoral weight is not a good reason to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">An industry composed of a large number of small to medium sized firms apparently does not rank as highly, as worthy or as important as an industry composed of a handful of global giants. But the fact is that both the global giants and those small and medium sized firms are integral to our social and economic wellbeing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The book industry has been the recipient of particularly poor treatment. Not only are the government still seeking to abolish their bounty ahead of schedule but they are prepared to leave incentives weighted in favour of offshore, rather than domestic, production. That again is an area of bias which the government needs to correct. Stop pushing offshore production ahead of domestic production. The government are prepared to advantage imports over Australian manufacturing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under the Florence agreement, fully imported books are brought in duty free while inputs such as paper enjoy a five per cent tariff. This effectively leaves book producers with a negative rate of assistance and, unlike the computer and shipbuilding industries whose bounties are also at risk, no alternative or compensatory assistance measures have been considered. It is not surprising, therefore, that preliminary results of a recent survey by the Australian Publishers Association indicate that printing in Australia is declining rapidly, whereas offshore printing is rapidly increasing. I cannot see why that is in the interests of your government or this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats believe that, as a minimum, the book bounty should be retained at an equivalent rate to the general tariff rate, at least until such time as compensatory measures are put in place to offset the negative assistance to an effective rate of zero. We should not be giving up any advantage for our industries unless there is an equivalent international competitive advantage for us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The shipbuilding industry was the most fortunate of the four being considered, but
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> they were only fortunate because of an unusual alliance of strong forces which pushed forward the change. Those forces included the political forces of the Democrats and the Labor Party, of Premier Court in Western Australia and of a very vigorous lobbying effort by the industry concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To date, the shipbuilding industry has performed extremely well, with almost 90 per cent of production being exported. Its strengths lie in niche areas, such as high speed aluminium ferries&mdash;where Australian builders supply about one-third of total world demand&mdash;and defence projects such as submarines and frigates. Enjoying one-third of total world demand as a market share was the very area that the government was going to put at risk. How can you claim to be strong and capable economic managers when you take such a risk with such an important niche industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While Australian shipbuilders are highly export oriented, unfortunately, they compete in an environment of high subsidies by foreign governments. Fortunately, the government undertook a complete policy reversal, and Minister Moore is to be congratulated for eventually coming to that view. This bill initially sought to prematurely abolish the shipbuilding bounty. Now it actually extends it six months. I hope they will continue to review it during those six months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision to extend their bounty is welcome news. It required a great deal of lobbying before the government was convinced to move in the right direction&mdash;in the direction which will safeguard jobs, investment, exports and growth in that industry. Unfortunately, the government is still proposing to phase it out prior to the European Union phasing out assistance measures for their shipbuilders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We cannot continue on that basis. No giving up Australian advantage and no giving up Australian competitiveness until there is an equivalent international commitment. That is all. It is a very simple mantra you need to adopt&mdash;you will not give up anything for Australia unless our international competitors give it up too. That is all; it is very simple.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of ensuring our manufacturers are on as level a playing field as possible with their key international competitors is understood in theory by the government, but has not yet been fully accepted by all elements of the government, particularly those who belong to the small, elitist and fundamentalist school of thought characterised by the H.R. Nicholls Society adherents. For this reason, the Democrats will seek to extend this bounty to ensure we give equal support to our industry as that provided by the European Union until such time as the European Union changes its assistance rates. If we fail in this attempt, we will support the government's extension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's policy reversal with respect to the machine tools and robotics bounty is also welcome. The bounty will no longer be prematurely abolished and retrospective impacts will be avoided. This was of concern because a number of companies would have been placed under considerable burden had they been forced to pay back bounty payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the fact is that the bounty is being abolished. This industry is fundamental to the entire manufacturing sector. It supplies leading-edge technologies to many other sectors, including and especially, I think, the car industry sector, and it is an important source of innovation and skills. In other words, it is an industry of the future which deserves nurturing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bounty has been instrumental in the growth of the industry. It has had 20 per cent per annum growth in exports over the last 10 years. That is not something we should put at risk. Allowing the bounty to lapse without any alternative assistance mechanisms means the end of a successful industry program which was critical to fostering the growth of firms in this sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In conclusion, the policy reversals over shipbuilding and machine tools and robotics are welcome but they are not enough. They are only piecemeal measures undertaken in isolation. The government must go much further&mdash;and we recognise it does intend to do so&mdash;in refining its approach to industry policy. In partnership with each of these
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> industry sectors, the government must urgently formulate industry development plans by sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Critical issues affecting the growth of these industries must be addressed and appropriate support measures must be implemented to ensure domestic manufacturers are not at a disadvantage with their international competitors. Failure to do so will mean failure to deliver on jobs. It will attack jobs, not create jobs. Unemployment is, Minister, the most crucial issue of our time and of your government. Solutions are needed and industry policy is, and must be, one of the primary solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, the first 1&half; years of your government has seen the loss of tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the economy overall. It is not something you are happy with&mdash;it is not something anyone is happy with&mdash;but we have in this bill one small element in recreating a situation in which we can create jobs and improve the job situation, not destroy and attack them.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, for those of us who have been involved in the fight to save Australia's shipbuilding industry, the news that the government will extend the shipbuilding bounty to cover ships contracted for and completed within three years is welcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But this concession, however welcome, does not fully solve the problem it was meant to address. Several months ago in Hobart over one thousand ship building workers signed an open letter which was been sent to every federal politician. In that letter they asked us to represent them and use our votes to extend the ship building bounty. Not indefinitely. Just until they can compete fairly with their european competitors  the extension of the bounty only addresses some of their concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have seen the government abolish the bounty, change their minds and extend it to June this year. Think again and change the cutoff date to December. Now the three year completion clause has been hastily added.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lack of strategic direction and sound industry policy on the part of two successive state liberal governments and federal government bludgeoning of the state through budgetary and other decisions have cost the state thousands of jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania has lost 6400 full time jobs in the past fourteen months. In terms of total employment including part-time and casual work, the jobs loss over the same period is 7200. This pattern of job losses  looks to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past months, Tasmanians have opened their newspapers to see headlines like: "Tassie reels as jobs woe grows."

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A recent yellow pages survey found that 20 per cent of small business in Tasmania identified a lack of markets as the most important barrier to investment.This was backed up by a similar finding in the recent Tasmanian chamber of commerce and industry survey of small business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's lack of industry policy means that industry remains deeply  reluctant to expand and provide new jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania is also vulnerable due to the narrowness of its industrial base. Seven companies employ approximately ten  thousand Tasmanian's.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A threat by any one of these employers to leave Tasmania has in the past caused political instability and a loss of confidence in the overall Tasmanian economy. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Had not a significant number of people stopped seeking work- Tasmania's unemployment figure would have been much worse.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increasingly grave situation in Tasmania looks like getting worse when national forecasts are taken into consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conservative economists are now predicting a significant rise in national unemployment in the coming months. Annex's Saul Eastlake predicts a national rate of 9 per cent by June 1997. Where will the Tasmanian rate be? At eleven percent? At twelve percent?  The current Tasmanian government has no answer to the federal government's attack on our state.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Liberal Senators and Members of the House of Representatives have done nothing. Pleas for special treatment have fallen on the deaf ears of both the Prime Minister and Treasurer. The latest budget confirms they haven't been listening.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania has got specific needs. Federal decisions which affect Tasmania should be preceded by a full study of the economic and social impact of those decisions on the state.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And yet the federal government continues to make decisions on the run which cost Tasmanian jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first Howard budget produced savage cuts to community services and public programs and has further added to the severe strain on our economy. The second has continued that trend.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's original decision not to continue the shipbuilding bounty put an incredible strain on one of our most important industries and demonstrated the federal governments lack of a coherent industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is simply not good enough for the Prime Minister to describe industry policy as "a pretty limited debate" as he did on ABC radio in December last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian workers and industry deserve better.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Prime Minister's statement demonstrates clearly that his government has no vision for the Australian manufacturing industry and that industry policy is not a priority for either the Prime Minister or his government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current do nothing approach of the federal government which leaves industry to the vagaries of the market approach demonstrates a single minded adherence to the free market philosophy.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sadly this leaves industry without policy guidelines and puts ever greater pressure on the social fabric. This will inevitably lead to greater unemployment. This is particularly true for Tasmania as the unemployment trend so clearly demonstrates.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need a planned economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need a government which responds rapidly to ensure continuing growth. Government needs to unite with industry, educational institutions, and in Australia's case the trade unions, to forge a new model for industrial co-operation and development. The goal of such an alliance should be to provide industry with a suitable mix of industry incentives, an educated workforce and a workforce which is included not excluded from the process of decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The divide and conquer advice and policies of the free marketeers who advocate more privatisation, corporatisation, deregulation, diversification, and the dismantling of the public sector is the absolute opposite of what we need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal government must recognise the need for a strong and workable industry policy. Alan Hanberg of the Australian chamber of manufacturers describes the Australian people as frightened."  Tasmanians share that fear.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unemployed and poor live with it daily.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hanberg has also noted that employment will not grow while the government continues to inhibit industry by cutting job training programmes, slashing development grants, and placing taxes on imported equipment essential for real growth in the manufacturing sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Above all else, Tasmanians must have work. Those in work must know that the government is committed to maintaining their jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those who do not have work must know that the first priority of the government's industry policy is the maintenance and creation of viable and sustainable jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Tasmania does not get back to work it faces the very real danger of becoming less and less economically viable. It is rapidly becoming a state where unemployment and social dislocation are the norm for many of our citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania has suffered large cuts to federal government programmes which have hit the state's ability to export. A break on tariffs until the year 2005 would still meet APEC and world trade obligations and allow Tasmanian clothing, footwear and textile companies to compete internationally on equal terms with our trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cuts to the export market development grants have seen significant cuts to export activity and has reduced the money available to help exporters.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Export businesses need security if they are to grow and expand their markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is in this environment that the government prevaricated and kept changing its mind about the shipbuilding bounty. The ship building industry in Australia has grown from humble beginnings in the mid nineteen eighties to an industry which has generated an estimated 600 million dollars in exports in 1996 and some twelve thousand jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only has the industry expanded enormously in the past ten years but it has a great future. The world wide fleet of high speed vessels is expanding at a rapid rate in response to passenger demand and changes to maritime regulation. The increasing demand for the development of high speed freight guarantees a future market for high speed vessels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is the very market that Incat, the ship building industry in Tasmania, is poised to dominate. I would like to describe the contribution Incat makes to the Tasmanian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1996, Tasmania's total exports totalled one thousand, six hundred and seventy seven million dollars. Incat's contribution to that figure was one hundred and eighty million dollars or ten point seven percent. Estimated export figures for 1997 put Incat at two hundred and sixty seven million or fifteen percent of the total.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fifteen percent of the export effort of the state.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1995-96 financial year, Incat paid two million in payroll tax. The taxes paid by Incat over the past four years exceed payments made to the company in the form of bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, in the 1995-96 financial year, Incat paid out in excess of seventeen and a half million dollars in state and federal taxes and received less than nine and a half million in bounty compensation. In 1988, Incat had thirty-one employees. As at the twentieth of February, Incat had nine hundred and twenty seven permanent employees, one hundred and twenty- one apprentices, seventeen-job skill workers and four casual staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This company employs point seven six percent of the state's full time work force, four percent of its apprentices and seven point four percent of its trainees. Incat is the largest private employer in the state and we cannot afford to lose this industry off shore because of this government's determination  to dismantle any and all of the decisions of the previous government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Incat is now building ships in China.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While we can celebrate this successful collaborative venture, Incat's domestic activity must also be retained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This industry is not looking for hand outs. All the industry wants is a level playing field.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Here government can help.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 and to support the opposition's amendment and the remarks of my colleagues, particularly those of Senator Cook, the former industry minister. I believe this legislation shows, as Senator Murray has just eloquently described, a complete lack of an industry policy by this government and a complete lack of a holistic approach to the development of Australian industry in the manufacturing sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The quarterly account figures that came out only a few weeks ago showed that the manufacturing sector in Australia is in recession. Two consecutive quarters of negative growth in any terms is an indictment on the government. It is an indictment on the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite having the manufacturing sector in recession, I cannot recollect any major statement of interest or even concern by the minister for industry about the fact that the manufacturing industry is now in recession in Australia. One would have thought the minister responsible overwhelmingly for our manufacturing sector would have at least  made some attempt to indicate what his policies and his government's policies were to overcome the manufacturing sector recession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we did get from a range of ministers was, `Oh, well interest rates are going down. This will encourage investment. And with a reduction of the government's deficit, all of this will create confidence in manufacturing. There will be investment and manufacturing will miraculously be turned around and become positive.' Various industry surveys have showed that that is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There may be some increased investment in some sectors associated with manufacturing&mdash;such as in Minister Parer's own area of resources&mdash;which is extremely welcomed and supported by the opposition, and that may
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4758"> create some manufacturing sector jobs as those major resource developments, such as the North West Shelf et cetera, take place, but overwhelmingly they will not give a boost in the manufacturing sector to those industries that are identified as providing the majority of employment in Australia in manufacturing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we want to see from this government is a commitment to develop a holistic industry policy. What we have instead from this government is a considerable interest in resources. The Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) is a very strong enthusiast in this chamber. If we get one more dorothy dixer from his own side, when he stands up and explains the wonders of what his sector is doing, we will all go to sleep. They are the most ubiquitous dorothy dixers of all time. The minister has had significant victories over the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) on resource issues, et cetera. It indicates that this government has enthusiasm for the resource sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson), a senior minister, and the Leader of the National Party of Australia and Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) are always enthusiastically talking about agriculture. They have to, because that is their political base in the rural sector. But why can't we have an industry minister as enthusiastic about manufacturing as Mr Anderson is or appears to be about the rural sector, even though the prices in the rural sector are not exactly moving along at a rate that we would all like to see, or speaking with the enthusiasm of Senator Parer for the resources sector? Why can't we have that from Mr Moore? Why can't we have that from the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser) in the industry portfolio?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We get nothing at all, and this is indicated in the bill. The bill is put up to make changes to bounties, as Senator Murray and Senator Cook have said. We are delighted that, after a lot of pressure from the opposition, the Democrats and the industry in particular, the government has backed off on some of the crazed decisions it made last year in the budget to abolish those bounties. I have always had a particular interest in the ship
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> building industry from my own ministerial days. It is pleasing to see that the government has backed away from bowling over the shipbuilding bounty and has now extended it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray just made a very good point which I have spoken of in this place in the last 15 months: we should not abolish the shipbuilding bounty until we get a commitment from all the other OECD countries that they will sign up to the OECD shipping agreement. This will get rid of all the other tariff subsidy and other non-tariff protectionist measures that the other OECD countries have to protect shipbuilding. I mentioned here before: when will the American Congress repeal the Jones act that prohibits the purchase for domestic use in America of Australian-made fast ferries, a market that is substantial? When the American Congress passes the repeal of the Jones act we can see that they are serious. When the Italians, the Norwegians, the Danes and the Germans in particular get rid of the subsidies and non-tariff protective measures that they have for their shipbuilding industry in the area we are competitive in, fast ferries, then we will know they are serious and we will put ours on the table as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Before the last election the then shadow minister for trade, Mr Tim Fischer, made a great point that he thought there should be more bilateral negotiations to reduce protectionist measures in countries where we are in  the same market. He criticised us when we were in government of being too reliant on multilateral arrangements to reduce protection. He was going to be the trade minister who would negotiate country to country in specific sectors to remove protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Here is a case in point with the shipbuilding industry. What is Mr Fischer doing to get rid of the protective measures, such as the Jones act, the other subsidies in the European Community and the non&hyphen;tariff restriction in Japan that make it almost impossible for a fast ferry manufacturer in Australia to sell a fast ferry into the Japanese ferry market? There are apparently 3,000 ferries operating around the coast of Japan and the inland sea. We can produce ferries of a higher quality and with better technology at a much lower
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4759"> price than any Japanese shipyard, yet we find it very difficult to get those ferries into the Japanese markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We did get one contract for a ship from Austel back in 1994-95, but the Japanese transport department insisted that a Japanese inspector be placed in the Australian shipyard in Perth full time and paid for by the shipping company to ensure that all the Japanese so-called safety regulations and design regulations were met. This was a cost, but it was still borne by our shipyard and we were still able to build a competitive ship. When the ferry was delivered to Japan, the same department then insisted on remeasuring the whole of the ship to make sure again it met the regulations, even though they had their own official based for 12 months or more in Perth doing the same thing. These are the non-tariff protective measures that countries use against us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the Minister for Trade were fair dinkum before the last election about his policy of bilateral discussion and negotiation, the shipbuilding industry is one industry where he can put his efforts to great effect, backed up by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) and the weight of government. Can Mr Fischer give us any examples of bilateral negotiations where we have had success in removing the areas covered by this bill, that is, robots, shipbuilding and book bounties? Can he give us any examples where, as part of negotiations by the trade minister on a bilateral basis we have removed protective measures? I certainly want to hear about it in the shipbuilding industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are concerned that, because the government does not have any holistic approach to industry policy, it is putting this measure forward in no context other than as a one&hyphen;off. That is why we have moved the second reading amendment and Senator Cook will be moving other amendments in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second reading amendment which is on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> today has four paragraphs. There is now a paragraph (e) which has been added and which I understand has been circulated. The second reading amendment
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> outlines, in a very simple way, the opposition's position on industry policy. Paragraph (a) says it all:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> rejects outright the Government's failure to develop and implement a policy for Australian manufacturing industry and is of the view that, because of the inevitable impact this bill will have on employment, the bill would be more appropriately referred to as the Bounty Legislation (Export of Australian Jobs) Amendment Bill.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Where is the industry policy? I know the Minister for Resources and Energy is very enthusiastic about increasing exports of raw commodities from Australia, and so are we. We want to support and will support in every way possible the increase of those exports. We have a chronic current account deficit in this country and the countries with which we have the biggest trade deficits are countries that have high value added manufactures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have a trade surplus with all of the developing economies of South&hyphen;East Asia. The one country in Asia which has high value added products, with which we have a trade surplus, is Japan because of our high exports of commodities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The countries with which we have a high trade deficit are the United States and Western Europe. What do we import from all of those countries? High value added manufactures. All of those countries in world&hyphen;wide terms&mdash;in Western Europe and Japan&mdash;which  have high trade surpluses are exporters of high value added manufactures. The only way we are going to get our current account deficit down is to encourage every area of export of our primary products and our mining industry and to get high value added exports going such as our shipbuilding industry building fast ferries. Lots of people are employed to make those ferries which are world competitive, and we can earn several hundred million a year, as we already are, even in a rorted market overseas. That industry employs lots of people and earns a high return for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government do not seem to understand. If they want to get the current account deficit down, they will not do it just by exporting coal, iron&hyphen;ore, bauxite and natural gas. That will all help; there is no argument
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4760"> about that. We have to get our value added industries improving in exports, including our service industries. Until we do that, we will always run a current account deficit and will always have a problem. It will not be solved only by reducing the government deficit. That will not resolve it by itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We need a comprehensive industry policy which this government has failed to deliver. We have an industry minister who is not interested in even fighting for a comprehensive policy. He will fight for an individual area once the pressure is put on him. He will come and fight for tariffs in the car industry, but the tariff issue is not the only part of industry policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We argue for a fully fledged industry policy that encourages a whole range of initiatives. For example, we support export market development grants, the DIFF scheme and programs that encourage our SMEs in Australia to become export oriented&mdash;the hundreds of thousands looking to become world competitive. Even if we get only 20,000 or 30,000 of them into exports, that would certainly be a major improvement on our current account deficit. This industry minister has allowed most of those programs to be destroyed over the last 15 months. Therefore, again in great sorrow&mdash;particularly those of us who have some previous association with the industry portfolio&mdash;we note that the industry policy is being wound back, displaced and lost. There is no longer any comprehensive view.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Minister, we know you are an enthusiast for resources. That is your job. We do not criticise that in any way, but would you please ask your fellow industry ministers, Mr Moore and Mr Prosser, to be as enthusiastic about developing and supporting manufacturing industry in Australia. I commend the opposition's amendment and trust the Senate will carry it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their contribution to the debate on the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1997. We have heard a considerable amount in this debate about how essential the various bounties are to the survival of firms and to the sectors which use them. The government has, on a number of occasions, acknowledged the role that bounty assistance has played in the development of the industry sectors which utilise them. The fact remains, however, that the actual rates of assistance have fallen significantly over recent years as a result of policies implemented by the now opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The industries that utilise the four bounties covered by the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 have been able to adjust. The Industry Commission book bounty review noted, for example, that production of bountiable books had increased by over 50 per cent in real terms since 1992 when the bounty rate was falling. Nevertheless, the government has recognised that circumstances do exist which warrant some alterations to the provisions of the existing bill. For this reason, I will be moving, in the committee stage, an amendment that extends the shipbuilding bounty  from the current termination date of 31 December 1997 until 30 June 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These changes address uncertainties for the Australian industry surrounding the ratification of the OECD shipbuilding agreement which is aimed at eliminating subsidies to shipbuilding. I might also point out that the amendments that we will be moving in the committee stage are the result of industry discussions between Minister Moore and the shipbuilding industry, and the industry supports those legislative amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also point out, because of questions raised in respect of the OECD agreement, that the minister has agreed that a review panel would be established, consisting of a nominee of the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4761"> minister, a nominee of the industry and an agreed independent chairman, to consider a number of things, all of which are important; you cannot take one particular item and say, `This is the thing that counts.' I will go through the list for the Senate: the long&hyphen;term strategic direction of the industry; the productivity and efficiency of the industry; the market conditions of the industry; the cost&hyphen;benefit factors of the industry, and I think that picks up something Senator Murray has foreshadowed he will move at the committee stage; the OECD and other competing arrangements; an improved method of monitoring and reviewing claims; and consideration of any transitional arrangements in the event of entry into force of the OECD shipbuilding agreement. The panel is to report by 30 June 1998, which is well in advance of when our amendment on the bounty would expire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government will, of course, be opposing the second reading amendment circulated by Senator Cook. The government has already announced its intention to extend the shipbuilding bounty to 30 June 1999 and I would remind the Senate that this, as I indicated, has the support of the industry itself. The government cannot accept an open&hyphen;ended proposal to keep the bounty going until the OECD agreement is in place. There are a lot of other factors, and I think I have gone through those particular points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In his speech on the second reading, Senator Cook indicated that the Industry Commission recommended that the computer bounty should continue. I would like to correct Senator Cook on this. The Industry Commission report in 1995 said that the computer bounty should lapse. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The force of the argument underpinning the compensation rationale for the computer bounty has been substantially eroded by general reductions in tariffs, changes in the focus of industry policy and developments in the IT industries, which now bear little resemblance to the IT industries of 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bounty is paid predominantly on the production of hardware. Bounty is not paid on the bulk of software development system design and integration and IT services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">As senators would know, particularly Senator Cook, the latter activities have been the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> strength in Australia and account for 80 per cent of our IT production.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I think I am correcting a comment you made, Senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Murray indicated that the whole process of getting rid of the bounty on computers was revenue driven. There is no doubt that last year in the budget, when we confronted the huge deficit that we inherited of some $10 billion, we had to take some hard decisions, and there is certainly an element of that in the decision to go down that track. But I think it is worth reporting, as I have, what the Industry Commission actually said; and the recommendation, which was recommendation No. 6, was that the computer bounty should lapse.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point I would like to draw to the attention of  the Senate is that Senator Cook would understand that failure to pass this bill will allow the computer bounty to continue to the year 2000 and the book bounty to finish in December this year. It will, of course, mean that the shipbuilding bounty will terminate on 30 June this year, just one week away, rather than there being the benefit of the extension until mid&hyphen;1999.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have indicated that in the committee stage I will be moving amendments for the extension of the shipbuilding bounty until 1999. They address the industry's concerns. We will also, of course, be amending the bill to remove the existing provisions covering  machine tools and robots so that they will now terminate at 30 June 1997, as set out in the current act, rather than last year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Rather than waste the time of the Senate, I just want to record that the government does not support this amendment, but we recognise that we do not have the numbers.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">This amendment really refers to a theme that the minister knows and Senator Cook knows, as he has been with me on most of those things, I have been pursuing ever since I entered this place&mdash;that is, government decisions are carried out without proper regard to evaluating the effects that they have.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In one of our committee inquiries I outlined the situation where we had inquired of the government advisers when they would find out whether the effects of their decisions were bad or good for Australia. We were talking particularly about jobs and the health of the industry. The eventual answer I got was three years. It frightened the life out of me that, in a situation where you have very high unemployment, a government should be making decisions without understanding what their effects are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Quite simply, I would like the government to adopt a practical, modern and corporate system of doing cost&hyphen;benefit or sensitivity analysis for its decisions in critical areas. I am as acquainted as you are with the dangers of models and trying to be too precise in these things. We have just had the example of the car industry inquiries where the three models all came up with different answers. I accept the limitations in that approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nevertheless, without being overprescriptive as to how the minister should respond, what I am seeking here is that there should be laid before both houses of the parliament, when any rate of bounty change is to come into effect, a report containing a cost&hyphen;benefit analysis of the relevant bounty scheme, including an assessment of the impact on employment, exports, investment, growth and international competitiveness of the cessation of the bounty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Simply put, if we had a two or three per cent unemployment rate and our current account deficit was not what it is currently and our foreign liabilities were not what they are currently, it would not be as important because the effects of what you did might not matter. In this economic climate, with debt, foreign liabilities and our unemployment rates what they are, we really need to be very careful about changing carefully crafted industry assistance programs before we are sure of what the effects could be.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition supports this amendment. This is a very sensible amendment. In many respects, I wish I had thought of it myself. I pay respect to Senator Murray for putting it forward. This amendment, if carried, would insert in all of the bounty bills a prevention clause&mdash;a clause which would prevent the government of the day enacting the stupidity that this government went ahead with after the last budget by unilaterally, without warning and without a forethought, cutting the levels of bounty across the board and ending bounty arrangements that many companies had planned to access in their strategic plans, thus disrupting the business affairs of those companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my speech in the second reading debate yesterday I referred to the book industry. That is one industry that has done some cost&hyphen;benefit analysis of the effect of the cut of the bounty. Without going back over all of the figures again, let me refer to the main point. The bounty in that industry, according to the calculations conducted by the industry association, amounts to $5 million. But when one considers the loss of PAYE tax to the government, the loss of payroll tax to the government and the payment of unemployment benefits, you come to a net negative impact of the cut of the bounty of $28.3 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government leapt into the dark in the case of this industry and maintains its leap into the dark; it will not relent in the book industry, as we understand it at this moment. But here is a calculation conducted by the industry itself. After surveying its members, after working out what part of the industry may go offshore as a consequence of these changes and looking at the levels of unemployment, it comes up with a figure in which the government has dudded its own bottom line in the budget. That type of proposition deserves an answer. The government has not ever given an answer to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Senate Economics Legislation Committee report into this legislation is a very useful document to go back and read in this debate. All of the industry organisations that came forward and gave evidence were unanimous
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> in saying that the bounties are important for cash flow and are used for capital investment or research and development. They were unanimous in saying that the bounties are necessary to compensate for the disadvantage of small local markets and competition from multinational companies, that the bounties are important because their termination would lead to production moving offshore with the loss of Australian jobs and adverse effects on the balance of payments, that the bounties are important because bounty payments are taxable income and so part of the bounty is recouped in the form of company tax and that the bounties may well be budget positive after taking into account downstream effects such as tax revenue from the economic activity that the bounty stimulates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So all industry organisations were of a common view, as the book industry was, about the negative effect of cutting the bounties. They all went on and agreed that the termination of the bounties interacts negatively with all the other recent changes which have made life more difficult in the sectors of industry&mdash;changes to the tariff concession scheme, to R&amp;D, to the export market development grants scheme and the development import finance facility. They are changes which across the board have affected the ability of particularly small companies to compete. At the time of the evidence, the strengthening of the Australian dollar was also making those companies uncompetitive. The dollar seems to be heading into a bit of a nosedive at the moment, so maybe that is a bit less of a constraint.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">They also were unanimous in that termination is premature and&mdash;this is important&mdash;without sufficient notice or consultation and will make difficulties for manufacturers who have entered long-term contracts; the earlier termination dates proposed in the legislative amendments may impose an undue burden on businesses which have planned their operations on the basis of known statutory termination dates. The final point that they all made in common was that termination will create anomalies in the tariff regime in which imported final goods are duty free but import
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4764"> ed inputs are dutiable, which is a positive disincentive to manufacture in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Democrats' amendment would put a requirement on governments to look at all of those factors before a government leaps into the dark, and willy-nilly and unilaterally slashes bounty arrangements that have been carefully considered by previous governments, have been under review by the Industry Commission, have been the subject of industry&hyphen;government consultations and are the basis of long-term planning by industry. The government is just slashing them across the board without knowing their effects. In doing that, it is creating a negative outcome for the budget bottom line, confusion in the minds of industry, and unemployment for workers in the industry as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I support this amendment and hope the government can see the merit of it, too. Given that at least it has bothered to consult in depth with industry leaders in one industry&mdash;the shipbuilding industry&mdash;the government has come to a view, as the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) has just said in his second reading speech, that these factors and similar factors ought to be considered in respect of the post year 2000 arrangements for the ship industry; they ought to be considered after consultation with that industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That begs the question: if it is fine for the ship industry&mdash;I believe it is right for that to happen&mdash;why is it not fine for the book industry? Why is it not fine for the computer industry? Why is that type of consultation and joint planning about the parameters in which industry must develop not fine for the machine tools and robotics industry of Australia? Why is it fine for just one industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government cannot answer that question in truth. The real answer is that this industry lobbied more effectively than the others. That is the only answer to that question&mdash;might is right; commonsense and a logical framework are not right. I have to say very strongly that the shipbuilding industry is right, and the government has moved to a far better position and ought to be commended for that. But, in contrast, it ought to do the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> same for all the other industry sectors, too. This amendment would enable them to do so. I  support it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is dangerous. My view is that it is very simplistic. With each of these industries, there is a series of reviews going on that are considering all of the points that you have made in your amendment. For example, we have the Goldsworthy review of IT, which is vital; we have the various Industry Commission reports; and we have the BIE and the Mortimer, and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know that you have put this up as a general principle, not related to any specific industry, and I understand that. Bear in mind, however, that, when we are paying a bounty, we are using taxpayers' money to pay the bounty; therefore, it must be justified. As I said in my wrap&hyphen;up of the second reading, in the particular industries we are referring to today, a lot of good work has been done in and has come out of that. However, the concern that I have, as a general principle&mdash;I am not referring to any of the industries we are talking about today, whether it be shipbuilding, IT or others&mdash;is that it would be easy to have an analysis done which would say, `Yes, tick off on employment and tick off on all these other things' for what could well be a dying industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want to get too philosophical, because we do not want to prolong the de bate. I have always been a great believer in the law of comparative advantage: where you have special things in your own country that you can develop that are more attractive and can be better done in your own country than another country, you should go down that track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What I do not believe in is trying to reinvent the wheel. Again, I hope I am not out of call by saying this, but it would seem to me that it would be fairly silly, having seen all the work go on in, say, the United States
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4765"> and some of the Asian countries, to try to introduce a Silicon Valley into Australia. It does not make any sense to me. We are a very fortunate country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Schacht tended to emphasise the raw material side. That is not our entire emphasis. What we are seeing in this country today is an enormous move into downstream processing or value adding based on comparative advantage. I did not really mean to get into that philosophical argument. All I am saying to you is that I believe the approach you are putting, while it has popular appeal, is simplistic. It does not recognise all these detailed reports that are done on specific industries. I think the one we are all looking forward to is the Goldsworthy report on IT. So, for that reason, and without having the benefit of being able to study it in more detail, we will not support the amendment.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister Parer, if we were populists, we would be either the government or the official opposition, and the fact that we are not populists is probably the reason we are a minority party. In response to remarks like that, I appreciate the honesty and openness with which you have addressed the issue. I do not want this to sound at all patronising, but I felt sorry for you and other ministers last year after the budget because some of you, I felt, were uncomfortable in defending the indefensible&mdash;that is, you simply had no grounds other than balancing the books for supporting some of the measures that were going through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The very fact that you were forced to take decisions at that time and to disregard all the consequences with which I am trying to deal here&mdash;namely, exports, investment, employment, growth and international competitiveness&mdash;was an indictment not only of your government but much more so of the departments who should have had that material to hand and should have understood and been able to advise the ministers of the expected consequences. We had to force eventually, through Senator Cook and my questioning in particular, an admission that they could not elucidate anything other than a downside.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Although it is a general principle, and I believe it should be a general principle for government to evaluate these matters appropriately on a sensitivity and cost-benefit basis, this amendment nevertheless only addresses four industries and only affects those four industries for as long as the bounty survives. So it is a confined report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Furthermore, you have made the point, quite rightly, that there are other analyses, investigations and inquiries under way. If that is so, it is relatively easy to summarise their main findings and put them in a report to advise the Senate, `As a consequence of these series of inquiries, we come to the following view with respect to bounties on employment, exports, investment, growth and international competitiveness.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his comments, the minister indicated that, whilst he understands the points that were made by Senator Murray when he advanced an argument in support of his amendment, the place for that may not be in this particular legislation. But what we are doing here is the result of a budget decision taken by the government, and it was taken on information the government had at that particular time. Now we have government amendments brought forward to this legislation, particularly in respect of the area of shipbuilding, an area with which I am quite familiar and, I suppose, in a way I advise the government and indicate to the government my view on that in appropriate terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am very pleased to see that the government has come to an arrangement that the particular move it was contemplating, and in fact had included in the bill, will not proceed in the form that it was included in the bill.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I come down to this: it just strikes me&mdash;and the minister can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that policies relating to bounty and industry generally are governed to a certain extent by those who are influential in the Industry Commission. They come from a general viewpoint which, in some respects, one could probably identify with some of those that are expressed by Treasury from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was rather interested in something someone said here in the chamber recently about cost cutting and about efficiency, and it was in respect of the parliament. Notwithstanding the fact that the Senate had achieved a 14 per cent saving over the period we were considering at that particular time, someone suggested, `I wonder how much savings there have been in the Department of the Treasury.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Treasury is a very important department, a department which has had a long period of great public service. But I do believe that in various areas, including in the taxation area, the department may have too much say, in this particular area as well. It does concern me that the viewpoints that are expressed by Treasury from time to time are then taken into account by the government, as they should be, but to the possible detriment of an analysis, the type of which is included in this particular measure before us at the present moment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this amendment is saying is that, before the changes in the rate of the bounties come into effect, the minister should cause to be laid before both houses of parliament a report containing the cost&hyphen;benefit analysis of the relevant bounty scheme, including an assessment of the impact of the cessation of the bounty on employment, export investment growth and international competitiveness.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. I just want to reply to the comment made by the minister when he said that he was speaking for himself. I appreciate and acknowledge that, but he did venture into an excursion, discussing comparative advantage. Of course, an efficient and modern economy emphasises comparative
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> advantage. We do not pick and select which sectors are going to rise to the top. The advantage of the economy&mdash;the skills and strengths of it&mdash;all conspire to select which industry areas we are good at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But comparative advantage in Australia is not that we are good only at farming or at digging holes in the ground and mining. We have an enviable intellectual capacity in this country, and we are good at a range of other pursuits as well. Every other nation provides some assistance to nascent industry to help it get off the ground and grow. Take the example of the robotics industry. Not too many people in Australia know what the capability of the Australian robotics manufacturing industry is: it is among the best in the world, and our industrial robots are regarded as among the best in the world. We are able to sell them at a higher price than most companies competing with Australian companies abroad are able to sell theirs. The same is true of the machine tools sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Most other countries provide assistance to their sunrise  industries, because they are industries of the future and they are where manufacturing is heading. We are going to chop that off today for Australian sunrise industries, while every other country proceeds with assistance to theirs. That is just one example. No&hyphen;one knows a lot about the robotics industry in Australia because it is not yet a big industry, but it is a world leading industry and, when we chop off the robots bounty, there will be celebrations&mdash;with champagne being uncorked&mdash;in Tokyo, Europe and North America. Those companies will have succeeded in getting an advantage over this industry and will be able to reclaim the market share the Australians have been taking off them in their own home countries. Has there been a study about that, before we make this move? No, there has not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I said last night that the Australian book publishing industry is a classic example of what we all hope Australian industry will be&mdash;aggressive, entrepreneurial and winning markets in parts of the world you would not expect. The leading first world market may be the United States; this industry has succeeded
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4767"> in the US! It supplies books to the education systems of California and Florida. It also provides books to countries in Asia and to their education systems. We write the books, our multicultural language skills help translate them, we prepare and design them and they are printed in part here and in part offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a natural comparative advantage of Australia's intellectual capability. To kill this industry stone dead or push it offshore is the height of stupidity, because it earns a lot more money than a ton of iron ore. If you sell one robot, you earn more money than if you sell a ton of coal or a bale of wheat. These are exactly the industry sectors that we should be getting into. So all I can say, when we talk about comparative advantage is: don't think that Australia is only good at digging holes and harvesting wheat, farming wool and mining coal; we are good at a lot of other things too. All we are saying here is that the government should study the effects of what it is doing before it kills those industries. It should look before it leaps.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When we come to the computer industry, the minister has said that we have got the Goldsworthy report. Yes, the government has a report into the computer industry, but it is proposing to cut the bounty off before it hears the findings of the report. What this motion would do is prevent that. What is the purpose of having a report that discovers how we devastated the industry? Why don't we have a report which promotes how we might build the industry and what the logical inputs in doing that might be?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This motion, moved by the Democrats&mdash;and I acknowledge that and take my hat off to them for it&mdash;would prevent governments of all stripe from doing that. I speak for the opposition in this debate. We hope to be back in government soon. This would prevent us, when in government, from doing it, and so it should. We would not want to do it, but it would be of great use to have this on the statute books.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose items 1, 2 and 3 in the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill. The items that the opposition will be opposing relate to the book bounty and book industry. In opposing the termination of this bounty ahead of its natural termination date, there are a few things that I wish to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have said a little about the book industry in my contribution to the second reading debate and in some of the remarks I made earlier this morning, but it is important to know that this industry is growing rapidly. It has had, as the minister has said, the benefit of the bounty and the bounty has been phased down over time and the industry has still been able to grow. Its being able to do that is not a reason for cutting out the bounty ahead of the date on which statutorily it will naturally expire. This legislation cuts out the bounty for  the book industry six months ahead of the time which the book industry knew that the bounty would exist until and, as such, has disrupted the plans of this industry considerably and put this industry at a competitive disadvantage.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4768">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am advised that in the last week a number of publishers in the book industry have negotiated new contracts for educational texts. At least one of those publishers, Mimosa Publications, has effected sales in France and Thailand for the first time&mdash;that is in addition to sales to California and Florida&mdash;and now has sales in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Korea and Taiwan. The intellectual content of the educational texts they sell is written in Australia, the books are of Australian design and the production of them is in some cases offshore and other cases onshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This company will have to move its operation offshore if this bounty is cut ahead of the time in which its corporate planning had enabled it to justify its presence in Australia. What the cancellation of this bounty ahead of time will do for this industry is, as illustrated by this particular company, the reverse of what we want to see: it will push Australian companies overseas, providing jobs for foreigners and not for Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said earlier, the minister explained to the chamber, in a way in which I think he was somewhat proud of, what the government had done in the case of the shipbuilding industry. Let me make a comparison between these two industry sectors. The shipbuilding industry brought a great deal of pressure to bear on the government, and the government changed its position. The book industry is not in a similar position to the shipbuilding industry in relation to, if you like, political weight or industrial consequence. Having said that, the book industry is an important and significant industry in its own right. But it cannot bring pressure to bear on the government in the way the shipbuilding industry did.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What did the minister say about the shipbuilding industry? He extolled the virtues of a logical plan in the case of shipbuilding. The shipbuilding bounty will be extended to the end of this century. There will be discussions with the industry before its expiry in 1998. They will look at the state of the international playing field&mdash;at whether it is fair, whether it is level and what Australian companies are required to do. They will look at the level of investment and research and development innovation in the industry, employment levels,
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> the market niche the industry is pursuing, the quality of the products it manufactures and the market share it can claim in the future. All those things are logical things that should be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why aren't they going to be done in the case of the book industry? There is a deafening silence to that question. In this case the government is just going to chop this industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is chopping this industry six months earlier. This industry writes contracts for the longer term, Minister. Companies that want to win a contract to sell Australian science books to Californian schools have to go to California to negotiate with the public education authorities there. Every other country that markets in that state is marketing against them, and they have to win that contract. When they have won it, then they have to design their publications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bounty is an essential ingredient in covering that up-front cost of getting to the market to win their market position. That was the evidence before the Senate inquiry. But you are chopping that off. You are preventing this industry getting to its market around the world to consolidate the position it has already built. Not only are you doing this to the bounty; you did this in relation to the export market development grants as well. These are small publishing houses in Australia. They require the export market development grants too to get into the market, but you chopped that off from them by putting a cap on the level of the benefit and putting hurdles in their way in accessing it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I understand the book industry has conducted a survey of its members about the effect that the government's intention to chop the bounty has so far had on the industry. The companies that were surveyed read like a who's who of Australian publishing. They are  the Aboriginal Studies Press, Addison Wesley Longman, Allen &amp; Unwin, Box Press, Chalkface Press, the CSIRO, Currency Press, Eastern House, Jacaranda Wiley, MacLennan &amp; Petty, McGraw Hill, Macmillan Education, Mimosa Publications, Original Redback Press,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4769"> Random House, RIC Publications, Rigby Heinemann, Spinifex Press, the State Library of New South Wales, Universal Publishing, University of New South Wales Press, the University of Southern Queensland, Wild &amp; Woolley, and Woodslane.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Those companies, the central core companies of Australian publishing, responded to a questionnaire from the association as to what effect the government's intention to cancel the bounty is having on publishing. They found that, in the 12 months of 1996, $43.6 million worth of printing was done in Australia and $29.6 million worth of printing was done offshore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at it from January 1997 to 30 June 1997&mdash;projecting on company plans for investment in this industry, knowing that they have longer term contracts so that they can accurately predict what the next half of the year will look like&mdash;we see the outcome is that rather than there being $43.6 million, which was last year's performance, this year there will be $38.8 million worth of printing done in Australia and that rather than there being $29.6 million worth of printing, which last year was done offshore, there will be $32.7 million worth of printing done offshore this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, the announcement that the bounty will be cancelled six months ahead of time is already having the effect of forcing this industry offshore. The Australian companies I have referred to and listed have returned to the industry association those figures of what their plans are as they accommodate themselves to the new bounty&hyphen;free environment. Is that the sort of industry policy this government wants? I suspect it is not.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to refer the Senate to the findings of the Senate economics committee inquiry into the book bounty. On page 7 and page 8 of the report a series of bullet points are set down as to what the circumstances are of the book industry. I will not read them now; I would be out of time if I did. But it is interesting to note that none of those bullet points has been adequately replied to by the government. This is an industry that is saying, `These are our problems. We itemise them
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> logically and sensibly, we back them up with internal research to prove that we're not gilding the lily, these are truthful submissions, and they have not been replied to.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the most important point&mdash;one on which the Senate economics committee was unanimous; Liberal, National, Labor and Democrat members of that committee supported the same view&mdash;was the bipartisan finding with respect to the tariff levels that apply to the inputs into publications of books. Here we are cutting out a bounty which assists book manufacture and publication in Australia while, at the same time, persisting with a tariff of five per cent for imported paper which goes to make up Australian published books.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to books published in Australia, 70 per cent of the paper used by Australian books is Australian paper; but 30 per cent of it has to be imported because of quality reasons or the insufficient supply of paper from domestic sources. That brings us to the question of why is there insufficient paper. That is entirely another debate about forestry and paper manufacture. It is not a debate I will get into now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the fact is that for book publication there is insufficient paper manufactured in Australia to meet the industry's needs. Do we help that industry by allowing imported paper to come in tariff free so that Australian publishers can compete on a level playing field with foreign publishers who get access to that paper tariff free? No, we do not. We impose a five per cent tariff on the imported paper that this industry needs to operate. So a foreign publisher that gets the paper free has a five per cent advantage immediately over the Australian company. Is that fair? No, it is not. Will the government do something about it? No, it will not. Why won't it? Silence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I again refer to the finding of the Senate economics committee and emphasise that Liberal members, National Party members, Labor members and Democrat members all agreed that the government should change this. The government is not changing it. So when it abolishes this bounty for the book industry it makes a positive decision, a cold&hyphen;blooded decision, that Australian companies
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4770"> will not compete on equal terms with foreigners; Australian companies will compete at a disadvantage with foreigners, a five per cent disadvantage, and that is hardly in our national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 1,500 jobs at stake when it comes to this industry. Most of those jobs are at Maryborough in Victoria, which is the major centre of publishing in Australia. But those jobs are also in Adelaide, Perth, Brisbane, Hobart, Launceston, Sydney&mdash;they are all around the nation. They are in country Australia as well. It is absolutely unbelievable that the government should move to cancel this bounty on the grounds of fiscal consolidation, which is its primary and only argument, without studying the effects and without looking at the issue that Senator Murray just raised in relation to what is the cost benefit, just because we are going to make a negative saving, and put this industry at a competitive disadvantage with foreign companies. I do not know how that can be justified. If the minister would like to chance his arm at giving us an explanation, I would be delighted to hear it.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond very quickly to this. It is not as if this were just announced. It came out in the last budget. So any claims that this bringing forward of the removal of the bounty has had a sudden effect are wrong. I think you quoted figures like, `It was $46 million; it is now $38 million,' in relation to local books.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me point out&mdash;and this was your government, not our government&mdash;that the bounty rate in 1989 was 20 per cent and you reduced it so that by 1 January 1997 it was 4.5 per cent. You are arguing that, if you had not reduced it, instead of these imported books, they would be all done in Australia, or something approaching that situation. There is an inconsistency there. All we have done is bring forward to June this year a bounty that was going to expire in December this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The other point is that you went on about tariffs. Of course, it was the previous government that went down the path of removing tariffs, for quite good reasons. I am delighted
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to hear what Senator Cook said, because I thought the new Labor approach was to freeze and increase tariffs&mdash;the complete reversal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief. For me, the major issue here is this: we recognise that this policy was a policy of the previous government and we accept that this government may not view it as desirable to increase or continue it, but we say that your government, like all governments, is contractually bound.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This was a contract. This was a contract which you want to break, and you want to break it in respect of this book bounty by cutting six months off the term of the contract, and that is just not right. You should as a government be keeping your word, and the reason you should be keeping your word is the reason that Senator Cook spelt out&mdash;that is, the planning process and the contractual process in these industries are such that 12 to 18 months minimum is often part of the cycle. That is the first thing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The second thing is whether the bounty should be extended. Senator Parer, you would know from what I have said previously that we disagree with your government and we disagreed with the previous government that it should end. We believe the book bounty should be retained at a level equivalent to the general tariff rate, at least until such time as compensatory measures are put in place to offset the negative assistance to an effective rate of zero.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In other words, the Australian Democrats say, `You maintain industry assistance, tariff and non-tariff barriers'&mdash;whatever you want to call them&mdash;`until such time as your trading competitors are on the same basis as you are.' We did not put that up as an amendment because we did not expect to get support for  it, but we will certainly support the opposition in maintaining our contractual commitments until the end of the year. That gives the six months back to the book bounty people, which they were contractually entitled to get.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I explain. These are Australian companies printing books in Australia. Seventy per cent of the paper they need to do that can be supplied within Australia. They need to import 30 per cent. There is a limited supply of paper in Australia. The Australian industry disposes of all the paper it  manufactures. Therefore, we are in paper debt, if you like. We need to import to make up the amount of paper we consume. It would be nice to make as much paper as we need in Australia, but we do not. We import paper to meet our national need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This industry has to pay five per cent tariff on the paper it imports&mdash;which is not competing with the Australian paper producers at all. If this industry did not exist and they did not print the number of books they print, you would not have had to import the paper. You would probably have met it by domestic needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A foreigner making the same book offshore and selling it in Australia does not have to pay that five per cent tariff. So the Australian book publishers have a five per cent cost loaded on to them by virtue of the importation, and a foreigner does not have to meet that. We are saying that, to the extent that limits the competitiveness of Australian companies, that tariff should be waived when the importation of paper does not compete with Australian paper manufacturing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To take the example one step further. A number of books that we produce and print in Australia are sold overseas. So we are bringing in foreign paper, printing the books on that and selling it in a foreign market, but we are having to pay a five per cent cost surcharge to the government on tariffs to use the paper to print that book. So when competing

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can be very brief. The minister is right as far as re&hyphen;export is concerned in terms of tariff drawback, but what the industry complains of&mdash;and, in my view, rightly&mdash;is that the government cancelled the tariff concession scheme when it came to office. Take the example we are dealing with of importing paper into Australia because Australia does not manufacture enough paper to meet its own needs. Under the tariff concession scheme, as it existed under the former government, paper would come in tariff free where there was no competition with an Australian producer. You would not have to pay the five per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What this government did was abolish that scheme. So where there is no competition with an Australian producer, you still have to pay the five per cent. The book manufacturers and printers are complaining that although they are paying a five per cent surcharge on paper that they have to import, which increases the costs of their final product, books by
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> foreigners come in tariff free. So we are charging a tariff on the importation of the key input in books&mdash;paper; we are not charging a tariff against the foreign entry of books&mdash;that is free to the market; and we are putting our own industry at a comparative disadvantage.

<PARA STYLE="Para">This raft of amendments concern the computer bounty. I said quite a few things about the computer bounty in my speech during the second reading stage and I will not repeat them. I will go immediately to the main  points as to why the computer bounty should be retained.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4773">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point I make is that a bill to extend the computer bounty was put by the Labor government to this chamber in November 1995. The opposition at that time&mdash;and, I think, to the discomfort of the minister at the table, he participated in this debate as an opposition senator&mdash;supported the Labor government by saying, `We, the Liberal opposition, will support the extension of the computer bounty to the end of the century and we support the computer industry as a consequence.' In the election, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and other responsible spokespeople for the then opposition, now government, campaigned strongly that they would support the extension of the computer bounty to the year 2000. This bill removes the computer bounty from the year 2000 and ends that bounty on 30 June this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a clear case of a breach of an election undertaking. It is not as if this was not a solemn undertaking. The computer industry is a big industry, a growing industry and an alive, active and intellectually stimulating industry in Australia. It knows what goes on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The position of the two major parties contending for government, the Labor Party and the coalition, was well understood. A lot of people in the computer industry took comfort from the fact that the opposition, now government, pledged that it would support the continuance of this bounty. Of course this is an explicit breach of that election undertaking, and the Senate, in the motion it carried for the second reading, said so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first point is: here is a breach of an undertaking, which has disrupted the planning of this industry. The computer industry, together with the telecommunications industry, is the world's biggest industry. It is also the world's fastest growing industry. We have a trade deficit of $6 billion a year on the importation of technology for this industry. It is forecast to go to a trade deficit of $20 billion a year by the end of the century&mdash;with the bounty. The bounty provides some comfort to Australian manufacturers of computer hardware and component parts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister, in his reply on the second reading debate, said, `But everyone knows
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> that Australia is good at software. Let's go to our comparative advantage; let's build software. Let's not try to develop a Silicon Valley in Australia; that's been done and the Asians are better at manufacturing than we are.' The truth is that Australia is damned good at manufacturing and is an exporter of manufactured computer hardware. That is the truth of the matter, and let the international market decide who is best at it. We are very good at it and we have an international market presence because of that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bounty is a small bounty that enables us to win in those circumstances. Let us not run away with the idea that the Asians, the Europeans and the Americans do not protect and help their industries. Of course they do. Of course they do, because they regard this as a strategic industry sector. Computer and information technology is enabling technology. It enables the work of all other businesses to be done more efficiently and more competently. It is exploding in demand and it is exploding in competence&mdash;and it is in reach. Australia is saying, very interestingly, `We'll come out of this industry now; we're not interested in it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of the studies about Silicon Valley show that you need a manufacturing sector, the hardware sector, to be alongside the scientists and to be alongside the software writers, so that you have all the elements of the industry interacting with one another and stimulating growth, imagination and new ideas in the creation of technology, one off another. We have a world leading software industry in Australia. That is true. We have a competitive, still growing, but relatively smaller, hardware industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If you kill the hardware sector, our software writers have to interact with hardware being developed by other companies offshore. They have to go overseas to understand the newest applications of technology and to work their software around that. While you have it here, they can work it around what is in Australia. You need both sections of the industry to be in balance, because if you take one away, the other will wither. That is the story of Silicon  Valley. That is the story of where computer manufacture has grown up elsewhere in the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4774"> world. We are a small country in the world. We have to be smarter, brighter, quicker and better than other countries&mdash;just to be equal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bounty is a reason why a number of major companies invest in Australian computer manufacturing. An example is IBM, one of the world's biggest companies. It has been going through a massive restructuring because it has been in financial loss for a number of years. It is just coming out of that. During the period in which it was closing down plants all around the world, it kept open its plant in Wangaratta, and did so because we were competitive. The bounty is the thing that has made the difference in that plant being here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know, in my experience as industry minister, in 1995, there was some consideration that if the bounty was not continued through to the year 2000, the international corporate plan of a company like IBM, where they were in financial loss and consolidating their outlets and manufacturing plants, and streamlining their operation&mdash;cutting off their dead wood&mdash;would have aggregated those plants back to a central manufacturing establishment. That would have been in Austin, Texas. So out of Wangaratta and over to Austin would be the effect of not having a bounty in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is jobs in country Victoria. These are intelligent jobs. These are good jobs. These are jobs that give Australia a place in world information technology development too. Why would we shoot ourselves&mdash;not in the foot, but in the head, in this case. Why would we remove the concession and break a solemn election promise that the government made in the case of this industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I refer the Senate to page 9 of the Senate economics committee's report on bounties, to the points that the computer companies made about the negative effect of the removal of the bounty on them. There is a whole series of bullet points there, but it is too long for me to recite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The fundamental point in opposing this is: the government would, if this is carried, explicitly break their election undertaking. Companies had taken solace and encouragement from the fact that the government had said that the bounty would continue to the end
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of the century. They have cast their corporate development plans, their investment plans, their employment plans, and their research and development and new product development plans accordingly. To remove the bounty now would be to throw all of that into the trash can and to disrupt their operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It would also be to give Australia a reputation of being capricious, that you cannot rely on the government in Australia to be consistent about what it says. From an international investment point of view, that is disastrous. This is an industry in which demand is not just growing, but exploding, and Australia needs to keep itself in this game if it is going to be a relevant 21st century economy. To remove this bounty is to go against all of those things.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just respond very briefly. In my wrap up on the second reading debate, I quoted from the Industry Commission report. Senator Cook has correctly quoted it as saying that the computer bounty should lapse. It was based on the fact that the argument underpinning the compensation rationale for the computer bounty has been substantially eroded by general reduction in tariffs, changes in the focus of the industry, and developments in the IT industries, which now bear little resemblance to the IT industries of 1984.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It also goes on to point out&mdash;and Senator Cook mentioned this&mdash;that the activities which have strengths for Australia, that is the software packages, account for over 80 per cent of our IT production. I will just make the point that&mdash;because Senator Murray referred to it and I know he wants a response to this&mdash;that is a reason. Another reason, and a very important reason, is that we had to confront a budget deficit last year. As Senator Murray himself has said, that is important and should not be the only thing. I agree and hence the reasoning I have given there. We had no option but to rein in the budget. If every time we take those hard decisions&mdash;and they are hard decisions&mdash;they start to get knocked off in places like that, how on earth are we going to attack the budget deficit? The decision was taken as one of the reasons.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4775">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The abolition of the bounty will save $142 million between 1997-98 and 2001. Future prospects for growth of the information technology and telecommunications industry are good and the government will continue to do all it can to make sure this potential is realised. I should point out that&mdash;and this fits in with Senator Murray's amendments he had passed on cost&hyphen;benefit analysis&mdash;there is a major report, and the information industry's task force led by Professor Goldsworthy will be reporting to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) on whether the information technology and telecommunications industry will require assistance in the absence of the computer bounty and, if so, what form of assistance it should take.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would have thought that that was a proper way and a very sensible way to address what to us is a very important industry and what will be&mdash;as far ahead as we can see&mdash;a very major industry into the next decade and probably the decade afterwards.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Parer) for those remarks. This one is difficult for us because of the amount of money involved and your legitimate claim that you need to find money for your book balancing exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We made the following recommendation after the economics legislation committee report of November 1996 into the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill. We said that the computer bounty should continue as scheduled, with the proviso that the government direct the information industry task force to review the merits of the bounty to the computer industry and whether it should continue to constitute a plank of a government strategy for promoting development of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Now you have clearly outlined the fact that the Industry Commission has said the bounty should lapse. It did not say it should be terminated early. It did not say it should be abolished early. The point I have consistently tried to make to you is that we are deeply concerned at taking risks without knowing the consequences. We are distraught about the job situation and we just do not believe that you
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> should take risks without knowing the full consequences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Nowhere in the evidence before us to that inquiry were we provided with an analysis which indicated that the risks could justifiably be taken. Because your Goldsworthy report is not out, we do not have the benefit in this chamber of their guidance, their conclusions, or their analysis. Consequently, we have great difficulty in appraising the situation. It may well be that following that the government is able to come back to the Senate and say, `Look, we have the following appraisal and we are able to recommend that the computer bounty lapse early.' But you have no such advice that you are capable of giving us now and you are forced to fall back solely on the revenue saving side of equation, without once again investigating the other side of equation, which is: what are the benefits to Australia which will be lost in terms of investment, growth, exports, employment and so on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Sometime back Senator Kernot totted up a list of all the promises government had made. I think the financial list came to $18 billion. You kept $6 billion of those and you broke $12 billion. So you have a two to three record of breaking your promises. However, in this case we say to you that this again is a broken promise. Once again you are breaking a contract and it is a really difficult thing for the parliament to accept that you should break a contract with industry that has been established in legislation and approved by the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I agree that there is a longer lead time available to you. There are a number of years and there is the possibility that industry could adjust. But that to me is not a good enough reason, given the fact that we have not been advised by you that the benefits of the cut are greater for Australia than the costs. We just have not got that information. Our view is that it is a broken promise. It is bad policy. It is a breach of the contract. We regret the possible effect on the revenue side of the budget, but we would be very pleased to see the positive side of employment, jobs, investment, exports and growth which will be consequent, in our view, from keeping this bounty until it lapses in its due term.</PARA>

I would have thought that the government would have waited until that report came down anyhow. If the Senate opposes these clauses, my suggestion would be that the task force be asked to review the situation as to whether our industries can successfully operate competitively, both nationally and internationally, without the bounty.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We support the government's amendment here. We have a similar amendment ourselves. The effect of the government amendment with regard to the Bounty (Machine Tools and Robots) Act 1985 is to remove what they intended to do in the original bill and terminate this bounty ahead of time. The effect of their opposing their own bill is to enable the bounty to continue through and expire at the statutory time set down in the act, which, as I recall, is the 30th of this month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I might say that, because this bill has taken some time to come before the parliament, the law has stood and the bounty eligibility for bountiable activity by companies in this sector has stood as well. So companies have been able to apply for and be paid the bounty because the act has not changed. As a consequence, the government, in opposing its own bill, is recognising the reality that it would be idle to go back and try to claim back bounty payments by companies in the machine tools and robotics sector. Because it is a pragmatic decision by the government recognising the reality and because this enables the act to remain and the period of bounty as set down in the statute to remain, we will support the government amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have made a couple of remarks about the machine tools and robotics sector.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will support government amendments 3 to 7. I acknowledge that this is a significant backdown by the government. Initially, the government wanted to kill this bounty. It has now been forced to recognise the efficacy of the claims made by the industry and to agree to extend the bounty to the end of the century and to hold discussions with the industry in planning beyond then, depending on the nature of international protection in this very important field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I wish to make a couple of very quick remarks. There is only one area in the world where Australia manufactures the very best, complex, sophisticated manufacture. That is in this field. We are the world's leader in the manufacture of high&hyphen;speed, fast, aluminium constructed catamaran ferries. No-one else does it as well as we do and everyone else wants to copy us and catch up to us.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The effect of what the government has now done is what it should have done from the beginning&mdash;sat down with the industry and planned how we can support this industry to get an even bigger slice of the world market. Eight years ago we did not have this industry; now it commands half a billion dollars worth of exports&mdash;the same amount of export earnings that the wine industry in Australia commands. Everyone knows about the success of Australian wines overseas. Very few people know that we dominate this market in the world.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because they don't drink them and they come in big $50 million lots. These are big vessels. They have captured the high&hyphen;speed ferry market in the world. This is an area in which Australia can grow to become a world leading power. Seattle in the United States is the home of the Boeing Corporation. Why Boeing became the world dominant private sector manufacturer of aircraft is an interesting story. Why they did
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4780"> it out of Seattle, in the most remote corner in the north-west of the United States, is even more fascinating. You could not have got any further away from the main centres of activity in the US than Seattle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Interestingly, in Australia, where you could not get any further away from the main centres of European and North American ferry manufacture, we have developed the leading industry. What Boeing is to Seattle and to aircraft manufacture, design and production in the world, the Australian fast ferry industry can be to water&hyphen;borne transport in the world, including up to liner shipping, bulk shipping and above. All those technologies are over the horizon but within our reach, given the technological edge we have. It makes a great deal of sense that the government at last has come to its senses and agreed to work with the industry to help achieve those outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is one thing that I will mention now while I am on my feet because it will save me debating it when my amendments come along later and thus save some time in the chamber. The one aspect of all of this that the opposition is keen to do is to relate the final termination of this bounty to the outcome of the OECD shipbuilding agreement. The OECD has been promoting an agreement following the Uruguay Round of international trade liberalisation, which concluded in 1993. It has been following a path of talking to the world's major shipbuilding countries to get them to remove protection so that there can be an international free market in shipbuilding. If that happened, Australian competitiveness would take over very rapidly. Therefore, it is in our interests to see that the OECD agreement attains universal approval among the developed countries of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Europeans have signed it, the north Asians have signed it&mdash;that is, Japan and Korea have signed it&mdash;but the US has not signed it. The treaty was presented to the US Congress last year before the presidential election and the Congress rejected it. With the presidential election there was also a congressional election, which changed the compo
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sition of the US Congress. The US government has not presented that treaty to the US Congress yet. Those who monitor the US Congress and try to read its mind and anticipate the likely outcome are not sanguine about the chances of the US Congress as it now is endorsing the OECD agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, I think it is prudent for Australia to argue that the bounty continues until the OECD agreement is endorsed. If the US Congress does not endorse it, the Europeans and the north Asians&mdash;Japan and Korea&mdash;are more likely to say, `Then this agreement will not bind our major competitor, the United States, so we will walk away from it too.' If they do that, the chances of reducing the levels of domestic protection in the shipbuilding industry around the world will be removed to zilch. It will not happen. Countries that want to maintain shipbuilding industries will try to out&hyphen;subsidise one another to protect those industry sectors. It is not in Australia's best interests that that happen but, in commenting on the likely flow of events, that is a real possibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I now take the opportunity of speaking to my amendment, which is next, and to hypothesise my remarks now as if my amendments had come up, to save me saying it twice. We believe that a safety net that would make even better the provisions that the government is putting in place is to relate it to the OECD agreement. They are the reasons we will be moving the amendment when our time to move it comes along.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I conclude by saying that I have before me a copy of a statement by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, Mr John Moore, and representatives of the Australian shipbuilding industry, dated 7 May. It sets down the terms agreed between the government and the industry on how they will manage the extension of the bounty and the  terms of agreement about negotiations and consultations leading up to the expiration of the bounty. It is, I think, the agreement that has been reached. I have not had the opportunity to show it to you. The clerk could show it to you.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill seeks to amend the Social Security Act to provide the framework to implement a work for the dole scheme, as announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 9 February 1997. The government itself has admitted that this bill is not an attempt to address Australia's high and rising rate of youth unemployment. In fact, John Howard and his then political adviser, Andrew Robb, developed the work for the dole scheme in the hope of diverting attention from scandals that were bedevilling the government at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill is one of a series of measures taken by the government which demonstrate that its response to unemployment is not to generate real jobs but instead to blame and punish the unemployed for their plight. Since the Howard government was elected, we have had the so-called dole diary, the work for the dole bill and, this week, the shameful an
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> nouncement of a plan to remove unemployment payments altogether from 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds and restrict them for many other young people from battling families. The submissions that were made by community organisations to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, which considered this bill, were overwhelmingly critical.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill is purportedly based on the principle of mutual obligation, that is, that it is only fair that, in return for receipt of unemployment benefits, young people should work. However, what it fails to acknowledge is the obligation on the government to provide real jobs to the unemployed. According to the leaders of Australia's churches, to compel people to work merely in exchange for unemployment payments&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where were we, before we were so rudely interrupted? You might assist me, Madam Acting Deputy President&mdash;I was talking about what leaders of Australia's churches were saying, wasn't I? I referred to the leaders of some of Australia's churches. They said that to compel people to work merely in exchange for unemployment payments, `will signify on the part of this government its abrogation of the responsibility to provide for the subsistence needs of unemployed people by reducing income support entitlements to gratuitous handouts to be earned.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor will be moving substantial amendments to this bill, which will seek to extend  the government's very limited concept of mutual obligation to the much more appropriate concept of reciprocal obligation. Labor's concept of reciprocal obligation was expressed in the former Labor government's working nation program. It means that the government has an obligation not only to provide unemployment payments to those who want work and cannot get it, it also has an obligation to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4784"> create real training opportunities and jobs for the unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor will move amendments to turn this bill into something that does do something to address Australia's high and rising rate of youth unemployment. One of the biggest problems with this bill in its present form is that it may, in fact, lead to the displacement of people in existing paid employment. Abundant evidence from overseas&mdash;in particular the United States&mdash;was presented to the Senate community affairs committee to demonstrate that similar programs there have had this effect. The government's response is that the need for work for the dole projects to represent additional work will be taken into account in the criteria for project selection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">However, one of the primary lessons from American experience of similar schemes is that legislative protection is, in fact, required to prevent displacement of paid workers. Specific laws have had to be enacted in the US state of Minnesota, for instance, to prevent work for the dole schemes destroying real jobs. There are widespread and escalating concerns about job security among workers in Australia right now. The last thing Australian workers need is more insecurity about their jobs. So Labor will be moving to amend the bill to ensure that the employment secretary requires, as a matter of law, that any new approved programs of work do not displace people currently in jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill in its present form may also lead to unequal wages for people doing the same work, to downward pressure on wages and&mdash;according to extensive overseas experience&mdash;to the creation of a large class of working poor. Accordingly, Labor believes that is essential that the provisions of the bill be strengthened to ensure that sufficient funds are made available for participants to be paid a rate of newstart allowance equivalent to the relevant national training wage award rate for the hours the person participates in the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another important issue is the need for accredited training to be incorporated into the scheme. Many organisations in their submissions and evidence to the committee high
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> lighted concerns about the absence of training arrangements under the proposed work for the dole scheme. One of the groups that gave evidence to the committee, the UNIYA Jesuit Social Justice Centre, urged that an essential feature of any program for long&hyphen;term unemployed young people should include accredited training and/or literacy courses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The inclusion of accredited training would eliminate wastefulness of time, energy and effort. It would also ensure logical progression for individuals in their pathway back to employment. Labor will take up this proposal in our amendments to build accredited training into the proposed scheme. We certainly do not accept the ridiculous argument that has been put by the government that, because not all training programs in the past have led to the securing of real jobs, no training at all should be included in this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another defect in the bill is the absence of provisions for case management and supervision of participants in the proposed scheme. Many community organisations experienced in the delivery of labour market programs to Australia's unemployed believe that the arrangements envisaged under this scheme are inferior to previous labour market programs. We consider that participants in the programs established by the bill must be given the case management and supervision they require to assist them in making decisions about opportunities relevant to the program. We will be moving amendments to the bill to make this requirement explicit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also a need to amend the bill to provide for additional financial support for on-costs and other aspects of the proposed projects. Amendments are required to the bill to spell out the responsibility of the Commonwealth to provide adequate financial assistance to the people responsible for conducting the programs to meet the costs of supervision, materials, workers compensation, superannuation, safety related measures, including protective clothing, and other unavoidable employment related costs such as transport and child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">One of the central issues in the debate on this bill is whether compulsion to work for
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4785"> unemployment payments is justified in the absence of properly structured labour market and training programs. Let us be clear that the Labor Party does not oppose requiring the young unemployed to participate in programs or lose their payments. That is what we did in fact in Working Nation. But they have to be decent programs. They have to provide training and they have to offer the prospect of leading to a real job. The so-called work for the dole bill does nothing of the kind. In its present form, the work for the dole scheme would threaten genuine existing voluntary activity, and it would place additional social pressure on some of our most vulnerable young people who already suffer low levels of self&hyphen;esteem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us listen to the words of the Salvation Army and the Sydney City Mission, who work at the sharp end of the youth unemployment problem. They have firmly stated that from their experience compulsory work for the dole schemes would not produce positive outcomes or improve the motivation of long-term unemployed people. This contradicts the unfounded assertion by the government that the compulsory nature of the government's present bill will assist people who have a severe lack of motivation. Contrary to the government's assertions, compulsory work for the dole will not in fact make participants more employable. Many prospective employers will view work for the dole participants negatively, assuming they have not participated in the projects at their own initiative and by their own choice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government's claims that the scheme will improve young people's work ethic are also undermined by its failure to produce any research to support the view that young people do not currently subscribe to the work ethic. In fact, the best, most comprehensive research available, conducted by organisations such as the Australian Science and Technology Council and the Commission for the Future, indicates that young people overwhelmingly do subscribe to the work ethic. The problem is that there are not enough jobs for them, and this government is doing nothing to create such jobs. It is in fact taking
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> jobs away through its massive cuts, for example, in the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the government's rhetoric, this bill provides new and very wide ranging powers for compulsion. As the bill currently stands, the government would have the power to compel anyone, irrespective of how old they are, irrespective of how long they have been unemployed, irrespective of where they live, to participate in a work for the dole scheme for an indefinite period, until they get a job, at the national training wage award rate of pay and without any of the protections afforded to other Australian workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we say is that this is not acceptable. If the government does intend to create only 10,000 places and these are in fact largely to be filled on a voluntary basis, then no case has been made for the inclusion of powers for compulsion in this bill. Accordingly, Labor will be moving an amendment to delete the provisions of the bill which allow the secretary to compel unemployed people to participate in the work for the dole scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Another flaw in this bill is that it prescribes that participation in work for the dole projects does not give rise to an employer-employee relationship for the purposes of workers compensation, occupational health and safety, superannuation and industrial relations laws. This means that the young and vulnerable participants in this scheme would have no recourse to the legal protections given to all other workers in Australia. Labor will move amendments to delete the government's attempt to remove these protections.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The bill also seeks to provide that decisions to approve a program of work for unemployment payment are not subject to internal review and are not decisions that can be reviewed by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Labor will move an amendment to ensure that unemployed people's rights of appeal are protected. Our amendments to the bill will provide the Senate with an opportuni ty to do what this government failed to do in its budget, and that is to create a decent skills training program to help turn back Australia's rising tide of unemployment. I commend the opposition's approach on this bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If today we were being asked to consider a trial work for the dole scheme for young volunteers, then the Australian Democrats would have absolutely no trouble in voting for it. But the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill is not about that, unfortunately. This legislation does not even meet the description by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of his work for the dole as a pilot program for the young unemployed. This bill is about exempting the current Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr David Kemp, from any future parliamentary scrutiny of the conditions he sets for unemployed people in need of income support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When you look at the bill you see that it is open&hyphen;ended, and I think we need to draw attention to that. We have an ongoing discussion in this parliament about the struggle between the executive and the parliament. I do not think the Senate should be willing to give Minister Kemp, as an appointed official, and any minister who comes after him powers which would normally be exercised by the parliament. I do not think we should be willing to give him the blank cheque.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We may have been willing to have endorsed some future changes in this area after the pilot scheme had been completed and after it had been evaluated. Then we would have been in a position to know whether this scheme should continue. But, if the Senate passes this bill unamended today, we are denying the parliament the opportunity for that kind of further scrutiny. We will not have the chance to oppose any extensions that we think are unreasonable or beyond the test of fairness. If we pass this bill unamended today, theoretically there would be nothing stopping a future minister from forcing retrenched, old breadwinners to work for the dole or have their families cut off from income support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That is why the Democrats will be moving to insert a sunset clause into the legislation, to actually make the government implement what the Prime Minister said he was doing&mdash;a trial for the young unemployed, at least for those who still get the dole, and to allow
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> parliament to assess the trial before considering whether it should be adopted as a matter of course for all unemployed Australians. I am tired of being asked yet again to vote on the `big picture' bill and let the government fill in the details afterwards. That is what happened with the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill, and we found out, `Oh, PS, it's voluntary voting.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That reminds me of one of the philosophical inconsistencies in this government. At the moment we are having this great passionate debate about why voluntary voting is important and how terrible it is to compel people. In this bill they are totally happy to compel vulnerable, unemployed young Australians to work for their dole. There is a fundamental inconsistency in their approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the months since this proposal was first announced, the Prime Minister and the minister have consistently presented this scheme as nothing more than a trial work program for young unemployed people. This bill, though, contains no mention of a pilot program, no mention of any age restriction on those who can be compelled to participate in the program and no mention of when this bill would finish. It goes on forever. So it is a very significant one for all unemployed Australians, not just for young unemployed Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let us face it: with this government's record on job creation, the potential for so many Australians to be caught up in the ramifications of this bill is very high. In the past two years alone over 75,000 Australians have been retrenched in Australian manufacturing, construction and retail industries. So there is huge potential there for people to be caught up in this bill. All of these people could be forced to participate in compulsory work for the dole as the bill now stands. Perhaps a more appropriate title and certainly a more honest title for this bill would be the `Social Security Legislation Amendment (Compulsory Work for Everyone on Unemployment Benefits) Bill'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not want the minister to misrepresent the Democrats' position on work experience programs for the unemployed. We are not
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4787"> opposed to them in principle. We believe that voluntary work programs which involve at least some degree of training and which are properly planned, staffed, managed and resourced have a great deal to offer unemployed people and the communities in which they live. The value of them has been spelt out by others. Yes, they probably can help build self-esteem and self&hyphen;worth, because they can provide a sense of purpose and structure to a day and hopefully a sense of achievement at the end of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But, along with many community organisations and individuals with vast experience in dealing with unemployed Australians, we do not believe that the same can be said for the outcome of work programs which rely on compulsion. Organisations such as ACOSS, Welfare Rights, AYPAC, the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission and the Australian Council of Volunteering have all voiced very strong opposition to the government's proposal to compel unemployed people to work for the dole. Many other organisations, including Anglicare, the Brotherhood of St Laurence&mdash;the one the minister quoted in question time yesterday&mdash;the Salvation Army, the Victoria Social Justice Council and the Moreland City Council in Victoria, have already said that they will not sponsor any work for the dole program in which people are compelled to participate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In response to that, the government has said, unless potential sponsors such as these groups are willing to sign a standard contract which makes provision for the referral of compulsorily referred, potential participants, they will be ruled out. That means that these kinds of community organisations, which would have been willing to sponsor a voluntary work for the dole program, will not be eligible to sponsor any program at all. I think that is a silly thing to do, because I am sure these people would have done a terrific job in monitoring, supervising and matching up the skills of volunteers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">My own research strongly suggests that finding enough organisations to sponsor the proposed pilot programs may not be quite as easy as the government suggests, although we
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> do note that there will be 10,000 participants in this scheme in regional and rural areas with high unemployment. But it would have been better to have in the first instance the goodwill of the majority of community groups who would have been good sponsors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the matter of compulsion, I think you can mount a strong argument that compelling unemployed people to work for the dole effectively punishes them for the failure of the economic managers of this country to actually create enough jobs. This is shifting the blame for unemployment away from the economy and the government and placing it instead on the shoulders of those who are the victims of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is a difference between reciprocal and mutual obligation. Reciprocal obligation implies that those who are requiring young people to turn up compulsorily actually have an equal obligation to provide them with something decent to do. We do not know enough about the detail of what young people are going to be asked to do. All the Prime Minister could say was, `Some of them can go to the airports and meet and greet tourists.' That was the amount of detail that the Prime Minister of this country had on offer when he announced this scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is not surprising that, after so many months of populist propaganda from this government, polls show that there is widespread community support for compelling young people to work for unemployment benefits, and that will last until we have an opportunity to assess how it worked and until families have real experience to apply to the theory. But the assumption that young unemployed people do not want to work is, I think, fallacious, and it is not something that has been borne out by the Democrats' own experience or the experience of many organisations that work with young unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr McAuliffe, from the Brotherhood of St Laurence, recently told a Senate committee that most young unemployed people are very keen to work in his experience. He said:</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4788">
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our experience shows high rates of self-referral by job&hyphen;seekers to our programs. In the case of young job&hyphen;seekers, self-referral to programs can be as high as 80 per cent . . . This hardly constitutes bludging, laziness or unwillingness to participate.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">If this government had just been a bit more flexible and creative, we could have been debating something really worth while today. There has been a lot of interest in this country in the example of the Blair government's work for welfare proposal in the United Kingdom. I hope our Prime Minister brings some details of this home with him but, unfortunately, we are debating this today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Tony Blair's package gives unemployed young people choice. This government is supposedly big on choice&mdash;low on compulsion, big on choice&mdash;except in this bill. In Mr Blair's proposal, young unemployed people have choices. Their first choice is a private sector job where employers are offered &pound;60 per week for six months to take on an unemployed person or &pound;70 if they take on a young person who has been unemployed for more than two years. Their second choice is a job in the voluntary sector. Their third choice is a job with an environmental task force. Their fourth choice is full-time study for young people with no qualifications. Isn't that a much more flexible and relevant policy package than the no choice we are being offered here today?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While the British government says that, if young people do not take up one of these options, they will be subject to a 40 per cent reduction in their unemployment benefits, I think that is acceptable under these conditions. They have four choices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We also know how Mr Blair has funded this program, and this government is not willing to find the funding through a tax on the windfall profits of the privatisation of utilities. Boy, we could make a lot of money in this country from that. It might have been a better way to use the Telstra money, mightn't it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Some concerns have been raised about the potential substitution effect that work for the dole programs may have on paid jobs. As Senator Faulkner said, this is something we
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have to pay attention to in the committee stage and in monitoring the impact of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a number of comparisons made in the recent Senate committee hearings between this government's work for the dole program and the workfare program in the United States. The worrying thing is that evidence in the United States is now showing that many low skilled paid jobs have been lost as a result of their version of this. A recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS> reported:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Job displacement is entering the debate over welfare reform. Across the country thousands of people on welfare are going to work, but often not at new jobs created for them as President Clinton envisioned when he signed the welfare&hyphen;to&hyphen;work legislation last fall. Frequently they do work once done by regular employees.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I know the government does not want that to happen, but it is very hard to say how it is going to prevent that that from happening. That is why I think the government must closely monitor the effect these programs will have on the availability of paid jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The importance of training has been largely overlooked in this proposal. Although the minister, Dr Kemp, has stated that training will be part of work for the dole programs where appropriate&mdash;good, I am glad about that&mdash;the department has, nonetheless, made it very clear that work for the dole programs are not intended to be training programs. The lack of any formal link between work for the dole programs, training and real jobs at the end is of great concern to the Democrats and, as I said, to organisations which are experienced in working with unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole programs are not a substitute for job creation. I do not believe that compelling people to turn up to work will automatically instil some kind of magical work ethic&mdash;a Liberal version of it. Of course, 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds now denied the dole ironically cannot be compelled to work for it. As the Minister for Social Security, (Senator Newman) is in the chamber at the moment, and because I have not had an opportunity over the last couple of days to do so, I want to take the opportunity now, in the last few minutes I have, to deal with her zealous embrace of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4789"> editorial which grossly misrepresented my view on the new youth allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I want to point out to her and to this chamber that, when passing her in the press gallery, I asked her personally and in good faith, `Minister, could you tell me where my facts were incorrect, because we did get some of them from your office late at night? I would be very interested to know, in good faith, where the inaccuracies were.' The good faith was returned, of course, with a further misrepresentation the next day in question time. I did not receive the personal written advice that I asked for&mdash;the minister, as usual, took the opportunity to distort and misrepresent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In regard to my own words, I accept responsibility for one inaccurate use of the word `student'. I did say `student child' when I used the example of an unemployed child, and I wrongly attributed the dole rate to a student child. I accept that. It is hardly a hanging offence, and it hardly detracts from the argument I was mounting about the financial stresses placed on families. I did not say that teenagers have an automatic right to taxpayer funded drinks and entertainment. I did say that many families, perhaps those where one or both parents are unemployed, are already struggling to make ends meet&mdash;and that is undeniable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This rearrangement of benefits, this denial of unemployment benefits to 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds, will make it more difficult for those families, and other families with below average incomes but which are still knocked out by the new means test, to find what they used to get&mdash;$145 a fortnight. Parents of these 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds will be under financial stress to find the money for the few normal daily needs of teenagers, trivialised by the minister in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph</EMPHASIS> as lollies: a few snacks now and then, transport costs now and then and the occasional movie. Yes, I did say that the removal of any financial assistance to unemployed 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds will cause even more family friction because of the sheer frustration when teenagers, knowing of their own parents' financial struggle, still have to ask, day after day, for every basic item that they need.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I reaffirm that those of us who can afford to do so do take financial responsibility for our children. But, equally, I am quite happy for&mdash;and I want&mdash;my taxes to be available to 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who are without the security of stable families and without either adequate educational opportunities or the capacity to participate in them. I still believe that it is selfish and callous of us to abandon these young Australians and their families. I sometimes wonder if the ministers in this government who have large share portfolios and their own shopping centres have much personal experience of the impact of unemployment on families. If they did, I really do not believe they could be so callous and mean, and I really do not think they could choose the trade&hyphen;offs that they have of rewarding some and making victims of the others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That takes me back to the beginning of this bill. We should not blame the victims of the government's policy failure to create jobs. We should not say to them, `You're the scapegoats. You bear the responsibility.' Yes, we should provide them with voluntary opportunities that the best structured programs like this could offer. But this is a limited, narrow propagandist opportunity. I think the Tony Blair comparison shows this government what they could have done instead of what they have done.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens oppose the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997, and oppose the concept of compulsory work for the dole schemes in a society in which 810,000 people do not have jobs, not because they do not measure up, have not tried to find jobs, do not want jobs or are not desperate to find fulfilment through work like the rest of us, but because those jobs are not there. The primary responsibility for parliaments, in particular for governments and in especial measure for relevant ministers, is to fix that situation so that jobs are available for everybody in our society. But that has not been done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4790">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Coming out of that there is a fairly widespread feeling in our society that those people who are in jobs should not have to pay taxes to support those who do not have jobs. It is a miserly, selfish, short&hyphen;sighted and vindictive way of thinking, lacking in the compassion that would come from a simple experience of the desperation and depression that so often comes out of failing to be able to get a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality for hundreds and thousands of Australians is that they cannot get jobs, because the jobs are not there. Sailing into the middle of this comes Senator Newman's and Prime Minister Howard's viewpoint that the best way to tackle this problem is to punish the innocent&mdash;in particular, through this formula, which the government itself pejoratively calls `work for the dole scheme'. Let's pick on those amongst the innocent who are least able to get themselves back into the work force. Let's pick on those who are least able, through no fault of their own, to get a job in a nation which has a social complex which denies them that opportunity. Let's feed into the philosophy of those people who feel they ought not pay taxes at all&mdash;or if they do, it ought not to be going to other people in less fortunate circumstances&mdash;because it is a vote getter, sadly enough, by creating a punishment program for the people who are in the most invidious circumstances as far as work and income, stability and outlook in our society are concerned. Here we have it in this bill, with this noxious little title `work for the dole' on the top of it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens would not mind near as much if it were a voluntary program, even if it did not have a training component&mdash;and this does not. We would cavil with it, because we believe that when government puts expenditure into creating artificial work programs like this there ought to be a positive outcome, that people through that process ought to get skills which will better enable them to find a job further down the line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But not this government; it scrapped all that. It wanted to wipe $1.8 billion out of the budget last year by getting rid of training programs, because it had other priorities to meet, not least keeping up the $800 million a year which it hands across to the job shedding
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> mining corporations so that they can the better pay for their chief executive officers with the rampant pay rises they have had over the last decade or two&mdash;six of whom in BHP alone will take home $1 million this year in our increasingly divided society, helped by this government handing BHP alone this year, on a platter as a tax rebate, the sum of $112 million. It is perverse; it is harsh; it is heartless; it is discriminatory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On the one hand, we will punish those people who cannot get a job because we have not provided it for them; on the other hand, we will hand the million&hyphen;dollar executives in this country $100 million on a platter so that their shareholders&mdash;and in particular they themselves&mdash;can have a better profit line at the end of the day and can work out a better pay package. In that way, they do not have to scrimmage on $1 million but they can bump it up to $2 million&mdash;or, as one of those executives has got, $3 million in the coming year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Just this morning, the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> runs a story from the Australian Bureau of Statistics which shows how this country is being increasingly divided, as the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. One of the things that immediately hits the eye is that teenagers who are working now are paid less than those who were in employ in the early 1980s. What is going on here?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Not least, corporate ethics. We have heard overnight how McDonald's did not come out smelling of roses from the McLibel case in Britain because, amongst other things, it has been found to have been depressing the wages of young people. It is not the only multi&hyphen;billion dollar corporation which has executives on obscene take&hyphen;home packages and at the same time is pressing down the income of those at the other end of the spectrum. And here we have a government that is aiding and abetting that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report in the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> goes on to point out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In 1994, the top 20% of Australian households received 40% of the total disposable income averaging $1205 a week.</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">That is the poor. So we have this formula of 20 per cent of Australians having a household disposable income of $1,200, and 20 per cent of Australians living next door or in the western suburbs getting an average of $175. How can we countenance that? How come we are not addressing that in here today? How come we are not putting a lid on those million&hyphen;dollar pay packages? What about that as a means of getting some social equity into our nation, which lives by the ethic of a fair go?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of that, we have got this nasty piece of legislation, which says, `Let's punish the young who can't get a job, who are down there in those $175 a week households. Let's make scapegoats of them. Having cut out their access to training schemes under the previous government's One Nation program, we'll make them work for the dole and we'll call it work for the dole and we won't skill them while we are doing it. Worse still, we'll set up other legislation that&mdash;through privatising the Commonwealth Employment Service, the CES&mdash;is going to enable those for&hyphen;profit private agencies, which will place people in jobs in the future, to get rid of the long&hyphen;term unemployed and skip them across into this work for the dole scheme.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Greens will be amending that other legislation to prevent that happening&mdash;to prevent these private job finding agencies making a profit, as they will do because that is the way it works, out of placing people in jobs and from skipping the hard people on their books across to a work for the dole program temporarily&mdash;get them off the books and, if they do not like that, they end up with nothing. There will be a fall&hyphen;out rate from this scheme, and the government knows that. Some people are not going to be able to hack it. Where are those people going to go because they will have no social support? They have turned down a job that they did not want and which had a pejorative term and label put across it by the minister anyway. They are going to be on the streets, and they are going
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> to be knocking on the doors of welfare agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I said to somebody here yesterday, it is as if a few government ministers have been to the United States, have seen in the streets the panhandlers who have got no support and have thought, `Australia's falling behind. We'll have to get some stimulus into the panhandle scene in this country.' That is a trite thing to say, but it has very serious ramifications because that is what is going to happen. As the poor get poorer and the rich get richer under this sort of scheme and as the government feeds the primitive and punitive streak that there is in some people towards those who are least able to get a job in this country, the division in society is going to come back and visit us all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Further down the line we are going to have more people begging in the streets, and we are going to have more aggressive panhandlers, because people have got to survive. We are going to have more locks on people's doors and we are going to have more advertisements on television about alarm systems for your house. That is the fall&hyphen;out. You do not bring in this sort of program, as part of an overall vindictive attitude towards the poor and the jobless in your nation, without the rich and the so&hyphen;called `secure' having a penalty clause written into their contract as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To people who do not believe that, I say, `Go to the United States, where 35 million people are living below the poverty line, walk down Market Street in San Francisco to the wrong end and see how secure you feel there if you are done up in furs, pearls and shiny boots.' It is a no&hyphen;go area for the wealthy in the central city. That is the prescription this government is bringing to this country little by little. It is eroding the fair go that we have had in the past and leading us towards the divisive rich versus poor prescription which mars a feeling of wellbeing, which deprives people of security, and which defrauds America of its own token label as `the land of the free'. It is nothing like it. If we are to retain our label of `the land of the fair go', we have got to turn away from this sort of direction being taken by this government.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4792">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It will not hurt to elaborate on what Senator Kernot was saying about the American system. In New York, there has been a massive dislocation of the work force in many city jobs by forced work schemes. People who were previously working in park maintenance, street cleaning and receptionist areas for the city are now replaced by people on much lower wages with much poorer conditions on forced work&mdash;read `work for the dole'&mdash;schemes. It is estimated that for every three jobs created on work for the dole, two jobs are lost which have proper wages, proper conditions and long&hyphen;term security. So the price of instituting and peddling this failed prescription here in Australia is going to be some diminution in the long&hyphen;term jobs available with proper wages and adequate conditions in this country. In other words, it is going to worsen the situation as far as full&hyphen;time employment is concerned. What a silly prescription. What an ostrich attitude. What a failure to learn from what has gone wrong elsewhere in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We should be working on the basis of a mutual obligation in this country where we recognise that there are not the jobs to go round, that those of us who have jobs have a special obligation to improve that situation and to ensure that, of all the things we do, we do not punish those who are not as lucky as ourselves. But that is what this legislation is: it is punishment legislation; it is division legislation; it is rich versus poor legislation; it is put the problems on the sidewalk for people a few years down the line to pick up legislation. It is nasty, vindictive and greedy, and it should have no place in this `fair go' country of ours.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As far as Tasmania is concerned, if you take a pro rata  guess it might create 300 jobs in a state that has got horrendous youth unemployment. It is going to create a lot more problems than that. If we take the figures for New York that I used a while ago, it will very likely displace, if it is kept up in the long run, dozens of full&hyphen;time jobs in its wake.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The problem is that is it going to give those people who are given the short straw, who draw the marble, in this punitive lottery the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> label `forced to work because they wouldn't otherwise want to work'. That is the idea behind this and it is going to pick them out in their own communities. Why couldn't this program have been voluntary? You cannot tell me that with 810,00 unemployed Australians there would not have been a queue to take up 10,000 voluntary placements. Of course there would. People tell you time and time again that they will do anything to get out of the boredom, frustration and emptiness of not having a job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I will tell you why it is not voluntary. It is because the real philosophy behind this is not help; it is punishment. It is a nasty streak of vindictiveness that comes from the rich and is aimed at the poor. Sadly, it is as old as human society itself. Wouldn't you think we could be doing better in 1997? Wouldn't you think that the combined intellect of this government would be matched with a combined compassion which would dismiss an idea like this at the outset? Instead, it has gone through the House of Representatives and here it is in the Senate, aimed at the least able, the least fortunate and the least hopeful of young people in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It might give some people on high incomes a good feeling. It might give some of those people who believe taxes per se are bad some passing smile that retribution is being wrought somewhere on some of those people they do not like to see hanging around because they do not have a job.

In Tasmania, the situation is one of sinking ever deeper into what has become an unemployment abyss. As of May this year, Tasmania has 10.8 per cent unemployment with a loss of around 7,200 jobs in the past 14 months. The number of Tasmanian women unemployed has increased from 9.4 per cent in March 1996 to 10.5 per cent in March 1997. Of Tasmanian youth aged between 15 and 19 years of age, 24.9 per cent are looking for employment&mdash;up almost six per cent on the figure for last year. There was, according to the ABS statistics, a decrease of 3.2 per cent in Tasmania's employment over the year to April 1997.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The saddest aspect of these damning figures is that they do not represent the real picture. These statistics do not take into account those who have simply given up looking for work.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">. . . signify on the part of this government its abrogation of the responsibility to provide for the subsistence needs of the unemployed people by reducing income support entitlements to gratuitous `handouts' to be earned.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The Labor government provided suitable, relevant training and active labour market programs. This policy was evident in our practical programs such as jobskills, LEAP and new work opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we had under Working Nation was a working, mutually beneficial partnership that had, implicit within its structure, a governmental responsibility to the individual and to the Australian people. It was the recognition on behalf of the government that there was an inherent individual worth and, therefore, there was a need for portable, industrially approved skills. Working Nation, which actively attacked the unemployment situation, was dismantled by the coalition government out of sheer ideological spite. Now we have this pathetic substitute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There were a number of concerns expressed by community groups to the committee charged with examining this bill, and I will refer to some of the concerns mentioned in the minority report. The concerns included: the danger of existing workers being dis
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> placed; the failure of the scheme to provide structured training and skills development which may lead to real jobs; the potential for this scheme to divert resources away from recognised training; the failure to adequately address issues such as duty of care, health and safety standards and the need for accredited training; and the discriminatory nature of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">By the government's own admission, there will be discrimination against those young unemployed in regional and rural areas. They will be compelled to work for the dole. How many young unemployed people in Toorak or Double Bay will be conscripted into this coalition work for the dole program? I suspect that the figures would show a large disparity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill will actively discriminate against the unemployed. Unlike other Australian workers, work for the dole recipients will not be covered by standard working conditions such as occupational health and safety, rehabilitation and compensation and workplace relations. Who covers the working unemployed people who have been conscripted to work with dangerous machinery such as chainsaws, backhoes and heavy vehicles? This government has once again abrogated its responsibility in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is of real concern, not only for us on this side of the chamber but for the community groups themselves. This issue was canvassed by the Youth Action Policy Association of New South Wales who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">There is a serious lack of detail in relation to the conditions under which young people will be working, the occupational health and safety conditions they will be subjected to, the accessibility of compensation if they are injured . . . </EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What this abrogation of work conditions amounts to is an invitation to be sued. What employer is going to leave himself or herself open to court cases?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where does this leave the unemployed who are compelled to take the job&mdash;a job that puts at risk their health and safety? It is perfectly clear how little respect this government has for the unemployed. Will there be personal safety equipment provided for work for the dole recipients, like those provided to green  corps workers? Who will pay for the safety
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4795"> equipment? Will the employer be reimbursed for safety expenditure or will it be up to the unemployed to provide their own?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Considering the high percentage of accidents that occur&mdash;in construction, a 22 per cent chance of an accident; in agriculture, forestry and fishing, a 24 per cent chance of an accident; in health and community services, an 18 per cent chance of an accident&mdash;you would think it would be prudent of the government to insure these people. You would think that that would be only sensible. The only recognition that the government gives to those expenses is to say that they will give an extra $10 per week for work related costs. This may cover bus fares for one week, but that would really be about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To fit out someone for manual labour to ensure a reasonable level of safety would cost around $271. For example, to buy a pair of steel&hyphen;capped boots will cost $79, an illuminated vest costs $26 and a pair of gloves costs around $14. How on earth are people going to find the money to pay for these items? Where will they get it from? These are essential items that are required to maintain a basic level of safety in the workplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">For an unscrupulous employer it will be nirvana, for the employer can opt for free unlimited labour with the added bonus of not providing basic work conditions and entitlements, and this is perfectly legitimate because this government has approved it. This is in direct contrast to the Green Corps reality, which is, essentially, a quasi&hyphen;environmental peace corps for the employed, for the lucky and for those who can afford it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government his admitted that up and running Green Corps projects have 12 per cent of participants that have been long-term unemployed, seven per cent that have been unemployed for less than 12 months but more than six months, 30 per cent that have been unemployed for less than six months and a staggering 51 per cent who have never been unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To further contrast the two coalition government policies, upon completion of a Green Corps project, the participants will receive $500 to assist with further educational training. To make it very clear, Green Corps
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> members receive a training allowance, safety gear, accredited training and money upon completion. Work for the dole participants receive no training, no safety gear, no Commonwealth protection and no real jobs at the end of the project. Where is the equality and social justice in the work for dole bill?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">You have to wonder how existing workers in jobs that have been earmarked for this policy are feeling. What stops the employer from totally staffing his or her business with unemployed people? I hope that that will not be the case. I hope that the government is going to put mechanisms in to ensure that that is not the case. I would be interested in a response to that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">At the moment they are free and there is an endless supply. It does not look like it is going to dry up in the near future, given that the recent unemployment statistics for young people are increasing exponentially. There is no need to secure their future, safety or retirement. There will be no union involvement of course&mdash;we could not possibly have that with this government, could we?&mdash;and the employer can threaten them because of the compulsion element within this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole is the ultimate in casualisation. It provides employers with free, casual and non-unionised labour&mdash;a casual worker who is free from superannuation, holidays, sick leave, workers compensation, overtime, award rates of pay and payroll tax, something you would think this government would be interested in. The worker even has to pay for his or her own safety equipment. If that is not right, I would appreciate a response to that. What next? Deductions for capital equipment used?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Professor Robert Mullaly, a New Brunswick critic of this type of policy, said that `workfare programs are "cash cows" for "business people"'. This type of unemployment scheme is open to corruption, and for corrupt businesses there will be the avenue to eliminate troublemakers by replacing them with welfare recipients. Again, if that is wrong, I would appreciate amplification on and clarification of that.</PARA>

<PARA STYLE="Para">These are existing overseas experiences from which we really should learn.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">While we are on the subject of overseas experience, this is what Maurice McTigue, who served as the New Zealand employment minister during that country's experiment, said: `Quite frankly, with the workfare thing, we didn't succeed.' He went on to say, `To keep finding useful work that is not demeaning isn't easy.' This is New Zealand, which is not that far away. Why don't we learn from this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The overseas evidence clearly shows that these schemes have been used to replace existing workers in paid employment. This is happening most in the United States where one state&mdash;and I think Senator Faulkner has already referred to this&mdash;Minnesota, actually had to introduce legislation to stop the practice of replacing paid workers with welfare recipients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I say to this government: in the interests of all  Australians, especially our youth, put real job creation back on the agenda, not mickey mouse stuff, not kicking unemployed people, not trying to pretend you are doing something when you are not&mdash;the statistics simply do not bear that out&mdash;and implement a sensible training program so that we can have a decent skills base when we go into the next century. We are in desperate danger of becoming a deskilled nation. That is the reality. Most business pundits will admit that. Even conservative ones admit that. That is the reality. This is a very depressing situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This bill provides no future, no training, a one&hyphen;way street of obligation and no protection. I say to the government: remember your fundamental duty to protect and provide financial help. You have a mandate to provide real jobs, not promote civil conscription. You
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have a responsibility to provide national portable training. You have a responsibility and obligation to all Australians to do this. In fact, it is your moral and social duty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ultimately, work for the dole will be seen by the Australian people for what it is&mdash;a shame and a wasted opportunity to really do something positive for unemployed people. It will divide Australian society and discriminate against those with the least rights under the Howard government&mdash;the jobless. This bill is not going to lead us any closer to a working nation and it will not provide a future for our next generation facing the new millennium.</PARA></SPEECH>

Let us blame the victims. Let us blame the people who are suffering most from those changes. This is what is happening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In recent times, in states like Western Australia, we have seen situations where substance abusers and petrol sniffers have been threatened with gaol. Just this morning I heard on the radio the Western Australian minister for education and the Deputy Premier saying that they are going to punish those who do not fit into the school system and fine the parents of truant children $100.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The community youth allowance once again punishes the square pegs that do not fit into the round holes. The government is saying, `If you don't fit into the school system we'll punish you.' It is a revisitation of Malthusian theory from the last century by saying, basically, `If you give the poor enough money, heavens, it is not kind, they'll only have children.' That is the kind of mentality we are seeing. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4797">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor should shoulder some responsibility for this kind of response. Because of the con of Working Nation, that it was a new, big spending program, it has been possible for the coalition to remove spending without Labor's being able to fight back in any effective way. The coalition has been able to pull out a couple of billion dollars because Labor was not able to say, `With only $5 billion allocated to it, it never was a big spending program in the first place,' because they established the myth that it was. The media picked up the two&hyphen;way myth, ran with it and we are therefore left with the situation where there is not enough training or support for young people. The government is looking for tactics to try to hide the statistics&mdash;and this is one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been $15 million set aside for only 10,000 places in the scheme around Australia. The work for the dole scheme, as has been mentioned, has no training component. Initially, the scheme was open to all ages, but only 18&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds unemployed for at least six months would be targeted for compulsory participation. However, on 19 March this age limit was dropped as the legislation was introduced into the Senate. Participants will work for two six&hyphen;hour days if aged 18 to 20 and 2&half; six&hyphen;hour days if aged 21 or over. This is based on the national training wage figures of $7.40 per hour and $9.30 per hour. They are required to work for a maximum of six months each and will be paid an extra $10 a week&mdash;whoopy&hyphen;do&mdash;in recognition of the unavoidable costs of working. Regional areas of high unemployment are to be targeted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the correspondence that I have received, I have seen two major arguments. One is a general argument that has been put by the Australian Council of Social Services and the other comes from groups voicing concerns stemming from international conventions, including a convention of the International Labour Organisation. I will deal first with the arguments put by organisations like ACOSS.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">ACOSS argues that the work for the dole scheme contains two damaging features: it is punitive and it is compulsory&mdash;with no training component and no benefits. Therefore, the scheme `blames the victim' and
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> implies that unemployment is the outcome of personal characteristics, such as work motivation and self-esteem, rather than a product of structural unemployment. When are we going to deal with that in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work for the dole scheme also fundamentally changes the basis on which social security benefits are paid to unemployed people. It changes the notion and basis of payments known as reciprocal responsibility. The current system is that governments have a responsibility to provide positive employment assistance and social security entitlements. The reciprocal obligation is that unemployed people have a responsibility to seek employment and participate in employment and training programs that are genuinely designed to improve their employment prospects. To force unemployed people to work and not provide any positive employment assistance in the work for the dole scheme fundamentally changes a set of rights and entitlements which has been in place for the last 50 years&mdash;since the Depression.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To make it clear, the scheme should be made voluntary. Positive employment assistance programs like labour market programs must be restarted. The scheme's objectives are vague and ill&hyphen;considered. If the one of the scheme's objectives is self-esteem, then the program should be voluntary. If one of the scheme's objectives is to improve employment prospects, then there must be well structured training and placements should be tailored to meet the needs of the people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government should not shift the reciprocal rights agreements already in place in unemployment assistance. Any voluntary scheme that is set up should include an adequate incidentals allowance and legislation to implement it. Currently, there are elements of the work for the dole scheme which can be implemented by regulation. That is obviously a concern.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole scheme workers could displace genuine volunteer workers and create a two tiered system consisting of volunteers by choice and volunteers by compulsion, which changes the view of volunteer work and changes the dynamics of voluntary organisations.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4798">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is another really important thing. In the last few weeks, the government has tried to shut up many voluntary organisations in Australia and told them that they were only allowed to do this work for nothing or for very little, that they were not allowed to speak up or criticise the government in any way. Here we go: over time, they might change the dynamics. Not only do they threaten people with funding cuts if they do not shut up but they will also be able to control the people in voluntary organisations and perhaps force voluntary organisations to be minders of unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work for the dole scheme needs occupational health and safety protection, industrial relations protection and advocacy. This is a huge failing in relation to this program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As I mentioned before, the other group we get arguments from are people concerned about Australia's obligations to basic human rights. The work for the dole scheme may infringe International Labour Organisation Convention No. 29 known as the Forced Labour Convention. Articles 5 and 6 of this convention prevent the use of forced compulsory labour for the benefit of private individuals and companies. The government has to guarantee that the work for the dole scheme is restricted to only community and not for profit organisations if it is not to be in contravention of this convention, which Australia ratified in 1932. We are not talking about anything radical or current; we are talking about something at the time of the Depression&mdash;1932. Are we going to be in contravention of this? Will the government guarantee that this will be the case?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The principles of this convention against forced or compulsory labour are also found in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Work for the dole may be in violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which is part of the Human Rights Convention, second covenant on human rights. It is potentially a violation of part III, article 8(2), which says that `no one shall be held in servitude' and possibly 8(3)(a) which says, `No one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour.' The exception, 8(3)(c)(iv), says the term `compul
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> sory labour' shall not include `any work or service which forms part of normal civil obligations'. This does not apply since this work is not expected of all citizens. A normal civil obligation is meant for nations where, for example, all citizens are expected to assist in irrigation maintenance. But that is for all citizens, except for particular exceptions like the disabled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If it is taken that it is a voluntary action, then there is no guarantee of the dole or legitimate work and the government is potentially in violation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, article 11(2), which says that the state has a duty to ensure that everyone is free from hunger. The condition of work may also be in violation of article 7, which says that remuneration for work must be on the basis of fair and equal remuneration relative to work of equal value, and also potentially of article 8, which guarantees the right to union activity and collective bargaining. Guess what? If it is not considered work there is not necessarily access to a union. And bargaining&mdash;bargaining for what? For poverty? None of this applies under this scheme. I wonder who the government is going to blame if this is made public overseas along with the litany of other recent shameful decisions here in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Long&hyphen;term unemployment blew out, according to figures published in April by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, by some 16,500. The government must address long&hyphen;term unemployment with sound education and training schemes rather than forcing the long&hyphen;term unemployed to work and therefore excising them from the unemployment statistics. This is cheating, to say the least. The government is abandoning its responsibilities to the long&hyphen;term unemployed, forcing them to work against the principles of international law. It is giving them work which has no beneficial training component or self&hyphen;esteem benefits because it is compulsory. The government can forget about these people if it can wipe them off the unemployment statistics, allowing them to be thoroughly unaccountable. </PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4799">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In summary, the change in reciprocal obligations blames the victim at the same time as the government has abandoned the long&hyphen;term unemployed without any genuine assistance and has literally attempted to wipe them off the books. This scheme is a whitewash and immoral, to say the least.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I also want to talk about some of the issues for those people who often do not fit into anybody's system and who somehow have trouble being recognised sometimes even as human beings within this system. Currently, personal files on each dole recipient are held by the Department of Social Security and the CES. There is already evidence of this information being used to victimise and to stereotype people. CES and DSS offices display sexism, homophobia and a lack of understanding in respect of illness, disability and so on. Through government agencies, though, there is accessible recourse to a social worker or counsellor in each office or region and a complaints board and so on. Of course, ultimately these officers are responsible to the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The offices are not well equipped enough to meet the current needs of unemployed people safeguarding their own privacy. Information being signed over to private tender companies in order to fulfil dole requirements will result in less security of information and fewer safeguards against information being mismanaged and privacy being breached and used as a tool against unemployed people. If you do not think this is going to happen, try being an unemployed person&mdash;the insect on the end of somebody's pin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The decision is arbitrary. This bill will allow enormous powers of discretion and arbitration, mostly given to the employment secretary, in deciding what is fit work for reasons of unemployment. Instead of services being delivered by the CES we can see that the tendering process for many people has favoured church and conservatively oriented groups. With good intentions, the Uniting Church, the Salvation Army, the Perth City Mission and so on deliver related services. But, with the current prejudice that has been apparent in the government service delivery process, there is even less of a safety net
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> against discrimination after the services have been tendered for. The trend towards Christian moral majority groups winning tenders for employment services suggests things will even get worse. Perhaps there will be a particular group of people who will be singled out in this direction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The role of the employment secretary will devolve decision making to local private service provider agencies which will affect the client and will be increasingly arbitrary and based on local belief systems rather than on federal or state law against discrimination and so on. The employment secretary is not required by law to fully inform clients in regard to their rights. A client of the work for the dole scheme could end up being unaware of when they will no longer be forced to work for their payment and at what point they can refuse jobs which they feel are not meeting their needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The resulting effect upon individuals will be less power to have input into what type of activity that person is interested in engaging in; for example, career choices, training opportunities, lifestyle choices, style of job investigation, issues of self&hyphen;presentation and the issues of self&hyphen;identification. The social effects of this formal disempowering process include alienation from government service provision, alienation from the community and reinforced feelings of having nothing to offer the community. The long&hyphen;term effects will be felt on the economy with the placement of unemployed people in low socioeconomic groups with no self&hyphen;determined power to change or affect that situation. That is a recipe for social disruption, for alienation and for social dysfunction.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In relation to industrial protection, workers compensation and the occupational health and safety act will not be applicable for the people who are on the work for the dole scheme. Injuries or occupational health and safety issues cannot be taken through the usual processes, through tribunals et cetera. Instead, an individual will have to apply common law practice to sue the service provider, which, under this bill, would not have to be covered by workers compensation insurance for that worker.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4800">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Are we creating a false economy through slave wages, loss of award wages and minimum income safety net? The work for the dole scheme will result in those subject to it working for slave wages. It creates a false economy of a job ready employment group prepared to work for very low wages. In actuality, people will be forced into these programs. This false economy can do nothing but reinforce the continuation of the same scheme creating no jobs and resulting in fewer jobs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This piece of legislation is allegedly seeking to implement a policy which the government announced earlier this year. It certainly did not announce this policy in the lead up to the 1996 elections.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Of course, there was no announcement at election time. There was no announcement until early this year. When did that announcement take place? It took place, as I recall it, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program, following a week of headlines about the Senator Woods and the Roxanne affair. That was the environment in which this announcement was made. It was an announcement which was out of the blue. It was not an announcement which was contained in any policy document which was before the electorate. The work for the dole policy proposal was announced to get the Senator Woods and Roxanne affair off the front pages of the nation's newspapers and off the news bulletins at least for a time. This was policy making on the run. This was policy making not based upon an appropriate assessment of the real worth of the matter but policy making based on opinion poll motiva
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> tion and on the establishment of a smokescreen for the Senator Woods matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What is this policy proposal borne, as I said, out of motives other than good policy motives? This is a policy to create a pilot program&mdash;that is what we are told&mdash;requiring young unemployed people to work for their unemployment benefit&mdash;that is, if they get it after recent announcements. It was to target 18&hyphen; to 24&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds who had been unemployed for six months with an emphasis on those who had been unemployed for more than 12 months. Other age groups could be involved, it was said, in various circumstances and localities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It was to be largely voluntary but there was to be a element of compulsion&mdash;two days work for 18&hyphen; to 20&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds; 2&half; days work for 21&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds&mdash;and a maximum of six months work was to be involved. There is to be&mdash;certainly under Commonwealth law&mdash;no health and safety rights or workers compensation rights. The participants are not to be deemed employees under any Commonwealth legislation. There are issues that arise from that, which I may deal with later, time permitting. This was to be the basis of a pilot program involving community assistance and development projects, with 10,000 participants over the life of the program, which was to be 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The aims were announced and they were: to raise young unemployed people's work ethic through fostering appropriate work habits and attitudes and improving self&hyphen;esteem; to involve the local community both in the projects that provide work for the dole for young people and in helping young people at the end of the projects; to provide communities with projects that are considered to be of value to the communities; and to ensure that participants in the community accept the principle of mutual obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The first three aims of these are, in the main, uncontroversial and supportable, but there are issues, of course, which must be addressed when you actually look at the bill which is before the parliament. This bill is basically unnecessary. This bill is not necessary for the implementation of a voluntary work for the dole scheme. Why do I say that?
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4801"> Because that is the evidence that was supplied when the Community Affairs Legislation Committee, which inquired into this bill, took evidence from representatives of the minister's department, the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government, under that evidence, could have had a voluntary work for the dole scheme running now without this bill, because essentially this bill is about the compulsion aspects of this proposal. I will quote from the government senators' report on this bill. At paragraph 3.24 on page 10, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The expectation . . . in Work for the Dole projects would be largely voluntary has been clearly stated by the Government. In the pilot projects it is expected that the requirement to participate would be minimal, if at all.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">There was evidence from Mr Powlay of the Department of Social Security confirming that the voluntary aspects of this program could be achieved under the current Social Security Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So why doesn't the government get voluntary schemes up and running to pilot this concept now? I think that is a matter that requires some contemplation. But I wanted to touch upon the issue of voluntary participation in these schemes, in voluntary work generally and the value of that and the effect on that of compulsion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">To do that, I want to refer to evidence which the committee took from the Australian Council for Volunteering, an organisation which coordinates various volunteer organisations which assist people to get into voluntary work. That evidence was given in Sydney. Firstly, I should say that the Australian Council for Volunteering, and the witnesses appearing for them, clearly rejected the involvement of persons compelled to participate in their schemes, feeling that their participation would undermine the work of these voluntary organisations. I want to refer to some of the evidence given by Ms Sha Cordingley and Ms Marie Fox to the Senate inquiry. In her opening statement, Ms Cordingley said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The compulsory work for the dole scheme, we believe, reinforces the negative perception of volunteering for young unemployed people.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" RIGHT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">. . . there were mixed views about asking unemployed people to take up volunteering.

Unanimously, people felt that it was an issue that needed to be handled with great tact and sensitivity. Nevertheless, those people who were both unemployed and also active volunteers felt that people who were out of work could benefit greatly by getting involved.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And in answer to a question from the chair of the committee, Ms Cordingley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that young unemployed people gain enormously from volunteer work. It is not just in terms of intangible things like self-esteem, but it is also skill related. Young unemployed people who undertake volunteer work develop work related skills. Through proper matching of young unemployed people to volunteer organisations of their choice, they can determine the skills they want to develop and the sorts of agencies they want to work in. But underpinning that, we believe that choice and the ability to say to people, `We chose to do this. We have shown initiative,' is probably the most critical thing for unemployed people doing volunteer work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that they can demonstrate to employers that they have taken the initiative to seek out work, to determine what sorts of skills they want to develop and have turned up, have developed those skills and have entered into a work relationship with an organisation is probably the most critical thing for young unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">What this witness was telling the committee, essentially, was that this bill will undermine the potential for great positives to come from a scheme like this (that is, if the scheme were voluntary) and that this scheme, its compulsory aspects in particular, will stigmatise the participants&mdash;that is, it will devalue the involvement of the volunteers, because employers will look at this scheme and say, `Well, we don't know whether you were a volunteer or whether you were there compulsorily.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Looking at that, they will not know whether they can take from that that the person chose,  of their own volition, to become involved, to develop skills, to show that they had some sort of work ethic. Sure, it is important to
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4802"> develop these ethics, but also are we not seeking to develop them with the purpose of making these people more job ready? If that is not a responsible and reasonable purpose of this scheme, then I do not know what is. Ms Fox, another witness from the same organisation, talking about what is possible now, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a recent submission that we made to the Department of Social Security we talked about our capacity to build a skills passport, basically, or a resume of work that they have done: the times that they have spent, the fact that they have low absenteeism, that they have a work ethic and these sort of things, but they do it by choice, not by compulsion.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And, she said, later:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ABS statistics&mdash;unfortunately, we did not bring those to table for you&mdash;on volunteering that were conducted in 1995, and the report issued in 1996, showed that the majority of volunteers in Australia at the current time are aged between 19 and 35 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, the experience now was that there was not a lack of volunteering in the age group that has been targeted in this bill. This organisation had been going to the minister's department, talking about some of the possibilities for using the volunteering scheme that are currently able to be used under the social security legislation to improve aspects of skills and, perhaps, the work ethic aspects of some of the young unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is ample evidence, according to this organisation&mdash;I do not think there was any evidence to contradict it&mdash;that young people will be volunteers, that volunteers can achieve growth in work ethic and a growth in employability for the unemployed. When we looked at the evidence that we had from this organisation, we could see that what we were faced with was a bill which essentially dealt with the negative aspects of this scheme&mdash;not the positives, not what could be achieved, but what might actually bring the aims of this proposal down. Further, in answers to questions by Senator Tierney, talking about her own experience with the long-term unemployed, Ms Cordingley said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my own centre, probably about a quarter of the people would be long-term unemployed, with the remainder being people who have quite recently found themselves unemployed&mdash;
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">talking about volunteers of course&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or are unemployed after leaving school or a university course. We could find that out for you, as a percentage, but it is not the largest percentage of people who are long-term unemployed. I think they find it more difficult to enter the volunteer work force, but that is partly because it has never really been promoted as a proper option for people either.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">And later:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To promote the opportunities to volunteer through the CES offices and to work with them to offer volunteering as an option for people who are unemployed. One of the things we have found is that even with the relaxation of the DSS guidelines, or under the terms of the Social Security Act, often those at the officer level within CES are not aware that people are entitled to volunteer, or that, providing they comply with the work test, they can volunteer regardless of any government legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our plan would be to work with the CES officers to ensure that people were alerted to the fact that volunteering is a viable option for them. That is probably the only way, apart from putting vast amounts of money into advertising that volunteer work is an option. That would be our most cost&hyphen;effective way of doing it.</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">In other words, their proposal&mdash;which this organisation is putting to the department&mdash;is to get some sort of voluntary scheme up for unemployed people. Could it be done? Yes. Was it being done? No. We have aspects of this bill which really are negatives to the aims that the scheme is alleged to have. This bill is an open&hyphen;ended proposal for legislation and, as Senator Kernot says, it actually provides for an open&hyphen;ended scheme which is not limited to young people and could be the basis of compulsory work for unemployment benefit. In that respect this is potentially a punishment bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not think we need evidence about the scope of this bill to be used for the government's announced policy other than to refer to comments that Senator Vanstone made in relation to the Reform of Employment Services Bill where the minister is saying in effect, `If you don't pass that bill, we will use provisions of the Social Security Act to implement our policy anyway.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the government believes that it is good public policy to implement an unannounced policy in terms of an election campaign&mdash;and I am talking in this case about the Reform of Employment Services Bill&mdash;by using legisla
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="1" PAGE="4803"> tion which was introduced on an entirely different basis, then what confidence can we have that this bill will not be used to implement something more than it announces now, something quite different? Senator Kernot talked about the conflict between the executive and the parliament. This bill will remove the question of work for the dole for all from this parliament while ever the bill passes and stands in law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That brings me to what I believe is one of very important aspects of the proposed amendments which the opposition and the Democrats propose, and that is that there be a sunset clause to this bill. If we are going to have an open&hyphen;ended piece of legislation to allow a pilot to occur, we should be in a position of being able to say that, as a matter of public policy, it should not be used for anything else until it comes back to this parliament. The government's argument against this proposal is contained in the majority government report on this bill and the only justification or argument against it was this passage on page 23:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEETYA used the process of evaluation argument to reach a different conclusion,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">that is against the sunset clause&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">advising the Committee that any decision to extend the scheme would depend upon the results of Stage 1 of the evaluation which would be considered in the 1998-99 Budget context. `Therefore, a "sunset clause" is not required' concluded DEETYA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When the government in the context of the 1998-99 budget considers it policy in this regard, it will set policy. That is the basis for not needing a sunset clause&mdash;we will rely on the government to make the right decision. That is essentially what that decision is telling us. Really, if that is to be the sole justification that this government has against introducing a sunset clause, then it has no justification at all. Facilitating a pilot scheme is one thing&mdash;however flawed that scheme might be&mdash;opening the legislative flood gates for the implementation of more unmandated, unannounced, knee jerk policies is another. No sunset clause means opening up those flood gates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Mr Acting Deputy President, there is only one other brief comment that I want to make
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> about this bill, although there are many I could make if time permitted me to do so. There is significant evidence which was presented to the committee in relation to the legal obligations which would apply to sponsors of these pilot projects or other projects in the future. It is clear that, even though this bill purports to extinguish certain health and safety, workers' compensation and employee rights, the evidence states that, unless there is reciprocal legislation from state governments, that extinguishment may not be complete in total.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There is also the question, therefore, of liability for the participants. There are questions which I have asked as to the insurance covers that the sponsors are obliged to receive, whether they will be any shortfalls and who will cover them. I am concerned that we may start a pilot project which has severe and unintended consequences for well&hyphen;meaning and well&hyphen;intentioned sponsors who become involved in these projects but find down the track that their obligations are more than what they expected them to be and that they will be faced with severe financial burdens. I believe that this government will be morally obliged to bail them out, but there is no guarantee in this bill that that will occur. That is another matter for policy and another matter for us to depend upon this government to attend to.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it quite surprising that this government seeks to enshrine in law the word `dole'. As far as I am aware this is unprecedented. That word, as many Australians know, carries with it many negative connotations, associations of idleness, of a lack of motivation and of being uncaring. The work for the dole legislation sends a message to the community, and in particular to young Australians, that young people are somehow lacking in motivation and lacking a work ethic and that they need to be compelled in order to work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Instead of tackling the issue of job creation and the need for additional education and training opportunities for young people, instead of acknowledging the radical and fundamental changing nature of this country's
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4804"> work force, this government yet again seeks to scapegoat young people, and in particular young unemployed Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government seeks to introduce a scheme that compels young people to work for social security benefits, implying that young Australians require compulsion or are, indeed, unwilling to work. It is a message that has been sent very strongly from day one of this government. It has been reinforced by aspects of the media and perpetuated by many decision makers in this parliament and in other bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">As for the meagre benefits that young Australians are expected to compulsorily work for, as many as 25,000 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds will lose those benefits under the common youth allowance proposals this week. Another 50,000 will face reduction in benefits and 12,000 to 13,000 will lose those benefits completely as a result of the new means testing arrangements under this week's announcement of CYA. That common youth allowance marks the latest phase in the government's targeting of young Australians. It is a pattern of targeting and hitting hardest at those least able to afford it and is part of this government's systematic attack on young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Apart from suffering through the negative images and stereotypes perpetuated by the media and some politicians, young people have had to cope with a series of legislative programs designed to strip them of what benefits they have, entrench these stereotypes and saddle young people and students in particular with increased levels of debt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Last year, this government introduced a job seeker diary. Again, behind this scheme was a sense that young unemployed people or unemployed people generally were not trying hard enough, that if they only looked harder, looked further, looked wider they might actually have a chance of getting a job. There was an implication that unemployed people were somehow ripping off the system, that fraud was rampant. But we know that fraud within the social security system is not rampant. And how, I ask, does keeping a diary enhance one's prospects of getting a job? It seemed to have no purpose or rationale
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> behind it other than punishing the unemployed and implying, `If only they were trying harder.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We seem to have forgotten in this and other debates in this place that the problem is a lack of jobs. There are not enough jobs out there for young Australians, let alone the kind of sustainable and long&hyphen;term meaningful jobs that Australians, I believe, deserve. The decision to introduce the diary, just as the recent common youth allowance changes and the work for the dole scheme, fundamentally misread the economic and social reality of young people's lives today and, of course, those of their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">When some ministers in this government were young, the levels of youth unemployment were between two and three per cent. Those levels are now between 20 and 30 per cent. The latest figures demonstrate that more than 27 per cent of 15&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds in Australia are looking for work. That figure is as high as 37 per cent in the home state of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone. These figures are shameful, as I am sure we all agree in this place, but I see very little being done to assist with job creation in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government does not seem to understand that the youth jobs market has changed in Australia. In the mid 1960s, two&hyphen;thirds of 15&hyphen; to 19&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds had full time jobs. Now it is less than a fifth of those. Generally, it was much easier for our parents to get jobs than it has been for today's younger generations. We have now had high levels of youth unemployment for over a decade and this has had a dramatic effect on how young people view themselves, their potential and their role in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the last decade, the number of teenagers outside full&hyphen;time education or not in full&hyphen;time jobs has gone from one in four to one in two. So young people have borne the brunt of the unemployment crisis. They have pursued high levels of education and training and more qualifications in the hope of gaining employment. They have stayed in school for longer periods than ever before. They are doing traineeships, apprenticeships, short courses,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4805"> long courses, filling in diaries and applying for jobs knowing that hundreds of other young people are applying for similar jobs, and many of them are facing rejection on a daily basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has the government done to fulfil its election promise, to give hope to young people? They have cut labour market programs, they have axed thousands of jobs, they have reduced access to education and training through disincentives such as additional fees and charges, they have harassed the unemployed with job seeker dairies and the employer contact unit, dubbed the `Dob in a dole bludger hotline', and now they seek to enshrine in law a work for the dole scheme which is designed to perpetuate notions that the unemployed, young unemployed in particular, require compulsion to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is about dole bludgeoning, getting them breached, making them scapegoats, compelling them to work on projects that deliver very few if any jobs at the end of it. I do not see the same attention being paid to clamping down on tax avoidance, although corporate fraud is estimated to cost the taxpayer $20 billion per annum, compared with $10 million in social security payments.</PARA>

The information obtained through freedom of information about the Paxton's case makes very interesting reading and smacks of direct political interference. But how they were vilified and how that image of young Australians being unwilling to work has been perpetuated by shock jocks, talkback radio and many in positions of power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The week of the announcement of the work for the dole plan was a sad one. Apart from the general reaction of the media, I remember the front page headline in, I believe, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, where the Prime Minister said to young people, `You owe us.' After all the platitudes and promises and rhetoric from the Prime Minister and the government in the lead&hyphen;up to the election&mdash;all the talking about giving hope to the young&mdash;what about those young people, their parents and their families saying to the government that perhaps it owes young people at least a shot at job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do not believe that anyone in this place disputes the notion that has been talked about
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4806"> today of mutual obligation. It is a concept that has been part of the social welfare system in this country for many years. Indeed, those people on unemployment benefits do engage in a variety of activities: activity tests, now the diaries, engaging in training and other schemes. These are all part of the process now, and usually with the blessing of most in the community. But this legislation seeks to entrench not the concept of mutual obligation but a sense that young unemployed Australians should be penalised even further for the position in which they find themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I know some people in this place have a commitment to the concept of intergenerational equity, a concept the Democrats have long believed in: the notion that we have an obligation to pass on to further generations this land, this environment, this world, in at least as good shape as when we inherited it, if not in better shape.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Members of this government, I acknowledge, talk about getting rid of the so&hyphen;called budget black hole, the deficit, for that very reason, so that young people are not burdened with economic deficits and hardships. But what about the environmental deficits? What about the intellectual and social deficits? What about the fact that, at the same time as people seek to remove this economic burden from young people and future generations, young people are a debt generation increasingly saddled with higher debt levels? For example, in higher education the combination of paying back Austudy loans and HECS fees can be around $30,000 worth of debts that they are paying off well into the middle of their lives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">And the government dares this week, with the common youth allowance, to claim that this is about providing incentives. I am the first to acknowledge to the minister that there are aspects of the CYA that are positive, and the Democrats have acknowledged that, whether it is the extension of rent assistance to students living away from home or whether it is the recognition of de facto relationships of two years or more for the independent status. I acknowledge those things as positive moves.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I cannot accept that throwing 16&hyphen; and 17&hyphen;year&hyphen;olds off unemployment benefits is positive. I cannot accept that removing the benefits that exist for those people not engaged in education or training or study of some form necessarily provides an incentive for other young people to engage in education and training. If you want to do that, you provide incentives in the form of a livable income and reasonable income supplements. You do not introduce disincentives in the form of fees and charges, HECS hikes, up&hyphen;front full cost fees and other loans. That is not the way to provide incentives. And you certainly need to provide additional education and training places. I see no recognition in this legislation, in a plan such as the work for the dole plan, of the need for fully accredited training and other skill development and training opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In my first speech I said that often it is said that some societies have a special respect for the aged and that I think our society has a fear of the young. Unfortunately, I have seen nothing since I have been in parliament and nothing from this government that suggests otherwise, in legislation or in media or in any programs or laws. John Casimir from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> puts it quite simply. `We are demonising our youth,' he says. Everywhere I look, there are negative messages about young people being directed at young Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The issue of public space and young people is indicative. Curfews and move&hyphen;on laws in public areas are specifically targeted at young Australians. One has to ask: what is a public space for? Aren't young people members of the public as well? Whether it is messages about young people and crime, young people and drug and alcohol abuse, young people and homelessness, young people as dole bludgers&mdash;all these are stereotypes designed to reinforce the idea that young people are something to be scared of and certainly not respected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Prime Minister and his colleagues want a relaxed and comfortable Australia, but I would suggest that there is one thing the Prime Minister is not so comfortable and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4807"> relaxed about, and that is young Australians. This government has consistently introduced policies and measures that discriminate against young people, target them, victimise them and penalise them. The pall of censorship may have been lifted, according to the Prime Minister, but the reality is that the censorship and the crackdown on young people's views and expressions and opinions have just begun.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I note that this week the government has announced that in 1998 it will hold national youth week. I believe around $400,000 has been allocated to that particular project. The Democrats would commend any additional resources designed to promote young Australians, and certainly to promote positive images about young Australians, but we hope the government does not use that as some sort of marketing or PR exercise for itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why not use the resources and the money and the energy to promote young people and demonstrate a real commitment to young Australians in the form of jobs, education and training opportunities and real opportunities to develop the self&hyphen;esteem we keep hearing so much about? Instead, young people have been denied livable incomes and income supplements. They have been denied adequate education and training opportunities, and the basic principles of freedom and respect and non&hyphen;discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Young Australians require real jobs. We should be planning now to provide real, sustainable, long&hyphen;term, satisfying, meaningful jobs for young Australians. That means not short&hyphen;term courses or compulsory work for the dole schemes; it means governments investing in the industries and the businesses of the future. It means being a little gutsy and looking beyond the next election cycle or cycles and investing in high&hyphen;tech fields and value&hyphen;added manufacturing. It means looking at how we can fix the environment so that we can create jobs at the same time&mdash;not Macjobs, not low value, low skill, undervalued and underpaid positions for young Australians.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their contribution to this important debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Work for the Dole) Bill 1997. I find it somewhat surprising how many people can see amendments to legislation in such different lights. Quite clearly, this government does not set about to punish young people with this measure. It is quite the contrary; we are trying to give young people an extra go&mdash;a fairer go&mdash;than life has dealt them so far. We are not about bastardising young people. That is probably not parliamentary; I am not quite sure what the alternative word is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are about 10,000 young people who will be helped through the legislation this year if the Senate does pass this legislation. There are many long-term unemployed young people who have become terribly isolated from their community who would benefit greatly from working on some worthwhile  community project at the same time as making contact with people who are going to help them get a job, perhaps at the end of the project. Surely that is a noble endeavour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We are talking about those young people who are having the greatest difficulty finding work, to the extent that a lot of us realise that a percentage of them have given up hope, lost confidence in themselves and have trudged the streets looking for work for so long that they have given it away. Surely we should as a nation be striving our utmost for those young people. I cannot believe that we are talking about the same program when we hear Senator Stott Despoja just now with her claims about how the government sees young people. We are parents and we are grandparents and we certainly understand that life has dealt some of these young people a pretty  rotten hand and it is up to us to do something about it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole is by no means the only measure that will do something for these
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4808"> young people. It is but a small element of it. It is a pilot program and it is amongst a number of other programs which will help young people. Some of them are short term, like this, and some of them are medium term, like the youth allowance and the marvellous new scheme that Dr Kemp has introduced for new apprenticeships and traineeships. Some of them, sadly, are more long term. By that I mean the measures which this government has already taken to try to get the nation's accounts into the black. Without that effort, which has been painful for so many people, we would never have investment confidence in this country. If we do not have investment confidence, those jobs will not flow to young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On every hand, this government is taking measures which will lead to jobs for young people who have been so sadly disadvantaged over the last few years. We have never claimed that work for the dole is there to create real jobs. Our policies to bring down interest rates, to revive small business, to reform industrial relations and to produce apprenticeships and traineeships will be creating real jobs, not mirage jobs financed by debt. If Senator Stott Despoja thinks that mirage jobs financed by debt are the way ahead, we have a different view of the long-term needs of this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Work for the dole will help the most disadvantaged group in the labour market come back out of their isolation and revive their self&hyphen;esteem so that they really are much more able to get the jobs that are available. The vast majority of young people taking part in this scheme will be volunteers. They will see that these projects are worth while and they will want to take part in them. It is fascinating that some of the keenest proponents of the scheme are young people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Compulsion has been criticised. We believe that compulsion is fair. One of the reasons we believe that is that there are some young people who have become so isolated in their long-term unemployment that they are most unlikely to come out of that isolation without more than just an offer of a voluntary work for the dole program. They will need the encouragement to join those who perhaps still
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> have more confidence. I think that it is important that they have the ability to be encouraged into the scheme through the compulsory nature of some of the pilots so they also come out of it feeling that they have put something back into the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are 70 pilot schemes planned. We have had tremendous reaction from around the country, particularly from the voluntary organisations in regional Australia because they see at first hand what a waste of young lives unemployment brings. There is a great enthusiasm and willingness to have some worthwhile projects that will not only help that community but will help unemployed young people and will also help the learning process, because they are pilot projects, as to how best we can help the long-term unemployed young people in the future. The pilot nature of the program is very important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Kernot mentioned the UK options of work for welfare. It was very interesting that she should do so. I am advised by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs that we are leaders in Australia in terms of the measures that we are putting in place for unemployment. The four measures that the United Kingdom is working on are subsidised jobs, voluntary work, environmental work and provision of skills for the unskilled. We have had subsidised jobs for quite a while under the previous government, and they are still continuing until March next year. But that money will then be cashed out to be spent on intervention in a more focused way appropriate to each individual rather than a broad brush approach. That help will go to each individual as it is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Voluntary work has already been acknowledged by this government to be a vitally important component of helping people back into the paid work force, and a number of measures which we passed in our first budget go to assisting people get into voluntary employment, as part of satisfying the activity test. The Green Corps is another project  which helps young people who are unemployed and those who are not. It is still a pilot project, but it is another element that tries to help young people get on their feet.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4809">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Finally there is developing skills for the unskilled. The youth allowance reforms are important for a variety of reasons. One of the most important has to be helping young people to acquire the skills that they currently do not have, which is why they therefore cannot get jobs. I hope that we are world leaders in Australia. If Senator Kernot says that work for welfare in the United Kingdom is the way we should be going, she should take a very close look at home because it is the way we have already gone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I have commented on people who claim that we are out to punish the unemployed. Senator Kernot said it; Senator Brown said it; Senator Stott Despoja said it. It is nonsense and I utterly reject it. Senator Brown said that we needed positive outcomes. Of course we need positive outcomes. That is what we are on about. That is what it is for. He is talking about how you come into the scheme; we talk about how you come out of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Renewed confidence, self-esteem, satisfaction from having contributed to a job that needed doing in your community and contacts with helpful people are surely the outcomes we would be wanting for these disadvantaged young people. He said that we are perverse, that we are discriminatory, that we are heartless and that it is the rich hitting the poor. The government utterly rejects that nonsense. It is monstrous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that traineeships, apprenticeships and vocational education generally are the preferable pathway to jobs. Work for the dole will provide a very valuable experience for young people that they currently do not have available to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Mackay was talking about some matters which I think she was pretty inaccurate about, and I would like to correct the record. The department will be taking out insurance to cover participants. The sponsors will be responsible for safety equipment, for clothes for public contact, for training on safety aspects where necessary and for maintaining a secure workplace. Also, private businesses will not be able to be sponsors. Therefore, Senator Mackay's talk of payroll tax is an irrelevance. I know that Senator O'Brien was on the committee and knows that
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> these things were inaccurate, but he did not say that. It is a shame that Senator Mackay came ill&hyphen;prepared to the debate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">She also talked about the need to implement a sensible training program. As I flagged briefly before, the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, is putting that program in place right now. The national portable recognition of apprenticeships and traineeships is under way. The provision of MAATS and the extra places in TAFE are all sensible training programs which already are available to young people and will make the difference. Work for the dole has a different purpose. The training necessary to do the job on the work for the dole scheme will be provided where it is required. It is for the recovery of self&hyphen;confidence. It is not a training scheme; it is not a scheme to provide work of itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I briefly mention the claim that was made by Senator Margetts about our international obligations. The government has taken the advice of the Attorney-General's Department that the work for the dole initiative should not contravene our international obligations provided the work offered is `suitable and reasonable for that person'. The advice read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that payment of unemployment allowance is not based on any prior mandatory contribution, combined with the positive benefits of work for the dole for participants, means that the initiative should be regarded as reasonable in its requirement of a contribution to the community from participants. The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has advised the Senate committee on this bill that it will confirm that the final design of the program does not breach any international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">Senator O'Brien, who I thought gave us a very thoughtful speech, recognised the value of voluntary work. I have already mentioned the reforms in the Social Security Act in that area. We do not believe that the fact that there will be some element of compulsion in some pilots will devalue the work of the volunteer. It is not in what capacity they go into the scheme; it is in what manner they are  able to come out of it&mdash;it is pride and achievement that really count.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The need to evaluate this program is also important. The committee inquiring into the
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4810"> work for the dole scheme was advised by the department of the evaluation process, which is proposed to be in two parts&mdash;half will be in time for the budget next year and the other half will be done late next year. It is intended that that will be a transparent system of evaluation; certainly, the reports will be available publicly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We believe that it is very important that we all understand what we have achieved with this program. As there will be so many pilots of such variety, and they will be depending very much on the local needs in each of the regional areas, then it is important that we study what worked, what did not work and what was average. There will be good, better and best, and there might be some poor and not good at all. That is the way we will learn about how this can be advanced in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There has been talk of a sunset clause. Nobody is going to want to continue a program if it does not work. Clearly, if this works&mdash;we believe it will&mdash;people will want to continue it. We do not believe that a sunset clause is an appropriate way to go.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The evaluation which is being proposed by the department is, as I said earlier, a two-phase process. One element will be undertaken in time for the budget in 1998-99 and the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> other part will be available at the end of 1998.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, March 1998. Therefore, to have an evaluation completed and reported upon by September 1998, is, in practical terms, too early. Too few will have come through the scheme and been out looking for work after it in that time. That is the advice I have and am giving the Senate. Therefore, the time scale in your amendment would not prove useful to people, and I do not think you would find it useful either. From that practical point of view, your amendment is a problem for us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I do believe that the evaluation which is being undertaken by the department will be transparent and public in its reporting. Therefore, the Senate will be able to use that evaluation process without the one you are proposing that the Senate employment committee goes through. Having said that, it is always open to the Senate to refer anything to one of our committees at any time. If you choose to evaluate the program in that way, there is nothing to stop you, but a proper and independent evaluation will be done for the government. Certainly, it will have to come in later than the time you are proposing in your amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We do not believe that a sunset clause is appropriate. Previous governments have not included a sunset clause when they have legislated to require people to participate in programs to assist them, which is what this is.</PARA>

<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4812">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But I believe that this will work very well. In saying that, I draw your attention to the tremendous community support there has been for it, particularly around regional Australia where the community has more of a sense of community and understands full well what this scourge of long&hyphen;term unemployment is doing to our young. People there know what facilities and opportunities there are in their community, if the community works together to help these young people. We have seen this in Tasmania, for instance, through organisations like the Beacon Foundation which have put measures in place under a no dole scheme whereby employers, service groups, schools and the community in general have all come together to help prevent young people&mdash;the ones who are the most vulnerable perhaps&mdash;from becoming unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So the community is clearly behind this, and it is something which can work extremely well. We will learn from the pilots as to the best methods of proceeding with this, but, if it is a system that is working well, what is the justification in coming back and having to start all over again in the Senate? Any further developments will be based on the evaluation of the pilots, as I have already said. Given the great community support, we wish to be in a position to extend the scheme quickly and without having to amend the legislation. Surely that seems a reasonable approach from the government. The evaluation will examine how projects operate and what types of projects are the best ones. It will also examine the regional, community and participant characteristics that contribute to the success of the projects. As I have already said, that material will be available for Senate and other parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Very briefly, these two amendments insert, as I think the committee is apprised, a sunset clause in the legislation. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) acknowledged in his second reading speech that the scheme will be evaluated to assess its impact on young people and `to assist consideration of expansion of the initiative beyond the pilot stage'. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A first report of the evaluation will provide a basis for discussion making in the 1998-99 budget.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The sunset clause that I am moving on behalf of the opposition will ensure that the provisions of the bill before us cease to have effect on 30 June 1998, well after the government announces its intention in relation to the continuation or otherwise of the scheme. The government itself, it seems to me, is still in two minds as to whether or not this measure will actually help anyone. That is the message that comes through to me loud and clear, even in the very brief committee debate that we have had this afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What the government have recognised in their budget is that they are going to provide only one year's worth of funding to this scheme. They do not even put their money where their mouth is for this pet project. It is for that reason I think these amendments in relation to the 12-month sunset clause are commendable, and I do commend them to the committee for support.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In addition I just want to point out that the second intake in this scheme will be in March next year. The six months they will be doing on the program will not be up until at least September 1998. So there will be participants in projects still running in the first two intakes of six months each. I think, therefore, whether you are talking about sunset clauses or you are talking about evaluation, you need to take that into account. Senator Faulkner just said that there was one year's funding provided for this. There is budget funding provided over two years&mdash;1997&hyphen;98 and 1998&hyphen;99.</PARA></SPEECH>

<PARA STYLE="Para">Amendment 5 imposes restraints on the employment secretary's power to approve work for the dole programs. Amendment 6 provides that, if work for the dole programs effectively turn into labour market programs by meeting the conditions inserted by the previous amendment, a work for the dole program is taken to be a labour market program for the purposes of the activity test and newstart activity agreements. So the secretary can compel a person to participate in a work for the dole program under existing subsection 601(2) and 606(1). It also provides that the decision to approve a work for the dole program is taken to be a decision to approve a labour market program. Of course, such decisions are not appealable internally or to the SSAT under subsections 1239(2), 1240(2) and 1250(1) of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Speaking to these amendments, which I will do for just a brief time, we in the Labor Party say that work for the dole flies in the face of a period of reform which was, until the mid-1980s, a passive labour market assistance program in Australia. The system was introduced in 1945. Unemployment was then regarded as something of a short-term problem. It was only in the mid-1980s that the Australian community decided that we had to reform the system of labour market assistance in Australia to turn it from a passive system into one that was based on an active approach to try to get people back to work.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That, in turn, meant the government identifying and meeting its obligation to the unemployed by offering programs tailored to the special needs of particular sections of the unemployed. It was an approach that was based on what was known as a reciprocal obligation. Yes, there was compulsion but, in return for that compulsory requirement to front up to one's responsibilities, there was an investment by government to try to get those people job ready and back to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Since coming to power, this government has progressively dismantled the comprehensive labour market programs of the former Labor administration. It seeks to put in place of those programs a totally inadequate response, in our view, to a very pressing problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Labor in government instituted a raft of labour market programs which attempted, we believe, in a very real way to come to terms with the needs of the unemployed. When Mr Howard came to power, he inherited an economy where inflation had been beaten, growth exceeded four per cent and job creation ran at an unprecedented rate. Yet in his first budget and then again in his second budget a few months ago, the Prime Minister literally threw in the towel on the issue of unemployment. His government was quick to set a target for reducing the paper load for business, but it has steadfastly refused to set a target for reductions in unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">These amendments that are before the committee seek to include a number of restraints on the secretary's power to approve a program of work for unemployment payment. The amendments essentially turn this into a decent labour market program. We will be seeking to require that the secretary cannot approve a program unless he or she is satisfied that the program does not displace existing workers and that it pays people for the hours of work at the relevant award rate; provides people with accredited training; allows people to take leave for education, training and employment opportunities with out penalty; funds the people running the program to cover costs associated with supervision, materials, workers compensation, essential clothing, equipment and so on; and
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4817"> runs for at least six months, as has been promised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If these conditions can be satisfied, it is our view that these programs can be defined as proper labour market programs with all that that currently entails. It is reasonable to make it compulsory for people to participate in a labour market program. Indeed, under Labor, people were compelled to participate in labour market programs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Like the government, we do not want to see what the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has described as short&hyphen;term merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round programs. We agree with that. There is nothing in this bill at the moment that would prevent this scheme being exactly that&mdash;a short&hyphen;term, merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round program. I ask Senator Newman how she can suggest that this bill is going to stop the short-term merry&hyphen;go&hyphen;round, when there are no restrictions in the bill as proposed by the government&mdash;none at all&mdash;on how long the program should operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">All of Australia saw the minister for schools on that Wednesday night ABC program. He was fronting up to the battlers of Mount Druitt and trying to explain the scheme. I do not think he is going to go back, even if he is invited. As soon as the minister had to talk to ordinary, Australian workers in western Sydney about work for the dole he was lost&mdash;hopelessly lost. They wanted training and opportunities and the sort of program reflected in the Labor Party amendments, not something that is defeatist and narrow. They wanted lifetime opportunities, and the minister could not deliver in a public presentation that was, frankly, not only totally humiliating for the minister himself; it was totally humiliating for the nature of the scheme that he has proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The amendments to the bill are going to improve it. They will make sure it does more than window dress and actually goes some way to dealing with the problems of unemployed people&mdash;not unlike a number of the other programs that I can say the government has embarked upon. The majority of participants in the Green Corps, for example, are in employment or education already.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The work for the dole program is on a par. It does not provide any comfort for the unemployed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think these amendments do go some way to making this a decent program and ensuring that people who are unemployed will get some benefit from the scheme, rather than simply being treated as pawns, as victims of this government's cynical attitude toward them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to outline the very positive future of Planet Earth 2000, Australia's international garden festival. This project is linked to tourism potential of the Sydney Olympics at the turn of millennium celebrations. It will be staged at picturesque Mount Penang near Gosford for six months from August 2000 to February 2001.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is a great event for Australia and for the central coast. The private sector will invest over $230 million in the coming three years. Over 20 million trees, grasses, shrubs and flowers will be planted on the site. In excess of 40 nations will build international gardens with national themes. A 10,000&hyphen;seat sporting facility will be one of facilities left for the community after the festival finishes. The project will generate 18,000 full&hyphen;time equivalent jobs on the central coast and add $1.5 billion to the New South Wales economy. It is expect to attract five and half million visitors to the Planet Earth 2000 exhibition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Given this very hopeful future and what this project can do for the central coast of the New South Wales, it is a great pity that New South Wales Labor senator, Belinda Neal, has fallen into the trap of recently making cheap political points about the future of the international garden festival. I refer to her brochure&mdash;which I have here&mdash;entitled `Garden festival alive after Howard government fails to support', which was widely distributed on the central coast. Senator Neal is in serious error when she makes the outrageous claim that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Howard Government jeopardised our International Garden Festival and the 18,000 jobs it would have generated when it backed away from pledges to lodge the necessary application for international status with the BIE.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The reality is that the festival has a very positive outlook and Senator Neal should stop talking it down. The Acting Prime Minister,
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4820"> Tim Fischer, authorised the payment of the full BIE of $180,000 on 14 April 1997. The Carr government failed to honour its back to back underwriting of the $230 million project with the private sector developer, Thiess, causing a reclassification downwards of the garden festival.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Despite the Carr government's lack of action at the crucial time of BIE lodgment, the reclassified international garden festival remains alive with final private sector and New South Wales government guarantees about to be finalised. The Howard government stands ready to provide an appropriate Commonwealth contribution consistent with our national responsibilities for such events, as indicated by a letter from the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Jim Lloyd the member for Robertson and I, along with parliamentary colleagues Chris Hartcher and Mike Gallagher, will actively support the application of the funds for the Australian pavilion; real support and not just political stunts like Senator Neal's outrageous flier. Senator Neal has made outrageous false claims about the future of Planet Earth 2000 and has placed in jeopardy the future of this festival by such action. Senator Neal has sent out false signals about its viability and this is all done, of course, to support her future political aspirations for the seat of Robertson.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The adjournment debate gives me the chance to comprehensively rebut her cheap political shots by referring to the long history of problems created by Labor since the start of this project. Let me emphasise that it has been a very long struggle to generate both state and federal government support and private sector underwriting over a period of five years. The project has required from time to time bipartisan support from all MPs, state and federal, Liberal and Labor, to try and generate the support the garden festival deserves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The record of all governments over time, including the Keating and Carr governments, has been patchy. The garden has had to fight to survive the scepticism of various ministers and bureaucrats at the state and federal level. Local ALP federal member Michael Lee in Dobell and Frank Walker in Robertson, the
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> local federal seats, refused to support the event in 1994-95 when valuable years of planning were lost. Michael Lee and Frank Walker, as members of the Keating cabinet, failed to use their authority to support a major project on the central coast. Michael Lee as tourism minister was especially negligent in not supporting this great project when he had the ministerial authority to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In the dying days of the Keating government there was a promise of $12 million of Working Nation money, but of course this never materialised. For Senator Neal's benefit the actual sum spent by the Keating Labor government on this project was a grand total of $20,000, being the 10 per cent deposit to the BIE. Meanwhile the Carr Labor government in New South Wales has had a very patchy record on this issue. Following their election win in March 1995, it took the new Treasurer, Michael Egan, just one month to entirely withdraw support from the international garden festival. In 1996 they had finally changed their mind again and joined with Prime Minister, John Howard, to fund $300,000 from each government to encourage the seed funding needed from the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The New South Wales government then committed the juvenile justice land at Mount Penang valued at $17.3 million in the Treasury papers&mdash;not the $25 million as claimed by Senator Neal in her recent election mailout. The state Liberal government of John Fahey is the only government with an impeccable record in support of the project. Premier Fahey approved $1 million in 1994 for the feasibility study and site selection. The Fahey government was committed to this project and, if it had been returned to office, there would have been a much smoother run for this festival.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">From this point on, securing the festival future is vital and there are four elements to this. The International Horticultural Organisation has approved a reclassified festival with the full support of the Nursery Industry Association of Australia. The reclassified  festival has two private sector bidders finalising underwriting and contracts of $230 million for this event. The New South Wales
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4821"> government has confirmed that the land, conditional upon the whole project being underwritten and guaranteed by the private sector at Mount Penang, will be gifted to the festival trust. Jim Lloyd and I will be working through the process of the application for funds for the Australian pavilion from the federal government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I urge Senator Neal to return to the bipartisan approach which used to exist and work with Jim Lloyd and I to help secure this vital investment for the Central Coast. If Senator Neal comes back to a sense of bipartisanship, we may actually achieve the one true statement in her brochure which was that the festival will jump start the local economy, bring 18,000 jobs and leave a world&hyphen;class recreational facility for the community. For the central coast, I urge Senator Neal to drop the politics and use her position to secure the outcome that we all support.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4821"><TITLE>Importation of Cooked Chicken Meat</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="4821" TIME="3.54 p.m." SPEAKER="Hogg, Sen John" NAMEID="7L6" ELECTORATE="QLD" PARTY="ALP" GOV="0">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7L6">Senator HOGG</NAME><STATE> (Queensland)</STATE><TIME.STAMP>(3.54 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon to speak on the issue of cooked chicken meat and its entry into Australia. Last week in the state of Queensland, particularly in the Redland shire, there was a meeting of some 300 people interested in this issue who attended to hear a keynote speaker from the Australian Institute, Dr Clive Hamilton. Dr Hamilton had given out a flier which said that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government's obsession with trade has blinded them to the implications of relaxing quarantine regulations.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It was in that environment that this meeting was first called. The Redland shire is one of the fastest growing areas of Australia and covers the federal seats of Bowman and Fadden. The meeting was part of a national campaign by the chicken industry to protest about the proposed federal government decision to allow the importation of chicken meat into Australia. There was an array of speakers and observers at the meeting, including in a very bipartisan group of speakers from all political parties. Senator John Woodley was there; the federal member for Bowman Andrea West was there; the state member for Redland John Hegarty, who is a National Party member; was there, the federal shadow
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> minister for primary industries Neil O'Keefe was there; a member of my staff was there on my behalf as an observer; the mayor of Redland shire Eddie Santaguiliana was there; and last but not least was the state opposition leader Peter Beattie. So it covered the whole spectrum of politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The meeting not only represented people from the production side of chicken meat in that area but also from the consumer side as well. All speakers soundly condemned the action of the government at that particular meeting. Whilst the member for Bowman did not address the meeting, in a subsequent speech in the House of Representatives on 16 June the member for Bowman did clearly register opposition to the pending action of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The main reason that people are speaking out so forcefully is that there are three major risks. The first is the risk to our native birds because, as the flier from the opponents of this say, the greatest threat to indigenous wildlife in Australia would come from the introduction of Newcastle disease, and that is the problem that is being faced with the cooked chicken meat. Secondly, our health and safety is at risk. A report from ANZFA has classified imported cooked chicken meat as a high risk food. Thirdly, there is a risk to jobs and whilst Australian chicken growers focus on jobs throughout Australia where they claim that approximately 40,000 people depend on the chicken industry for a living, in the Redland shire a large number of people are dependent upon this industry for their lifestyle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So there are three major focuses as to why this meeting was so well attended and was so much in condemnation of the action that this government is taking. In particular, if you look at the native wildlife, they are going to be exposed to a disease which is, as I understand it, quite virulent and will go through the wildlife and cause some havoc and devastation with our native species.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In particular at that meeting the mayor Eddie Santaguilana said that the disease  would not only harm bird wildlife but that the disease will also destroy our poultry industry, bankrupt farmers and put thousands of people
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4822"> out of work. It is very difficult to prioritise which of those risks is the greatest risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Briefly I would like to look at the risk to jobs because in the Redland shire the production of chicken meat is responsible for the 10 million to 13 million birds per year being produced from 24 farms. So it is not an insignificant industry at all and there is an overall turnover of some $20 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Each farm invariably is run by two people on average and there is a multiplier effect which is four to five times that number into other areas of industry and the community. This includes people such as catchers, transport, people in feed milling and processing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If one considers those 24 farms alone, there are a substantial number of people involved in and dependent on this industry. However, when one looks further, one finds that not only are there about 300 jobs on those farms but that the major operations have not been accounted for in those earlier figures. I particularly refer to the operation by Darwalla, where over 100 people are directly involved and there are countless people involved indirectly. So one can start to see the magnitude of the problem that is faced in the Redland shire, where this industry is such an important employer and such a generator of income and business for the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The meeting roundly condemned what the government is proposing in terms of the cooked chicken meat industry and exhorted the government not to proceed down the path of allowing cooked chicken meat into this nation. In particular, the chicken industry has put forward a five&hyphen;point plan. I will run through those points because I believe that they deserve strong consideration. They read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. That a full technical evaluation of the capabilities of commercial cooking ovens and monitoring and control equipment suitable for quarantine control be conducted;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. That suitably qualified Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service staff and industry technologists (by invitation) inspect all applicant processing facilities in the USA and Denmark as has recently been conducted in Thailand;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. That source chickens for import to Australia as cooked chicken meat come only from regions certified free of diseases of greatest quarantine/economic significance;
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. That the areas of disagreement between AQIS and the industry concerning matters of detail contained in the draft protocols be further examined; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. That the protocols be framed in a manner that requires less subjective judgment by AQIS staff.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">It is on those five points that the industry are proposing to protect not only the wildlife of Australia, our native birds, but also our health and our safety. We should also not put jobs at risk unnecessarily when jobs are the number one factor we should be looking at in this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The meeting really got to the heart of the community, was supported by the community and roundly condemned the moves by this government to allow chicken meat to be imported into Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1><DEBATE.SUB1 PAGE="4822"><TITLE>Legal Aid</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon to take this opportunity to talk on the issues that affect my electorate, specifically with regard to the developments in uranium mining. We are all very well aware in the Senate that there was a recent report by the Senate Select Committee on Uranium Mining and Milling and that that report was tabled during May 1997 and is currently up for consideration by the Senate in detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I would like to commend the report for many of the actions that it canvassed, for many of the issues that it addressed and for many of the recommendations and conclusions that have been drawn. In particular, I have been very pleased at the involvement of two of my colleagues, Senator Grant Chapman and Senator Alan Ferguson&mdash;both South Australians, I should mention, and with their own interest in Roxby Downs. I have no doubt that they had sympathy for many of the issues that were canvassed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is also important to note a very major shift by the Australian Labor Party on the issues of uranium policy that actually were reflected in this particular report. I am pleased to note and to acknowledge that Senator Mark Bishop and Senator the Hon. Margaret Reynolds have both agreed with the report, and in fact many of the recommendations that have come into play as a result of this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I think it signals to this industry and to the Australian people that the issues can with time be canvassed and addressed. I am pleased to note and acknowledge that the Australian Labor Party is at last seeing commonsense with regard to the ridiculous policy that was imposed for so many years with the three&hyphen;mines policy. Another position may well now be able to be adopted with much more openness by the Australian Labor Party.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is important to acknowledge that the committee report itself has drawn this conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The hazards of mining and milling uranium, if those activities are properly regulated and controlled, are not such as to justify a decision not to develop Australian uranium mines.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">The report also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis of available evidence, the uranium mining and milling industry will be sufficiently viable financially to be able to meet its environmental, health and safety, and security responsibilities fully.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">This is important because the issues that were being addressed in the Northern Territory&mdash;and I am aware that they are under consideration by the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill&mdash;with regard to EISs that are currently before the government over the development of Jabiluka and also the review of the activities at Ranger and Jabiru are most important.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ranger's environmental performance has been acknowledged to be very significant and a credit to them. It is acknowledged that there has been no deleterious effect on the local river system from activities at Ranger. The Ranger tailings storage system has operated satisfactorily in containing the tailings and it has caused no environmental degradation. Seepage from the tailings dam was overestimated by the Ranger uranium environmental inquiry&mdash;that is, the Fox inquiry&mdash;as were the transport of heavy metals in groundwater and the environmentally vitiating effects of seepage. No environmental effects are observable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Fox commission's concerns over the potential for damage caused by blasting have proved to be unfounded. A management regime was able to be developed to allow performance well within the expectations outlined by the RUEI. The negative effects on the environment by both sulfur dioxide and radon were overestimated by the Fox commission. These pollutants are effectively undetectable in the broader environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report also draws to our attention the fact that the Ranger mine is widely regarded as the most regulated mine in the world. This  observation is especially true of the supervision and monitoring of Ranger's impacts on the environment.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4824">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Ranger has been an important contribution to the Northern Territory economy. We need to look back at the construction cost in 1980 dollars of some $326 million. A further $62 million was spent on the construction of the township of Jabiru. ERA paid, in 1980 dollars again, $407 million to the government for the government's right to the uranium resource. Since 1980 ERA has generated more than $2.8 billion in sales revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Until June 1985&mdash;June 1985, I stress&mdash;Ranger contributed $198 million in wages, $27 million as an export levy to fund the Office of Supervising Scientist, $119 million in Commonwealth royalties earmarked specifically for distribution to Aboriginal communities, $35 million in  royalties to the Northern Territory and $562 million in tax. In 1995-96 the mine employed about 215 people. An amount of $639 million has been distributed in dividends to Australian shareholders from a net profit of $687 million. Probably most significantly, the 1993 ACIL economics and policy group assessed Ranger's contribution to the Australian economy as $5.3 billion. That was recorded in 1992 dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">So it is important that as we look at this industry we consider their occupational health and safety record. Again, the conclusions of the report were very graphic in that respect and, again, very commendable.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The social impact on the Northern Territory is important, not just because of a new township and a new development but also because of the wide variety of employment for Aborigines within the region. It is certainly acknowledged that there are and have been and will be increased employment opportunities. Aboriginal unemployment is discussed in the report, with many negative reasons given for this, which sometimes are not properly canvassed. It is interesting to note the challenges that have been picked up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The establishment of the township of Jabiru goes much broader than servicing the mine itself. It services an important environmental resource to Australia and also a very significant tourism sector concentrated on the Kakadu National Park and in increasing Aboriginal access to amenities and services in that particular area of Arnhem Land.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What has been the impact of royalties? Again, these are very significant and generally through the provisions made through the Gagudju Association to their various members in the region. These include housing, construction and maintenance, the generators for power and water, carpentry, plumbing, mechanical and electrical services, health and education, cleaning services, garbage collection, the provision of food, including livestock, medical services, including the employment of a general practitioner and a health worker, construction and running of a school, employment of teaching staff and related services and transport. Coming out of this area there has been the construction and maintenance of roads, access to out&hyphen;stations, the provision of community vehicles for Aboriginal people and the provision of helicopters for use in the wet. This is very often not recognised due this to inaccessibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I mentioned earlier the provision of employment and training opportunities for Aboriginal people in the region. Of course there is a direct income&mdash;a distribution of approximately $2,000 per member of the Gagudju Association per annum. Children upon majority are entitled to approximately $23,000 that is held in trust for them. The Gagudju Association stated in its submission to the inquiry that they remain:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . dependent upon the royalty equivalent income from Ranger Uranium Mine for the provision of the above services. Without the assurance of payment of royalty equivalent income, Gagudju may be forced to withdraw from the provision of those services.</PARA>
<PARA STYLE="Para">I am disappointed to learn that are other Aboriginal people who reside in the area&mdash;largely those associated with the Gundjemi Association&mdash;who now seem to want to torpedo the development of the Jabiluka resource that is associated with the area. That would be a pity. It would be very significant for the members of that association and for Aboriginal people in the area generally as well as for other territorians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">There are so many flow&hyphen;on and associated benefits that come from these operations. With the government's abandonment of
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4825"> Labor's hypocritical and absurd three&hyphen;mines policy, we will see the development of further uranium deposits in the Northern Territory. Energy Resources of Australia is currently seeking approval to proceed with a mine at Jabiluka in the territory. There are also several other deposits of uranium in the Northern</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="4826">
<PARA STYLE="Para">Territory and they are now workable thanks to these sorts of initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The report of the Senate Select Committee on Uranium Mining and Milling in Australia shows conclusively that uranium mining is not only economically viable but is also extremely safe with the very high standards of safety practised and enforced in Australia.</PARA></SPEECH></DEBATE.SUB1></DEBATE><ADJOURNMENT TIME="4.15 p.m." PAGE="4826"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Senate adjourned at 4.15 p.m.</EMPHASIS> </ADJOURNMENT></CHAMBER.XSCRIPT></HANSARD>
