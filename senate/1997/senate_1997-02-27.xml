<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs. I ask: Minister, are you aware of a recently released schedule of fees for full fee&hyphen;paying students in 1998? Are you also aware of reports that the entry requirement for full fee&hyphen;paying students at Melbourne University is expected to be about 10 per cent, a substantial amount less than for publicly&hyphen;funded places? Minister, will you now admit that fees of up to $110,000 for a degree make a mockery of your claims that educational equity would not be harmed by such higher education measures? Minister, in these circumstances how do you further justify your decision to set no limits on the amount universities can charge in such private fees?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1011" SPEAKER="Vanstone, Sen Amanda" NAMEID="7E4" ELECTORATE="SA" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bolkus, I am sorry, you simply still fail to understand the government's changes to higher education policy as they relate to Australian students being able to buy places. You simply fail to understand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The situation is, and will be, that before a university can sell a place in a course the government&hyphen;funded places in that course must have been filled. For example, we have more undergraduate government&hyphen;funded places than we had last year. In addition to that, next year, Senator Bolkus, when&mdash;on a course&hyphen;by&hyphen;course basis&mdash;those places have been filled by government&hyphen;funded students, other students will be able to buy a place at a university if they choose to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This is not a prison sentence; it is not a penalty; this is purely a matter of choice&mdash;something that your government was never very fond of offering people. It was not fond of giving them the opportunity to exercise their own minds and their own preferences.</PARA>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On a number of occasions in this place I have said that I believe there will be children of parents who are prepared to pay in order to get their son or daughter into the university or the course of their choice. That will mean that a previously government&hyphen;funded student who has won a government&hyphen;funded place will move out of the government&hyphen;funded place into a place for which they pay, leaving the government&hyphen;funded place free for a student who otherwise definately would not have got in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I hear from people such as you, Senator Bolkus, and from others of your ilk&mdash;and a lot of students&mdash;`Make the rich pay'. This government is prepared to let the rich pay, but you are complaining about it. You should be pleased, Senator Bolkus, that this government has provided a mechanism whereby people who can afford to pay full fees can choose to do so. They are not being made to do so. If they choose to do so, why would you be worried about it? Why would you be worried if a wealthier person moves their kid out of a government&hyphen;funded place, leaving that place free for a less wealthy kid who otherwise would not have got in? How can you possibly complain about that? It shows the twisted, demented attitude that you people&mdash;born ideologues who lost touch with the battlers&mdash;had to politics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me tell you this: the kids who miss out by one or two points on getting in at the moment will be very pleased to have some students who get in easily with a higher TER move out of government&hyphen;funded places into up&hyphen;front fee places that they pay for. That will give more kids opportunities they otherwise would not have had to get into government&hyphen;funded places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me turn briefly to the question of price. As I have said, this is not a prison sentence. If people do not think it is worth whatever it is Melbourne University wants to charge, they will not pay. And if they do not pay&mdash;that is, if people do not purchase the full up&hyphen;front fee places&mdash;then those wealthy people will stay in government&hyphen;funded places. One of my colleagues thinks his son may or may not get into commerce at Melbourne University. He is prepared to pay to ensure that he does, so 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1012"> the boy will move out of a government&hyphen;funded place into a place funded by his parents, and someone else will get a chance.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></ANSWER>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I will tell you why we are concerned, Minister. We are concerned because a lot of intelligent not&hyphen;so&hyphen;wealthy kids will be missing out. Isn't it a fact that as a result of the measures that are being implemented a student will, in effect, be able to buy 10 per cent of TER points for $110,000? How does that enhance equity, Minister?</PARA></TALK.START></QUESTION>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator, you still do not seem to understand how it works, do you? You know that the TER scores in a lot of courses are artificially inflated because there is not enough money to fund the number of students who want to do it. You know full well that you do not need something like 90&hyphen;something to do law. Heavens above, you got through, so you know very well! The University of Sydney could drop the entrance to law by two points and sell their 25 per cent like that. But you do not seem to understand the TER scores are artificially inflated because your people kept putting chains on the higher education system. You would not take the chains off and let as many people come in as were prepared to pay in addition to the government&hyphen;funded places. That is what you do not understand.</PARA></TALK.START></ANSWER></QUESTION.BLOCK>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. I assume the minister would be aware of the comments made by British Telecom's Deputy Chief Executive, Alan Rudge, on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Sunday</EMPHASIS>  at the weekend regarding the benefits of privatisation.

<PARA STYLE="Para">Will the government's privatisation of Telstra transform Australia's telecommunications giant into a company offering better service, greater efficiencies and new opportunities every day, and how does this compare with 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> attitudes of the Australian Labor Party on this important issue?</PARA></QUESTION>
<ANSWER PAGE="1012" SPEAKER="Alston, Sen Richard" NAMEID="LD4" ELECTORATE="VIC" PARTY="LP" MINISTERIAL="Communications and the Arts" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Alan Rudge, the Deputy Chief Executive of British Telecom, did have some very wise words of advice to offer. He pointed out that customers now get better service and a quicker, more responsive and efficient company which is still growing and seeing new opportunities every day. He went on to say that it was not the end of the world as we know it and that we in fact had some of these attitudes 10 or 12 years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">That could, in many respects, be a warning to the Labor Party, because this has all the shades of the backsliding that we have seen going on since you lot lost the government benches. The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley&mdash;and, remember, Mr Beazley was the Minister for Finance between 1993 and 1996 so was the de facto minister for privatisation&mdash;presided over the privatisation of Qantas, CSL and the Commonwealth Bank, facilitated with the privatisation of the FAC, even supported the opposition and did the scoping study on AIDC and Dasfleet. In other words, he privatised everything that moved when he was in government. Now he is trying to walk away from it by saying on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners </EMPHASIS>program, `Actually we weren't in favour of holus-bolus privatisation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Why was Mr Beazley at the National Press Club in August 1994 saying, `We don't pursue this because of any new right ideology. We do it because of the real benefits to consumers. We do it because it creates jobs'? He said, `I will repeat that&mdash;it creates jobs.' Here is the bloke who we all know told Frank Blount that he was in favour of the privatisation of Telstra, and he has never been game to get up in the House of Representatives and deny it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, he has never done it. So we know that he is up to his eyeballs in this stuff. He is keen on privatisation, keener than anyone else in government. The problem is that Labor Party members do not know what they stand for. That is why George Campbell was dead right when he said, `I don't think the party knows or has a clear perception of what it stands for.'</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Collins, there are obviously regular reports&mdash;if you are interested in the answer to the question that someone gave you to ask&mdash;on teacher supply and demand. The deans of education are concerned that there will be an inadequate supply of teachers. The deans are concerned about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">But the opposition rates and classifies any cuts in education courses at universities as a function of things that this government has done. I think you need to appreciate that what we have done is given universities greater freedom to decide what courses they should offer. If it turns out, as I believe it will, that we end up with universities that specialise in this area&mdash;as opposed to everybody doing a bit of everything&mdash;I will be very, very pleased.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">If the public are to believe these reports, you have given a very helpful tip to school leavers who are capable of getting into university. As I understand it, the TER courses for the undergraduate teaching areas are not that high. If there is going to be an under&hyphen;supply, what would that tell you? It would tell you that, if you were leaving school, tick that box and get into that course because you are dead certain to get a job. So, frankly, I do not understand your concern. There is the cyclical demand and supply of teachers and other professions on a number of occasions as time passes by. The deans of education believe that there will be a shortage further down the track. A university with some freedom that wants to spot that and offer courses and opportunities will undoubtedly find those places taken up by students who believe that report.</PARA></ANSWER>

The higher education review will clearly look at something your government failed to look at, and that is the appropriate nexus between technical and vocational training and universities absolutely. I think you will find that what Mr West actually said was that it is not necessarily appropriate to teach postgraduate education.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McGauran very much for that question. Is it not amazing that every time we get a question involving good news, the Labor Party goes bananas. They just cannot stand good news. They were not used to it for 13 years when they were in government. They just cannot hack it. Let me say that the Labor Party will 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1015"> have to get used to this under the Howard government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am delighted to have the opportunity to inform the Senate about exciting developments in the resources sector. The contribution of the resources sector is not well understood by some sectors in the Australian community. It is worth pointing out that total exports are worth currently $34 billion, representing 60 per cent of all commodity exports and 35 per cent of all exports from Australia. It is a major employer of labour, currently employing directly 85,000 people, predominantly in regional and rural areas, but indirectly somewhere in the order of 400,000 people, who are mainly involved in the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">In a very real sense, the industry is the future of Australia, and the future of Australia depends on its continued success. That is why it is vital that major projects such as Century Zinc, which are in the national interest and in the interest of all Australians, are not frustrated by undue delays. That is why this government is sweeping away the Labor legacy of unnecessary impediments, red tape and green tape.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">According to information brought together by my department, there have been 34 new mine expansions and value&hyphen;adding projects completed in the last 12 months valued at $5.4 billion. Major oil and gas projects include Esso's West Tuna and Bream B projects in New South Wales and Victoria, goldfields, Moomba to Sydney gas pipelines and downstream processing in nickel, iron ore and mineral sands. With the new confidence of policy predictability injected by the Howard government, these resources are expected to accelerate. Fifty&hyphen;seven new major mineral projects valued at $15 billion have been identified as currently committed. Of these, $5.4 billion are in downstream processing, which means more value adding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Good examples are the $1 billion Laminaria project, the Mount Isa gas pipeline, coal projects worth a total of $1.6 billion in Queensland and New South Wales, the massive $1.48 billion Olympic Dam expansion in South Australia and value&hyphen;adding projects, such as BHP's hot briquetted iron ore plant in 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> WA and the expansion of the Boyne Island smelter, Korea Zinc in Queensland and synthetic rutile expansion in Western Australia. In addition to these projects already committed, there are an estimated 88 mining and processing projects with a value in excess of $40 billion under active consideration. While not all these projects will come to fruition, it is the responsibility of this government and this parliament to ensure that as many as possible do. As a nation, our wellbeing depends on our being able to capitalise on the advantages and opportunities presented by the resources sector.</PARA>

Who was one of the people who assisted in a tour of the mines? A graduate of the University of Ballarat. Did he have to

It is important to realise that the former council failed not because of any problem with the concept of self-regulation but because of a division within the council between those who were prepared to modify corporate plans to meet tight budgetary circumstances and those who refused to adapt to the different circumstances. The strategy of the former government towards franchising went through a number of lurches or changes in direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The previous funding allocations had to be set against the need to take firm budgetary action to redress the massive budget deficit left to us by the other side. In this context, funding for the council was reviewed. Funding for the council was discontinued in 1997-98. However, there was no change at all to the $648,000 allocated to the council for 1996-97 because the government recognised the desirability of allowing it time to adapt to those budget changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The minister met with the council in October and discussed the need to modify the strategic plan, which they had developed under the former government, and to prioritise their activities to achieve self&hyphen;funding status from 1997-98.

I think Senator Harradine is referring to a proposal that New Zealand submitted in late December 1995 to export apples to Australia.

That is their proposal. Fire blight is a serious bacterial disease of apples and pears and a number of other rosaceous plants. This disease is present in most apple producing countries&mdash;including New Zealand&mdash;but is absent in Australia.

Minister, the last 10 months has seen a catalogue of failure of quarantine services in this country, recently capped off with the outbreak of anthrax disease in Victoria, ovine Johnes disease in Victoria and New South Wales and sorghum ergot in New South Wales. North Queensland farmers have endured further outbreaks of papaya fruit fly with flies trapped recently at Mount Isa. There have been outbreaks of anthracnose affecting lupins in Western Australia, equine morbilli virus in North Queensland and the VRE in the poultry industry. This is not good news. Yet, against this background, farmers are now hearing that your government plans to pursue a quarantine policy of acceptable risk which means relaxing quarantine barriers.

<PARA STYLE="Para">I do not wish to delay the Senate overly, but I feel the need to take note of the late and, as the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) admitted, incomplete answer that he has just given me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">It is interesting that subsequent ministers up to now have said that they have no record of Australians working in any mercenary capacity in Papua New Guinea. The explanation that has been given in the past has related to the fact that it is not an illegal activity to recruit people for mercenary activities from Australia under certain stated conditions; therefore there is no necessity to keep a register of those Australians so engaged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">First of all, the minister said there was no knowledge of the incident on 15 January. Secondly, he said no Australians were involved. It either has been investigated or it has not. If it has been investigated, that is not the same as saying there is no knowledge. To say the Australian government has no knowledge and then to say no Australian was engaged in flying the Iroquois is rather bizarre. You either have knowledge of the incident or you have not. If you have knowledge of the incident and then say that no Australian was engaged, that makes sense. It is a matter of whether it has been investigated or it has not. That was the question I asked two days ago: has the matter been investigated? That does not seem to be the case. It is always possible to go to one's advisers or department and ask, `Do you have knowledge 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> of this incident?' They could say, `No, we have no knowledge,' but that does not mean the incident did not take place. And it certainly does not indicate that the matter has been investigated by Australian or any other sources. Certainly, that question was not adequately answered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am pleased to see that the minister has indicated there will be further investigations into the funding of mercenary activities. I would like to point out that the definition of mercenaries, according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Collins English Dictionary</EMPHASIS>, is a soldier for pay. If you happen to be flying an Iroquois helicopter into a war zone, that seems to fit the definition. So whatever people called the exemption in the first place in 1989&mdash;because that meant that it was no longer illegal to recruit Australians for that kind of activity&mdash;it simply meant the Australian government at that time largely washed their hands of responsibility for keeping an eye on what was happening. They enabled the Papua New Guinea government to fund such activities and they set up a mechanism by which Australians could be involved. Therefore, it is hardly surprising that Sir Julius Chan was scratching his head early this week and saying, `This is what Australians showed us how to do.' The previous government showed them how and that is exactly why it is very difficult for Labor to speak out strongly on this issue at the moment. It is difficult because they were involved in it. I would like to see some changes in that response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have been asking questions since 1994. Sir Julius Chan said, in 1994, that he would take all steps necessary to rid the world of the leadership of the BRA. Nothing much has changed except by degree. And it is so obvious now that even governments and oppositions cannot totally ignore what is going on and what Australia's culpability in this potentially is. It is extremely embarrassing, for both the government and the opposition. There have been inadequate answers to questions about training. There have been inadequate answers to questions about mercenaries and Australian involvement in mercenary activities since 1994. It is time now for proper investigations to be done. It is time now for Austral

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In terms of the introduction of fees for places, I must say that I was a little astonished by Senator Vanstone's incapacity to see the difficulties that may arise from creating a double system&mdash;a double system where those who have merit get into places based on that merit and those who may or may not have merit but who have large pockets, or at least their parents have large pockets, are able to purchase a place despite their merit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0">
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must say that, if we looked at another community in a country overseas where people are able to leap over a system of merit and buy themselves a place, we would probably see this as some sort of corruption. But what this government sees fit to introduce, what Senator Vanstone sees fit to introduce, is a system of entrenched corruption. You do not have to be very good. You do not have to measure up on the merit stakes. All you have to do is pay a bit of money. Then you can bypass everyone else who is lining up and get taken to the front of the queue. You get told that, despite your merit and just because you have more money than somebody else&mdash;because your parents have done well, they have inherited some money or you have inherited some money&mdash;you can skip the queue and get in ahead. You can get into the course and the university that you want. Those who are not so well-off have to go further down and go somewhere else where they do not want to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I must confess that, after talking to people who are at university now or who are trying to get into university, I feel a bit of survivor guilt. I did enjoy a free education and I very much appreciated that and have benefited from it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was talking to a young girl the other day who is presently working as a secretary. She has felt inspired to do some study, and I am very proud of her. She wants to do a law degree, at least part time, but she said to me, `I can't afford it.' I think that is a pretty appalling situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A situation like that&mdash;where someone who is so committed and prepared to put in the time and effort but cannot get in, compared with someone in different circumstances who has parents who are well-off and are able to buy her a place&mdash;is corruption.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Where are the five opposition senators who asked Senator Vanstone questions today? This debate is about taking note of answers, but the opposition have left it to a member of the second XI.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Under your system, Senator Neal, both of those people would have missed out. Under our system, students can purchase a place. Mind you, they must meet the requirements of the university. As was pointed out by Senator Vanstone, quite a lot of students who are capable of doing the course miss out because the supply and demand forces up the TER. Under your system of restricted quotas, they could not get into the course. Under our system, if they meet the requirements, they get into the course.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Let me give you the good news, Senator Neal. That frees up a place for the ones you were most concerned about. They can get a place. We have freed it up. There is a public place for those people who would not have got one under your system. Why would they

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I was absolutely shocked when I came into this parliament in 1991 when, in the depths of the recession which you created, you were turning away 55,000 people from the gates of universities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">A second point was made in your rather pathetic questions today relating to the university review. What a contrast to what the opposition did in terms of changing the university system. My colleague Senator Patterson will remember this because she was in the system at the time. In fact, Senator Patterson and I were both in the system. We woke up one morning and discovered all of a sudden that, instead of having 18 universities, we actually had 37. When the Labor Party was in government, Dawkins woke up one morning and said, `I'm going to create all these new universities and put them all together.' What a pathetic way to do public policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">What we have done is set up a proper review where we are not determining the outcome of the review.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find that the answers of the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) today to the various questions that have been asked demonstrate yet again just how inept this government is when it comes to questions of higher education. What senators opposite try to disguise is one simple proposition: this is a government that has embarked upon some of the greatest cuts to higher education of any government in the history of this Commonwealth. The direct result of those cuts is a reduction of 17,000 places in the higher education sector. There are 17,000 fewer places against the forward estimates. That is 17,000 lost opportunities as a result of this government's action. There will be 17,000 fewer places available as a result of this government's attacks upon higher education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">We have $1.8 billion dragged out of the higher education sector. Some $1.2 billion is being extracted from students as a result of higher education fees and charges. HECS fees and various ancillary fees and charges are being levied by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">On top of that, a proposition is now being introduced that students will be required to pay for tuition fees. We have seen cases in Victoria where some courses will attract fees of $110,000. It is not just a question of being able to pay; you will also get a discount, on that basis, on your tertiary entrance score requirement. There will be a lower academic requirement to enter into a particular course. If you have the capacity to pay, under this government's policy you will be able to enter university with reduced academic ability. As you well know, TER scores actually represent a measure of academic ability. To discount the entrance requirements is to look, on the basis of a capacity to pay, at a transfer to wealth away from ability. That is a fundamental change that this government is trying to introduce.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Look at the broader picture that this government is aiming to achieve. It instituted a review with an old&hyphen;world view that there should be two types of higher education institutions in this country: one for academic education and one for vocational education. 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> That means the reintroduction of a bifurcate system of education in this country. You will see this government attempting to justify its cuts to higher education, undermine the higher education sector and remove the rights of citizens in this country to higher education. It wants to introduce a further class system within higher education. If you have the money and the connections, you will go to university. If you have not, you will go to the TAFE college; you will go to a vocational centre.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The government is trying to reintroduce a system which Labor did so much to get rid of in this country. Labor allowed for up to 70 per cent more students to go to university than otherwise would have been the case. There was a massive expansion in the places that were available. There was a massive expansion in the amounts of public funds put towards public education.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">This government is about privatising education and opportunities. It is about ensuring that, if you have wealth and power, you will have the ability to extract from this system advantages that other people do not have. This government is committed to removing 17,000 places from the higher education system based on the forward estimates. Who says that? The minister's very own officials do. Is there any denial that that is the case? There will be 17,000 fewer places against the forward estimates. There will be 17,000 lost opportunities as a direct result of this government's attack upon the higher education system. It is a mean and philosophically withered view of our society.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">The Labor Party allowed fees for overseas students, but we did not hear them bleating then that it was going to take places away from young Australians. Fees will be paid by young Australians now who were not able to buy a place then. They were discriminated against because there were young people coming from overseas who could buy places in universities. There were people in Australia who were prepared to do things to buy a place when they could not get a place for lots of reasons. They were being discriminated against because overseas students could buy those places. Look at the number of young people who do all sorts of things to get themselves into Bond and Notre Dame. There are young Australians who are prepared to do that, and they should not be disadvantaged because young people from overseas can buy places at Australian universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Neal went on as if those people were going to take places away from young people or mature age students who could not afford places. Full fee places will not be at the expense of current course positions.

What we are saying is that people should have the same chance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President, for giving me a little limelight. First of all, it is necessary to counter some of the comments that Senator Patterson has made. It is all very well to talk about research scholarships, but I wonder if the honourable senator realises that the purported maintenance of undergraduate load is coming at the expense of postgraduate positions. Postgraduate positions in this country are going to be reduced as a consequence of the budget measures. As for taking away an inequity&mdash;what a farce that is. This government have entrenched inequity. They have made the university system in this country even harder to access than it was during the period of Labor rule.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">I am the first to point the finger at both sides in this debate and to acknowledge that they are equally culpable. I will tell you where the Australian Democrats were, not only when fees were introduced for overseas students but also when the higher education administration charge, the higher education contribution scheme, the increase above CPI to HECS payments in this country and the deregulation of the postgraduate sector were introduced&mdash;and the list goes on. We Democrats were in this chamber and not only did we speak against and oppose those moves but we voted against them. I acknowledge Senator Margetts's comment that the Greens have also voted against fees while they have been in this place. The ALP opposition are culpable. They began a process of user pays education, and the government has now entrenched that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Carr is right. Some of the most radical reforms to higher education ever to have been undertaken have been undertaken in the last few months since this government got into power. When in opposition, the coalition acknowledged that, whilst the legacy of the Labor government was certainly an increase in the number of undergraduate 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> places, it was at the expense of funding for infrastructure and staffing and followed the introduction of fees and charges. In opposition, the coalition lamented the underfunding of the sector. They said they would do something about it and promised they would not cut operating grants. What have they done?

This is a furphy and what we have heard from the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) not only in this chamber today but in estimates last night and during the debate on the higher education so&hyphen;called `reforms' is farcical, positively Orwellian doublespeak: the minister says it is choice.

It is absolute doublespeak and I cannot wait to hear someone explain how that can be defended as a choice for people with no money or coming from a traditionally disadvantaged background, be they women, Aboriginal or Islander people, people from lower socioeconomic different backgrounds. This government has entrenched a system where it is not your brains but your bank balance that counts. Your ability to study is determined by your ability to pay. Senator Bolkus was quite right in this chamber today when he talked about the trading off of TER points for about $10,000 per point. That is what is happening. If the minister needs reminding of the decline in enrolment applications, it is all in front of her, available from her department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16">Senator Patterson referred to opportunities for young people&mdash;what about mature age aspirants? That is where the sharpest decline

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the Senate the fact that members of the Royal Australian Navy who served in Malaya between 1955 and 1960 are the only Australians to be deliberately excluded from eligibility for repatriation benefits in the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (the Act) for honourable `active service'. Australian Archives records show that the only reason for the exclusion was to save money. Members of the Australian Army and Air Force serving in Malaya were not excluded, and the costs associated with the land forces was one of the main reasons for the exclusion of the Navy. An injustice was done which later events have compounded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two forms of benefits for ex&hyphen;servicemen, Disability Pensions for war caused disabilities (denied the sailors referred to but introduced in 1972 for `Defence Service' within Australia) and Service Pensions. Allied veterans of 55 nations involved in conflicts with Australian forces until the end of the Vietnam War can have qualifying eligibility for Service Pensions under the Act. Service by 5 countries in Vietnam was recognised after RAN service in Malaya was excluded. The Department of Veterans' Affairs confirms that 686 ex&hyphen;members of the South Vietnamese Armed Forces are in receipt of Australian Service Pensions; 571 on married rate and 115 on single rate. In effect, 1,257 Service Pensions, denied to ex&hyphen;members of the RAN, are being paid for serving alongside Australians in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is claimed that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Naval personnel were engaged on operational duties that applied to all other Australian service personnel serving overseas on `active service'. They bombarded enemy positions in Malaya and secretly intercepted enemy communications;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) Naval personnel were subject to similar dangers as all other Australian service personnel 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1037"> serving in Malaya and there were RAN casualties, none of which appear on the Roll of Honour at the Australian War Memorial;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the Royal Australian Navy was `allotted' for operational service from 1st July 1955 and this is documented in Navy Office Minute No. 011448 of 11 November 1955, signed by the Secretary to the Department of the Navy. The RAN was then apparently `unallotted' secretly to enable the excluding legislation to be introduced;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the Department of Veterans' Affairs has said it can find no written reason(s) for the RAN exclusion in the Act. In two independent Federal Court cases (Davis WA G130 of 1989 and Doessel Qld G62 of 1990) the courts found the two ex&hyphen;members of the RAN had been `allotted'. Davis had served in Malaya in 1956 and 57. As a result of these cases ex&hyphen;members of the RAN who served in Malaya and who had, at that time, claims before the Department of Veterans' Affairs for benefits, had their claims accepted. Eight weeks after the Doessel decision the Act was amended to require allotment to have been by written instrument. In parliament, it was claimed the amendment was necessary to restore the intended purpose of the exclusion, reasons for which can not, allegedly, be found.</PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES BILL 1997</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am delighted to rise today to introduce this bill, and the accompanying bills, which give substance to a core commitment given by this government to the Australian people on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These bills reflect the government's faith in an Australian health care system which recognises both public and private providers, and in which the private health sector actively complements the public services funded largely through Medicare and grants to the states and Territories under the Medicare Agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Private Health Insurance Incentive Scheme, which this bill will implement, is the centrepiece of the government's strategy to rescue Medicare from collapsing under the weight of demand for publicly funded hospital and medical services. The Scheme does so by recognising the value of the private sector as an indispensable complement to the public sector, and acknowledges that, by making the fullest use of the sum of our hospital resources, we will be able to ensure that all Australians have reasonable access to the full range of public and private services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The private health insurance incentives are not simply a commitment to private health insurance in its own right. Rather, they reflect that private health insurance is the way most favoured by Australians to gain access to the hospitals and doctors of their choice, when and where they need them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the Scheme this bill implements is an essential part of restoring the necessary balance between the use of the public and private health systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This package of bills will give effect to the government's incentives to assist people to purchase private health insurance. They come not a moment too soon. It is a matter of record that when our predecessors took office in March 1983, private health insurance covered 65.1 per cent of Australians. In June 1996, this coverage had fallen to just 33.6 per cent, with the burden of this exodus falling squarely on our public hospitals. Most particularly, the effect of the drop-out has been felt very heavily on public hospital waiting lists for elective procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our predecessors chose to neglect the contribution of private health insurance makes to health financing, and deliberately allowed private health fund membership to wither on the vine. It was seen as 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1039"> a boast by those politically responsible for our health care system that they personally disdained making any private provision for their health care. This government's election has ended this sad and wilful policy neglect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, Medicare is a successful and popular part of this country's health system, the support of which is a key government commitment. Medicare, however, was never designed to stand alone. It was devised by John Deeble and Richard Scotton in the context of being complemented by a robust private health care system, primarily funded through a private health insurance system partially assisted by government through measures such as the private hospital bed day subsidy and Commonwealth contributions to the private health fund reinsurance pool. These supports were knocked away by our predecessors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, the ongoing and increasingly precipitous decline in health fund membership threatens the financial stability of the entire health care system. The Private Health Insurance Incentive Scheme, and the addition to the Medicare levy (to be known as the surcharge) for people on higher incomes who have chosen not to insure themselves privately, are essential measures designed to arrest the catastrophic decline in the level of participation in private health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The available evidence suggests that the biggest concern Australians have about private health insurance is the cost of premiums. The government's Private Health Insurance Incentives Scheme therefore provides assistance to people who purchase private health insurance by giving them incentive payments to assist in lowering the cost of their insurance either directly through lowered premiums or indirectly through a taxation offset.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The incentives provided will make private health insurance a more financially attractive option to ordinary Australians, especially in providing much needed assistance to the one-third of Australians already providing for their own health care. For if we can, as a start, stop the exodus from private funds, health care providers&mdash;both public and private&mdash;can better plan for the future health care needs of our nation, and a time of likely increasing demand for health services, with a confidence based on real stability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Details of the incentives</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, I will now outline the main elements of the incentives scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has honoured its commitment to provide private health insurance membership incentives for singles, couples, and families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 July 1997, single people earning not more than $35,000 a year may receive up to $125 each year towards the cost of their private health insur 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> ance premiums, and couples earning not more than $70,000 may receive up to $250.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Families with one child earning not more than $70,000 may receive up to $450 per year. The income threshold will rise by $3,000 for each additional child, in line with the government's Family Tax Initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The incentives will be paid as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> eligible people with single memberships will qualify for a $100 incentive payment per year for their hospital insurance, which covers them for costs incurred during hospital</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> episodes and a further $25 if they have ancillary cover which covers services such as dental, optical and physiotherapy;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> eligible people with couple memberships will qualify for an annual $200 incentive payment for their hospital insurance and a further $50 if they have ancillary cover;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> eligible families&mdash;including single parent families&mdash;will qualify for an annual $350 incentive payment for their hospital membership and a further $100 if they have ancillary cover.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Eligible people will be able to choose the way in which they receive their incentive amount. They may either have the incentive paid directly to their health fund in return for a guaranteed reduction in premiums or may receive the payment as a taxation offset after the end of the financial year. This choice recognises that many Australians who have private health insurance are pensioners and self-funded retirees who no longer pay personal tax. Aged pensioners with appropriate health cover will clearly be eligible for the incentives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Health funds wishing to participate in the scheme will register with the Health Insurance Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People wishing to receive the incentive as a premium reduction will obtain a booklet from their participating health fund. This will provide them with information about how to apply to receive the incentive payments. If they believe they are eligible, they will complete a statutory declaration stating their belief that they are eligible to receive the incentive amount appropriate to their level of cover.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The health fund will then reduce the member's premiums by the appropriate amount depending on their membership status. The premium reduction will be pro-rated according to the period for which the member pays. If, for example, they pay for a full year's cover, their premium will be reduced by the full annual amount. If they pay for a month's cover the premium will be reduced by one twelfth of the annual amount.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fund will then notify the Health Insurance Commission to complete the registration of the 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1040"> single, couple or family membership as participating the incentive scheme</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Health funds will receive through the Commission, on a monthly basis, the incentive amounts applicable to their members. To enable this, health funds each month will send the Commission information on participants in the incentives scheme. The Commission will then forward to the funds an amount equal to one twelfth of the annual incentive payments for the registered memberships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The alternative to choosing reduced premiums is electing to receive the amount as a year end taxation offset.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People electing this course will fill in a section in their tax return. The Taxpack will provide information and instructions on how to complete the tax return. The Australian Taxation Office will then deduct the tax offset from the income tax of the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure that ineligible people do not claim the incentive and that people do not claim twice, appropriate measures will be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Care has also been taken by the government to ensure that information provided by health fund members will receive due privacy considerations. The bill contains a provision making it a criminal offence for unauthorised use or disclosure of the information provided by people under this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, I will be formulating principles, modelled on the Information Privacy Principles of the Privacy Act 1988, to ensure that funds comply with privacy requirements for incentive&hyphen;related information in their charge, including its collection, use and storage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the Private Health Insurance Incentives Scheme will cost an estimated total of $8 million in 1996-97, $491 million in 1997-98, $609 million in 1998-99 and $616 million in 1999-2000. These estimates include both amounts paid to the funds in return for lower premiums being charged to eligible members and taxation offsets direct to claimants, as well as expected running costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is estimated that about 2.5 million memberships of health insurance funds, covering more than five million people, will potentially be eligible for these incentive payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These costings are based on the assumption that the private health insurance participation rate will stabilise at just under a third of the population by l July 1997, and will then increase by two percentage points over time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, this legislation will make private health insurance more affordable for the many Australians on lower and middle incomes. Those who have maintained private cover in the face of the premium rises largely driven by the previous 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> government's policy will be rewarded for their perseverance. This is particularly so for those older Australians, many on very low fixed incomes, who have scrimped and saved against great odds to keep their cover.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those who have had to make the decision to let their membership go, and those who want to purchase health insurance, but have been unable to afford it, will also benefit from the incentives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But another beneficiary will be the Australian health system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By providing this assistance, the government will restore $600 million a year of the funding that was deliberately and systematically cut out of the private health system, when it removed bed day subsidies and payments to the reinsurance pool.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was on the basis of the private sector having this infrastructure that Medicare was introduced. These incentives will provide the injection of funds, and public confidence, into a private health system which for too long has been neglected, while our public hospitals are straining at the seams to cope with demand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the Private Health Insurance Incentives Scheme, and the related measures being introduced today, highlight the government's absolute determination to turn this around, to make the most of our existing health care assets, both public and private, and to ensure that Australia and Australians can look forward confidently to assured quality health care, with the maximum of individual choice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1996 to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE INCENTIVES) BILL 1996</PARA>
<PARA> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to ensure that the private health system remains a vital component of Australia's national health care system, this government has introduced into parliament the Private Health Insurance Incentives Bill 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of this bill, there are several consequential amendments that need to be made to other acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 to allow the Commission to administer the Incentives Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also makes several amendments to the National Health Act 1953. These amendments require registered health benefits organisations to comply with the provisions of the Incentives Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments also require the funds to provide information relating to the Incentives Scheme to the Private Health Insurance Administration Council. The Council is then required to include such 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1041"> information in its annual report on the operations of the private health insurance industry.</PARA>

<PARA> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Medicare levy surcharge</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill complements the private health insurance incentives being made available to lower income earners by providing encouragement to high income earners who can afford to take out private health insurance to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for a 1 per cent Medicare levy surcharge for individual's with taxable incomes greater than $50,000 or families with combined taxable incomes greater than $100,000 who do not have private patient hospital cover for themselves and all family members. Married and de facto couples and single persons with dependants are eligible for the $100,000 combined taxable income threshold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Trustees of trust estates who are assessed under section 98 of the Assessment Act (that is a trustee who pays tax on behalf of a beneficiary who is under a legal disability) will also be liable for the surcharge if the beneficiary would have been liable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The required private patient hospital cover is cover under a private health insurance policy which provides benefits in relation to fees and charges for hospital treatment. This includes `front&hyphen;end deductibles', or excess, cover. Cover merely for treatment provided by a medical professional in a hospital (ancillary cover) does not avoid the surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments imposing the surcharge will apply from 1 July 1997, in respect of the 1997&hyphen;98 and subsequent years of income. This parallels the introduction of the private health insurance incentives scheme. The surcharge will generally by payable when income tax for a year is assessed and is payable. However, provision is to be made for PAYE taxpayers to provide for their liability for the additional amount through the tax instalment deduction system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Madam President, the Treasurer has stated in this House that this is a surcharge the Government hopes no&hyphen;one has to pay. However the Government is assuming that a number of taxpayers liable for the surcharge will choose not to take even the most basic private health insurance cover for hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We estimate therefore that the surcharge will raise additional estimated of $60 million in 1998&hyphen;99 and $75 million in 1999&hyphen;2000.

The additional threshold for each child remains unchanged at $2,100.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These increased exemption thresholds, together with the change of Medicare levy rate already implemented for the 1996&hyphen;97 year of income, result in changes to the income ranges over which the exemptions are shaded&hyphen;out. The new upper limits of the ranges for individuals, certain trustees and families are $14,346, $454 and $24,209, respectively.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Payment of a Minister's Legal Costs: Part 2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 28 August 1995, the Senate referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee matters relating to the payment by the Commonwealth of the legal costs of the then Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Carmen Lawrence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 28 September 1995, the Committee reported on terms of reference (a)&hyphen;(e) and (h) in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Payment of a Minister's Legal Costs: Part One</EMPHASIS> .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate extended the time for the presentation of the Committee's report on the remaining terms of reference on three occasions. The workload of the Committee did not allow it to complete the inquiry and it lapsed at the end of the 37th Parliament, following the March 1996 Election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the commencement of the 38th Parliament, the newly constituted References Committee requested, and the Senate agreed, that the Committee inquire into and report on the two outstanding terms of reference, namely: 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1043">  </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(f)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> what guidelines and conditions should be put in place to ensure the legality and propriety of any use of public funds to pay the legal costs of Ministers and members of parliament; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> what is the appropriate level of reporting to parliament on the use of public funds to pay the legal costs of Ministers and members of parliament including the reasons for the decision to provide such funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In order to address term of reference (f), the Committee reviewed the various policies and guidelines for the payment of Minister's legal costs that have been adopted by the States, Territories and New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also took evidence from officer of the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department on proposals for statute&hyphen;based schemes for payment of legal costs of Ministers and members of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this report, the Committee noted evidence advising that the nature of parliamentary duties may leave Members of Parliament particularly open to civil actions, such as negligent misstatement actions. The Committee also noted that parliamentarians have no special immunity from civil actions for damages arising from their position and duties as Members of Parliament. The Committee considered that Members of Parliament need to be aware of the legal rights and responsibilities that are concomitant with their duties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that the Presiding Officers ensure that newly&hyphen;elected Senators and Members of the House of Representatives receive advice during orientation programs on the legal liability of parliamentarians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the provision of Commonwealth assistance to Ministers for legal matters, the Committee is of the view that comprehensive arrangements, based on appropriate and transparent criteria and procedures, should be established</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee welcomed advice from the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department that it is developing a proposal for a statute&hyphen;based scheme to be established by regulation under the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990. These regulations will include revised guidelines to be applied when determining whether it is appropriate for the Commonwealth to pay a Minister's legal costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this report, the Committee makes several recommendations about such a statutory based scheme. For example, The Committee recommends that revised guidelines should include indicative limits on the use of public funds to pay Ministers legal costs, but that these limits contain an element of discretion to retain flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also recommends that the revised guidelines indicate the level of professional legal 
<BREAK TYPE="COLUMN" SOFT-HYPHEN="0"> services that are considered appropriate to specific court proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was concerned about extravagant or unnecessary litigation strategies and has recommended that revised guidelines should require the Attorney&hyphen;General's Department to monitor the strategies being pursued by Ministers in legal proceedings and that the revise guidelines stipulate that extravagant or unnecessary strategies adopted in the course of legal proceedings will not be funded. The Attorney&hyphen;General's Department should determine and advise beforehand whether a strategy is extravagant or unnecessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also reviewed existing arrangements about who decides whether a minister's legal costs will be paid and has recommended that, in relation to a personal claim against a Minister, the decision to pay legal costs should be made by Cabinet, based on advice from the Attorney&hyphen;General that the matter is part of the Minister's duties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee also recommended that the Commonwealth Government maintain its policy not to use public funds to assist Ministers to institute defamation actions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second part of the Committee's report relates to reporting of these payments to Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that discretionary payments to parliamentarians require a high degree of transparency, control and accountability. Where politicians are providing discretionary payments to other politicians, the public is entitled to such a standard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that the proposal to establish schemes relating to the payment of Ministers' legal costs by regulation under the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990 is consistent with constitutional and legal principles that the Parliament must pass a bill that contains an appropriation for any money expended on a Minister's legal costs and that any allowance or pecuniary benefit paid to a Member of Parliament must be paid pursuant to a law enacted by the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that, if a scheme is established to appropriate expenditure for Ministers' legal costs under the standing appropriation contained in section 11 of the Parliamentary Entitlements Act 1990, the relevant regulations should require the Attorney&hyphen;General to inform the Parliament of each decision to pay a Minister legal costs, at the earliest opportunity This information should include the initial reasons for the decision to pay the legal costs and any limitations placed on expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Committee has recommended that a consolidated statement on current cases, including progressive levels of expenditure, should be tabled in the Parliament every three months. 
<BREAK TYPE="PAGE" SOFT-HYPHEN="0" PAGE="1044">  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that these and other measures recommended in the report will ensure that the payment of a Minister legal costs will be done in a transparent and accountable manner.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) &amp; (2) There were no arrangements made between the Government and Senators Harradine and Colston to protect jobs in Tasmania and Queensland at the expense of jobs in Victoria. My letter to Senator Harradine, which was supposedly the basis for the Herald Sun articles, makes no reference whatsoever to employment levels in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">During discussions with Senators Harradine and Colston I provided a table prepared by Telstra of the breakdown over three years of the effect on Tasmania and Queensland of the announced 22 000 reduction in Telstra's workforce. The 22 000 workforce reduction, which will affect each of Queensland, Tasmania and Victoria, was announced well before Parliament had agreed to the part sale of Telstra. It reflects the need to reduce costs and make Telstra more efficient as the telecommunications market becomes more competitive. Telstra's staffing requirements will be determined by the Telstra Board and management in its corporate planning processes in accordance with operational needs.  </PARA>
